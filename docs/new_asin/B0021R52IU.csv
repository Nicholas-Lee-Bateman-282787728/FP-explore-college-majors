3841191,5,B0021R52IU,"Desiree and Andrew offer some essential stretches for anyone and everyone. You don't need to practice yoga to benefit from these simple exercises to reduce neck and shoulder tension, and avoid  serious injuries.  As a yoga teacher, I recommend this DVD to my students of all levels!",1264896000,,282,4.9787234042553195
3841192,3,B0021R52IU,"I bought this dvd because I have a terribly tight, uncomfortable neck (any time I go for a massage, the therapist says 'I hope I helped you. You have A LOT of tension in your neck'), and I was hoping that this dvd would help with my neck issues. I have been to a few yoga classes and am basically a beginner. It is great that this dvd has a tutorial, because it would otherwise be way too fast paced and advanced for me. I have started with the tutorial, and I sometimes have to pause the dvd to make sure that I am doing things right. I haven't tried the flow sequence yet because I think it will be too quick. I do think that the poses are helping my neck (it is definitely going to take time and patience), and I am pretty happy that I bought the dvd. In order to get the most of of this dvd, I think that I should probably take some more yoga classes so that I am more adept at moving fluently from pose to pose and can ask questions about certain poses (which of course you can't do to a dvd). I would defintiely not buy this dvd if you have never done yoga because I think it would be challenging and frustrating.",1258848000,26,1119,4.022421524663677
3841193,5,B0021R52IU,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online.

I took a yoga workshop with Desire Rumbaugh, the instructor of this DVD, in September 2008, and it was absolutely amazing.  However, I also tried Rumbaugh's previously two DVD releases, Yoga to the Rescue and Yoga to the Rescue for Back Pain, and unfortunately found them to be be disappointing.  Happily, this latest release succeeds where the prior two videos failed.

One important change which Rumbaugh made for this DVD is that there are two separate 30-minute practice segments:  the ""Tutorial"" offers more comprehensive instruction plus a detailed review of modifications for most of the postures, whereas the ""Flow Sequence"" is a faster-moving, more dynamic session based on the postures introduced during the tutorial.  For both segments, Rumbaugh has an assistant, Andrew Riven, who displays the modified versions of the poses.  Rumbaugh instructs the Tutorial segment via voiceover, although a few of the segments are preceded by brief live introductions.  The chapters of the Tutorial are listed below:

*Wall Shoulder Stretch & Chair Pose
*Neck Strengthening
*Push-Ups
*Sphinx & Cobra
*Bow Pose
*Down Dog
*Locust Pose
*Side-to-Side Leg Lifts
*Crunches
*Lunge with Twist
*Side Plank
*Shoulder Stand
*Bridge, Plow & Shoulder Stand
*Relaxation

As the title suggests, the Flow Sequence moves along at a significantly quicker pace.  Rumbaugh again teaches via voiceover, but there are no chapter breakdowns and no pauses between segments.  The entire practice continues in this vigorous manner before concluding with the short (approximately 4 minutes) relaxation.

Although I am very pleased with this DVD, I would offer a few cautions.  The DVD case states ""For Beginners & Beyond,"" which I think is misleading.  I would recommend these practices for experienced yoga students only--i.e., advanced beginners and above.  The case description also suggests that the practices will help to ""alleviate pain and stiffness,"" and I do think the DVD would be valuable for this purpose--that is, in terms of normal, everyday aches and pains.  I would be much more hesitant to recommend this DVD to someone with any type of injury or other special condition which might require a more GENTLE therapeutic approach.",1257465600,58,2305,5.320441988950276
3841194,5,B0021R52IU,"I have tight shoulders and lack the natural curve of the cervical spine or back of the neck.  As a regular practioner of yoga, I am always looking for ways to loosen up those areas.  I used this video once and immediately felt more flexible.  I love the detail of the instruction in the tutorial. Although, the flow moves a little faster than I like, after a few more times, I should be accustomed to the sequence and be able to flow with it. So this video is broken into a tutorial and a 30 minute flow sequence using the poses explained in the tutorial.  I love this video and will be using it daily!",1251763200,5,602,4.208695652173913
3841195,5,B0021R52IU,"I was pleasantly surprised with this dvd. i was afraid it would be all stretching poses and not enough ""workout"" strengthening poses.  boy was I wrong!  I felt refreshed and energized afterwards, but also like I had been throug a grueling workout.

I personally think just about anyone can do this DVD, they show you modified versions of each pose, but gives you the chance to move more if you can.  I am actually back now to see what other DVD's Desiree has!",1251676800,4,459,4.493975903614458
3841196,5,B0021R52IU,"Desiree is awesome, let's face it. Acacia has done an excellent job at showcasing her. I love how they have the tutorial section to get details on the poses in the flow section (and a few extras), as well as an index of poses so that practitioners can focus on poses that feel good. The music is great and inobtrusive, and I like the option to be able to turn it off and just have instruction. The demonstrations are great, showing Andrew with a little less mobility and Desiree showing more advanced options.
This video will work for beginners and even more advanced practitioners. For beginners I would say, watch the video at least once without doing anything. Go slow at first. Skip anything that feels too hard and come out early if you need to. Let your body adjust by focusing on the poses that are easier and then you can start trying poses that were harder over time.
It's hard to know if you're doing the poses properly, and if you're feeling pain, please consult with a professional teacher. Don't give up. You can find a local teacher in your area who teaches the same therapeutic alignment as Desiree at [...]
As Desiree says, ""Yoga shouldn't hurt!""
Personally, I will use this video often - it's a great home practice I can do before work (30 min). I will definitely get her other videos too, so I can mix it up. Thanks Desiree!",1251676800,6,1342,4.481632653061224

She tried this yoga dvd, as well as another for relaxation, and after her first go she said she could feel every muscle in her body (in a good way!).

It is fast-paced and seems challenging at first to keep up, but once you learn the poses you will get it. I had a cramp in my neck for months, following a long flight last May.

3841209,5,B0021R52IU,I have lost the curve in my neck due to a car accident which results in tight neck/shoulder muscles. This video has helped a lot. I feel relaxed and my posture has improved. Works better than muscle relaxers. I would recommend not doing the shoulder stand at first because you can easily lose your balance and hurt your neck.,1395705600,,325,4.52542372881356

3841211,4,B0021R52IU,"I do enjoy this yoga dvd. I find it to be very relaxing and calming. I had originally bought it a couple months ago because I slept wrong and injured a disc in my neck. It's very helpful as it has some nice poses that really stretch and strengthen the neck and shoulders such as the chair, cobra, and triangle poses. The only thing I don't care for is that you are required to have a chair with you to put your feet on at certain times. If you happen to be injured or don't have a chair available, it's kind of inconvenient. Other than that, it's a really great program! If it wasn't for the chair, I'd give it 5 stars!",1389052800,,619,4.081967213114754

3841213,3,B0021R52IU,"On the plus, she is vibrant & peaceful. There is also a man who is doing the exercises alongside her. She provides decently thorough instruction and also provides modifications of poses.
On the negative, she moves quickly in and out of poses, which are not held long. She instructs very quickly. There's not a flow between poses,as a sequence, rather the video cuts from pose to pose. Somehow, her word choice doesn't quite nail it for me, an advanced beginner; afterwards, I found myself more stressed in other places in my body, than when I had begun the practice. I don't think its sufficiently safe for someone who had a bit of back pain or weakness going into it. Rather, I'd use this once truly intermediate or advanced for back strengthening and maintenance. Maybe I'll purchase it someday in the future....but I need some gentle, safe strengthening first.
If you'd like a safe practice by knowledgeable instructor, with a male counterpart doing modifications, also in an indoor setting with chill music, check out 'Yoga Therapy for Back Pain' with Emily Klingermann. Its great for a beginner working on a back issue.",1381104000,,1124,4.890052356020942

I have tried a lot of things to reduce neck/shoulder tension and the resulting tension headaches that I frequently get (physical therapy, chiropractor, massage, etc).  This video has specific exercises for the neck & shoulders and I feel like she ""gets"" my problems.  Her personality is a bit odd and sometimes she moves too fast for me to keep up, but I just skip some of the harder poses and will work up to them.",1377734400,2,511,4.302083333333333

When I do it fairly consistently, it actually prevents the shoulder pain (and accompanying headaches)!  I rented it first, but then bought it right after...so worth the money!!!",1339804800,13,340,4.9298245614035086
3841228,1,B0021R52IU,"I have never written a review before, but after trying this video I felt obligated to warn others how misleading the title of this video is.

This video is way too intense for anyone that has neck or shoulder pain.  I have a lot of pain in the neck and shoulders and this video just makes it worse.  Anyone with severe muscle tension needs yoga with a lot of stretching for those tight areas- this video is NOT it!  The video starts off with pushups and several weight bearing poses placing a lot of stress on the neck and shoulders (such as plank and downward dog).  This is a very fast paced video - it is more of a power yoga flow, definitely not something that will ""rescue your neck and shoulders""!!!!!  She alternates in and out of weight bearing poses very, very quickly and there is almost no stretching in this video! She doesn't explain the poses at all and moves way too fast.  This video is for advanced power yogies and definitely not for beginners or for anyone that has any type of pain.  I am not a beginner, but I do have a lot of neck/shoulder pain and this video is completely inappropriate.

There are other reasons too why this video is annoying (but these are of much less importance):  the music is annoying (it sounds like some kind of voodoo music), the background scenery is nauseating and she is very fake.

If you are looking for a good video to help with neck and shoulder tension, try ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" with Barbara Benagh, it is excellent!  This video allows you to choose from various sequences depending on what type of pain you have, and you can choose if you want an active flow or a more passive flow.",1328313600,12,1644,4.3894389438943895

3841230,5,B0021R52IU,"Practicing from this video has created huge change in my shoulders!  After doing either of the 30 minute video options(there are 2 options, one tutorial and one flow sequence), my shoulders feel more relaxed and my posture looks better.  I feel great immediately after doing this video, and furthermore, doing it one or twice a week has strengthened my posture, creating longer lasting relief in my upper back area all the time.
  This video uses a combination of strengthening the area between the shoulder blades and stretching the fronts of the shoulders.  The exercises are unique, creative, and target the shoulders from an interesting perspective (back of the heart, front of the heart, shoulders in relationship to hips and relationship to abs.)  I definitely recommend this if you have stiff, tense upper shoulders!  After years of just dealing with mild pain, I have found wonderful relief and strength with this video.
  I agree with the other reviews that this DVD is most helpful if you are already familiar with yoga, especially Anusara yoga.
  I think its important to note what type of ""rescue"" this DVD offers.  For me,  my neck and shoulders are generally stiff from a forward rounded posture, from reading, sitting at a desk, driving, and working at a computer.  This DVD offers a lot of upper back arches, chest stretches, and heart opening postures to counteract the forward rounding positions.  For this reason, this DVD does offer relief and general strengthening to open up my posture and reduce forward rounding.  I do not have any neck or shoulder injuries, and I probably wouldn't recommend this DVD to help with injuries.",1316390400,11,1648,4.981684981684982

I have had upper back stiffness, posture trouble, and serious neck and shoulder stiffness and restriction of movement for years now. I've gone to doctors, massage therapists, and chiropractors repeatedly with very little relief beyond a day. I wish it had crossed my mind sooner to try yoga postures that targeted my problem areas.

I found just a couple of Desiree's poses a tad too advanced and difficult for me, so I'm just going slowly with those. The majority of these moves are straightforward and invigorating and I have no trouble doing them. She explains what to do very well in a clear and gentle voice. Although some of the ""open your heart"" and ""let the light shine from your head"" stuff is just a little too new-agey for me, you get the gist of what to do, and it is filmed clearly from different angles. Her companion does the same moves but often at a lower level for those of us who are less flexible. The studio is very nice, and the music is very pretty and relaxing.

I'm really very pleased, as I've done her exercises only for a few days now and I feel better already. Sure, there is some residual soreness, but it is the good kind of sore that you get after a good workout when you challenge your body and work towards improvement. I predict that if I keep up with these poses, I'll feel better and better.",1313625600,3,1395,4.4453125

I don't find language such as ""ground your body in the Earth"" and ""pull your shoulder blades into your heart"" very helpful in making sure I am doing the poses correctly. Perhaps this DVD is meant for those with a background in yoga (in which case I probably would've chosen a slightly different title, as the current one has a good chance of drawing in anyone who is searching Amazon for solutions to neck/shoulder pain). Second--and this was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for me--the instructor and her pretty male companion both went into deep squats...and anyone who has been instructed in doing squats knows what the following means: the male's knees were hovering over the floor in *front* of his toes.

As a Yoga Therapist and Licensed Massage Therapist, with over 25 years of specialized training in injury rehabilitation and prevention, I purchased this DVD to check it out as a possible referral source for my clients. Wow was I shocked! First of all, Desiree talks alot about how Yoga can heal this and fix that (no matter what condition). That is a lot for someone to claim without backup. And with what medical degree? Second, in the tutorial she begins with radically extended poses of the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine along with massive overstretching of the anterior shoulder capsule. My clients, who are seeking pain relief with my help, would be shocked if I gave them any of these poses! Far too challenging and risky for anyone with a neck or shoulder injury or chronic pain. Especially beginners! The alignment she and the gentleman show in the tutorial is horrible and not proper bio-mechanically. My body hurt just watching!

Yes, his videos are a tad on the simple and repetitive side. And that is what someone in pain needs! Something simple, repeated with loads of variation, to effectively help problem areas. If you have pain, stay away from the ""Yoga to the Rescue"" series. Yoga is great, when appropriately applied for an individual, but it's not on these DVDs.

Lots of downward dog, which is my least favorite yoga pose anyway.  Doing this cd was, unfortunately, painful for me.
