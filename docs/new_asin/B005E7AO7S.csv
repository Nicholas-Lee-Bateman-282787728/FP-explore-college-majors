4663482,5,B005E7AO7S,"Once upon a time horror films were scary. As kids we would venture off to the Manhattan to check out the local grind house theaters to catch flicks that may not have always been well made from a cinematic perspective but typically they did deliver what they promised; a good old fashion horror story. Then, as politically correctness became the rallying cry of the population the horror flick took a decidedly different course. The horrid creatures of the night that would rip slash and devour the hapless victims morphed into really bad choices in relationships.
Instead of being terrified by werewolves and vampires teenage girls are now caught in a decision between necrophilia and bestiality. The modern horror film is so intent on the emotional impulses of angst ridden teenagers that that many have become unintentional comedies. J.T. Seaton, is a filmmaker working in the horror genre that appears to have rebelled against this regrettable `emo' trend and decided to throw caution to the wind and set out to blend horror with a liberal dollop of dark humor. His film under consideration here, `George: Zombie Intervention', has helped to restore balance to a once proud genre by crafting a film that highlights how ridiculous politically correct monster are.

Seaton has made something that works not only as a deliciously black comedy but in a way more importantly a brutally on point commentary on the degradation of a formerly great type of movie. Many people may try to group this film into the made for cheap, sophomoric laughs of flicks like the `Scary Movie' franchise. Students of cinematic history will realize the predecessors of this film provide a much more substantial relating back to the founding fathers of the horror comedy that blended the famous troupe of Universal Studio's monsters with the antics of their premier comedians, Abbott and Costello. The use of elements established way back then are further augmented by the use of the sharp satiric eye similar in context to one of the earliest to take on the formulaic nature of horror, the 1982 cult classic, `Student Bodies'. This is not to say that Me, Seaton is content to rest on the shoulders of these movies. `Zombie Intervention' is an exceptionally well constructed poking fun of the state of horror in today's world but the dilution of valid twelve step programs through trivialized application by our society.

Seaton wastes no time in establishing the tone of this movie. It starts with a faux public service announcement that might as well been made but a public service film school dropout. Like ant PSA we are exposure to on a daily basis this one endeavors to inform the public with a forced style of a commercial. The subject of the PSA is growing social issue of zombies. It comes across more like a public health matter or a problem that `polite society' refrains from discussing in mixed company. Having a zombie among your friends of family is likened to that uncle that is frequently drunk at family gatherings, embarrassing but manageable. Those close to George (Carlos Larkin) find themselves in such a social dilemma. George is an amiable enough sort of bloke except for the unsavory perchance for consuming human brains. It is not as if George can help it, he is a zombie. George's friends are naturally concerned and come to the decision that the only course of action possible is to mount an intervention. This is a post apocalyptic world were the zombie menace has been addressed and rather than being eliminated the undead have been more or less assimilated into our culture, at least in a provisional capacity. Society puts up with them looking at the condition as a type of illness practically covered by the Disabilities Act of 1992. George's friends want to help their undead buddy so they obtain the services of Barbara (Lynn Lowry), a professional interventionist. If you have ever seen the television series on A&E called `Intervention' then you may be familiar with this new age driven profession. Society in general has become so concerned with the `correct, Pro forma way of addressing `issues' that even something as fundamental as confronting a loved one about his destructive behavior requires a designated expert with acceptable credentials. With this profession on board to direct the proceedings in the correct direction Best friend Ben (Peter Strickles), imperious sister Francine (Shannon Hodson), pre zombification girlfriend Sarah (Michelle Tomlinson) gather together to confront their loafer turned creature friend George. The first sign that this is going to be an awkward gathering is established when Sarah brings along her new boyfriend Steve (Eric Dean). George was a slacker in life and the thing is not much has changed with the onset of his non living status. Well, instead of snacking on bags of chips George's predilections have migrated to munching on the occasional neighbor.

J.T. Seaton may be relatively new to both screenwriting and direction but it is exceedingly clear that is understanding of the subject matter is based on a long held position as a fan. The script written in conjunction with another new comer, Brad Hodson, is one of the sharpest, most intelligently constructed screenplays I have encountered in many years. The tongue in cheek humor is delightfully dark and moody creating a pervading mood that perfectly lays the foundation for the story. The characters are very well drawn and one of the most amusing aspects of the movie is the zombie is far from the lease likable character in the movie. His friends are more concerned with appearances than the actual plight that George faces. While interventions and twelve step programs are valid and have helped many people our society seems to have made this method of help into a panacea for any socially popular issue. Try watching Marc Fratto's `Zombies Anonymous' as a companion double feature to this film for a really great evening.

It is exceptionally rare for a comedy to work as completely as this one does. The fact that Seaton is a new filmmaker makes this accomplishment quite remarkable but it also is evidence of a fresh approach that can only be achieved by someone not hindered by forced expectations. This is a low budget piece but that translates to an immediacy that carries the film. The movie is dialogue driven, rare for a horror flick even one with a comedic slant. This only reinforces the talent displayed by this auteur. I look forward to seeing where his future projects take him. one thing is certain, if this is how he starts out great things are around the corner.",1320624000,18,6604,4.957581227436823

His best friend Ben (Peter Stickles) and sister Francine (Shannon Hodson) plan an intervention to help George, help he doesn't want. The professional interventionist (Lynn Lowry) provided comedy with every line and move.

This is an over-the-top dark comedy with colorful characters. It includes cameos by Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman who gave himself a 27 minute interview extra. The DVD included an alternate ending which didn't different much from the one in the film.

Not for everyone.

8467897,2,B005E7AO7S,"I'll watch practically any zombie movie, but ""George: A Zombie Intervention"" was hard to sit through. The film looks reasonably professional, but the script and acting are on the level of community theater. The first two-thirds of the movie are slow paced and generally unfunny. If you can patiently endure that, then the final third adds some zombie action, but it's still dragged down by slow pacing and dull wit. The only explanation for the high ratings on this site and others is that the filmmakers and their friends and families contributed them. If you're looking for a low-budget zom-com that pokes fun at pop psychology, the 2006 film ""Zombies Anonymous"" is better than this, in my opinion, and it's no masterpiece. The Blu-ray is a BD-R that played fine on my player.",1462060800,2,778,4.857142857142857
