8220932,5,B000W0H5AG,"There are no other sources like those from Dr. Yang.
I teach Qigong and Taiji and I have many of Dr. Yangs books which I recommend highly. The books are often a little difficult to read but in these DVDs everything is clear, organized and sequential. Start with DVD 1 & 2 when you want more just keep going! Dr. Yang has so much knowledge it is quite amazing.

When I started reading his books about 12 years ago I found him a little hard to get into. After watching 7 or 8 DVDs I find him kind of charming, in other words, he grows on you. After watching so much of his stuff, I feel like I actually know him as one of my teachers, even though I have never met him. All of his DVDs are like attending a personal workshop/seminar, and you can watch them over and over!

The truth is, he knows this stuff inside and out, from scientific to spiritual.  Another truism is this... No one else will give you as much information, period.",1358640000,7,931,4.189944134078212
8220933,5,B000W0H5AG,"This DVD, particularly when coupled with the book ""Qigong Meditation, Small Circulation"", is a very valuable adjunct to the serious student's developing practice and understanding of qigong.

Dr. Yang, as always, is precise, explicit, and extremely skilled at communicating his knowledge. Wahwei! There it is!",1238284800,,309,5.866666666666666
8220934,5,B000W0H5AG,"The DVD has the following chapter headings:

THEORY REVIEW

Dr. Yang begins this DVD by encouraging the practitioner to first understand the theory before attempting to practice small circulation qigong.  In the past some students and masters studied, practiced and taught qigong without understanding the theory behind it.  They had the techniques and the methods, but not the understanding of the theory behind the practice.

A student that approaches the actual practice of small circulation  qigong will experience better results in less time if they follow Dr. Yang's advice in learning and understanding the theory, which he compares to a road map to lead one to greater understanding and ability.  As in the majority of his productions, a fair and necessary amount of time is spent in covering the theory and basics of small circulation  Qigong.

Dr. Yang discusses the differences between internal and external elixirs, and the effects and goals of each.  Where in the past the key to mastering the internal elixir was a secret, now the secret, Embryonic Breathing, is explained in great depth by Dr. Yang.

Dr. Yang leads the discussion through the use and functions of the Meridians (rivers) and the Vessels (reservoirs).  Dr. Yang explains how small circulation works with two of the eight vessels, the conception and governing vessels.  As noted on the DVD, there is less risk in practicing the external elixir exercises, which mainly work with the meridians, than practicing the internal elixir exercises, which work with and regulate the vessels.

Consequently, this DVD provides some essential information on correct usage of accessing these vessels through the practice of small circulation qigong, which helps to insure a safe journey.

Dr. Yang then provides an explanation of the ""third eye"" that covers the need for one to be truthful in the journey, otherwise the third eye remains closed.  Western concepts such as semiconductors and piezoelectric materials are used in the explanation to bring a very esoteric subject closer to western readers.  The explanation of how slow moving exercises like Taijiquan provide more effective electrical buildup in the bones than an exercise like jogging.

Although much of this lecture has been covered on previous DVDs in this series, I encourage viewers to watch the whole DVD.  These seminars on DVD are like practicing the form, one time through will not give one skill and understanding compared to practicing, or in the case of this DVD, watching the material repeatedly.  This first chapter is almost an hour and a half in length.  Well worth the time to watch it.

TANG DYNASTY CHART

Dr. Yang displays on his lecture wall a chart created 1300 years ago in the Yang Dynasty.  The chart, which I have seen in other publications, is a wonderful symbolic representation of the workings of small circulation.  Dr. Yang provides an explanation of all the drawings on the chart.  He even cautions that some of the information on the chart is incorrect.  It was common for masters to put in false information in their teachings, writings, etc...  Consequently only those with a strong foundation and years of practice would recognize the incorrect information and be able to discern the truth from the false.
My only question is, where can I get one of the charts that he displays.

I did an internet search and have not located the meditation chart as of yet.  If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this chart, please email me at patrick@taijiquanstore.com

OK, I'm totally blind.  I just found a copy of the Tang Dynasty Meditation Chart inside the DVD case.  Excellent!  I also just located a full sized reproduction of the chart for sale.  Go to [...] if you are interested.

ABDOMINAL BREATHING

Dr. Yang, in his usual manner, clears up some common misinterpretations of basic and advanced Qigong concepts.  From the location of the Huiyin to whether one converts original essence or present day fat to Qi is clearly and convincingly clarified by Dr. Yang.  You know, when someone knows what the heck they are talking about, and can actually practice what they teach, oh my, then the real flow of information begins.

As I've mentioned in other reviews, I often find myself wondering whether I actually read the related book to whatever DVD I'm watching by Dr. Yang.  In the section on Abdominal Breathing Dr. Yang discusses the effect on the adrenal gland, which sits on top of the kidneys, while one is practicing the abdominal breathing exercise.  He states that the adrenal gland is pushed down approximately one inch during the lowering of the perineum and the pushing out of the stomach as one is inhaling.  This stimulates the gland and keeps it active and healthy.  I don't recall ever reading this information.

Yet when I think of former events, I had the lucky experience of having lunch with Dr. Yang one Saturday in San Francisco.  He mentioned how in the past he had thought that he knew Qigong.  He then stated that he has reached a level of understanding where he really didn't know Qigong in the past, but now has a more solid understanding of the concepts.

When you read Dr. Yang's earlier books, then peruse them in order, you can see how he has truly grown in his understanding and ability to practice what he preaches.  I have tried in my life to follow a similar approach, if you are not learning, growing and healing, then you are becoming stagnant, which leads to disease and death.

I've had teachers in the past, for only a short time, who proclaimed that they were at the best level and that they would always teach their style at the level of their present understanding.  I didn't stay with these teachers for long once hearing such a dead end type of philosophy.  One must constantly question, research and practice concepts in one's own field of study.  Dr. Yang has always approached learning in a very proactive and inquisitive manner.  I have loved watching the progression of his learning and teaching, especially in light of the benefits I have received from learning indirectly from him through Dr. Yang's and David Silver's productions.

Dr. Yang explains how fat, although not thought of in the friendliest of terms, is actually a very pure form of energy that has already had the impurities filtered out and can be easily converted to Qi.  Dr. Yang points out that fasting, held in high regard by many religions and philosophies, helps the mind to be clear as the body is converting pure fat to Qi rather than obtaining it from alcohol, red meat, or some other less than ideal substance.

Dr. Yang teaches the differences between Normal Abdominal Breathing and Reverse Abdominal Breathing.  He then discusses how he originally tried Normal Abdominal Breathing, which he describes as being a very slow process.  Once he switched to Reverse Abdominal Breathing, he stated that he then began to experience the effects much more rapidly than the previous method, as one uses the mind in a more active manner when using Reverse Abdominal Breathing techniques.

SEVEN PAIRS OF MATCHING GATES

I don't want to spoil the joy of hearing these next two sections directly from Dr. Yang.

SMALL CIRCULATION

THREE TRICKY GATES

Master Yang clearly describes the dangers and methods of mastery for dealing with these gates.  He also developed what he calls the small small circulation, which beginners can achieve within a few weeks.  This involves leading the qi from the dan tian around the hui yin (perineum), while exhaling, and then inhaling and leading the qi up to the ming men (spot on the back directly behind the dan tian) and back to the dan tian.  This allows the student to practice circulation of the qi and providing the time to build up high levels of Qi, necessary for passing through the next two gates.

MODIFIED PRACTICE

Dr. Yang's small small circulation is presented here.  I'll let him provide the explanation when you watch this excellent DVD.

MEDITATION ORIENTATION

Which way to face while meditating or practicing the small circulation.  As Dr. Yang points out, literature seems to support all four cardinal directions.  Dr. Yang presents a logical process for determining the proper direction for your practice as well as a wonderful explanation of the effects of the earth's magnetic field, and the differing effects on a person based on whether they are in the northern or southern hemisphere.

TRADITIONAL & MODIFIED PRACTICE

Excellent section.  I'll let Dr. Yang do the presenting.  Otherwise this review will be too heavy to carry.

PRACTICE TIPS

When to practice, what to wear, what to sit on, placement of hands, closing techniques and many more practical tips are provided by Dr. Yang.

DR. YANG MEDITATION

Dr. Yang is filmed while meditating.  This is a good time to join him.

CANDLE TRAINING

Meditate while watching this video of a candle burning.  I would suggest getting your own candle and practicing in a dark room.  Meditating while in the Boy Scouts is one of my greatest memories of that time period.  I spent many evenings looking deep into a camp fire.  Great stuff.  Very conducive to learning and enjoying meditation.

Bottom Line:

This is an awesome DVD.  The whole series has been one hit after another.  Do yourself a favor.  Start with DVD 1 of this series and work your way through them.  If you are serious about learning Qigong and small circulation.  This is the series to get.",1192924800,39,9440,4.898989898989899
