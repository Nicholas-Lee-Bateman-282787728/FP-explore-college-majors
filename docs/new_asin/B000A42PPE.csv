2357988,4,B000A42PPE,"Over the last fifteen years, NDE (Near Death Experience) has caught the interest of the medical and scientific communities. As a recent Gallup poll suggests, one in twenty Americans have had some form of a NDE, and what is compelling, is that the reports are all strikingly similar in content. Although severely lacking in production value, The Lazarus Phenomenon more than makes up in content, because the two testimonials are indeed extraordinary, provoking serious thought on the subject.

The first testimonial is of the African preacher who died in a car accident. He was pronounced dead (he still possess his Death Certificate) and sent to a mortuary, where is body laid for three days. Strangely, the preacher's wife ""knew"" that he would come back to her, and asked that his body be moved from the mortuary and taken to the preacher's church. We next see his parishioners surrounding the body all in deep prayer. Viewed from an amateur video, we see the man start to breath and awaken with an expression of shock and confusion. The man had indeed returned from the dead. But what did he experience over that seventy-two hour period?

The preacher admits to seeing two angels, who take him to a land of extraordinary colour a limitless space. Both walk over a hill and the preacher sees a vast crowd of people who seem to resemble the angel. At first he believes these beings to be angels, but he's told they are saints, singing the praises of the Lord. The sounds of their singing is nothing the preacher had ever heard before, so beautiful, that the music could well transport him to another more wondrous place. The angel then takes him to the Gates of Hell. It is here that the preacher witness's the suffering of those souls who refused to follow the word of God and have been sentenced to an eternity of suffering. The angel tells him that his destiny is hell because in his heart he has failed to forgive his wife. In fact ""forgiveness"" is the central theme in both stories, because in order to be forgiven we must forgive the transgressions of others to ourselves. He pleads for another chance and is returned to the physical sphere to genuinely forgive his wife and his enemies.

The other testimonial is from a New Zealander who had been stung by a poisonous jellyfish in South East Asia. As this man tells his story, one can perceive great emotion and the fact that this experience changed his life in a profound way. While watching this man, I was reminded of the philosopher, William James and his book, The Varieties of Religious Experience, where James concludes that a ""real"" experience is followed by a profound change in the person's values and behaviour. This was certainly true of the New Zealander, because he was truly ""reborn"" as his values changed considerably to a life of Christian devotion and good works.

Rather than illustrate this man's experience, suffice to say that again, the central theme was ""forgiveness""; that before one can enter the kingdom of God, one must genuinely forgive one's enemies before being forgiven.

Medical practitioners and scientists are currently changing their views on NDE, no more attributing the experience as hallucination due to brain chemistry. The NDE's are too similar in content and too profound to attribute it as a mere chemical reaction.

What has truly stumped many doctor's are those cases where someone has been blind since birth and actually can ""see"" during their near death experience, describing in minute detail their surroundings after being resuscitated.

In my opinion the testimonials of little children who have come close to death or have actually died, return to describe their experiences from their innocent perspective; their accounts are truly moving and strike at the heart.

It is a shame that the overall production value of this documentary is poor. However, the content is fascinating, the testimonials extraordinary, provoking serious thought about the possibility of life after death. Recommended.",1145664000,42,4001,4.943452380952381

Pastor Ekechukwu was certifiably dead for 3 days, embalmed, yet God sent him back to repent of unforgiveness and testify that heaven and hell are 'real places' and that the Word of God is true.  Ian Mc Cormick's testimony also lives out the reality of the Lord's prayer and the need to forgive others.  Without Christ he first visits hell, but being prompted to pray the Lord's prayer and forgive those who mistreated him, God brings him to heaven where he encounters  the overwhelming love of God.",1391385600,,766,4.435714285714286

One of the things this production talks about is forgiveness, which is something I am struggling with now in my own life regarding a sibling and how they are treating my mother.  After watching this movie, I need to learn how to forgive while still protecting her from his actions.

Other productions you might consider are Round Trip and The Search for Heaven.  I give both of those productions 3 1/2 stars. Another movie on near death experiences is ""To Hell and Back"" with Brian Melvin.  Its only available on instant video, but I give it 4 stars.",1361577600,3,639,4.56140350877193

Pastor Daniel's experience is very impressive although the language barrier makes it a little hard to understand in some places. Both experiences share similiarities with others who have had near-death experiences. The importance of loving all others which includes forgiving.

A few months later, however, I watched the same video a friend of mine had received as a gift, and I was not impressed.

2358048,3,B000A42PPE,"The first story introduced on this CD can be found on youtube for free. Infact you can find many NDE's on youtube through a series called ""I Survived, Beyond and Back.""  The other story with the diver would have been a bit more special had I not already watched similiar stories.  Wish I could return this DVD it was not worth the $17.

However, these stories are thought provoking with a strong message:

It is clear to those that have read the bible that one can not get into heaven by their works/deeds.  It is what is in the person's heart that places them into either heaven or hell. You will see a reoccurring theme that ""forgiveness"" is a key issue when coming face to face with judement in the afterlife. If we look at the reason why God sent his only son to die on a cross for our sins we can see that God did this in order to be able to forgive us of our sins.  If God could do this for us, why then could we not forgive others? Forgiveness can also be found in the Lord's prayer a prayer this is supposed to be considered a perfect prayer ""and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.""

Not something that is easily done for sure but none the less the basis of the message this DVD provides.",1318204800,,1233,4.1991525423728815
2358049,2,B000A42PPE,"This is probably one of the worst example of a documentary on Near-Death Experiences.  The FX are very cheap and in the segment about the African pastor, most of the dialog is so mumbled, you can hardly tell what they are saying.

I will admit, I kinda fast forwarded through the parts where the narrator was talking in between the stories of the two guys who went to Heaven and they also saw Hell. I really enjoyed the stories of what happened. They re-acted them out like a movie. Not a real good production, but okay. This movie would be good for everyone to see. It really gets you thinking. This would be a super movie to watch if you have any unforgiveness or anger towards someone, or if you know someone who has not forgiven someone for something. These people would have stayed in Hell if they had died.....for not forgiving someone. Very powerful...",1300665600,,646,4.52991452991453

2358068,5,B000A42PPE,"The documentary starts off with a parable Jesus told, of the rich man and Lazarus the beggar, who begged for the crumbs from the rich man's table.
It was told the rich man died in his ways, and went to hell. When Lazarus died, he went to heaven. The rich man saw Lazarus at the foot of the prophet Abraham from a far, and begged for water to quench his thirst; Abraham explained how it wasn't possible to fulfill his request.

The second story was of the African Pastor, and his experience with death.
He was declared dead for three days; his body had been embalmed.
Upon his spiritual visit, it was told to him by an angel, of what happened between him and his wife that led to his resentment against her, that if the book of judgment were to close upon him, hell would be his portion.
The 3D effects, lets you visualize what the African man had seen.
The moral of this, is,
God doesn't care if you had given your life to Him, and call yourself a Christian, and or a Pastor, a Preacher; if you do not keep His commandments, and if you completely turn your back on Him, you will be judged according to your actions here on earth.

The third story was of the New Zealander, named Ian Mc Cormack, and of his near death experience. He had been stung several times by poisonous, boxed jellyfish.
It was the knowledge upon remembering his mother, and what she had always told him to pray when he was in trouble; that alone, urged Ian to ask God to teach him what to say in prayer. The 3D visualization of his near death experience, will have you glued to the TV screen.
Ian McCormack conducts a fervent prayer, on the special features of the DvD.

I've concluded the movie as being an informative masterpiece; a tool to save, encourage and deliver one from eternal damnation.
