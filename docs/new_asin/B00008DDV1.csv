1835487,5,B00008DDV1,"All the first reviewer wrote is completely true. This film gives a wonderful bio of Ram Dass. But his graceful path through the STROKE EXPERIENCE is a must for strokees to view. there is much he has learned from this ""fierce grace"" from ""BEING STROKED""...that could help others through the aging process and esp through the understanding of stroke as a strokee and as a loved one. I wish all of the 700,000  who experiences STROKE this year could  have this dvd placed in their hands asap.
I give it 5 stars. I intend to enjoy each part of THIS FILM for a long time. THANK YOU RAM DASS FOR YOUR LIFE BEFORE STROKE AND AFTER.
NAMASTE'
Love, Light, Rainbows
and Blessings

He is at his most open, his most giving and humbled in this wonderous film of the journey of his life. old home movies,many stories, comments by friends such as Huston Smith, Ralph Metzner, Larry Brilliant, Krishna Das and Bhagavan Das. This film inspires, as does all of Ram Dass' work.

1835489,5,B00008DDV1,"This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It has the power to really touch the hearts of anyone.  Ram Dass's life story is captured and presented in such a real way that he becomes your friend, and anyone can relate to him and his life experiences.  The film has great footage from the, Be Here Now, era of the late sixties and seventies all the way up to his life after his nearly fatal stroke. Fierce Grace details many of Ram Dass's career highlights and life achievements.  The relationship between an enlightened guru, Neem Karoli Baba, and his disciple Ram Dass is the essence of this story, pure devotion to GOD. Ram Ram. A must see.  OM Shanti - Jai Sri Neem Karoli Baba!!!",1049846400,17,696,4.40625

1835650,5,B00008DDV1,"Ram Dass fans will love this in depth look at what our guru has become with age. It's funny to see that the great american sage of his times is just another old man dealing with the pains of life and maturity. This guy was preaching like Jesus for 45 years of his life. Now he has had a stroke and he see's that he is dying and traveling to the same point the rest of us are. His views seem to have finally come full circle and he has realized, the teacher is still the student. We'll see you on the other side brother!

1835651,5,B00008DDV1,"If you care about aging and disability, or believe that it will never happen to you, this film is a must. Ram Dass is a modern day holy man, teaching us how to deal with our bodies breaking down yet embracing all of the things we fear, even death, with humor, grace, and a rich soul life. The film has footage from the 60s, which is great fun, as well as present day coverage of RD's challenge to live with a debilitating stroke, while  continuing to inspire, write, and teach. I've watched it twice within 10 days and I keep it on top of my movie musts pile so I can dip into it for his insights, perspectives, and the love that comes through him to anyone who watches this film.

1835735,5,B00008DDV1,"Sometimes painful to watch, this movie details his early days, but more importantly, shows his struggles after the stroke. So real, frightening and uplifting at the same time. Watching an icon struggle just to perform daily tasks we all take for granted, is humbling. I wondered if I'd be as graceful and loving were I in Ram Dass' situation. Well done!",1348704000,,353,4.80327868852459
1835736,5,B00008DDV1,"Ram Dass turned my life around, his words of wisdom and the way he lived his life as shown in this documentary enlightened me on the real meaning of what it is to be a Christian. I will forever be grateful to him.",1339632000,,213,3.9767441860465116
1835737,5,B00008DDV1,"Ram Dass was a favorite of many in the 1970's and beyond, someone who could describe ""being here now"" as a path to enlightenment.  His book Be Here Now sold almost as many books as The Bible and Dr. Spock.  Clearly his mission was to help, through spiritual wisdom and enlightenment, as many people as possible to attain the blissful state of enlightenment he himself felt he had attained, therefore escaping from further earthly suffering.

I have read all his books and in a few places I remember feeling an ego state he had, something not compatible with being the spiritual being he clearly is.
For instance in one place he describes in a sentence or two how once people like himself attain a certain level of spiritual developement suffering isn't needed and these people live blissful lives free of suffering and enjoy nothing but pure joy and contentment.

He now feels that his stroke, or ""being stroked"" as he calls it, was an act of grace, to teach him a further lesson he needed to learn.  He says ""We all have our melodramas.
They can be very sticky.""  He has come to terms with his condition of near paralysis.
He describes how on one side we all have suffering, and on the other side we all have grace, so we have to balance these out.  By grace he means he can get through it as he has a lot of help, and ends by saying where he is now is ok.

The amazing life of this man, his obvious genius, the revelation that there was more to life than money and success as a Harvard professor once he tried LSD with Timothy Leary, is a fascinating story.  There were many moments where his talks and counseling with people who were troubled brought tears to my eyes as I saw how good he was at saying just the right things to get people to see their suffering in a new light.  But it had to happen to him, too.  He says when he was brought to the hospital there was no spiritual thoughts or feelings.  He was just miserably lying there staring up at the ceiling unable to move.
He candidly says, ""I failed the test.""

The stroke forced him to admit he still has some work to do on himself.  The grace comes from knowing he is loved and cared for, still in a good place.

There is God, Guru, and you.  And they are all the same being.  As Ram Dass says, life grinds you up.  I found it incredibly inspiring and moving seeing this amazing man coping with his life's lessons.",1329609600,2,2377,4.315315315315315
1835738,5,B00008DDV1,I knew virtually nothing about Ram Dass before watching this. A wonderfully-constructed documentary on an inspiring man. I plan on reading some of his books now. Highly recommended.,1327622400,,181,5.5
1835739,5,B00008DDV1,"In 1870 someone challenged Ram Dass by Asking him. ""Are you rich?"" Ram Dass replied. ""I am infinitely wealthy in all ways."" That's the man this motion picture is about. I recommend it highly!",1315180800,,191,4.647058823529412
1835740,5,B00008DDV1,"I know that Dass himself thought his documentary fell short with too much emphasis on him, but this is a touching spiritual journey and particularly from the Steve & Anita, ....and Abby. The reviews on the cover do not lie. Yet I say it is at all once...reflective, ...""Heartbreaking, moving, inspiring.."".",1303084800,,306,5.019607843137255
1835741,4,B00008DDV1,"I don't know much of the guy but, I loved how the film made him very ordinary and not in a romantic way. Just an old guy with a past. A past that still leads him to decay and his hope to find something in that humbling process. I find him wanting to grow and be positive as person during this process and not in vapid way. I feel its more him struggling to cope with fear and struggle to be what he believes.

Its almost a sad film and I didn't want to like it but, that's just a reaction to wanting to watch someone triumph. He doesn't triumph, he keeps living day after unremarkable day.  Its the ugliness of people existing and running from death and pain our entire lives that the film, I find, puts a light on. A light that outshines his fame, followers, and even his own life.

In the end, I didn't find him to be a great man. I found him to be just another man. And that, I feel, was profound. It made a man out of a legend and not even that was done in a romantic way.

Its an unromantic film and I think that is as fitting a way to, be here now, as it could honestly have been.",1290124800,,1086,3.922727272727273

1835744,5,B00008DDV1,"With honesty and great heart, Ram Dass' owns his vulnerability and thereby helps us all chart a course to find strength and purpose in our lives that may feel hopelessly derailed by personal tragedy.

1835831,4,B00008DDV1,"I am one of the original readers of Be Here Now when it came out in 1971.  When I found this DVD available it was a good way to see where Ram Dass had been traveling these last 3 decades.

It was nice to revisit an old friend and was inspiring.  It would be a good video for young ppl on the path to see.",1257638400,3,304,3.646153846153846
1835832,5,B00008DDV1,"Fierce Grace is an autobiographical documentary about Ram Dass (a/k/a Richard Alpert), a spiritual pioneer and leader. His book, ""Remember, Be Here Now"" was a catalyst in the great awakening that has been unfolding in our world since the 1970's, and is still selling strong at amazon.com.  We see Ram Dass through all phases of his life: as a charming priveleged youngster, as an elite professor at Harvard, as an LSD experimenter with Timothy Leary, and as a dedicated disciple of an Indian guru. Now an aging baby boomer, Ram Dass tells his story from the perspective of someone who's in long-term recovery from a serious, life-altering stroke. His willingness to be ""stroked"" and to use the event as inspiration to continue to work on self and to expand his spiritual awareness is compelling. I highly recommend Fierce Grace to all stroke victims, to anyone on a spiritual path and to young people who are curious about an authentic, non-Hollywood version of the hippie movement and the love that created it.",1256774400,,1011,4.912280701754386
1835833,5,B00008DDV1,For the Spiritual Seeker this is am exemplary film. You can really see the progression of Ram Dass throughout the film and the relation between suffering and spiritual growth. There are also some very touching scenes of people conveying how Ram Dass touched their lives. Some of these people have gone through incredibly difficult experiences making his love even more special.,1239148800,2,377,5.19672131147541
1835834,5,B00008DDV1,"This DVD was a sensitive exploration into adversity, how it can impact on our lives, and yet how we can view it from a spiritual perspective and gain greater awareness of how we can transcend the challenges and move through the process. Ramm Dass, a great teacher and learner from life, satisfies again the point between poignancy and clarity.",1221436800,,343,4.830508474576271
1835835,3,B00008DDV1,"Knowing the younger Ram Dass from recordings of his talks to devoted and appreciative audiences, I was familiar with an immensely articulate and affective advocate of Eastern spirituality - able to speak with a familiar voice and an accessible vocabulary about a subject that goes beyond language and reason. What is disappointing about this film is how post-stroke aphasia has affected the man's ability to speak so clearly, precisely, and eloquently. Watching the film, I kept thinking that the film's editors were making him seem more articulate than he now is.

I gather from those who speak highly of Ram Dass that you literally have to *be there* with him to fully grasp the impact of his presence as a teacher. A lengthy scene at the end of the film records a session with a young woman who comes to him for help dealing with the violent death of a dear friend. The camera attempts to capture what transpires during that meeting, but I think it's very difficult to tell to what extent the force of his presence (given his difficulty with language) has in the situation. It may have been profound or superficial - it's really hard to tell for sure, and that is, I think, a problem with the film.

Others here have blamed the filmmakers, and I don't know if that criticism is fair. The medium of film, with its attention to surfaces, is handicapped in dealing with a subject like this. I would recommend this film only for people who are already fans of Ram Dass. And if you are older, don't look for much insight into aging. To that extent, the film shows him at a reading of a new book about this subject, and if you aren't troubled too much by the obvious role played by his editor (which we see in one scene), you may find the book more illuminating than this film.",1221264000,14,1774,4.540625
1835836,5,B00008DDV1,"This is one of the most moving and meaningful documentaries I have ever seen. Mickey Lemle has done a magnificent job of blending all of the significent aspects of Ram Dass' life together into a beautiful tapestry that is at once touching, profound, insightful, hilarious, and heartbreaking. Ram Dass' characteristic willingness to be totally vulnerable, open, and honest, to explore the spiritual challenges inherent in the after-effects of his life-changing stroke, and to continue to share his own magical blend of extraordinarily wise, compassionate spiritual truths is refreshing, delightful, and heart-warming.  BRAVO!  Thank you for creating this precious gem!",1176249600,5,667,5.7272727272727275
1835837,5,B00008DDV1,Very inspirational with highs and lows.  Great for any person who has had a stroke.  I totally enjoyed it.  Recommended,1176163200,3,119,4.85
1835838,5,B00008DDV1,"I don't know if it was just me or what, but when I was fifteen, I thought I was somehow going to be the one that magically escaped ""old age"". But then I got to be in my twenties and I still clung to a shred of hope that maybe I could still escape it. After my thirties I knew I was going to be no different than all the others that preceeded me, age was inevitable, but getting old was entirely up to me.

In this exceptional movie, Ram Dass shows us that even though the body may betray us, the Spirit that is within is always willing to make all things new. He is a ""true"" Spiritual teacher. He lives what he talks about. I was always kind of suspect of those ""teachers"" who claimed to be so exalted and beyond this world. What makes a ""true"" spiritual teacher is someone who shows us the we are in the world, but we are not of it...that our limitations are not here to thwart us, but are given to us so that we may get the opportunity to prove that our soul/our spirit is infinitely stronger than any situation we may be going through.

I have to admit, I've done my fair share of pouting the last few years. My body has had its share of trials and tribulations to overcome and after seeing Fierce Grace, I was actually embarrassed about my physical complaining. Ram Dass has faced his physical limitations with an even greater willingness to ""serve God"". He truly is the embodiment of Love, Compassion, and Service.

We can all learn from this beautiful movie. Do we curse the things that we are given or do we realize that even the so called difficulties that are in our lives are blessings? We really don't know what is for our Highest Good, but there is something that does and it is that something greater that we need to continually surrender to moment by moment by precious moment.

Every moment of our lives has gotten us to right here and right now and where we will eventually end up will be determined by what we predominantly used our time for. Did we use our time helping others or by seeing what we could get from others? Did we use our time for celebrating or for mourning our losses? Did we realize the amount of grace that is available in each and every moment or did we argue that life isn't fair? We may not be able to escape age, but we can use it to our greatest advantage.

This movie is a blessing. You will feel blessed just by watching it.

Peace to all...",1169424000,16,2384,4.228571428571429
1835839,5,B00008DDV1,"This DVD transports the viewer to a sacred space where the events in life make sense from a higher perspective.  Ram Das still has the great gift to move people to their higher purpose in life.  This is a DVD which I will watch whenever I need to be reminded of this higher perspective.  Not only does this include a biography of Ram Das' life including his present struggles with aging after his stroke, but it also includes three incredible people who share about their tragedies and how they use their experiences to attain a higher perspective.",1169078400,7,548,4.628865979381444
1835840,4,B00008DDV1,"I really enjoyed this DVD and thought it was well done.  It included a bit of biography on Ram Dass along with deep vulnerable sharing in terms of how his life changed after he had a stroke, the inner struggles involved and where he stumbled.

I have met Ram Dass in person and up to that point, I wasn't a huge fan.  However, hearing him talk life, I understood there was more to him than I originally thought.  He had a quality of presence, sincerity and empathy that was palpable.  Somehow... the producers of this video managed to capture much of this.

When my mom had her stroke, my dad started CPR within 90 seconds and saved her life.  However, my dad felt guilty and wondered if he did the right thing by saving her.  When I posed this question to Ram Dass in person, he started to cry and after more than a minute, he said.... ""If your dad jumping into action was motivated by love... how could it be the wrong choice?""  I felt bowled over by the wisdom and empathy of his response and somehow that helped me to shift my relationship to that event as well.  I tell this story because I think it illustrates an important point that Ram Dass isn't merely a ""hippy guru"" struggling with a stroke and old age.  He has learned a lot over the years and has much to offer us in terms of understanding old age and illness from the inside.  He also models how to approach the inevitable difficulties and existential crisis' of aging with grace and dignity.",1168992000,11,1457,4.355555555555555
1835909,5,B00008DDV1,"My first introduction to Ram Dass (aka Dr. Richard Albert) came in December of 1984.  I was managing a bookstore in my hometown in North Carolina, and an elderly lady came in one night just before closing.  My mother had died of cancer several months before, and I was in a state of severed depression about my life and where I was headed.  The lady walked around the store for a number of minutes, and then came up to the counter and laid a cassette tape down it.  Now, I didn't know who this lady was.  I'd never seen her before, nor did I ever see her again.  She said that she wanted me to have the tape and that it would help to ease my emotional pain and suffering.  I didn't know how she knew about that and felt somewhat embarrassed by her comment.  I didn't want the tape and attempted to give it back to her.  That was when she mentioned my mother and said that I was being watched over by her.  I didn't know what to say.  The lady left the store.  Against my better, I listened to the tape that night.  It was a lecture by someone that I'd never heard of.  The man's name was Ram Dass, and he was speaking to a group of people about living and suffering, and how all of this is nothing more than another method for learning about ourselves as spiritual beings.  There was a truth to his words that touched something deep within me.  I could hear the honesty in his voice as he talked about his own life and the struggles that he had to work through.  I have no doubt that the tape saved my life that winter.  Afterwards, I began to search for more tapes by this unusual gentleman and discovered a wealth of information in both tape and book form.

Twenty-two years later, Ram Dass is once again in my life in the form of a documentary by Mickey Lemle called Ram Dass: Fierce Grace.  The documentary was done in 2001 and deals with the major stroke that Ram Dass had in 1997, as well as flashbacks to his early years as a child, a Harvard professor, a spiritual seeker in India, a guru to the baby boomers of the sixties, and as the best selling author of Be Here Now.  Ram Dass has always said that his message was simply his own personal journey through life.  That was what he had to share with others who sought a clearer understanding about life and why we're here.  During the documentary, we get to see Ram Dass and how the stroke has changed his own life with numerous sessions of therapy, learning to talk again and to be able to find the right words to express his thoughts, and still being here to help other people on their own special journey of inner discovery.  We also get to see the early years of Ram Dass, especially with his spiritual guru, Neem Karoli Baba, and with his father after he returns home from India.  It was enlightening to see his father, who was very upper class, deal with his son returning from a third-world country, dressed in a white robe and having a long beard, with hundreds of people flocking to their home in New Hampshire to listen to this ""servant of God"" speak about his own journey toward understanding.  Some how, on a deeper level, his father knew that he was doing something that would help others.  As the DVD ends, Ram Dass talks about his new journey, which deals with aging and strokes and still being here and a new way to find true grace in his actions.

Though I'd seen pictures of Ram Dass over the years and had listened to countless cassette tapes, I'd never seen him in person.  This DVD is probably as close as I'll ever get to him.  It was certainly an eye-opening experience, and it made me realize that there was vital information here that I needed to know because I'm now 56 and dealing with the aging process and my own unique journey.  It was also fun to finally see Wavy Gravy.  I've heard so much about him over the years and his acute sense of humor.  And yes, he did make me laugh.  I do wish, however, that the documentary had been longer.  There's an extra twenty minutes of scenes in the Special Features, but it was still too short.  I could've easily sat through another ninety minutes, listening to Ram Dass talk about perception and reality and how each person has chosen a particular path to follow with its own challenges and mellow drama and methods for achieving self-realization.  There were a number of scenes in the documentary that will have you crying.  The biggest one deals with the parents of Rachel, a young teen who was raped and murdered.  Ram Dass wrote them a letter with regards to their tragedy, and it helped them to over-come their rage and helplessness at what had happened to their daughter.  When the mother of Rachel reads the letter, it definitely brings you to tears.  Another scene has Ram Dass listening to a young woman as she talks about the murder of her boyfriend and how she's trying to understand why this has happened.  What she has to say brings Ram Dass to sudden tears as her words touch his heart.  Needless to say, Ram Dass: Fierce Grace has an important message to deliver to those who are ready to hear it.  As Ram Dass says, when you're ready, all it takes is a simple word or action to open the door to your awareness.  Then, you're able to walk through it with better clarity as to why we're here and the many different roles that we play throughout our life.  This is powerful stuff, but if you're not ready, it'll be meaningless to you.  Namaste, Ram Dass!",1168560000,19,5397,4.345654345654346

1835911,5,B00008DDV1,"I went to see Ram Dass in Santa Fe, New Mexico just before his stroke in 1997. I had recently gotten interested in his books and they were giving me a much needed perspective on how to live my life during a very challenging time. Many hearts were broken when the news of his stroke were released. Now he comes back to show us how to grow old. He is such a wonderful example. I don't think that he would consider himself an enlightened being. Perhaps highly awakened. But that's the key to being on The Path, accepting exactly where you are now with all of your hangups and negativity. His outstanding book ""Be Here Now"" has been the catalyst for many spiritual aspirants. Anyway ""Fierce Grace"" is absolutly wonderful. Very well produced and edited. It takes through Ram Dass's childhood and then through his years experimenting with hallucinogens to his search for a more ""natural"" high which eventually brought him to his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. The DVD brings me to tears a few times. Some from sadness, some from the fact that it touches that spot in me that holds it all, sadness, fear, ecstasy, love, all of it. Ram Dass has helped many to find that place and this film is such a well deserved tribute to him.",1162684800,8,1214,4.497737556561086

1835914,3,B00008DDV1,"I was hoping that this would be a documentary about the life of Ram Dass, but, alas, it is not. The film is a study of the would-be prophet after his stroke, and shows his struggle with language and aging as it makes illusions to his earlier life. It showcases the way in which he continues to inspire and be admired by thousands. We see him interact in with therapists and give speaking engagements. Numerous interviews are held with those who know him. I must note that, even though I don't give a darn for its subject, the movie is very well-crafted.

However, I can only give it a tepid recommendation because there is no critical evaluation of Ram Dass-or at least a person interviewed who does not think he's great. This is needed as, contrary to unconventional wisdom, Dass is not a profound man. His observations, then and now, were a stringing together of banal clichs involving words like ""love, consciousness"" and ""spirituality."" If you're the type of person who regards taking acid as ""a religious experience"" then you'll be receptive to a guy like this. For those who have had enough of sixties emotionalism, you might not want to see the hailing of this vapid fellow for ninety minutes, but that's what Fierce Grace amounts to. Dass finds nobility in most of the things he does and with the film he hopes to show baby boomers what age has in store for them, but that spoiled generation may be the only one in history who regard death as not being absolutely necessary or that maybe it doesn't apply to them. For the rest of us, we understand that oxidation and returning to ash are inherent to our existence.",1135987200,7,1622,4.593103448275862
1835915,1,B00008DDV1,"Having followed the philosphy of Ram Dass since the late 70's, I can't begin to express my disappointment at the director's shabby work here. Was this a hatchet job on Dass or was the filmmaker really this out of touch with his teachings? Either way it's a shame that this unfocused piece of rubbish actually made it to DVD distribution.",1135641600,7,337,4.633333333333334
1835916,1,B00008DDV1,"Somebody put something in my drink, or was it this snooze-fest of a film. This guy directs like a dead-beat trying to avoid creditors. What a disgrace to Ram Dass's legacy. Please avoid this film like the plague.",1135641600,7,212,4.605263157894737
1835917,1,B00008DDV1,I would love to have seen this subject handled by a more insightful and skilled filmmaker. It's regrettable that this tedious mess will be part of Ram Dass's legacy.,1135641600,4,165,4.724137931034483
1835918,5,B00008DDV1,"I bought this DVD when it first came out and I think I've watched it at least every four or five months since then.  This film carries so much human truth and longing, and does it in such a simple, unassuming way that I don't think I could ever really tire of it.  Populated by a cast of real-life characters as colorful as any you'll find (not least of all Ram Dass himself), suffused with tenderness and sincere spiritual feeling, this film is a source of sadness, laughter, and somehow, tremendous comfort.  And the music is lovely.  I really couldn't recommend this any more enthusiastically.",1131840000,11,596,4.647619047619048
1836012,5,B00008DDV1,"Baba Ram Dass was one of the major spiritual influences in my life during the early '70's. I discovered his books and tapes just about the time I decided to change my college major from Anthropology to Religious Studies. It's books like: 'Be Here Now', 'The Only Dance There Is' and more recently 'Still Here' that continue to break through my rigidity of thought and open my mind and heart to new vistas of understanding and acceptance.

I had the priviledge of meeting Ram Dass back in '76 after a talk he gave at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA. During that brief moment in his presence I experienced an unmistakable flow of energy emanating from this ex-Harvard professor, turned subversive LSD user, turned Hindi guru and devotee of Hanuman, the Monkey-God. I felt totally alive, empowered and so bursting with emotion that I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.

Through the years I've met, or stood in the presence of numerous famous spiritual figures from a wide variety of faiths and traditions and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything comparable to what enveloped me that night in '76 as I looked into the smiling, grandfatherly face of Ram Dass.

Seeing Ram Dass old, infirmed and confined to a wheelchair since his stroke in '97 takes a little getting used to, but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes and see that knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed a bit. At least not concerning the things that really matter. 'Fierce Grace' is a magnificent visual document presenting one mans' commitment to love, endurance and living life ""in the moment."" His teachings and attitude have remained as clear and consistent today as they were thirty-five years ago; humorous, insightful, deeply personal and above all compassionate.

1836013,4,B00008DDV1,"Recently, as I was recovering from pneumonia and feeling pretty depressed, a friend recommended I get a copy of Fierce Grace.  As I watched clips of Ram Dass both before and after his stroke, I realized what suffering really was and that the human spirit always---even in the depths of pain, disease, or sorrow---has choices.  When Spirit smacks us in the head with some kind of difficulty in our lives, we can either wallow in our suffering and fade away or we can accept the ""fierce grace"" Spirit has extended to us and grow.  The message that healing is not a return to the way things were before we get sick or go through some kind of trauma, but rather the growth of spirit and consciousness that we can undergo as we come through difficulty stuck with me.  My physical illness is gone, but I am not the same.  For anyone facing a difficult time in his or her life, I highly recommend viewing this DVD.",1126224000,26,907,4.4397590361445785
1836014,5,B00008DDV1,"As we all get older, the loss of independence and control that we've spent a lifetime acquiring is a frightening aspect. Beyond the spiritual components in the biography of Richard Alpert's life is a story of his life after the stroke that left him incapacitated; it's ironic that the book he was working on when he was ""stroked by God"" was a book on aging itself.  Ram Dass's current example has become a daily reminder of what each one of us can accomplish with manifest hope and the help of others in our lives. (May we all have a cosmic jester the likes of Wavy Gravy!) Whatever one may think of Ram Dass as a spirtual guide his all-too-human frailty teaches a practical, very earth-bound lesson toward approaching age and disability.

1836016,5,B00008DDV1,"Mickey Lemle's documentary Ram Dass, Fierce Grace, describes the life of Ram Dass (Richard Alpert), author, 60s guru, spiritual teacher, cohort of Timothy Leary, and author of Be Here Now, one of the most influential books of the 1970s. The film begins in the present as Ram Dass deals with the effects of a massive stroke he suffered in February 1997 that left him physically incapacitated and with impaired memory and speech.

Interweaving current conversations, interviews with people in his life, and archival footage, Lemle then looks back at his childhood, the controversy surrounding his research with Timothy Leary in psychedelics at Harvard, his studies in India with Neem Karoli Baba who renamed him Baba Ram Dass (Servant of God), his work with the Seva Foundation in social action projects dedicated to relieving suffering in the world, and his impact as an author and guru to millions of followers. Several examples are shown of his compassion and his ability to feel the pain of others. In an opening sequence, his beautiful ""Rachel's Letter""*comforts a family after their daughter was murdered. In the final sequence, Ram Dass listens to a young woman struggling to overcome her grief at her boyfriend's violent death. In a powerfully moving segment, she brings Ram Dass to tears when she tells him about a dream she had in which her boyfriend speaks to her from beyond with a reassuring message.

When Ram Dass received the ""fierce grace"" of being ""stroked"", he admits he did not have any unusual spiritual epiphany. He recalls, ""Here I am, Mr. Spiritual, and in my own head I didn't orient toward the spirit. It showed me I have some work to do"". He has written about the stroke in his latest book, ""Still Here"" in which he talks about slowing down, and finding out about the ""everything"" that is out there. For Ram Dass, aging has become a gift. ""I was galumphing through life before the stroke"", he says. ""I'm at peace now more than I've ever been. The peace comes from settling in to the moment"". Enhanced by the music of Krishna Das, the documentary is more than just a bio-pic or a meditation on the process of aging, it is an inspiring portrait of a man whose life can be summed up in one word -- service. Ram Dass has said, ""What one person has to offer to another is their own being, nothing more, nothing less"". In Ram Dass, Fierce Grace, Mr. Lemle has given us Ram Dass' being, nothing more, nothing less. That is a gift of love.",1101340800,100,2456,4.696055684454756

This is a perfect example of how this medium can be a powerful tool for healing and transformation. The journey of this film is an emotional ride with many delightful moments of wit and interesting history about a man and presence of love on this planet. I highly reccomend everyone to experience the power of ""Fierce Grace"". While no one would ever wish upon another the harsh lessons of the many people interviewed in this documentary, there is an opportunity for growth and expansion of awareness contained in this slim DVD.",1079913600,17,685,4.622950819672131

1836019,5,B00008DDV1,"This is a documentary about the legendary Harvard professor, Richard Albert, who experimented with LSD in the 60s, then went to India, changed his name to Ram Das, and came back to become a guru for the hippie generation. Now he's about 70, and, due to a stroke he suffered in 1997, is wheelchair bound.  ""I never expected old age to be like this,"" he says with difficulty, as his speech is slow now as he struggles to find the right words.  The camera takes us right with him on his daily routine.  Aides help him dress and drive him to his many therapy appointments and we are witness to his acupuncture as well as speech and physical therapy sessions.
There's background of course, home movies of him as a child in the 1930s, one of three lively siblings whose father was the president of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad.  There's some footage of him with a fresh face and short cropped hair as a professor at Harvard as he and Timothy Leary saw the mind altering drugs of the time as a major breakthrough in human psychology.  And then we see him with his guru in India, taking on the spiritually that was even more powerful than the drugs.  He then returned home, bearded and dressed in what his father described as a ""bedsheet"", and held outdoor yogi sessions for his hundreds of his followers right on the golf course of his family's New Hampshire estate.  His book, ""Be Here Now"" became a best seller and is still in print.
But now he's an old man, struggling with his physical challenges.  Much of the film focuses on him this way, and sometimes it's hard to watch as he's learning to live with his limitations.  I was impatient with some of these scenes, in which he struggles to speak; I would have much preferred the film tto be about his history, rather than his present. However, I realize that the film is exactly what he intended it to be and it gives a powerful message.  He's now a guru to the aging baby boomers and he's a living example of how to deal with old age with dignity.  Aging is a natural part of life and we all have to learn to live with it.  Ram Das is a fine example.  He's recently written a book, takes on speaking engagements, and finds time to give individuals spiritual counseling.
I give this film a high recommendation.  There's a lot to learn from it. It might not be comfortable to watch, but it
certainly is worthwhile.",1065052800,116,2375,4.4050343249427915
