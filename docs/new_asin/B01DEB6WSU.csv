8755678,1,B01DEB6WSU,"This video very disappointing.  Bought it in preparation for upcoming Grand Canyon trip.  The photography is amateur and the editing worse, with long segments of very boring scenery (pine trees).  The narration sounds like a British computer voice.  Wasted  my money  here.",1492128000,,273,5.380952380952381
8755679,2,B01DEB6WSU,This movie looks like something made in the 50's was rather dull and not very good video.,1491436800,,89,4.294117647058823
8755680,2,B01DEB6WSU,looks like a guy mounted a camera on his dash and just drove around; and then overdubbed a really boring narrative read without skill from a high school text book.,1485043200,,163,4.466666666666667
8755681,5,B01DEB6WSU,"I wanted to get an idea of what to expect before I visit the Grand Canyon area. This video served the purpose. This video shows images as seen on a coach tour of the Grand Canyon area.  It also shows images of a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, Black Canyon river rafting and scenes of Las Vegas. Scenes of  Sedona and Williams are also  included. Images are good and narrative relevant as a travel documentary.",1472774400,,415,4.434210526315789
8755682,1,B01DEB6WSU,"I think this is where Jezza, May, and Hamster tried to bury Evan's and the ""new"" Top Gear. Fortunately, Evans did it himself.",1470873600,,125,4.478260869565218
8755683,5,B01DEB6WSU,"Was hoping to see more of Jeremy, James and Richard - but I guess the new cameras aren't quire right yet and unable to capture footage of them.  Overall 5/10 without having viewed it.",1470873600,3,183,4.382352941176471
