5079308,5,B007DK8M7S,"Television, which can be so awful, can also be magnificent, breathtaking, and memorable. ""Far Pavilians"" is such a work of television art. So is ""Kings in Grass Castles,"" a brilliantly well-acted, stunningly photographed study of the westward movement of white settlers into the aboriginal lands in the 19th century. All the main characters are a marvelously charismatic lot of Irish peasants who brought their wits and charm to the new lands. The dynamics of the native population in conflict with the new settlers is at times tragic, but the film makers bring enormous compassion and intelligence to the subject. It is a drama, not a sentimental tirade against whites, nor a reactionary celebration of the civilized against the savage. It is a human drama, well told, against the background of the seemingly endless Australian landscape.",1184371200,7,839,5.222222222222222

5079310,4,B007DK8M7S,"Very, very good.  I stopped short of ""Excellent"".  Not sure why.  Trying to put my finger on it as it were.  The scenery was gorgeous, both in Australia and Ireland.  The settings felt right .. clothes,.... what was being used.  I felt something was missing in the writing, just felt as though I wanted more in some way.  Perhaps it is a true historical depiction from the author of the book (who was a relative I assume) but I felt as though it missed some richness somewhere.  The parts with the Aboriginals were excellent and I would have liked to have seen more than that.  I thought the most touching scene in the movie is where ""Pumpkin"" or Burrukin tells Patsy that he needs to go where he began.  So beautiful.  I would love to see a movie that does tell more of the Aboriginal story and culture but perhaps they are wanting to stay private as most indigenous cultures do.  They are a fascinating and wonderful people who carry a great deal of knowledge of how to walk in balance and beauty on the Earth.  Overall though, worth watching.",1510358400,2,1045,4.436842105263158
5079311,2,B007DK8M7S,Too slow. Amateur actors. Script dialogue could have been written by a committee.,1510358400,,81,5.3076923076923075

5079313,5,B007DK8M7S,"Kings in Grass Castles depicts both the atrocities committed against the indigenous peoples of Australia and a family's fight to escape and survive the famine in Ireland.  Several subplots come into play, artfully woven into the fabric of the story.  As life often is, ""It's complicated.""

Well worth the watch.",1509408000,3,311,5.18

5079317,4,B007DK8M7S,"I'm sorry, but I'm sure the story is good.  I just couldn't get past the score, which a major distraction for me.  I felt as if I were watching something from the 50s or 60s.  The sing-song, dark, something's about to happen score. The score feels dated. Lost me on that.",1505606400,,271,4.2745098039215685

5079319,4,B007DK8M7S,"A most entertaining adventure about Irish famine survivors who emigrate to Australia in the mid 19th Century. There's cruelty and crudeness of course, this is not Brideshead Revisited. But the characters are colourful and it is they who drive the narrative. I enjoyed it very much. History is something you can't change so don't expect colonisation to be portrayed as anything else than what it was",1504742400,3,398,5.045454545454546
5079320,5,B007DK8M7S,"I absolutely love watching these historical recreations if if in Austrailian. Almost like the old wes of early America.
It was a good story, not perfect in every sense, but very human with human weaknesses as well as the strength of determination to succeed even in the shadow of failure.
I wiish there could have been more episodes.",1504137600,8,333,4.758620689655173
5079321,5,B007DK8M7S,"I love historical dramas. I appreciate that this one gives, at least, a nod to the plight of the Aboriginal people. The cost they paid for the Irish to flee British subjugation. I'll never comprehend how an oppressed people can so easily forget the plight of their dark skinned brethren. I feel empathy for the plight of the Irish, sold into indentured service. Forced out of their homes if the ""rent"" wasn't paid to the conquering English. At any rate, this series held me in it's grip. Great writing. The story moves quickly forward. The drama will stop your heart. By the end, I was in tears. Lingering thoughts about a man's ambitions and the line of morality he'd cross to win his share of gold.",1503792000,4,700,4.563492063492063
5079322,5,B007DK8M7S,"Meaningful story, perfectly chosen actors, superbly directed. I loved it. It is the story of life... full of challenges to be met. It is the story of real love, that transcends earthly ease.  And it is the story of the reality, that after achieving all the challenges, all that is left is our offspring. It's a rainy day, the news of the world is awful, and I immersed myself in this story. Thank you.",1503792000,2,401,4.418918918918919
5079323,1,B007DK8M7S,"It comes to mind that all of the 8 reviews were either written by the characters in the movie or by their relatives because this movie was drab from beg. to end.  Thee was nothing lush about it, either mud and stone in bitter cold or red earth and stone in a dessert.  It was struggles, usurping, murdering, poisoning, opportunity and loss...a crap life.  It was depressing.  I don't call this entertainment and like an uninvited guest who overstays their welcome I'm not inclined to see another minute of this film if it goes over to another season.  I only watched it bec. Amazon refuses to change out their prime movies and nothing's left but 1, 2, 3 star drivel and things like this.",1503792000,6,687,4.508064516129032

5079325,5,B007DK8M7S,"This is a classic movie about an Irish family who go to Australia during the potato famine as indentured servants, strike it rich, and then greed takes over.  An insight into the horrible treatment of the Australian natives.  Very sad.  But good movie with great photography and acting.",1415836800,2,286,4.916666666666667
5079326,5,B007DK8M7S,"What a great movie! I have always been fascinated with the settling of Australia and this movie depicts the journey of one family from Ireland in the mid 1800s. The contrast within the family of how to accomplish the journey and settling in a new country is quite interesting. The hardships that the family endured parallel anything that happened during the settling of America but are certainly not as well known outside Australia. One member of the family, Patrick, had the courage and character to forge a place for his family in the Australian Outback but each family member played a significant part in their success. It is a story of building a dynasty and the relationships built with others within the business community. I was particularly impressed with the treatment of and respect shown to the Aborigines by the Dulacks. The actors are superb and so believable and the cinematography is beautiful. Stephen Dillane , Ernie Dingo and Fionnula Flanagan are wonderful in this movie. I highly recommend this movie.",1389916800,6,1021,4.976608187134503

8515032,5,B007DK8M7S,"Kings in Grass Castles a meaningful story of reality, life's challenges, and how a family dealt with all it had to face. This was a very human story of real love filled with pain and challenges and life not often dealt with kindly or in the wisest way. I was immersed in this drama from the beginning. In the way it's presented I would categorize Kings in Grass Castles as a true classic depicting an impoverished Irish family in the mid 19th Century who fights to escape the potato famine in Ireland by leaving their home and land against the will of the headstrong patriarchal father. The family immigrates to Australia in hopes to survive, but once they arrive in the new land, life for the family proves to be no better than before. From the beginning they become nothing more than indentured servants, badly treated by the English Aristocrats who think them less than what they are. The family later strikes it rich and unfortunately they soon discover how greed begins to cause them to become not so different from those who ruled over them in the beginning.

Many subplots filter in and out, weaving together the fabric that makes Kings in Grass Castles so enjoyable while intensely deep and complicated. I loved it, this story of life as it sometimes is and was back then. In one of the subplots we also experience some of the atrocities committed against the indigenous people who also had to fight to survive but in their way.

Heart rendering in so many spots, it was still a most entertaining adventure. The characters are great and the narrative moves the story along at a good pace. Some people might not like this depiction but you can't change history. It is what it is. Colonization was not pretty nor should it be portrayed as anything other than what it was. A meaningful story, with perfectly chosen cast, it was superbly directed. I loved it. It is the story of life full of challenges that don't always lead to a happy ending.",1523923200,2,1948,4.610951008645533
8515033,1,B007DK8M7S,"How did this get so many stars?  I'm sorry to say that this movie was boring and trite, and I laughed out loud when the father said about the main character, ""He's only a lad!""  That guy is thirty-five if he's a day.  That's fine, but at least have the sense not to include such a ridiculous line in the movie.",1521244800,,310,4.049180327868853
8515034,4,B007DK8M7S,Absolutely amazing scenery both in Ireland and Australia. Good acting. Another sad commentary on the treatment of Australia's native people. I love these historical adaptations.,1515974400,,177,6.12

8515037,1,B007DK8M7S,"Same old story: down-trodden, white person leaves his home country to make a new life for himself and his family. In the process, he takes over land that belongs to the native residents, mistreats them and gets rich. Then, surprise, surprise his grown children are not really anxious to expand their family holdings.  Perhaps going to university would be more interesting. Father gets angry, sends sons into the wilderness where they encounter further problems. This is as far as I could stomach this movie. Unoriginal script, mediocre acting horrible scenario.  Much better movies have been done that brought honor to the hard working Irish.",1512950400,,642,5.163461538461538
