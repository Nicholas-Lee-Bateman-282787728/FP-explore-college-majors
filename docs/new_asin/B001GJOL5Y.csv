3611847,5,B001GJOL5Y,"This video is awesome for targeting the backside, I have knee trouble so the two sections on your knees were a little much, but overall I think it is a good video and you can pick which segments you want to do.",1237248000,3,210,4.023809523809524
3611848,5,B001GJOL5Y,"I have been doing this workout for 4 weeks and my booty is really firming up....I tried the old Buns of Steel workouts w tamilee and michelle and also leisa, and i always seemed to think Leisa was the best...i had forgotten about her until i got pregnant and loved her FITMAMA dvd, and now i am ecstatic to have her new BUNS OF STEEL dvd, it had some great moves that challenged me, the camera would always show the advanced moves so i was never lost. I REALLY liked the music and the variety from the 5-10 minute segments...this is a new favorite.",1234137600,10,548,4.278846153846154
3611849,1,B001GJOL5Y,So disacppointed.  I have several 'buns of steel' DVD's but this one is garbage.  :(,1404691200,,84,4.533333333333333
3611850,5,B001GJOL5Y,great exercise dvd. it really works if you stick to it. I am so glad that i finally found it!,1394496000,,93,3.7
3611851,3,B001GJOL5Y,"I think its a great workout overall.. my problem is, i am only feeling the burn in my thighs, not my butt, which is what iwaswanting to target. I am sore a few hours after though, so i cant complain",1393200000,2,198,3.975
3611852,5,B001GJOL5Y,Great workout! Highly recommended. Sore after the first workout which means it works. Can't wait to see my results after a couple of weeks.,1381622400,,139,4.833333333333333
3611853,2,B001GJOL5Y,"I've had the old 80's buns of steel video and i thought buying a newer version would be great, but this video has bairly any bun workouts. Most of the focus was on legs aka your quads i believe. Would not suggest for people who want a serious bun workout like i did",1360713600,2,265,4.018867924528302
3611854,4,B001GJOL5Y,"Great price, perfect dcondition, but i haven't actually applied it yet. Maybe i should get off the couch and actually do the work out to make sure it works :)",1354492800,2,158,4.3
3611855,1,B001GJOL5Y,"I had high hopes for this video. BUT i found the following:
1)She rushed through the choreography without showing you how the move is supposed to look like
2)She didn't explain any of the workout moves
3)Most of the moves were difficult to do and she assumed you could do them all.
4)Leisa Hart doesn't really connect with you. She seems a little cold.

This whole video was awkward and not very useful. No wonder its only 5 dollars. It sucked so much that I'm going to donate it or throw it out. And i normally don't do that. But its THAT BAD.",1331596800,,544,4.281553398058253
3611856,5,B001GJOL5Y,"I'm a stay-at-home mom and I've been looking for an exercise DVD to help me get my butt and legs toned now that going to the gym is a distant memory.  I LOVE this DVD, the instructor is great, very encouraging without being annoying, and I am sore in all the right places the next day.  :)  I like how the workouts are broken up into 5 and 10 minute workouts, it's great for when you are short on time.  (Or you can do all of them at once).  I have two kids under the age of two, so it's perfect for me to get in a little bit of exercise here and there while they are napping and in between my housework.  It adds up fast!  You can make the workouts harder or easier, the instructor shows the modifications.",1327276800,3,707,4.007142857142857
3611857,3,B001GJOL5Y,I was expecting this video to be more challenging than it is.  I would recommend this for beginner exercisers as opposed to more advanced exercisers.  Low impact and slow paced for the most part.  I always enjoy Leisa Hart as an instructor though.,1323648000,2,247,4.6976744186046515
3611858,1,B001GJOL5Y,"I thought I would be sucking air and have Jello legs, but man was I wrong! This work out is lame and I barely broke a sweat. I hate the slow pace. This DVD is going in the cupboard and not coming out.",1316736000,2,200,3.6744186046511627
3611859,2,B001GJOL5Y,"It is for sure for beginners not advanced..so if you are looking for advanced then don't get this! But if you are a beginner, this will be good for you.",1316390400,,152,4.1
3611860,2,B001GJOL5Y,"This is NOTHING compared to the original Buns of Steel.  The warm up in the original video is more of a workout than the workouts on this video.  Further, the lady on the video does little to prepare the viewer for the next step so you don't end up following the steps well.  I've engage in a lot of aerobic exercise, everything from cardio kickboxing to yoga in both live classes and with videos and this is one of the few times that I kept fumbbling along because of lack of proper instruction and preparation.  Even after completing 3 of the routines (one 10 minute routine is totally pointless), my heart rate was not up, my buns did not ache, and I felt like I'd have got more exercise vacuuming.  If you're looking for a worthwhile workout video find the original Buns of Steel at your local Half Price Books or order the VHS here online.  Now after that one you'll feel the burn AND lose inches!! :)",1293494400,3,906,4.363095238095238
3611861,4,B001GJOL5Y,"This video allows you to choose the length of your workout. It is split in to various sections, so you can choose how much you want to do. The instructor is pleasant and explains the exercises well.",1290816000,2,198,4.378378378378378
3611862,2,B001GJOL5Y,"I have not had a gym membership for over a decade.  Because I have small children I excercise in my home only.  I have used countless workout videos and I really work hard at getting the most out of them.  After using this video I wasn't even sore.  It was too easy.  I didn't feel like I got a good workout from it.  However, this video may work for someone who has never worked out.  I'm not in EXTREMELY great shape but I am in good shape and I am in my 30s.",1279238400,2,461,3.89247311827957
3611863,5,B001GJOL5Y,This is a great workout and the segments are divided up into 5-15 minute sessions. It's perfect for when I don't have much time. I can always pick more than one if I have more time.,1254355200,,181,4.055555555555555
3611864,1,B001GJOL5Y,"This DVD was really a disappointment.  I have been missing my old Buns of Steel VHS tape workout, and thought that this would have been a good substitute.  However, I didn't find it with this workout.  Routines are overly simple, and didn't give me anywhere near the burn feeling that I used to get with the old workout tape.  I think this workout was really designed for people who do little to no exercise and are couch-bound!",1245283200,16,428,4.51948051948052

I find this workout  very good,  you can sellect the type of exercise  you want to do.

in my opinion all are very good, easy  and  no special equipment needed.

I am just waiting  to get  the new DVD arms  of steel.

Congrats for this Item.

3611866,2,B001GJOL5Y,"I don't really like this DVD because the workouts aren't very good. They do one thing and stretch, then another move and stretch. I'm not in great shape, but I have never been sore after doing this DVD. I also can't stand to do more than one 10 min workout because I fill like all I do is stretch and cool down.",1241049600,3,311,4.032258064516129
3611867,3,B001GJOL5Y,"I read so many great reviews about this video that I was pretty excited about it whipping my *** into shape. It's still a good video but I was disappointed to discover how low key it is. I'm not an avid exerciser (haven't hit the gym in... 5 months?) but I basically end up spending the whole video making up my own variations to make it more intense. On the positive side, its segmented style makes it great if you only have 5 or 10 minutes to spend on your buns but if you want to do more or even the whole thing, the segments get annoying. They stop and do stretching and cool down for a few minutes in each segment and then it takes 30 seconds to switch to the next segment and you start all over again.",1240617600,19,707,4.057142857142857
3611868,4,B001GJOL5Y,It is a good tape but I am not sure yet how well it will work.  Some of the moves are difficult and I am not sure if I am doing them correctly.,1240531200,,143,3.3333333333333335
