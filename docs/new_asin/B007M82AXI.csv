8519481,3,B007M82AXI,"Alcoholic street vendor Apple Annie has secretly supported her daughters education and travel from a distance, with her daughter believing her mother was a wealthy woman of prominence. When her daughter returns from Europe with her aristocratic fiancee and his father to meet her mother, the street people pull together to pull off a major ruse. Bette Davis shines, as usual, and this is an early movie for Ann Margret. [Those are the highlights.] The plot is based on a Damon Runyon story, and the Runyonesque characters are colorful. If you're a fan of Runyon, you will probably like this film, but its too long-winded and hokey for contemporary viewers.",1491696000,,656,4.972727272727273
