4241527,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Well put together documentary-one of my instant favorites. This tugged at my heart to see brothers torn apart by circumstances beyond their control. A Laker fan but more of a basketball fan, I've found new love and respect for Vlade Divac. As humans we are all infallable and it was sad to see that they were unable to reconcile prior to Drazen's untimely death. It was touching to see that Drazen's family welcomed in Vlade to allow him to find closure to the situation. Great job ESPN!",1287014400,11,487,4.609195402298851
4241528,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Being born in the balkans, this was one of the hardest documentaries to watch. I grew up listening to my dad talking of these men, how they lifted the yugoslavian team to gold medals multiple times. I never thought much of it until i watched this, a tear wrenching movie. Really shows the ""golden"" days of yugoslavia, and what could have been.",1286928000,8,343,4.548387096774194
4241529,4,B0040ZN9MM,"In my opinion, this is very good documentary but not excellent. I expected a little more footage of Drazen but I am delighted to see some rare footage of him, especially from Trail Blazers training. It is very emotional documentary.
I was 11 years old when Drazen died. I knew absolutely nothing about basketball back then. When he died that was a complete shock to me. I said to myself: ""I will start covering basketball because of him. And I did.""",1286928000,,449,4.555555555555555
4241530,5,B0040ZN9MM,This was an excellent documentary.  It is very emotional for not just Croatians but all fans of Drazen Petrovic to watch.,1286928000,7,121,4.761904761904762
4241531,5,B0040ZN9MM,"I just wanted this program on ESPN.  My husband, a basketball fan, loved the documentary.  He found it thought provoking and insightful.  I am a 7th grade social studies teacher who is always looking for new ways to teach geography and history.  I hope to use clips to educate my students about the concept of nationalism and the history of Eastern Europe.",1286841600,3,356,4.693548387096774
4241532,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Vlade is just so real in this film. His narration is perfect for the film and the story is both as gripping as it is tragic. His emotion and sorrow is palpable as he takes you through his youth. I really love that he reconciles his own pain through telling his own son his story.

You need to see this film. Easily one of, if not the most well-made 30 for 30.",1402531200,,359,3.986111111111111
4241533,5,B0040ZN9MM,This dvd sure brought some memories. I cried like a baby watching it. Highly recommended to everyone with interest in European basketball as well as NBA,1397520000,,152,4.884615384615385
4241534,5,B0040ZN9MM,"I love the NBA but this DVD is more about people, war and what it can do to you. This is one of the best 30 for 30 i have seen.",1369440000,3,127,3.129032258064516
4241535,5,B0040ZN9MM,Got this for my brother he loved it and I had seen it as well.  Its one of the more interesting documentaries.,1366675200,,110,4.0
4241536,5,B0040ZN9MM,"This story is an incredible one told by a former NBA player who was never able to mend fences with his close friend before his friend died in a tragic auto accident. They grew up together playing for Yugoslavia, when the country was unified under one central government, then both opted for the NBA draft in the U.S. When communism fell, and the (6) republics decided to become independent, civil war broke out, dividing the country. This political and bloody confrontation/partition lasted almost the entire decade, and the once-proud Yugoslav national basketball team was broken up, divided and never able to overcome what their country had created. This true story is sad, but redeeming and is probably the best documentary I've seen from ESPN's 30-for-30 series of films. I recommend this DVD highly.",1362787200,,804,5.052631578947368
4241537,5,B0040ZN9MM,"I am 33 years old, grew up in NJ a die hard Nets fan in the early 90s, and will never forget the day Drazen died. Watching him play in person back then, I'll never forget the absolute joy he brought to the court. The day he died was unbelievably tragic. This documentary tells his story better than I could have ever imagined. Vlade does an amzing job narrating and telling their story together, and I'm not ashamed to admit I am brought to tears everytime I watch this. It is quite simply one of the greatest documentaries ever made. And it's so much bigger than basketball too. This is about what it is to be human...the good in us and the bad, smiles and tears, guilt, elation, stubborness, obsurdity, love, fear.....everything. It's all of us. I could not recommend you watch this enough. It will literally make you a better human being (I seriously mean that). I'd give it a million stars if I could.",1362528000,3,905,4.457831325301205
4241538,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Great production and images, unforgettable human history. Divac's trip to Croatia it's amazing and incredible. But, i miss spanish subtitles.",1358726400,,141,6.1
4241539,5,B0040ZN9MM,"If you're a basketball fan, you'll love this documentary because of some of the amazing rare footage it contains (e.g., clips of the Yugoslavian National Team playing in an exhibition against Larry Bird's Boston Celtics; footage of Magic Johnson and Vlade doing a commercial together and then talking at practice about Drazen; etc.), and because it will make you remember how good Drazen really was.  If you're not a basketball fan -- not even a little bit -- you'll still enjoy this documentary.

Narrated by Vlade Divac, Once Brothers is the story of the friendship between Vlade, a Serbian, and Drazen Petrovic, a Croatian, that was immediately severed when the two countries went to war with each other.  Vlade tells the story of him and Drazen and of the Yugoslavian national team.  He tells the story as he embarks on a journey to come to grips with the untimely death of his former friend who he was never able to reconcile with. He travels first to his parents house in Serbia, and then to the gym where the national team used to practice to meet another Serbian member of that team, and then to Drazen's mother's house, and finally to Drazen's grave, where he pays his respects.  The shots of the country are beautiful as he drives through the snow.  And the music is amazing.  Joel Goodman did the score to this documentary, and it is excellent.

I've probably watched this documentary 20 times now.  I kept it on my DVR for nearly a year, and it would still be there if I hadn't had to swap out that DVR with a replacement box.  And now, after writing this, I would like to watch it again.  It really is that good, and I would recommend it to anyone.",1358467200,,1661,4.540268456375839
4241540,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Another 5 star film from ESPN. I didn't know much about this topic other than that Vlade Divac was a very good center who played for the Lakers and Sacremento and that Petrovic died young. The breaking of the friendship between Divac and Petrovic due to a single incident amidst the political upheavals in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Croatia at the time, is show here as a palpable and sudden event where Divac's passions ruled and he was not forgiven for a stupid, rash and unthinking act. The things that struck me - Divac's engaging personality, the warmth of Petrovic's family and friends Kukic and Radja, the winter background of Serbia, Croatia, how Divac was shunned when he returned to visit Zagreb, and the raw talent of the Yugoslav national team of the early 90's. I wish more of the personnages had been identified earlier and more consistently. It wasn't clear who was who at first. Very touching. 5 stars.",1338681600,,914,4.754716981132075
4241541,5,B0040ZN9MM,I would recommened this to anyone; you don't even need to be a basketball fan to enjoy and appreciate this amazing documentary. It's very touching and hard to beleive Vlade lived with this all these years and no one knew.,1332720000,2,221,4.55
4241542,5,B0040ZN9MM,"This has to be the most touching basketball movie ever made. Witness how moving to America changes a young boy grown up in communist Yugoslavia, who could be happy with the simplest things in life. Also, how a civil war tears up countries and breaks up friendships. So many lessons to be taken from this movie. Kudos to the people who made it happen..",1317081600,,351,4.5
4241543,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Kudos to NBA Entertainment for such a great idea for a film and for pulling it off so brilliantly.  The emotional wallop of 'Once Brothers' surprised me.  I knew of the great tragedy of Drazen Petrovic's early, shocking death right as he was on the cusp of NBA super-stardom.  I also knew of the great Yugoslavian teams of the late Eighties culminating in 1990's World Championship.  I also knew that the Balkan conflicts ripped the team apart.

What I did not know - and what this film focuses on - is how deeply that conflict forever ruptured these teammates.  Once brothers, these players - a team comprised of individuals from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia - became divided along state and ethic lines.  The dual axis of the team revolved around the stars: Croatian Petrovic and Serbian Divac.  A single flashpoint incident - Divac ripping a Croatian flag out of a celebrant's hands after the championship - became the tinder for the split between the two men.  Divac swears to this day that his actions were misinterpreted: that he did it because it was a Yugoslavian triumph, not a time for state partisanship.  No matter, the action was taken by Petrovic (and many others) in a far different light.

Divac's regret - that Petrovic died before the two of them could reconcile - is palpable.  It's his narration - he's the film's guide in the US, Serbia...and, most stirringly, in Croatia - that guides us throughout.  Think you don't care one way or another about Vlade Divac?  Think again.  You'll have a completely different opinion after seeing this film.  His likable personality and genuine regret and remorse are what make this excellent film work.  And the last scene?  I defy you not to be impacted by it.",1310169600,4,1726,4.754208754208754
4241544,5,B0040ZN9MM,"THIS documentary is NOT really about basketball bur rather about relationships.  Like the other great ""sports"" movies, that just use the sport itself as a vehicle to deliver the story.  These two guys could have been brought together by....oh....their love of root beer.  It is a well delivered documentary, that tells the story of love and passion broken by politics and horrible violent war and hate.  Beautiful.......... and......... oh  bring tissues.  One thing that most impressed me was the warmth and gentleness displayed by Magic Johnson.  I am NOT a basketball fan nor a Magic Johnson fan.  In fact until Magic was found to be HIV positive i never knew anything about him but his name.  WOW what a great guy and how he received and helped his new team mate from half way around the world.  That is how you can tell Magic was a real talent.  He did not have to feel threatened, but rather, did everything in his power to make his new team mate feel welcome and successful in a new country.  GOOD STUFF ALL THE WAY AROUND.",1307750400,,1030,4.5989010989010985

4241546,5,B0040ZN9MM,"Being from Macedonia and having lived in Serbia, this movie has truly found its way in my heart. Its the typical story of how two guys from small cities through honest work end up living the American dream. However, what makes this movie very emotionally grasping is that you wanna feel ecstatically happy however you can't due to the course of tragedies which unveil by the end of the movie. I recommend it to EVERYONE, especially those who love sports and those who are from small cities and want to make it big.",1300147200,,514,4.537634408602151

4241549,5,B0040ZN9MM,"For those of us that lived through that period, and lost a friendship because of it ( as I did), one can't help but well-up. Kukoc, Dino, and Vlade all stand out as fantastic human-beings. Kukoc made the statement that the Yugoslav team of 1990 could have very well been the best in the world. Tough to argue against his assertation.",1291420800,,333,4.475409836065574
4241550,5,B0040ZN9MM,"I live in Oregon and am a Lakers fan so very familiar with Vlade as well as Petro..
Petro was a great ball player that died to young..
Very very sad that the two never got to bury the hatchet..
You can't help but feel for Vlade and the burden he carried all these years.
You could almost see the relief on his face when we was talking to Petro's family..
But beyond that, such a sad story of what might have been not only for Petro but the
Yugoslavian Basketball team.. They would have given the Dream Team a run for there
money in Barcelona..

Very Powerful a must watch for all..",1288051200,,581,4.1415929203539825
4241551,5,B0040ZN9MM,"It's amazing that such petty nationalistic feelings could divide that friendship, but that's the underlying problem that led to the tragic breakup of Yugoslavia.  Vlade is a warm, outgoing person and it was heartwarming to see him rise above that and bridge that gap to Drazen's family.  Zhivio!",1287446400,2,295,5.125
