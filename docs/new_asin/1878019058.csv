7901687,5,1878019058,"On this tribute-like video we see Nisargadatta giving some discources with students. We get to see brief clips of the Master in action. Although the footage of Nisargadatta is quite limited and of modest quality the filmakers make up for it with great, sincere tributes by his former students.
Nisargadatta never actually speaks into the camera or gets interviewed in any sense of the word. It's just a few moments here and there of him teaching that they captured on film that we get to see.. The video consists mainly of former students speaking about their experiences with the revered master-similar to ""A&E Biography. Some of them are: Jean Dunn, Jack Kornfield, Robert Powell and Stephan Wolinsky to name a few.  Even though we don't really get to see long discources with Nisargadatta Maharaj, we do get to hear voice overs of his teachings throughout the video.  The essence of Maharaj's powerful teachings are adaquetely expressed here, leaving the seeker with the Master's teachings to meditate and ponder on.
Very Proufound.",1069718400,8,1035,5.046783625730995
7901688,5,1878019058,"Nisargadatta was one of the most profound teachers of the modern era and he ranks with the great ones of the past.  His teaching is at a very high level while simple and direct.  He says more in a few words than most do in a book.  Home movie shots of Nisargadatta capture the spirit and dynamism of his delivery.  There is a real feel to this video.  He speaks no English but there is abundant translation.  Commentary by followers is not of star quality but is sincere, and taken together their personal perspectives bring out a more complete view of the man. Also order his book ""I Am that"" - It is loaded.",991440000,14,609,4.298245614035087
