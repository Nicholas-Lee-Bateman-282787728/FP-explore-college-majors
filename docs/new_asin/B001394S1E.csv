4239071,4,B001394S1E,"When actresses of a certain caliber and age reach a certain level of potential bankability and critical respect, it appears inevitable that they do a standard-issue Hollywood romantic comedy. Talent becomes a less critical factor in these casting selections. Early last year, Amy Adams did one between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doubt/dp/B001PA0FFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doubt</a>&nbsp;and The Fighter, a silly one set in Ireland called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leap-Year/dp/B0038N9X3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leap Year</a>, and now it's Natalie Portman's turn. This 2011 film has a more provocative premise and a snappier tone, but the sensibilities are still very much in rom-com territory. As written by first-time screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by industry veteran Ivan Reitman (whose last film was the overdone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Super-Ex-Girlfriend/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>), the movie deftly asks a less than earth-shattering question: can two friends sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship without any emotional expectations? In an age when text messaging makes anyone instantly available, the answer naturally looks to be yes, but Hollywood convention intervenes.

Set conveniently in LA, the plot centers on the friendship between Emma, an overworked medical resident, and Adam, an overlooked production assistant on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical</a>-type show who longs to be a writer. Moving fleetly from summer camp to a frat party to an accidental run-in at an outdoor market, they definitely have a connection but never act upon it. In the meantime, their personalities take shape as adults nearing thirty. She is an unromantic pragmatist who has convinced herself that she doesn't need a relationship to have sex, while he is a pushover whose airheaded girlfriend dumps him for his father, a self-infatuated former sitcom TV celebrity. After an all-night drunken binge lands a naked Adam in Emma's apartment, she proposes they take advantage of their mutual attraction and start a purely physical relationship with no expectation of commitment. She's in charge, and he agrees to play along. Needless to say, both start to have feelings that pull them in predictable directions with Adam also dealing with his unresolved anger toward his father. There is no real tension to the central dilemma since we all know how the movie will end, especially with stars as attractive and laid-back as Portman and Ashton Kutcher playing the leads.

What I do like is how Portman doesn't subterfuge her own sensibilities as an actress to play Emma within formula. She plays a workaholic but on her terms as a sensible professional who needs to manage her schedule carefully. Unlike rom-com contemporaries like Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway or Kristin Bell, Portman comes across as too smart to go through much humiliating shtick to get her inevitable comeuppance beyond devouring a box of donut holes. Even though Kutcher has more experience in this genre, he comes across a bit more substantive this time around and shows a natural rapport with Portman that makes the movie breeze along with aplomb. A solid supporting cast helps with Greta Gerwig (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greenberg/dp/B002ZG97T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greenberg</a>) and Mindy Kaling (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B002N5N5SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>) as Emma's sharp-tongued roommates; Lake Bell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Complicated/dp/B0038N9WKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Complicated</a>) as Adam's dithering, sweet-natured associate; Jake Johnson and a low-key Ludacris as his horndog buddies; and Kevin Kline as his vainglorious father. I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes as the veteran doctor whom Emma fawns over. Special mention should go to Rogier Stoffers whose bright-colored cinematography brings contemporary LA to vivid life.",1295740800,9,4342,6.7656529516994635
4239072,5,B001394S1E,Saw it in the theaters and laughed the whole time. It's a youthful sex-filled movie with comedic relief throughout the whole movie. The leads Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman have great on-screen chemistry and handled the roles well. I fully intend to purchase the DVD as soon as it is released! Go see it!!!,1295740800,6,310,4.7592592592592595
4239073,4,B001394S1E,"What ""No Strings Attached"" lacks in originality and unpredictability is made up for in the charm and likeability of its leads. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman not only have great onscreen chemistry, they also are individually well developed - at least, as well developed as they can be within the boundaries of a romantic comedy. It's also surprisingly funny, although it's only partly because of the well placed raunchy sex jokes; the film is one of the few recent romantic comedies to successfully find that balance between sweetness and silliness, and while that's only moderate praise for writer Elizabeth Meriwether and director Ivan Reitman, at least it's proof that they know how to take innately ridiculous material and make it accessible to general audiences.

The film is not realistic in any way, shape, or form, but that's just stating the obvious because we don't go to movies like this looking for meaning or truth. It tells the story of Adam and Emma (Kutcher and Portman), who first met as teenagers in summer camp and saw each other off and on over the next several years. In the present day, they live in Los Angeles, Adam an assistant on a TV series that crosses ""Glee"" with ""High School Musical,"" Emma a doctor at UCLA. They have successfully maintained a friendship, although there's always a flash of jealousy whenever one of them shows up with a significant other. When Adam's girlfriend dumps him for his father (Kevin Kline), he goes on a bender, makes several phone calls to women he knows ... and wakes up in Emma's apartment, naked and surrounded by Emma's friends and fellow residents.

No sex took place the night before. The morning after, however, Adam and Emma suddenly drop their defenses and just go for it. That's when they decide to take a stab at being friends with benefits; they will use each other for sex at any time of the day, but they won't commit to anything long-term. Surprisingly, this comes at the insistence of Emma, who for reasons left a little obscure is frightened by serious relationships. This is made clear in her habit of texting Adam rather than seeing him in person, a trend that has become all too real in today's smart phone society. I'll stop short of saying this movie is sending a message about technology limiting social interaction, although there are hints of it all throughout.

No more of the plot needs to be described. It goes through the motions and ends exactly the way we expect it to end. There are, however, a couple of side characters that deserve to be mentioned. One of the best is Adam's on-set colleague, Lucy (Lake Bell), who's deeply neurotic and talks at a hundred miles an hour. Making this kind of character likeable is next to impossible, and yet Bell pulls it off, probably because she understood that there's a fine line between comedy relief and annoyance. And then there are Adam's best friends, played by Chris Bridges and Jake Johnson; they aren't given all that much to do, but you can count on them for a few good male-oriented one-liners. Kline is somewhat underutilized as Adam's father, a former TV star who does drugs as if it was the 1970s and has a thing for much younger women. He's mostly just a counterpoint to his son, a way for the audience to see what Adam should not do when it comes to meeting and loving the opposite sex.

One of the film's funniest scenes is in Emma's apartment, where she and her girlfriends - along with one gay man - spend the night together in the throes of menstrual agony. Knowing they're all on the same cycle, Adam stops by with a box full of cupcakes. He also gives Emma a period-specific mix CD, with titles I probably can't repeat for the purposes of this review. There's also a moment when Emma gives Adam a Valentine's Day card, which reads, ""You give me premature ventricular contractions."" I laughed hard. But then again, I was raised by registered nurses who specialized in cardiology, so I probably have an unfair advantage.

Reitman made the right choices in the casting of Kutcher and Portman, for they have that compatibility movies like this require. Kutcher is especially enjoyable and plays what may be the warmest, most caring role of his entire career. Portman is also a natural fit for this movie, which is surprising given her latest stint as a mentally ill ballerina; it's good for even the most dedicated and serious of actors to reveal that they do in fact have a sense of humor. ""No Strings Attached"" is by no means a great movie, and it will never be in the same league as ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Ghostbusters II,"" my two favorite Reitman comedies. But if you're in the mood for a conventional lightweight romantic comedy, this movie gets the job done nicely.",1295568000,108,4720,4.702539298669891
4239074,3,B001394S1E,"Sadly, ""No Strings Attached"" does not live up to it's poster or the well-edited trailer. The second poster that was released for the film is flirty, fun, and exudes control. The film is nothing like the poster - there's chemistry between the leads but the plot is full of nonsensical boy-meets-girl, girl-doesn't-want-to-get-hurt-so-rejects-boy, stereotypes. Instead of being a commentary on the reversal of gender roles in relationships, the film abides by the conventional rules.

Furthermore, the jokes are thin and, frankly, the best ones can be seen in the spectacular trailer.

Still, spending an hour and a half looking at two gorgeous people like Ashton Kutcher (who exemplifies his pretty boy image, but doesn't strain his acting muscles) and Natalie Portman (who is pitch perfect in her portrayal of a strong, sexy, yet vulnerable woman, who is as far from her Black Swan character as one can get) is hardly a bad way to pass the time.",1295568000,5,945,5.051282051282051
4239075,5,B001394S1E,"this is a tight, lean, powerful film with cool characters, an interesting plot, perfect pacing and a great ending. there are no silly distractions here like you would see in a michael bay film... you get a completely developed concept and story with characters that are flesh and blood... not just skeletons walking around saying the same things we have seen in hundreds of movies. wonderfully executed low budget film that hopefully will not get lost in the onslaught of horribly executed big budget nightmares. two thumbs up (wish i had a third thumb.)",1203811200,2,554,4.904255319148936

Pitt, the main guy played by Richard Scott, is someone I can totally identify with. I feel like I grew up with him. He and his friends seem to live just on the outskirts of society. Except, unlike me he stands up to the bad guys. He's got a strength I wish I had. But he kills everyone, and I still like him.

In the end all works out. Reminiscent of True Romance, without the love. You should watch this movie. It's movie making and story telling without the fancy (and waste of budget) CGI. Highly recommended.",1201824000,3,701,4.303030303030303

Hmmmmm.....I may lower my starts for just watching it once.  I was basing my review on a couple of viewing times.  Does anyone know the answer?
Sexy little Rom Com.  Not embarrassed to say I very much liked seeing Ashton in Action.  Okay, maybe a little embarrassed. Cute story.

Even watching the movie had as many surprises as doctors and those who work incredible hours to become doctors worry so much about maintaining a professional bedside manner. I wanted to see all the deleted scenes. One of the deleted scenes works as a music video dance routine. There was so much tension about who wrote that? in the movie that the performers kissing at the end did not seem as exciting the first time I saw it. Compared to this movie, strategies of avoidance seem to be the conscious mind trying to suppress the unconscious desires people that maintain any social order try to suppress.

4239263,2,B001394S1E,"I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a ""sex only - no strings attached"" common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.

The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since ""Ghostbusters"" in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.

The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...

I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in ""Butterfly Effect"", ""The Guardian"", ""My boss's daughter"" and ""A lot like love"") and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of ""Notting Hill"", ""While you were sleeping"", ""When Harry meets Sally"" or ""Must love dogs"" - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of ""A lot like love"" (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!",1420761600,3,1977,4.64

4239265,4,B001394S1E,"Another Razor Bay, Washington book that focuses on Tasha Riordan, the pizzeria owner and Luc Bradshaw, half-brother to the other Bradshaw boys. Tasha and Luc first met seven years ago when she took a much sought-after vacation to the Bahamas and had what she thought was a vacation fling, only to find herself in jail for two days, accused of drug dealing after Luc deserts her.

When she encounters him again, she's furious. Not only did he lie to her (she never knew he was and undercover DEA agent), but he never returned, though he'd promised he would. He is surprised at her reaction until he learns she'd been in jail for two days, something his supervising agent seems to know something about, but never revealed.

Only Tasha's life at the pizzeria seems to be going well. She mentors a rich-girl-soon-to-be-poor after her parents' impending divorce and a boy recently housed at a group home and their closeness becomes a teen counterpoint to the developing relationship of Tasha and Luc, whose sexual tension they can't seem to ignore. But Tasha wants a home and family and she knows Luc will leave for danger zones for months at a time. Not her idea of home and family. Luc is having second thoughts about leaving his brothers and the family they represent and Tasha, whom he now acknowledges is more than just a vacation fling. But Tasha doesn't know how he feels, nor has she accepted that she loves him. Will he? Can she? When will each of them come clean with how they really feel?",1420243200,,1494,4.65530303030303

The girl next door and the hunka hunka leading man, mixed with the two best friends and their racially or sexually related issues so that no one feels left out, the heartbreak, the love, the sex, and everything else in between that allow it to be as close to reality as Hollywood gets. I do love this movie! What can I say? If anything, watch it for the pretty, clean colors. It's a weird, sometimes overused, plot but it gets the job done when you are looking for something simple and refreshing with a bit of feeling. Enjoy!",1399593600,2,590,4.372727272727273
4239323,3,B001394S1E,"Honestly, I watched this to get some insights into the mind of Liz Meriwether who also created the show New Girl.  However, being that this is a movie the other is a TV show it's really hard to compare.  In any case, it was a decent Rom-Com.  I wouldn't say it was the best I ever saw but it wasn't bad.  The one line at the end from Ashton Kutcher's character was sweet and sort of made the movie.  I got frustrated with the Natalie Portman character who just seemed like the typical ""I can have meaningless sex"" female.  Somehow media always makes it seem like these type of women are so totally evolved and somehow smarter than other woman who feel sex is a little more important.  Anyway, it was okay and sort of cute.  I love Jake Johnson and he made it worth it too.",1399161600,,772,4.204081632653061

No stings attached and i fell right on to the ground as the movie was so boring that i had to switch my bedrooms light on to prevent me of not sleeping whilst watching it. The lead paid Ashton and Natalie had no chemistry whatsoever there was just no connection between them. Natalie's character was left incomplete i was failed to connect with her character why didn't she want a committed relationship??? The biggest fall out is that there's no humor the movie was just emotionless No Acting. SO SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS DISASTER MOVIE AND WATCH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS INSTEAD.

4239349,2,B001394S1E,"This film should succeed better than it does. Both Portman and Kutchner can be enchanting when provided with the right comic script, the right director, and the right film editor. To be sure, there are scenes of amusing potential. In one of them, when Kutchner wakes up--in someone elses apartment with no memory of the previous nights events--he tries to determine, by questioning everyone who passes through the room (both male and female), if that person had been his bedmate. Such a scene can be very funny indeed. But in this one, all four actors are restrained by uncertain, cautious, self-conscious direction and tedious editing.

Fraternity jokes about straight sex (Can I finger you?) and gay sex (I hear they're tunnel buddies) don't belong in romantic comedy. The film is packed with them. No Strings Attached seems more like a second-year film-school assignment than a Hollywood movie. The actors must have been embarrassed to watch it, if they watched it at all.",1386028800,,975,5.018518518518518

Rated R so not for kids.",1376524800,,261,4.954545454545454

4239369,5,B001394S1E,"Unlike most other movies of this genre, I could actually identify with the the relationship between romantic leads Natalie Portman and Ashton Kushner.  The craziness and the intensity of their feelings and beliefs, regarding what a relationship (or non-relationship) should be, actually rang true to me.  People do crazy things when they are strongly attracted to one another--whether you are the person like Kushner who tries to frantically push the relationship forward, or the person like Portman who refuses to even consider the possibility that something special is happening.  Both parties, are, in point of fact, terrified that this thing will follow a different course than the one to which they are currently committed.

For me, a very large and essential part of the appeal of this movie is that I could actually FEEL the intensity of the attraction between the characters played by Portman and Kushner!

I was particularly taken by one scene in which Portman begins to realize how much she cares for Kushner.  As you would expect for someone who has strong emotions, her description of her feelings for Kushner are often incoherent.  I really loved it that she begin this outpouring of her feelings by exclaiming ""He's so tall!""",1374364800,,1239,5.073891625615763

It's not great like the old movies were, but compared to modern movies, it's ok.  ""No strings attached"", the euphemism, is all you really need to know.

4239436,3,B001394S1E,Ashton Kutcher is not really the best of actors - but I love Natalie Portman.  It was good light-hearted rom-com.  Its got its funny moments.  Although Ashton Kutcher's friends in the movie were totally wasted.  I would have liked to see more from the two of them.  Same with the actors that were Natalie Portman (including Mindy Kaling - totally wasted in this movie).,1366848000,,369,4.703125

Just look at the cover and imagine the most predictable ending... You're right! It ends just like that. The most surprising thing about it is just how likable Ashton Kutcher is.

More hanging out and doing things together.  Woman had similar rules and behavior to Female character, and I couldn't understand and still don't really her hang ups.

4239457,4,B001394S1E,"Cute.  Rolls reversed.  Woman doesn't want the commitment and man does.  Good cast.  Not always plausable, but cute.  Not sure if it would be a date movie or not.",1365897600,,162,4.448275862068965
4239458,5,B001394S1E,"I absolutely believe ""No Strings Attached"" is destined to become one of the real classic that will endure the test of time... like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc.... but it's got just enough ""drama"" and ""heart"" to make it different and, I think, better.

Make sure that when you watch it you can be completely focused on it, volume up with no distractions, or you'll miss out on half of the fun.  That's because half of the great dialog is contained in the sort of understated and/or ""background"" comments made by the various characters.  Although I'm not really an Ashton Kutcher fan, he really does a great job here.  I also think Natalie Portman was the absolutely perfect choice for her part as well... her acting perfectly portraying the feelings and emotions of her character.

I've now watched this movie about a half-dozen times, sharing it with in-home audiences ranging from a ""significant other"", to my 50- and 60-something female friends, to my 20-something sons and one of their girlfriends, and everyone who's seen it has laughed through it and loved it.

In my mind, it's already a classic!",1365897600,,1117,4.821989528795812

4239462,4,B001394S1E,"Funny romantic comedy, good for couples, friends, basically anybody who wants a laugh. Ive had issues with the BluRay since day one. I put the disc in my BluRay player & it doesnt do anything, it looks like its loading but never does. I checked the disc, it's not scratched, I immediately tried other BluRay discs in my player & they worked, I even tried playing it on another BluRay player to no avail; clearly it's this one particular BluRay disc. The good news - it comes with both DVD & BluRay, so at least Im not hooped, however, I would've preferred to watch the BluRay, obviously.
The Movie: I enjoyed it, it was funny, clever & the chemistry between Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher was great. I much preferred this to Friends with Benefits for many different reasons, one being the comedy factor but mainly because I didn't see the chemistry between Justin Timberlake & Mila Kunis, whereas I did see chemistry in No Strings Attached, maybe its just me.
Overall: Besides the issues with the BluRay copy I received its good, I just won't watch it in HD, at least its not some major flick with all sorts of great cinematography.",1365724800,,1134,4.5911330049261085

Natalie Portman does a good job playing her character.  However, this is NOT great cinema.  It's entertainment.  And if you are a bit on the conservative side and think pre-marital, casual sex and foul language are turn-offs then DON'T watch it.",1365465600,,393,4.720588235294118

Do not waste your money.",1365292800,,328,4.45

The acting was well done and made some of the situations really come alive (and hit a little too close to home too).  I wouldn't own it, or see any reason to re-watch it anytime soon.  However I'm glad I finally saw it.  If it was on TV sometime in the future and I was couch-potato'ing I wouldn't turn it off either.",1365206400,,423,4.048192771084337

The obvious story here is that it's not going to be possible to have a purely sexual relationship without any attached feelings, and we go into the story hoping for that redemptive lesson to come through. It finally does, but not until a lot of crude and lewd and nasty dialogue and visuals have taken place. And when the lesson is learned at the end, it's half-hearted.
Just makes me depressed about how people view sex and relationships. So casual. So selfish. And we wonder why our culture is riddled with divorce and so many of us suffer from feelings of isolation and low self-worth.",1362355200,,688,4.694214876033058

I give most movies a chance - at least in the beginning, however, and only watched this in it's entirity due to the soundtrack grabbing me early on, especially after hearing Bishop Allen (click click click). I'm glad I gave it a chance, it's pretty funny and Ashton is at his very cutest. Highly recommend. Giving four instead of five stars because I find female lead annoyingly cute. Prefer the working woman digging on Ashtons character, and was secretly rooting for her.

When things get close, girl rejects boy. Boy starts dating others. Girl realizes she actually loves him and has to be his one and only.

The premise makes a sideways glance at the idea of friends with benefits -- relationships that say a couple can have sex without all the traditional levels of commitment, but does nothing to explore the idea.

Likewise, the story does little to add any depth to the old fashioned romance story it actually is.

Low marks for innovation, low marks for elegance in retelling a timeworn stereotype.

Add to that, the male lead has no charisma and his character has few elements to make him interesting. A little character depth for both the boy and the girl character would have added a lot.

Oh well.

4239703,2,B001394S1E,"One of the highest rated films of all times is ""Casablanca"", a romantic film set in wartime.  As in literature, Romance and all its entanglements and disasters make up a good portion of Hollywood's output.  Yet, when it's paired with comedy, while a few classics are produced (""Bringing Up Baby"" comes to mind) most of the genre is pretty fluffball, rarely earning critical respect even with the passage of time.  ""No Strings Attached"" is not going to end up on one of the better lists of All Time Movies.

""No Strings Attached"" as the billboards and cover imply, has tried to up the ante with Sex and near nudity, but the film remains nothing more than sweet entertainment, albeit for a more sex-tolerant crowd.  It's a dead ringer for ""Friends With Benefits"", at almost every point, and the fact that the leading men in both films, Ashton Kucher in this one and Justin Timberlake in the other, are men who make the heart flutter but get almost no  respect, is just one more parallel.  If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen the other, but if you're in a funk and need diversionary entertainment, yet can't stand the thought of ""Mama Mia""; streaming both films back to back is your corn-syrup-laden box of Mac n Cheese.  Mac n Cheese with real  bacon, because all four of the main actors are simply delightful when spared the antics of the wardrobe department.

Oddly enough, with all the nudity and simulated sex, neither film is the least bit erotic.  Your evangelical relatives will never believe you, but what do they know?

Basically, the two main characters are introduced at Camp, bump up against each other in College, and finally find themselves in LaLa land as adults; she's finishing med school, and he's an aspiring writer with a famous dad whose shadow he finds diffiicult to escape.  But, he does have that which many new grads won't, these days:  A swank, designer-made house, a BMW, and a job.

In any case, she has commitment issues, mother oriented as it turns out,  and thus they agree to be Sex Friends, something which seems to puzzle everyone they know in Los Angeles, but would be so 2011 in San Francisco.  In effect,  they have a relationship a lot of gay men have, with pregnancy not being an issue; lots of sex with no entanglement.

Except that they get entangled.  That's not as bad as it would seem:  Seventy years ago such ""loose"" women had to be punished, and usually Hollywood killed them, or in some other way wrote them into purgatory by the end of the film.  And it was always the women.  It's still the women. The guys here are exactly what they tell us women want, but these women don't want them.

Ah well.  If you keep eating that mac n cheese you're going to die.  If you expect to find deep meaning in Romantic Comedies, well you're still going to die, but from something that pops up while you're distracted.

4239708,3,B001394S1E,"The friend I was staying with this weekend, who I shall call R, encourages my worst pop culture impulses. Or perhaps I encourage hers. Either way, we decided we needed to view a double billing of No Strings Attached and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends-With-Benefits/dp/B00650SSDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends With Benefits</a>.

All four lead actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake) were charming. Portman's Emma was my favorite character. She's brilliant, driven, and the movie doesn't make her sacrifice her career for true love. Justin Timberlake's Dylan was probably my least favorite, for reasons explained later. Therefore, No Strings Attached wins the leads.

Both films have terrific supporting casts. I loved the side characters in No Strings Attached - Emma's neurotic med student roommates, Adam's friends with bad advice, coworker Lucy, and Kevin Kline as one of the worst parents ever. Then Friends with Benefits's came along with Woody Harrelson as a manly, openly gay coworker and Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father with Alzheimer's. Plus, there's tons of brilliant cameos. Friends with Benefits wins secondary characters.

Final category: story. In No Strings Attached, Emma and Adam have been casual acquaintances for years. After beginning a casual sex relationship, Adam clearly wants something more while Emma isn't ready to make an emotional commitment. While both of them come close to screwing things up, neither makes a truly awful mistake. Friends with Benefits's Dylan and Jaime become friends first, then decide to sleep together. They obviously become something more, but Dylan isn't ready to admit it - which causes him to say some very hurtful things about Jaime. She, of course, overhears them. That scene felt cliche and made me dislike Dylan, but overall Friends with Benefits was funnier, more realistic, and had a truer emotional core. Thus, Friends with Benefits wins, by a hair, the better storyline.

I slightly preferred No Strings Attached and R felt the same about Friends with Benefits. But both of us agree that if you're going to watch a 2011 romantic comedy, it should be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Stupid-Love/dp/B0060V1WJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>.

Can platonic friends be sex buddies without all the romantic entanglements?  Yeah, good luck with that.  Portman's character Emma is a medical student working an 80 hour week and looks to a friend she first knew when they were budding teenagers, to provide sexual release.  Adam (Ashton Kutcher) works on a TV series, obviously helped along the way by his famous actor dad played by Kevin Kline.  We certainly know where the movie is going to go, so how much fun is it getting there?  More than we might expect.  Portman and Kutcher work well together and push all the right buttons.  There is no question Portman adds a certain acting legitimacy to what is pretty much a cookie-cutter plot.  The movie is sexy and fun.  What's wrong with that?",1322611200,2,916,4.734177215189874

Also, whomever directed this movie needs to understand, no matter how bad a script is, if the actor can add depth to the voice and animate the face, it's more believe for the audience to ENJOY a the feature film. With that being said... this movie could have been better, it felt like the editing was rushed from how the scenes were cut as well. And there was so much naked'ness going on that it became a low budget porn (should of gotten the dreaded 'N-17' rating instead!). Natalie and Ashton didn't really hit the nail on the head with the sex scenes in making them lively. It fell too flat and was like watching two married people in their 80's having sex instead.

No matter how good looking an actor is, if they can't act for the role, it won't matter in the end.

These two actors can act, but this movie should of had two DIFFERENT leading actors who could be more vivid in their acting, like Justin and Mila in ""Friends with Benefits"". At least their faces were animated, they had chemistry, and they made the sex scenes VERY funny and easily watchable.

I mean Natalie was better in ""Thor"" than this movie and Ashton is more suited for physical comedy roles. So it's not their fault entirely that this movie was horrible, it was the casting directors and such who gave them the job for this movie.

(Also my theory is that Natalie probably did this movie as a last ditch effort before she had a kid, to feel free and sexy, instead of doing a good job on her acting...)",1322352000,7,1654,4.409836065573771

4239717,4,B001394S1E,"All romantic comedies follow the same plot thread. If you've seen on RomCom, you will be able to call out what will happen next in every other one: guy meets girl, they get together and have their romantic comedy, something happens to disrupt the relationship, they reunite before the end credits.

No Strings Attached follows this thread. Natalie Portman is fantastic. Is there a role that she cannot play exceptionally? Ashton Kutcher, on the other hand, plays the same exact character in every movie he's in.

They meet at camp as young kids and then hook up again as adults, agreeing only to have their relationship based on sex and no emotional attachment. As is the case for every Kutcher character, he falls in love with the girl and is the poster boy for charm and chivalry. Portman's Emma freaks out and it looks like the relationship has reached it end.

I will admit that I did chuckle a number of times during this movie. The humor feels real (most of the time) It does suffer from the cliched ""given"" scenes and lines of every romantic comedy but, when it's a date-night movie, these things can be overlooked.

Portman made this movie following her turn as The Black Swan so it feels like she did it to come down from the dreary world and relax into a mindless fun flick. Kutcher only wants to play the simple, every-woman's-dream in every film he's in.",1318896000,,1366,4.609053497942387

The scene with the 3 women moping around the house, pigging out on sweets, hanging around in pj's, and generally seeming miserable, only reinforces the stereotype that a woman's menstrual cycle is a time when she is non-functioning and feels miserable, which is far from the truth.  Women can basically do anything we normally do during this week and be happy about it.

Loved Kevin Kline (who, unfortunately, had only a few short scenes).

It did give a fairly accurate portrait of the sad way that young ppl interact these days, thru texting and sexing.  It is a good movie for cultural study, perhaps, but not definitely not for entertainment or to teach values.

Featuring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher this follows two characters called Emma and Adam as they try to have a relationship where they have plenty of sex, but don't fall in love. Emma, who has intimacy problems, finds this concept easier than Adam and that is when the problems start.

This has some decent jokes in it and it had me laughing out loud a few times. Both Portman and Kutcher play their roles well and you tend to feel their was genuine chemistry between them. Kevin Kline as Adams father also has some great lines and raises some laughs.

I loved the soundtrack, which features one of my favourite bands (The Temper Trap) and the songs match the scenes very well. The story was also quite good, with some great dialogue and it didn't feel overlong or tedious at any point.

All in all this made for just under two hours entertaining viewing and it is an easy going and reasonably funny film. It is well worth checking out and whilst you won't be rushing to watch it again straight afterwards, I didn't regret watching it at all.

I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan at all. I think he is really annoying, however he did well in this role and meshed well with Natalie Portman. Kevin Kline plays Ashton's father in the film and he was hilarious, one of my favorite funny actors. All of the actors did well and pulled their weight through the film.

As the story started to go... it started to become entertaining. One thing that I just couldn't get past was the casual way people had sex with each other. I mean even back in my day of ""free love"" (despite what you may of heard or read) when you were ""boning a girl"" you liked, you didn't pass her around like a reefer (as some of the characters were doing).

4239768,5,B001394S1E,"Ashton Kutcher is known for his many starring roles in several Hollywood romantic comedies and ""No Strings Attached"" is his latest. Co-starring with Natalie Portman, the film deals with the new 2000's slogan ""friends with benefits"" where two people share only one thing in common with each other: a great sexual relationship and that is all. The movie tackles this subject brilliantly, but the real question is can these same two people keep their relationship as it is without actually falling in love?

 For the men Portman has never looked more beautiful and for women and gay men Ashton Kutcher has never looked sexier (except in his film ""Spread""), so viewers will love the film solely because of the leads with their charming chemistry. Kevin Kline (after a long absence from movies) has a supporting role playing Ashon's dad.

 The movie (which cost Paramount $25,000,000 to make) was a boxoffice hit earning over $144,000,000 at the box office making ""No Strings Attached"" one of Ashton Kutcher's biggest films.

They come from wealthy families. She becomes a doctor and he follows in his father's footsteps and works in the film industry. When Ashton discovers his dad's new girlfriend is his ex-girlfriend he gets drunk and calls every girl in his cell phone until he gets laid. He ends up with Natalie and they make an arrangement to just be ""friends with benefits.""

Natalie is a the one who insists on the ""no relationship with strings"", just a sexual arrangement as she works weird hours and needs to relax. Ashton apparently has the equipment to help her relax. As all chick flicks go, we know how it turns out, the fun is watching it get there.

The usual issues arise but the friend networks on each side keep things fun, along with Kline adding some great comedy as the mid/late life crisis dad going through his own serious love issues. No big surprises here, but this is about watching pretty people doing adult things in this modern era. The supplements are interesting and include:

* Deleted scenes, 5 @ 11:04 minutes. The two obvious sequences where things had been removed early in the film are shown here (Reitman awkwardly edited the Jewish references out of the funeral scene). Glad they cut out more of the dancing high school numbers.
* Alternate storyline, 2 @ 3:45 minutes. Wish this would have been left in the film as it shows Ashton's and Lake Bell's characters having a decent relationship, worth the watch.
* Dos & Donts of Modern Love, 8:46 minutes. A clip-heavy take on all of the actors/creators giving their take on how modern relationships work like depicted in the film.
* Sassy halls of Secret High, 11:22 minutes. What actually makes this Glee-ish mess watchable is Kevin Kline - again. All of the extras are worth the time just to see him talk about what he does - hilarious. If you are into the dance routines and musical references this would be your supplement.
* Sex friends, the making of, 20:46 minutes. Lengthy talking head piece with plenty of clips and honest input about the film - including the original title; F**kbuddies. Virtually everyone gets interviewed here; if you are a fan of Meriwether's writing this is your one to watch.
* Commentary by Reitman. I got more out of what I needed for this film on the other extras.
* Disc 2 is a bare-bones version of the DVD with a Dig Copy included.

English 5.1 DTS (which was great), French, Spanish, Portuguese 5.1 & English Descriptive Service with subs in same. Picture quality is as expected with the night shots showing no weaknesses. 3.5 stars for the film and 1.5 for the BD specs, overall package deal and supplements. Definitely worth a rental.",1304553600,7,2451,4.73536299765808
4239771,5,B001394S1E,This is one of my favorite movie ever made! I loved it! Ashton and Natalie are the best! It is funny and witty.  They are great together and it is a very entertaining movie! Will watch over and over and over!!,1304294400,4,209,4.097560975609756
4239772,1,B001394S1E,"This movie just plain stinks, there is no catchy story, nothing remotely funny at all about it. Also people wanted to see these to Hollywood stars going at it, well you barely see anything that you wouldn't see in a PG-13 film, there isn't even any NUDITY! Natalie Portman is a strange person to say the least, but if you want something better as far as a sex scene with a much better story then check out Black Swan. I can't stand Ashton Kutcher as he does the same old dork, clueless boy character that he does in all his films. Good Luck Chuck was much better, funnier and had a LOT more sex in it, also Natalie Portman (looks wise) just doesnt even compare to Jessica Alba. This is just a run through of nothing more than finding a girl you were friends with, having some casual sex, then liking her at the end, nothing more nothing less. There are about 200 movies just like this one in the last 8 years or so that have come out as well. Comedies in the last 10 years have really gone down hill. I can't even think of the last great comedy that i've seen. This goes in the discount bin even before it comes out on DVD. :)",1302393600,13,1126,4.169724770642202
4239773,5,B001394S1E,Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are completely adorable in this movie. I would watch it over and over again.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  Very cute movie with this situation of 'no strings attached' theory.  I highly recommend for a girls night out movie!,1300579200,10,271,4.604166666666667
4239774,4,B001394S1E,"Saw this movie this past weekend & I thought it was a good movie. If you like Ashton Kutcher & Natalie Portman, you'll probably like this movie. I've gotta say that Natalie surprised me in this movie. She usually plays conservative roles. Her acting as usual is great. Ashton's acting was okay. They had good chemistry though. I didn't think it was that funny, but overall a good movie. I recommend this movie for an audience of 21 & up. Having a friend with benefits is always a recipe for disaster.

*Spoiler Alert* The only complaint I have about this movie is the part where Ashton's ""dad"" gets high in front of him & offers him some. This part almost ruined the movie for me. It's supposed to be a romantic comedy, not a get high fest!! Why does Hollywood portray getting high, getting drunk, & smoking as good things?? Why do people think these things are cool?? They're not...I find them to be stupid & unhealthy. I wish they would stop putting crap like this in movies. This is such a bad influence for our youth. That's all I have to say.",1300060800,2,1047,4.424870466321243
4239775,4,B001394S1E,Natalie Portman and Aston Kutcher are perfectly adorable and perfectly cast in this film that looks at the friends with benefits relationship.,1297814400,,142,5.5
4239776,2,B001394S1E,"A young couple begin a friends with benefits relationship, with the man wanting more, while the woman resists commitment. This leads to the inevitable, and predictable scenario of will they, or won't they, come together? The movie is at times crude, and is not as funny as it thinks it is. There was an occasional laugh, and Natalie Portman is a strong lead. However, with standard elements of the genre present, I would like to say it is a run-of-the-mill romantic-comedy, but that would be an insult to romantic-comedies everywhere.",1295827200,4,534,4.944444444444445
