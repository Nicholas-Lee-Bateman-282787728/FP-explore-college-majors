The 2015 Muse DVD Collectors Box is a 2 disc 210 minute package that celebrates 21years of an English rock band that has left a sizeable imprint on the music scene.  Matt Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard are now in their 22nd year and their meteoric rise is captured here in a documentary that goes for the detail of a tantalising tale rather than drowning the viewer in the Muse-ic that they know so well! Fans have no doubt got the sounds so it is time to assess the standing of this commercially successful trio who have come a long way from their Teignmouth origins.
Their most recent 7th album Drones was a 2015 number one on both sides of the Atlantic as well as in Australia. Muse have also won numerous prestigious music awards including five MTV Europe Music Awards, six Q Awards, eight NME Awards, two Brit Awards, four Kerrang! Awards and an American Music Award. Since this DVD surfaced On 15 February 2016, Drones won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 58th Grammy Awards (and this is the second time this accolade has gone to Muse with The Resistance being a previous winner). As of June 2015, Muse had sold more than 17 million albums worldwide.
This DVD release delves in to the domain of this industrious band who are arguably a contemporary Queen who will venture down a variety of paths in order to maintain diversity and dexterity. There is rare live and studio footage plus chat from those from the inner circle. This is merchandise to fit along the records and is more likely to a-Muse than be-Muse!",1460332800,5,1570,4.556737588652482
