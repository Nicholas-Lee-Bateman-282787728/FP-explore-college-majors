3104198,5,B0013D8LCW,"What a WONDERFULLY romantic film! Like the other reviewers before me, I was besotted by the film. This is definitely one of the best gay themed movie to come in a long while. Production values, acting, actors were all top notch. Definitely something you would keep as a collector.",1207699200,73,280,4.73469387755102
3104199,5,B0013D8LCW,"""Pure being,"" a friend of mine once said enviously of the surfers riding the waves along the Southern California coast some thirty years ago.  Though there was a strict demarcation between the gay section of the beaches and those parts that belonged to the surfers alone, even then a few surfers hung out at night in the Breakers or one of the other gay bars along Highway One, especially in Laguna. There, what seemed so easy a life out in the Pacific, just following the next big waves one after another, became less obvious and more conflicted.  Stories about coming out have so dominated many gay films that the theme has developed into an archetype, a genre of its own with endless variations:  from dark into light, from secrets into revelation.  In Shelter, Zach is a young artist who has turned down a scholarship at CalArts in order to stay home to care for his nephew Cody.  Zach has inherited the family gene, from his mother he says.  All the concerns and nearly all the love the five year old Cody should find in his mother, Zach's sister Jeanne, he gets from Zach alone.  Zach has had a long time girlfriend, but everything about their relationship is tentative, on hold.  When he meets his best friend's older brother again after several years, they surf together, just as they used to.  But Shaun is an openly gay man who has published a novel which Zach has read.  Shaun's sexuality is no secret to Zach, but Zach's is to Shaun--as it may still be to Zach himself, at least in the sense that he has never before been with a man (or in all likelihood a woman; his responses to his girlfriend are mostly tepid, except when his real longings frighten him).  What Zach wants more than anything are family and love.  After a night during which he and Shaun kiss, Zach is happy but its meaning is still uncertain.  He rides the waves, paces the deck of the house he shares with his sister and nephew in what he calls San Pedro's ghetto, then drives back to the family house on the beach where Shaun is staying to recuperate emotionally after a boyfriend has dumped him in L.A.  What follows between Zach and Shaun is stunning in its impact upon both men.  Their coupling, however, is not filmed as soft core porn, all or nearly all about the physical alone, but as love scenes.  What matters most is the feeling shown through their eyes.  All the acting in this emotionally profound film is superb, but the love beyond words Zach and Shaun manage to express just with their eyes has almost never before been seen in movies, not even, say, in Brokeback where to some degree it was often having to be hidden by one or the other man.  What follows in Shelter is Zach's coming to understand what that love means to him for the rest of his life.  Part of this is the usual problem of coming out to his friends and to his sister, though nearly all that effort is accomplished for him; they know before he tells them. But he must also come to see himself better; he must change, too, as he tells Shaun later.  Part of that transformation is his discovering more fully who Shaun is.  Shaun has been criticized by some viewers for being too patient with Zach.  But patience is part of love, one of the virtues that help people abide all the messes we make or almost make out of our lives.  When Zach learns that Shaun has mailed his application and portfolio to CalArts, he sees, quietly, the man's generosity.  In a way, Shaun has shown that he loves Zach as kindly and patiently as Zach loves Cody.  Zach's and Shaun's erotic communion is intense.  But this is a love that is also caritas, deep, perhaps abiding.  It is his recognition of that possibiity, if not certainty that leads Zach back to Shaun, especially after a talk with his girlfriend in which he says his only regret (about being gay) is that he wanted to make a family with her.  In this moment between them, it is her goodness which allows her to encourage Zach to return to Shaun, to the different family he might find now through Shaun and with Cody.  At least, she says, he should try.  Near the end, after Zach and Shaun drive to the house to pick up Cody from Zach's sister who is moving to Portland with her rough boyfriend, Zach turns to Shaun and takes his hand in his.  It is a gesture of love between them as telling as any more passionate embrace.  The seemingly unencumbered lives both men had known together surfing when younger--Shaun the master, Zach the pupil in a running joke between them--has grown into a love that is in every sense good.  I think this is one of the best movies ever made about gay men, searchingly decent and generously spirited about love without any loss in erotic force.  It is also wonderfully realized, except in a few of the songs on the soundtrack, in both the director's eye and the hearts of all the performers, even those in relatively minor roles (Gabe is as perfect a surfer dude as one can imagine, but with more than the usual soul).  But Trevor Wright as Zach gives to his character an especially touching complexity.  Zach is in some ways still a kid, talking in the lingo of surfers, tagging buildings, riding his skateboard.  But he's also emotionally older than everyone else in his life, already committed to a way of living many people never come to.  His coming out is more painful to himself than it is to others perhaps because his need for real communion is already so great. Yet he finds it.  This is emotionally complex work for so young an actor.  But every gesture he makes, everything he expresses is true; no moment ever feels false or contrived.  What the movie leaves one with is a sense of both the hopes and ambiguities of moral being, a far more difficult, yet greater life than merely riding the waves of one's youth.",1207267200,255,5762,4.480842911877395

I promise...  Your sister isn't a very good mom.  She's willing to trust her moronic boyfriend to traipse 1000 miles north to try housekeeping in an environment without her only child.  Her brother who has always been a person in loco parentis to the boy has discovered that he prefers guys, and is particularly fond of his older brother's best friend, who is also gay.  Juggle the pieces, friends.  This is surely not a puzzle easily solved.

3104295,5,B0013D8LCW,"One of the very best ""Bambi"" coming-of-age or ""coming-out"" movies I've ever watched.  I say that in all sincerity.  I'm 63 and have been watching independent queer cinema since its origin with the 1986 seminal ""NO APOLOGIES"" gay-point-of view classic ""Parting Glances."" There have been a few films in the decades-long interim which live up to the sophistication and narrative promise of ""Parting Glances.""  ""World and Time Enough (1984), ""Latter Days"" (1992), ""Defying Gravity"" (1994), and ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" (1991, I believe) all deliver an almost miraculous depth of feeling from an impossibly paltry financial investment.  This little film ""Shelter"" is a panoply of the highs and lows of love and devotion and it truly satisfied my desire for its protagonist to achieve the joyful contentment he so deserves. ""Shelter"" is a love-ly story (in every sense of that word) and I hope you will be as pleased by it as I am.
An aside: See Brad Rowe (Shaun) at his most Robert Redford-ish in ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" with Sean Hayes as Billy, a lonely yet hopeful photographer with a tuxedo-wearing guardian angel. (Directed by Tommy O'Haver)",1492905600,10,1156,5.1005291005291005

Shelter follows Zach (Trevor Wright) who is a down on his luck artist (drawing, painting, tagging) that works in the kitchen of a diner. He doesn't really know yet, but he finds himself attracted to his best friends brother Shaun (Brad Rowe). Although both of these men are obviously straight in real life, they played their roles well and I believed that their characters were in love. The story is amazing; it has elements of homophobia, love, the amazing California life and much more. I'd say this is one of those movies that will make you sad, but will lift you up as well. Both men are beautiful and I felt their love for each other through the screen. It is rated R, but there are no explicit sex scenes. I think it had a few F-words, so that's why. I think they should've taken them out and made it PG-13, so that the teenage crowd could see  a positive, gay love story.",1487030400,8,997,4.442622950819672

3104321,4,B0013D8LCW,"With all the acclaim currently being heaped on Moonlight, I found myself reflecting that any number of more modestly-budgeted niche *gay* films have negotiated the same territory, and often done it better.  Shelter is one.  It seems at first like a relatively standard gay romance, but is quietly and subtly perceptive, and ultimately powerful.  It is also tightly-scripted, well-directed and well-acted.  It might not be as moody or as self-consciously arty as Moonlight, but nor is it slow, flaccid or tedious - as Moonlight is at times.  In short: I was greatly moved by Shelter, and not so much by Moonlight.  So if you were also somewhat underwhelmed by the Oscar-nominee, check out Shelter.  It might restore your faith.",1486425600,,726,5.050420168067227

3104352,4,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter was a very enjoyable M/M romance that I know I'll be watching again in the future.  It is one of the few out there that gives those watching a happy ending, and while it would have been great to see more intimate moments between the two main characters, it still leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end.

The story did have some slow spots, and overall was a bit predictable, but as a whole was enjoyable and I would recommend it to those looking for a feel-good M/M romance.  My one dislike?  Zach's sister.  Homophobic?  Yes...but there's always going to be characters like that in same-sex movies and books.  I was more incensed with her excessive selfishness-she has absolutely no consideration for Zach and doesn't seem to care for her son like a mother should.  Her character was unlikable enough to affect my star rating by at least a half a star.

Shelter is a great addition to any M/M romance collection, and gets a 4-star rating from me.",1475193600,2,964,4.526011560693641

3104380,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is my new favorite romance movie.  The two leads, Zach (Trevor Wright) and Shaun (Brad Rowe) have an easy chemistry that makes their discovery of love a joy to watch.  The overall storyline is one covered many times in many other movies.  It doesn't break new ground, but it doesn't need to.  What it does, it does well.  And that's make the sympathetic viewer root for what they fervently hope will be a joyful ending.  It has just enough of the angst of typical coming-out stories to check the necessary boxes to fit the genre, but its focus is far more on new love, promise of commitment, and the creation of family.  Solid movie when what you want is an uplifting romance.",1464566400,,684,4.512195121951219

3104382,5,B0013D8LCW,"In my humble opinion, this gay themed movie, starring Trevor Wright and Brad Roe as two nearly lifelong friends, who in real life are both straight, while in the movie Its obvious that Trevor, while being brother to Jeanie - quite possibly the most self-centered, irresponsible, mother to one of the cutest little 5 year old muchkins with a heck of a lot of acting ability who loves his uncle Zach (Wright) since his father cut out on his wife and baby son, so even at age 5, little Cody is calling Zach his father, while uncle Zach is trying in vain to tell Cody he's just his uncle. Zack, Jeanie, and Cody live in a tiny house near the beach of a town called San Pedro, while a few miles away, lives Brad Roe's chacacter, who has his degree and written one book about all the secrets that are kept in the walls of Pacific Bluffs, and enclave of the wealthier beach & luxury loving folks. It's
Zack's dream to go to the Cali Institute of Art in LA, and that just so happens that's where Brad had just signed a lease agreement for a large condo
only a few blocks from where Zach wants to go to school, if it weren't for Jeanie, who's been using Zack as an unpaid nanny. And Zack keeps doing it for two reasons: He loves Cody like a real father and knows Jeanie is running around with a low-life house painter who hates kids, the rent is cheap, and finally Zach is keeping a secret about himself, even though he has had a gf for six years. Guess that secret, and you have the ingredients for something to happen that could change all their lives, if they could just work things out. That's enough to get up your interest, and if you think two straight guys can't act the roles of two guys in love, you'll be blown away by this movie.",1462147200,,1732,4.251515151515152
3104383,5,B0013D8LCW,The story is set in an area of Los Angeles that was once the place of fine restaurants and great shopping for the not so usual items in the 1960's. Now it is a place of poverty and very little work. I can easily identify with the characters as I too used to frequent Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach where the surfing was the best. Lots of scenes of the beautiful California coast line and the beautiful Vincent Thomas Bridge all lit up. Brad Rowe is one of the very finest actors I've had the pleasure of watching on screen and no one else but Trevor Wright could have played his character as well as he did. This is one of the best love stories you'll see on screen.,1456790400,2,669,4.1937984496124034

I'm from LA, so I usually don't like watching films where the story is set in or filmed in this territory, and surfer movies...mehhhh, but because I have always thought highly of Brad Rowe, I gave it a chance.  Trevor Wright, I had never heard of but WOW, he really impressed me.  Not only is he a fine actor but he's amazingly good looking.  The supporting cast, especially the actress who played Zach's sister, and Gabe's bro, are all excellent as well.  The unexpected ending, I loved, and I found myself really touched by it.  It just goes to show how everything always works out for the best.  It was filmed very well and you can almost smell the run-down house out east where Zach and his family live, and the sea salt of the beach and the burgers in the burger joint.  Zach's artistic talents made for a great B story.  Obviously Zach and Gabe have always loved each other a lot, but their love has gone through some different waves (pun unintentional).  Jonah Markowitz definitely achieved something great with ""Shelter"" and got Wright and Rowe (both straight) to play gay very well.  I've seen a lot of gay films - even some very popular ones- where the directors don't get the most out of the two male leads but I'd say Markowitz succeeded in that respect and that's what made his film so great.

If I show you one sunset over the ocean & tell you that's the movie , please believe me & save yourself some money, especially at $30. Borrow it/ buy the regular used dvd.. The kissing scenes were so strange to me because it looked like it was strained throughout the movie.. There is never a moment in this movie that you really believe their relationship. Now add to this when you load the Bluray it usually starts up with a cool picture. Whomever designed this Bluray decided to put a supporting actor on the opening screen.. Where it should have been either of the two lead actors.. This dvd missed on so many levels .. I know & love Gay movies/ I just saw ""Boys"" from the Netherlands..

3104493,5,B0013D8LCW,"One of my favorite movies in a long time.  Nice to see a story like this.  Very warm and touching with genuine characters.  Nothing against you WeHo guys, but nice to see a non stereotypical representation on screen.

I thought one reviewer's criticism that this was some hollow chick flick mo-equivalent to be way off.  ""No conflict, no depth, nothing but a smooth ride to the happy ending.""  I'd just like to say that (a) nobody has to die or get beat up to have dramatic legitimacy, and (b) conflict can be very subtle, especially for a young gay man figuring things out.  This kid had plenty of conflict in his life already, then added a completely new type of relationship to his life.  The importance of his nephew in his life was a big driver and that was threatened by his sister's selfishness, clear ulterior motives, and prejudice.  What if she'd freaked out and taken him out of her son's life?  I like the way the film didn't spell out some of the inner conflicts and let the viewer figure it out (although I thought that one was pretty obvious).  It seemed to me, some reviewers were looking for flaws.  One commented on the bad double entendre ""it was a good day to come out.""  ""Go out"" or ""come out"" is a very common way to describe going surfing as in ""out"" in the water.  It never occurred to me that was intended to be a play on ""coming out"" and I don't think it was.  One reason I've liked some gay themed movies is that it let's you see the experience of others different from yourself.  The Falls held that appeal for me.  I suggest  some might enjoy this film more if they took that tack in this case.  I think surfer  stereotyping in film/TV might be working against this film, but should  not.  I'm glad to see so many viewers liked it as much as I did.

I also liked the story because much of it was filmed where I grew up (no, we didn't call it ""the Bu"") and I thought the characters reflected real socal beach culture, with no over the top ""Spicoli"" stereotypes.  I may be swayed somewhat by the beach setting and the intimacy with the ocean the characters shared.  That shared love  of the ocean will resonate with  anyone who grew up with the ocean as their playground.  I liked the story line.  I liked the characters.  It is a very warm story about two nice guys; one helping the other and joining his nurturing relationship with the little boy.  Loved the ocean scenes.  Loved the music.  ""Lie  to me"" is a great song and its scene placement in this film was perfect.

Special mention to the Gabe character.  Despite the ""bros"" and ""dude"" (yes people really talk like that), he came across as genuine and warm - at times hilarious (running up the stairs ""where's my princess big brother?!).  His intonations were spot on.",1422662400,2,2753,4.401590457256461

I loved this movie since it does such a wonderful job of showing the difficult rollercoaster ride of emotions which one can face when coming to terms with their sexuality and the narrowmindedness of those around them, but does so in a way that is uplifting and heart warming.  It shows that things can get better, despite a difficult path.  One of the subtle scenes which I liked, was the morning after Zach and Shaun made love for the first time.  Zach is driving home, and sudenly gives a big smile as he realizes this is what he truly wanted.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone -- gay, or straight.
I'm not sure why this movie is priced so much higher than most other movies. Though already rated highly, I'm sure it would gain an even higher popularity rating with a lower price, as the high price may be limiting the number of people viewing it.  If you can get past the price, I think you will find it to be the best movie in it's class.",1416700800,,1105,4.360975609756098

3104501,5,B0013D8LCW,This is one of my favourite films of all time. The chemistry among the actors feels very genuine and I like the working class perspective.,1416355200,,138,4.56
3104502,5,B0013D8LCW,"Can a director film a feature-length movie worth seeing in only fourteen days?  Most Hollywood directors would probably say no, or at least they wouldn't want to try it. But Jonah Markowitz, who wrote and directed Shelter, pulls it off.  He had a story he wanted to tell and was finally able to get the financial backing to make it.  I think he did a great job!

Shelter is the story of an all-too typical, modern family.  Zach, the 'father figure', unexpectedly finds himself drawn to another man ... not in the 'let's hop in bed and have a good time' sort of way, but much deeper.  How all the relationships play out is the basis of the story.  I found the acting, by a cast of relatively unknowns, to be very good.

The DVD includes an interesting Making Of segment and a running commentary by the director and two main actors.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the three describe the filming, over the action on screen!

I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they would enjoy a M/M love story.",1414368000,,1019,4.51912568306011

3104504,2,B0013D8LCW,"I get it!!! This is a completely uncomplicated gay romance with a happy ending that a gay couple could cuddle up with and enjoy - the gay equivalent of a ""chick-flick"" [though no rhyme-equivalency would be appropriate here, since there is no nudity or sex to speak of]. The problem is that it is pure cream-of-wheat. No conflict, no depth, nothing but a smooth ride to the happy ending. Oh, there are two or three seemingly endless sequences where we simply listen to a couple of insipid pop songs...but for the folks who like this film, these sequences are probably the film's highlights. Bottom-line: it's pretty to look at;  but for anyone who wants anything approaching an interesting story-line, it's a crashing bore.",1413504000,,722,4.869918699186992

3104507,5,B0013D8LCW,"Absolutely adore this movie. Heartwarming, loving, sweet - just a perfect film to make you feel good.  I read a critical review that panned this as being a Lifetime channel like movie.  And I actually agree, it is like a Lifetime movie - but in this case it's not a bad thing - I think it is really amazingly done.  Not all movie's have to be doom and gloom - sometimes we want to walk away smiling and feeling good about love, life, etc... This movie is one of my favorite pick-me-ups, it makes my heart smile.

Also in terms of it being a ""gay surfer film"" - the director mentions that he wanted to create a life story that just happened to be about a gay person/couple, and I think he succeeded.  As a straight female, I just saw two people fall in love and a young man finally live his own life.  Even though it's hard to get one's hands on - I really hope more people get to see this lovely film.  I am so happy that I finally got to own my own copy and see the commentary and other special features.",1410220800,5,1005,4.096938775510204

3104535,2,B0013D8LCW,"Although this film has reasonably good production values, cinematography, and music, it lacked chemistry between the characters. There seemed to be no real feelings evident in the relationship. The viewer is given no background, just quick, almost wordless introductions to the characters, and the story. We are forced to guess at what each character represents. The story lacked real depth and meaning.

I understand it's a pretty film. Good looking leading characters and a charismatic child are not nearly enough to sustain this film. I long for the days of Latter Days and Big Eden. Recent entries such as E-Cupid have more entertaining content than this.",1405036800,,659,5.216981132075472

So it was nothing short of therapeutic to see this excellent film, which made it possible, maybe for the first time, for me to be able to be comfortable about being gay myself.  I'm also a photographer and appreciate the great videography of the film.  I've got a little hero worship for Trevor Wright, who I think nailed his part.",1403654400,2,500,4.231578947368421

3104560,5,B0013D8LCW,"I can't believe that I didn't see this movie when it first came to an art-house theater in our town. It was released in 2007 and is just as wonderful today.  This movie is timeless and a milestone in Cinema for this genre --  Gay Romantic Drama.  The screenplay and direction are excellent; the cinematography is spectacular (especially the scenes involving surfing and the Pacific Ocean); but most of all, the acting is so superior to that of  any other film that debuted in 2007.  Brad Rowe, in a tour de force, burns a hole in the screen with his multi-layered performance of Shaun, who is a screenwriter in Hollywood as well as a published author.  Trevor Wright is even more impressive as Zach, a ""street artist"" who works dead-end jobs and has dreams of attending CALARTS, but is hampered in doing so by his manipulative and selfish sister Jeanne.  Zach is not only a babysitter, but also a surrogate father to the adorable Cody, Jeanne's son by a long-gone lover in a string of deadbeat men.  Needless to say, Zach is trying his best to be a role model for Cody, but his on again/off again romance with girlfriend Tori is causing him to have a serious identity crisis.  Enter Shaun, the brother of Zach's best friend Gabe.  Shaun is such an endearingly good-natured and gregarious character, that Zach finds himself attracted to him more than he is to Tori. Shaun, who is older and wiser, helps  Zach out of the closet by degrees, but complications set in from all sides --- from a slightly jealous Gabe, to a belligerent sister and her lout of a boyfriend, Alan, back again to Zach who isn't  entirely sure of himself.  Brad Rowe is such a consummate actor that he can take  simple scenes like building a sand castle with Cody on the beach, or playfully asking him what he wants for dinner, and turn these incidents into pure cinematic charm.  He is so good at his craft that he calls to mind Daniel Day-Lewis, who is known for immersing himself in a role to the point of total believability. Both Zach and Shaun are so well portrayed, and the screenplay is so good that by the end of the movie you absolutely know where the title comes from---certainly it came from Zach's and Cody's situation, but even more poignant you get the feeling that for all his exuberance, Shaun's is a bruised soul (past relationships that failed) and that all three are seeking ""Shelter"" and you root for them wholeheartedly to get it.  In all probability, Mr. Rowe and Mr. Wright would have been  fellow nominees at the Academy Awards for this film had it been widely distributed, as it much deserves to have been.  I won't tell prospective viewers any more of the story from this ""Eternal Valentine"" because  I want them to experience it for themselves, but I do promise everyone that you will watch this cinematic masterpiece, directed by Jonah Markowitz, an exponential number of times.  Check out some of the other films of Trevor Wright as well as those especially of Brad Rowe.  Watch for one or  both of these fine actors to one day win an Academy Award!",1398816000,,3050,4.588560885608856

In this case poor Zach is faces with the reality of turning down a scholarship to art school to deal with his highly dysfunctional family.  I've been there before with a sister who's a terrible mother only to pick up the pieces of her son's broken heart.  Shelter is not really a gay surfer movie, that is just the thing in common that draws the two protagonists together with a common interest.  Sean is lost and he has no meaning in his life because, up until this point, he really hasn't faced any real challenges. Zach on the other hand, believes that he can somehow save his family, when he has his own issues to deal with.  Zach's biggest outlets are his surfing and his art.  Sean just happens to be the one who challenges Zach to face his homosexuality, and false sense of obligation.

Incredible photography of surfers as a background to the main story doesn't overpower your interest in this relationship between a younger, compassionate surfer dude, and a slightly more mature one. It's a movie you'll want to watch over and over as you are enfolded in the struggles many young gays have aligning their needs with family obligations, but still wanting to break away.

I really love the progression of the story and the genuine sincerity of the love between them. There were no typical gay stereotyping like hot hunks with chiseled bodies, heavy partying and clubbing, being promiscuous or anything like that. Instead it is a wholesome feel-good love story between two average-everyday men with average-everyday bodies.

The story of the younger guy falling for the older guy and realizing his sexuality is very well done, and without full sex scenes (which may have been good to add a few :-) ) -- his anguish of living his life, taking on more responsibility than is normal for his age bracket, and accepting his potential future as a gay man is heart breaking to watch, but excellent.

3104639,5,B0013D8LCW,"This has to be one of the best gay-themed movies made thus far. The story is set in San Pedro and La Holla, CA. It's about Zach (Trevor Wright) who falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe). Shaun is the older brother of Gabe (Ross Thomas), Zach's best friend. There's roughly a 12-year difference between Zach and Shaun. Gabe goes off to college in Santa Barbara. While he's gone Zach visits Gabe's house to work on his surf board that he's left in the backyard. Unbeknownst to Zach Shaun is staying there temporarily until the lease on his new place in Los Angeles begins. He surprises Zach. Both are delighted to see each other. It's obvious that Zach has had a crush on Shaun for some time. He invites Shaun to surf with him. Shaun takes up the offer and the romance between them begins.

""Shelter"" is a coming of age story in that it's about Zach coming to terms with his sexual orientation. Being older Shaun has already come to terms with his sexuality. He helps Zach to accept who he is. There's much drama in this film as Zach not only comes to terms with his sexuality he has a very trying relationship with his sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes). She frequently puts Zach in a situation where he has to care for her five-year-old son, Cody (Jackson Wurth). But Zach loves his nephew. He is both uncle and father to him. And Cody worships Zach.

Zach and Shaun both love Cody. Shaun's very good with him and loves the funny things he says. Cody tells his Uncle Zach, ""Shaun rocks!"" The three of them make a wonderful family. Thankfully, this movie has a ""Hollywood ending"".

There are a lot of surfing scenes and beautiful footage of Southern California. Trevor Wright actually does surf and and ride a skateboard in those scenes. Both he and Brad Rowe are terrific actors. The two of them have great chemistry together. ""Shelter"" is a love story anyone would appreciate.",1373587200,,1870,4.543026706231454

Zach is in a relationship with his friend Tori, but he falls in love with Gabe's brother (Gabe is his best friend who lives in the rich part of their town). They start to see each other secretly until Zach takes Cody to Shaun's place and Jeannie finds out through Cody one day. Then Zach is forced to talk about it. I love the quality of the film and all the actors/actresses did an amazing job. I also love the story. The only thing I don't like about this film is that Gabe and Jeannie smoked around Cody. Zach shouldn't have told Cody to go and start his car 'cause it's dangerous. Last but not least, Jeannie should've chosen someone who also loved Cody. But ultimately, it's a very wonderful film.

3104667,5,B0013D8LCW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I had heard a lot about it, but never had the chance to watch it until recently.  Then I decided to buy it, which for me means I must've really enjoyed it.  I think it's unfair to compare this film to Brokeback Mountain, however, since the tone, story, setting, and budget are completely different for each film.  They're both great films in their own right and I enjoy both of them (and own both of them) for completely different reasons.  Shelter is sweet and hopeful, BBM is sad and achy.

The acting in Shelter is better than I expected and the little boy who plays Cody is utterly adorable.  The two leads have good chemistry and they made me believe their relationship.  The soundtrack is definitely topnotch.  I would also caution you to disregard those who describe this film as a ""gay surfing movie"" because while there is plenty of surfing, it's not a surfing movie.  That's not what the film's about.  The characters just happen to surf.  They also happen to paint and draw and write and act like immature boys sometimes, too.

This is really a film about learning who you are and accepting it, about finally letting yourself reach for the dreams you've been denying you could have.  Watching Zach's transformation and Shaun's quiet encouragement is a real treat.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a sweet and hopeful story with a happy ending.",1365724800,2,1404,4.673469387755102

3104686,5,B0013D8LCW,"The outpouring of positive feedback for this movie is obviously well deserved.  It is well paced with great sound and picture quality, impeccable direction, a lovely story, and a cast of actors perfectly suited for their roles.

Three of the main characters here (Zack, Jeanne, and Cody)are a family living together in a very humble section of San Pedro, CA which is in Los Angeles County. A beautiful, selfless young Gay man, Zack, has put his life on hold to look after his adorable nephew Cody whose mother, played by Tina Holmes, is an irresponsible, self-centered alcoholic with deplorable taste in men.  But his compassion and love are well rewarded when an older gorgeous hunk and surfing buddy, Shaun, reunites with him and eventually becomes his mentor, his ""rock"", and his lover as well a wonderful role model and support system for his little nephew.

In real life, Trevor Wright(""Zack"") and Brad Rowe(""Shaun"") are both heterosexual and are actually 12 years apart in age. If Brad Pitt makes you drool, so will Brad Rowe, and if you love a perfectly beautiful young man with the face of an angel and a smile that lights up a room like a Christmas tree, you'll love Trevor Wright.  Also, if you like Tina Holmes, I would suggest you check out another great movie, ""Edge of Seventeen"" in which she appears as a teen in love with her male ""BFF"" who comes out to her as gay.

It would be a grave injustice to dismiss this wonderful movie as just another ""coming out"" film. It's a tribute to the power of love that can be enjoyed and embraced by all open-minded audiences who appreciate a feel good romance with a happy ending.

From my vantage point, having a collection films about love and romance without ""Shelter"" would be like having a collection of classic cars without a vintage Pink Cadillac.  Along with ""Beautiful Thing"" and Jean-Claude Schlim's ""House of Boys"", ""Shelter"" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies.",1362700800,3,1996,4.731988472622478

This film relies heavily on the scenery and the actors (I suppose if the director cut out all the driving/surfing/skating scenes it would be about 30 minutes long).

Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright do such a great job and their on screen chemistry is just right for this, Tina Holmes is great (I really love/hated that character), and Ross Thomas' character seems to take over the scenes he's in.

Probably the worst thing about the film is that it had the potential to be/do so much more as a film and for the community, but then again maybe that's part of why I like it.  It's romance and coming out without all the sex, political issues, or blatant ignorance that some films get wrapped up in.",1361750400,7,760,4.368794326241135

This story is an example of good cinema that does not trivialize us or deduce us simply to sexual animals without telling the story of our fullness as just another variation of normal social beings trying to work, play and live in loving relationships.  I am so tired of Hollywood and others reducing us to stereotypes or sex centric individuals.  Gay men and women are not socialized with respect to their realities.  We don't have proms, acceptable dating protocols, and ways to help us develop healthily into our gay bodies with other gay men.  We will never get full recognition as normal people until we are accepted as normal on the culture especially movies.  Name 5 great straight romantic  movies.  It's fairly easy.  Name 5 great gay ones and it's impossible.  The homophobes win until the gays in Hollywood and the whole industry provide good material for good actors that shows us no different from straight men and women.

It's a decent length film and one that I think is pretty well written. Give it a chance. I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised!",1327017600,,406,4.355263157894737

It takes place in the Los Angeles/Orange County area, which is where we live.  So seeing familiar landmarks was also pleasing to us.  Plus, it's a surf movie. So if you're into surfing and happen to be gay then this is definitely your movie!",1325030400,3,515,4.543478260869565

3104736,5,B0013D8LCW,"Well I'm a teen and sad to say, I was obsessed with the shows about gay stereotypes at one point(ie. The L Word, Queer as Folk). This movie is something completely different. The characters were easier to relate to and they have the same issues that we do as average people.

  I love that the guys were open in the end, it sends a nice message out to today's gay youth. Being gay is okay and you shouldn't hide it from your family or friends. They might be hurt when you don't tell them and they find out from other people.

This movie didn't portray gays as sex hungry pedophiles that take drugs. The romance was beautiful and I could understand why one of the guys felt so unsure and confused. Some people don't know they're gay till later on in life and this movie says it can take time to get used to -nothing happens over night. You won't always be so uncomfortable in your own skin.

  BRAVO!!! I want to see more movies like this and show them to my friends in LGBT youth group. I'm sure the are more symbols and messages that can be taken from this movie. I'm going to watch it a few more times. This picture is absolutely amazing and fantastic!",1323734400,6,1154,4.26605504587156

I've bought a lot of Gay oriented films but most of the time have been extremely disappointed by the amateur feel of the film or the terrible writing or acting or both in many films. So I really didn't know what to expect.

After watching this movie it felt like one of the best films Gay or Straight I've ever seen in my life! It was not only professionally done, but the casting was fantastic. the writing was fantastic, the acting was superb and the direction and production extremely well done!! I've rarely ever given a review of a film I've bought but this film was so good I can't stop talking about it!

The screen play and script along with the great casting and acting made the characters come alive. Their interaction was not only believable but but you felt the definite connection between them. The story was so good, the acting was so good, as was the direction and production, that the audience cannot help but become emotionally involved. So many Gay oriented films end in tragedy. This film ends with an uplifting spirit of heartfelt hope that love can conquer all and win in the end.

This is a beautiful film, a beautiful story, wonderful acting and fantastic cast, and great direction and production. It is so good that immediately after watching it I went online to buy another copy of the film to give as a gift to a friend.

This is one of the best films I've ever seen!! It should have won many Indi awards and I wonder why it didn't? I highly recommend it to anyone, Gay, Bi, Straight... it doesn't matter, this film is that good! I can't say enough about it!",1313884800,4,1727,4.421383647798742

In his free time he surfs, draws and hangs out with his best friend, Gabe, who lives on the wealthy side of town. When Gabe's older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe) returns home, he is drawn to Zach's selflessness and talent. Zach falls in love with Shaun while struggling to reconcile his own desires with the needs of his family.
Zach seems to have his head together, has a pretty girlfriend he loves very much and adores his young nephew who has no other stability than Zach in his life. He is determined to make this kid's life enjoyable in spite of family neglect. Yet there is a part of Zach that is yet undefined and he has great difficulty coming to terms with, knowing it could jeopardize his relationship with his nephew Cody.
Trevor Wright does an INCREDIBLE job portraying his character. He was very well cast for the role. He is quite good looking which doesn't hurt, but acts the part with such tenderness and realism. A very professional actor for his age. I was enthrolled by his performance. The acting of Brad Rowe was also very good and the two make a believable couple in spite of an age difference. This is a very well written script and one almost any viewer can enjoy from beginning to end. I highly recommend the film.

The way Zack stayed cool with how his sister was not taking care of her and then stepping in as the father figure was the part that put this movie on a whole other level. The way Shaun and Zack relationship evolves is one of the most believable I have ever seen and the way  Shaun GENTLY pushes Zach to better himself by giving him an application to the school that he wants to go to is how I would think a boyfriend that love his man to act.
The ending showing how  Shaun and Zach take in Zach's nephew and then how the last part moves to the beach seen closes out the movie very well.",1308528000,,899,4.073446327683616

Guy finds out he is gay, has trouble in accepting that for himself and his surrounding, but in the end everything turns out the way it should. Pretty thin story. Maybe especially for a Dutch guy like me. But the acting and the storyline are believable. And the actors are nice people, what makes it easy to sympathise with them. So yes, it's a clich. But a well done one.

I also liked the music in the movie very much. The Shane Mack songs as well as most of the others. That helps too.

This movie came without subtitles. And that's a dissapointment for those who can't hear very well and for those who don't understand english well enough. And that's a shame.

The production values are very high throughout, with great cinematography, including some amazing shots of surfing.  The script is excellent, avoiding the usual clichs and allowing the characters to talk like real people.  The actors do a great job of making the characters come alive as three-dimensional people, where even the less sympathetic characters have redeeming features.

Writer/director Jonah Markowitz brings it all together to present a powerful and moving story.  The soundtrack is also well done, with songs that enhance each scene.

The DVD has great picture quality and Dolby 5.1 audio.  Extras include a commentary track with Markowitz and the two leads, a ""making of"" featurette, a photo gallery, music video of Shane Mack singing ""Lie to Me"", and trailer.

Lush with emotion and the making of decisions that will make (or break) lasting relationships, this film tackles big topics while keeping the pace relaxed and unforced.

I love the character of Zach - he's struggling with so many feeling and on the cusp of making huge life choices that weren't all his to make. I love his devotion to his nephew and his family and that he truly knows what sacrifice means and does so without much complaint.

I also love the character of Shaun, whose open heart and patience make a 'Shelter' for Zach. Not everything is cut and dry and I love the way this character is wise enough to wait for Zach to decide how to deal with his newly realized feelings.

Love does just 'happen' and this movie sums that up with grace and beauty - a really poignant piece of art that says volumes of what relationships today are truly made of and how family and lovers all overlap in our lives.",1300320000,4,1050,4.486910994764398

3104773,5,B0013D8LCW,"While watching ""Shelter,"" a rather sweet-natured story about a good-hearted, self-sacrificing young man dealing with the realization that he might be gay, I was reminded of the the Otto Preminger film of 1962, ""Advise and Consent.""  In it a young but influential senator, now happily married  and with a small child, had had sexual relations with a man while in military service who, now in poverty, is attempting to he commits suicide rather than suffer exposure, an effective if extreme solution to his problems.  CAUTION -- the next paragraphs contains spoilers to the plot of ""Shelter.""contact the senator for money and threatening to expose his past. The senator becomes so distraught with the situation before him that

This film makes one realize the distance we have (hopefully) traversed in 50 or so years.  In ""Shelter"" an artistically gifted young man, Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is helping to support his sister and her little boy, Cody (Jackson Wurth), and their ailing father, and, as a result, has given up his hopes of attending an art academy.  Zach's boyhood friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), who is straight, has an older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe), who had taught them both to surf a few years before and is known by his brother, Gabe, to be gay.  Shaun, who has returned to the area and is living at the family residence in a much nicer part of town,  reestablishes an acquaintance with Zach and a friendship begins to develop  between them.  As time goes on this becomes more than a friendship as Zach comes to terms with his sexual feelings and gradually falls in love with Shaun.  Zach's sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes), is planning to leave the area with her dolt of a male friend and intends to leave her child in Zach's care for a considerable period.  Zach's relationship with Shaun becomes known to her and she initially doesn't want her child anywhere near Shaun, but gradually comes to realize that Cody, who is very attached to Zach and now to Shaun as well, would be better off under his and Shaun's care than with her and her male friend who isn't particularly fond of Cody.  The film ends with Zach, now having broken up with his girlfriend, Tori (Katie Walder), and his little nephew now living happily with Shaun who has seen to it that Zach will get to attend art school after all.  The film was skillfully written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  The brief final scene of Zach, Cody and Shaun happily romping on the beach was apparently added some months after the film had been considered complete as both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are here seen having long hair.

The cast is generally excellent and the developing relationship portrayed between Zach and Shaun, a bit rocky at times due to Zach's uncertainty and hesitancy, being all the more captivating for that reason.  This is a dramatically and visually pleasing, well-made if rather short film about a character portrayed as being gay who does not necessarily end up as a victim of a mental breakdown, suicide or murder.  There are several scenes in this movie that are quite affecting, most notably the two scenes in which his two straight friends -- his ex-girlfriend, Tori, and his boyhood surfing buddy, Gabe  -- each in their way help put Zach back on the right track toward his relationship with Shaun, his obvious true love.

Zach is, of course, the central character of the story and all of the other characters are defined by their relationships to him. There is essentially no scene in the film in which Zach doesn't appear and the title could easily have been ""Zach's Story.""  How the title of ""Shelter"" was chosen isn't exactly clear to me.  Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe, both straight actors, bring a degree of warmth and believability to their characters that is quite amazing.

Incidentally, in the commentary track, director Jonah Markowitz erroneously refers to the suspension bridge in San Pedro, shown several times in the film, as the Saint Thomas Bridge.  The correct name is the Vincent Thomas bridge.

UPDATE -- 7-11-14:  Well, I held off for as long as I could and finally gave in and bought into the imported region-free Blu-ray of ""Shelter.""  I  had some trepidation.  ""Shelter"" was originally shot as a 16 mm negative, blown up to a 35 mm print, so I expected the possibility of seeing little improvement with Blu-ray.  Not so at all!  The improvement in detail and contrast is apparent from the first frame.  The sound is DTS optional for 5.1 and 2.0 stereo and is an improvement over the DVD version in that respect as well.  And there was no compatibility problem.  Only disappointment -- it doesn't include the commentary track available on the original.  But I have the DVD version tucked into the same case with the Blu-ray, so no big deal.  Worth every cent.",1297468800,4,4787,4.766990291262136

Jan 2011. Since I wrote my review, I've viewed a bunch of gay-themed movies. And it's really hard to find a nice, well-acted, directed, gay love story. This is more a coming out/love story but it's still sooooo nice. And tops the list of gay movies. I feel it's up there with Latter Days, Just Say Love, Thirteen or So Minutes (a short film), All Over the Guy and Antartica (I liked how straight forward the movie showed gay relationships).

His life wasn't easy by any means and he made major sacrifices for his family. The struggles the characters encountered were very real and relevant.

I have since watched the film many times at home, again introducing as many people as I could to it.

My opinion of the film has, since recently, changed ever so slightly though.

I'm not sure the film was nearly as brilliant as i (and judging by the reviews on Amazon everyone else who saw it) thought it was.

If you think about it, the story isn't that original, virtually every gay film of the last 10 years sings the same tune. And while Shelter is better executed than most other films of this genre (both gay and straight), its inherent weakness shows as the film caves in on itself mid way (as soon as the first obstacle arises)

Despite this, I do still believe that Shelter is worth seeing, as mentioned, the film is well made. The direction in the first half is sturdy, the cinematography, although hardly sublime, places you as the viewer in the perfect mood, and I loved most of the music used. The actors did exactly what was necessary to pull Shelter off, and after watching, it feels as though they are still there.

Most importantly the characters are well written, something that is tragically missing in most films of this kind.

3104800,4,B0013D8LCW,"Every now and then you want a movie which makes you feel good, and which requires no profound internal analysis thereof. All that is expected of you is to involve yourself in a story which unfolds in way which is both calming and desirable. 'Shelter' is one such movie, which has as one of its best selling points, the 'normal' characters. Perhaps it is profound that the gay characters in this movie, are 'normal' in that they are love struck, confused, and yet function as every other person in society. They are not dying of Aids, nor are they subject to the frivolity of stereotypical gay casting. There is no neurosis, but rather an honest exploration of emotions. These gay men work, surf and love.

Most pleasing is the peace they find within themselves, despite how other characters react to their relationship. In short, a wonderful portrait of an alternative love, coloured in a way which sensitive without being condescending or stereotypical.",1277424000,2,954,4.888888888888889
3104801,5,B0013D8LCW,"I just recently started renting gay movies online. I never have before because so many of them are just campy, soft porn or just about the same thing (guys trying to get laid). Shelter is one movie which has made me very glad I did start renting this genre. The first thing that made me interested was, of course, the main characters. (Shaun is my ideal dream man.) But, after I started watching the movie, I realized there was so much more to it than the usual hot actors. I'm usually not too impressed with the storyline in a lot of the movies I watch because so many of them are the same thing over and over. Shelter immediately drew me in and made me want to watch more. So seldom do you see any romantic movies that show such compassion, challenge, sacrifice and realistic day-to-day struggles. I couldn't help but want everything to start going well for Zach, especially after he ran into Shaun. Zach had such responsibilities and character for someone so young. His sacrificing his dream of being an artist so he could take care of his nephew really touched my heart. I could definitely relate to the difficulties he had coming out to his friends and family. The movie was well written. The chemistry was off the charts. The character development was very well done. This is a movie I would truly want my friends and family (both gay and straight) to watch. It was a movie that left me with that happy lumpy feeling in my chest and the sparkle of happy tears in my eyes. It will definitely be in my ""Favorites"" section of my movies.",1277164800,3,1539,4.460992907801418
3104802,5,B0013D8LCW,"I'm so jealous of young gay men today!  They get to go to the movies and see gay characters that are three dimensional and well-developed; homosexuality is just one aspect of their personalities and not necessarily their defining characteristics.  Gone are the campy clowns, ubiquitous drag queens, and tragic AIDS victims that were required in the movies I grew up watching.  In movies like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Shelter"", the story is about two people falling in love who happen to be gay, which results in a much more realistic movie, and one which a wider audience can, I think, appreciate.

The photography in ""Shelter"" is absolutely top-notch.  I used to live in L.A., and I have never seen so many beautiful sunsets in my life!  The surf photography makes you want to run out and buy a board immediately and the footage while the actors are driving makes you feel like you are in the car with them.  I think there is enough creative camera-work to keep any fan of independent films happy.  Watch for how the shots of ""Zach's"" art transition smoothly into shots of buildings in the film, underlining the the title.

I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of acting in this film.  Whenever I see a movie in which the gay characters are portrayed by straight actors, I must admit I watch with a critical eye, but Brad Rowe and especially Trevor Wright, do an excellent job here.  They really portray the intimacy between their characters, not just the lust.  My favorite scene is when they are just lying in bed talking, and you can see in Zach's eyes how this relationship has become ""shelter"" from the stress of his life.  I also love how Trevor Wright appears 16 when he is happily looking at Brad Rowe's character, but looks like he's pushing thirty when burdened by the weight of expectations from others.  Tina Holmes also does a terrific job; somehow you feel sympathy for her character despite the terrible choices she makes.

I guess I'm biased, because this film is now one of my all-time favorites!  I could, and will, watch it over and over again.  A critic quoted on the DVD package calls this film an ""instant classic"", and I am in complete agreement because I believe gay men 10 years from now will be able to appreciate it just as much as we can today.",1276041600,5,2286,4.632754342431761

He is stuck in a painful life.  He escapes by surfing, by doing art when he can and by taking care of his nephew Cody (Jackson Wurth).  Change comes when he falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe).

This story is brilliantly written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  It fits together beautifully with no false notes.  Though all of the actors are excellent, I would like to single out Trevor Wright.  He was able to show a young man with his emotions on hold and then show the intense joy experienced by the same young man when he finds love.  Extraordinary.

The actors are phenomenal, and several scenes and the scenery can take your breath away.  The montages should have editing awards and the sound track is so wonderful if you are any thing like me you will start looking for Shane Mack's CDs.

  Love is a powerful emotion and in this movie, Jonah Markowitz (writer/director) takes you to all the corners of it.  From the young man who has loved his family so unconditionally that his wants and needs are never thought about.  To the friends he has loved, cherished and respected.  And especially to the man he comes to love who teaches him what it's like to be on the receiving end and valued for the person he is first.

  I'm a 47 year old woman who has been reading romance books for almost 30 of those years.  It's rare for any movie to capture so many sides love.  I see praises for this movie as the best gay romance.  That is almost an insult to this movie, to limit it as such.  This is one of the best romance (happy ending) movies I have seen in a very, very long time.  If you're looking for a romance that will bring many emotions to the surface look no more.
BUY WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER, I HAVE!!!

It has grown on me since I first saw it and it's one of my 2 favorite ""gay movies"" - but I definitely don't think you need to be gay to like it.  (The other favorite is a French film, ""Just a Question of Love"".)  The dramatic tension in the story is based on simple, generally realistic connections and relationships between people.  Although it is didactic, it doesn't rely on or need melodrama or common gay stereotypes to produce impact; and you'd have to be pretty cynical and jaded not to be affected by it.  The story and characters are engaging, the acting is good, the production quality is good, the screenplay is pretty good, and the soundtrack supports the feel of the film.  Technically it's not a 5 star film, but it has qualities that work for me and raise it above the ordinary.  In short, Shelter is beautiful and heart-warming in its simplicity.",1268697600,,1012,4.451086956521739

What makes it work however, are the repsponsibilites he assumes for his family and the tensions that arise when he can no longer deny his loneliness for another male.  This comes in the form of his best friend's older brother.  The warmth of their relationship is beautifully wrought.  One begins to feel that there's a future waiting for this young man, even as he wrestles with his responsiblities at home and the desires that awaken him to the promises that life holds.

3104824,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is about Zach, a guy who just graduated high school and now is at a crossroads for his future. For a long time, he's been a father figure for his nephew, Cody, and he's been trying to be a good boyfriend for his on-again, off-again girlfriend. Meanwhile, he really wants to break free from it all and pursue his dream of becoming an artist. To make things even more confusing, he discovers he is gay when he begins hanging out with his friend's older brother.

Shelter is a wonderful movie because it's not just a ""gay movie."" Zach being gay is only one of the beautifully interwoven conflicts of this movie, not the only one. In addition, the intimate scenes are done tastefully and are not hardcore (which might be a detriment to some, but I think it helps preserve the art-like feel to it). It seems to me to be very realistic and enjoyable to watch. One minor thing which may be a problem for some is that there is quite a bit of swearing. Not a big deal for me, personally, but something that may bother others.

I'd recommend buying this movie because it has definite replay value and I'd suggest anyone watch it, not just LGBT supporters.",1263686400,,1153,4.459715639810427

3104828,3,B0013D8LCW,"I was disappointed after finishing this movie, especially after all the rave reviews.  Maybe it's just me, but why are there so many gay movies with the same types of plots?  Homophobia, AIDS, coming out...always seems to be the same boring sort of thing.  This movie was mainly the coming out and homophobia storyline.  It is 2009 - most gay guys I know are out and the majority of straight people I know are OK with it.

How about we finally make a movie focused on true love, sensuality, good times between gay characters without any of the conflicted feelings of coming out or dealing with homophobic idiots?  I was expecting that in this but there are very few moments of romance in this movie and most of them are ruined by someone who seems to be uncomfortable with actually getting out of that frickin closet or by his homophobic sister.

I felt bad for Shawn as if he deserved to be treated a lot better instead of having to deal with a straight/gay split personality type that is more focused on pleasing his stupid homophobic, irresponsible sister (that isn't very nice by the way) than throwing himself into a relationship that is very real, very loving and supportive, and could be so much more.  In the end, it was just an OK movie, a lot like other gay movies I've seen.  Might be worth a rent, but not worth buying.",1260230400,5,1331,4.4896265560165975

3104830,5,B0013D8LCW,"Viewing Shelter was like watching a miracle unfold before my eyes. While staying at a friend's house over the Thanksgiving holiday, serendipity intervened and allowed me to catch this sublimely acted and beautifully nuanced piece.  I don't think I'll ever be the same.

To me, what often separates the good from the great when it comes to film is that good movies manage to come up with something new while great movies are able to make standard material, even the highly cliched (boy meets boy/girl), seem completely original, authentic, and fresh. Shelter definitely falls under the latter description. What is miraculous is that it went a step further by having the narrative, music, and visuals completely wash over the viewer - like surfing a giant wave. The result is a sense that the film is an intimate chronicle of one's own journey for affirmation and acceptance, even if the details of one's life are completely different.

Just in time for the holidays, this DVD definitely tops my Christmas Wish List but in more ways than one: The soundtrack is beyond amazing and I hope to own that soon. Although I typically avoid movies that are made out of books, I would love to see the reverse take place and have a book made out of this movie. (It could be fictitiously penned by and written from the perspective of the character of Shaun, since he was a writer.) I also hope to see a sequel or a TV series even. I've read dismissive comparisons to the O.C., but if the Here! network (or any courageous channel) needed to put a contemporary spin on the typical family drama, I think this would be a great launching point. I kept yearning to see more as the characters moved forward with their lives and their relationships matured.

One could tell that everyone involved in the production, cast and crew, were totally invested in making the film. It's easy to understand why audience members like myself have been pulled in so passionately and completely.",1259452800,4,1959,4.752941176470588

It was realizing that it was better to live honestly, be true to your nature, and of overcoming one's fears. I was impressed by the simplicity of the scenes and the richness in their content.  I liked the choice of neighborhoods and the lack of pretentiousness.

Heck, [...]would of even been worth it.  This is one of my favorite romance films, gay or straight, and even though the technical presentation on the DVD is a bit underwhelming (the picture is soft, but the sound is fine, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1), that would be an invalid reason to miss a great of film as this.

If you are buying this DVD solely with the purpose of demoing your Home Theater system in the terms of picture quality, you'll be a bit disappointed.  But who am I kidding?  This isn't some action flick or a ridiculously high budget and loud special effects extravaganza.",1252368000,,961,4.558139534883721
3104836,4,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter doesn't rise to the level of great filmmaking but it's a really nicely made movie that's heart-warming and ultimately enjoyable to watch. To be sure, the script has too many ""dudes"" and ""bros"" and lots of guys catching waves. But it's no more a surfer movie that Brokeback Mountain was a cowboy movie. Surely that's part of the storytelling vehicle, but it's the human interactions that matter.

The other downside is that director Jonah Markowitz could have made a sexier film without crossing the line into soft porn. Shelter is tamer sexually than it needs to be. Honestly, would two guys who'd made love all night wake up together the next morning wearing underwear?

I occasionally found the music soundtrack somewhat distracting, even though some of the songs were good.

Still, Shelter is well-made film with a fairly good script, fine performances and excellent cinematography and film editing. The surfing and ocean scenes were beautifully filmed and edited.

So what if it has a somewhat predictably happy ending? Not every story of gay men ends with tragedy or heartbreak. This film deals with subject matter about which I'm personally familiar - dealing with your own sexuality and trying to decide your own future while playing father figure to your sister's offspring.

Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is caring and sensitive while being tough at the same time. His art and his surfing are his escapes from the realities of every day life.

Shaun, played by Brad Rowe, has returned home to lick his wounds after the breakup of his relationship but finds himself falling for Zach, the best friend of his younger brother Gabe. Shaun taught Gabe and Zach to surf and its surfing that brings Shaun and Zach together.

The movie shows how conflicted Zach is about his sexuality. There's the moment when after a night of drinking together he allows Shaun to kiss him, only to wake the next morning running away from what happened. He returns the stares of another surfer in a beach parking lot, but turns away when he becomes uncomfortable. He becomes standoffish with Shaun each time he gets questions about his sexuality from his sister Jeanne, with whom he lives and whose he is father figure.

He initially gives in, but backs away when he's unsure of how to deal with all the pressures in his life while loving another man.

Shaun is patient, but I don't believe overly so. There are moments when Shaun pushes for what he wants but backs away when he realizes he's pushing too hard.

Overall, I see places where some improvements could have made this good movie into an excellent one. Still, it is a good, very enjoyable movie and one worth adding to your DVD collection.",1251763200,4,2691,4.817787418655097

That is so awesome!!! I'm glad they made a movie like this to show how gays really are. We're not ""perverts"" as we are often portrayed but real ""normal"" people like anyone else with feelings, connections, etc. I especially loved the ending as well.

The usual conflicts of being homosexual with prejudices and hesistation come into play, but the story is told so authentically that this movie is a keeper.",1245110400,4,560,4.683673469387755

3104863,4,B0013D8LCW,"""Shelter"" has a lot going for it.  An interesting and credible screenplay, an attractive and professional cast, some excellent surfing action footage and impressive outdoor settings.  Most of all, it succeeds in establishing characters that the viewer comes to care about a great deal.  The story goes well beyond some of the usual gay coming of age genre flicks.  It avoids soft porn titillation and sexual fantasy in favor of presenting the developing affection between the two lead characters--Zach and Shaun.  And it does not pretend that there are not other things going on in those characters' lives.  In the case of Zach, a major load of family obligations while facing of a bleak future.

The film also demonstrates--pretty accurately in California, at least--the transition from rejection to unconditional acceptance that gay and lesbian people are seeing these days.  The unquestioning reassurance that best friend Gabe (Shaun's brother) gives to Zach is touching and, I think, not unrealistic for that generation.  This is repeated later by Torrey, Zach's girlfriend.  This kind of acceptance was unimaginable for most gay people 20 or even 15 years ago.  It is extremely touching and gratifying to see it expressed now.

""Shelter"" is a very good indie film that fully deserves its apparent success.  There have been many gay genre films that have covered the same material but without the skill and sensitivity that are present in this film.  ""Shelter"" sets a kind of standard that I hope will be regularly exceeded in the future as gay-themed stories receive the kind of mainstream production that they might deserve.",1240185600,3,1630,5.14828897338403
3104864,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is a defining film for the gay community and stands shoulder to shoulder with Brokeback Mountain. For all the criticism about its imperfections on plot line and lack of sexual content, the movie depicts an ordinary situation for a young disenfranchised man with raw talents and suppressed aspirations. Movie critics were looking for gay stereotypes in such films, and the lack of it should be celebrated as a hallmark that the time of acceptance has come to mainstream markets.

Trevor Wright delivers a masterful performance as a rebellious, dissatisfied artist with a confused sexuality. He embodies the angst of someone having to put off his dreams and goals for the betterment of others. The camaraderie between him and Brad Rowe is easy and believable. The scenes of intimacy speaks to a couple who has found a connection beyond sexuality and physical needs. Through a simple smile, a look of trust, and a gentle caress, Trevor has conveyed what gay relationships (or any romantic relationships) are really about - connecting with that one individual that makes you feel like the top of the world every day.

By portraying intimacy rather than lust, this movie has successfully recast sexuality as an aspect rather than the entire identity of a person. That assertion in itself makes this a brave film by refusing to bend to perceived gay norms. It is no wonder that this movie had consistent connected with people old and young, gay and straight, rich and poor - the truth is powerful. Look no further than the hundreds of positive Youtube reviews for confirmation.

I hope that Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe will get more work - they have truly done gay and lesbians a service by doing this film and should be rewarded somehow.",1240099200,7,1740,4.8915254237288135

This touching, romantic, and, at times, heartbreaking story is now one of my absolute favorites, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a thoughtful and poignant story about life and about love- the real kind.",1240099200,,595,4.570093457943925

3104867,4,B0013D8LCW,"This is just one of those rare great movies you'll find in gay cinema.  It has a story that is unique and poignant, great writing, and some great acting.

What it's missing is the sexual tension.  I don't see those looks of lust between Zack and Sean.  When they're not in bed together, they act as if they're two straight guys hanging out.  Yes, it's clear that they learn to deeply care for each other and be vulnerable - but that's not lust.  Every moment leading up to the make-out session is without sexual tension.  No lingering looks or ever so slightly too long touches.  Not that we need that to be over-the-top, but we something - anything!  People that are about to hook-up need to look to each other as if they're wanting each other -- which they don't.  Frankly, it just seems under-rehearsed.

Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright never seem to take on their characters as whole different people than who they, themselves as the actors, are.  The way they walked, moved, spoke -- it just didn't seem that there was any stretching or altering of themselves to play these characters.  They never change their own individual vocal patterns or posture to become different characters.  We've all seen many straight men play gay characters.  But this was the first time I was really just not buying it. I didn't believe either of them were gay.  I understand and appreciate not wanting to ""act gay,"" but all gay men have this look about them that says they've been through repression and hard-times.  They just didn't.  It's hard to explain - but it wasn't there. This resulted in the sex scenes' passion to be mediocre -- hot, but mediocre.

In addition, I got a distinct feeling that the Zack/Sean relationship needed to be explored and analyzed more by these actors.  I saw an interview where Rowe said that he got the script three days before filming.  It shows.

Sadly, it's the film's star, Trevor Wright, who never really rises to the occasion in his acting.  He never seems to truly makes Markowitz's lines his own for most of the movie.  He never fleshes-out a character that would really speak these lines.  All his subtexts and actions seemed very directed and mannered.  It was clear that he did a lot of work as an actor to understand Zack's story, but rarely did I see the inner torment a gay man who's scared to come-out goes through.  It just wasn't enough to really succeed.

Brad Rowe is an incredibly natural actor - making Markowitz's words his own and really come to life.  We grew to like Sean and feel he was a real person.

Tina Holmes was the stand-out actor of this film.  She embodied Jeannie, made her relatable, and earned our understanding and sympathy.  We can tell she understood and empathized with the character's situation.  She's a great actress and did a phenomenal job.

In the end, it's because the film is so touching that makes the audience root for it.  It touches any romantic's heart.  I highly recommend that everyone watch this.  Slightly critical of this movie, I was.  Disappointed, I absolutely wasn't.",1239753600,2,3050,4.652908067542214

3104882,5,B0013D8LCW,"This film is tone perfect.  What amazes me is how authentic it feels, whether we are watching surfers, ""dudes"" around the campfire and their girlfriends, the life of a short-order cook and devoted uncle, or two young men falling in love.  It made my heart ache, just like real life sometimes.

Beyond the romantic love story, the film is a testimonial to family love:  kindness, loyalty, tolerance and solidarity.  Without making a too-obvious statement, it delivers the highly political message that gay men have a place in family life and, in some cases, are the anchor for everyone else.  The main character, Zach, never questions the rightness or inevitability of his commitment to his nephew and his sister, and although several other characters talk about his making a ""choice,"" we see (and he tells us) that it is a given, not a choice.  In view of the circumstances he faces -- nowhere job, collapsing home environment, impossible future -- he is truly heroic just to carry on.  It is inspiring to see him struggling to find love for himself while meeting all of the standards he has set for himself with respect to others.

Trevor Wright's performance is extraordinary.  He seems so completely natural that it doesn't feel as if he is acting at all.  Since this is the only time I've ever seen him, I can only wonder whether he could bring the same conviction to another role, but he totally inhabits this one.  The subtle ways that his character expresses his affection for the little boy are credible and affecting.  He is very likeable and lovable.

3104884,5,B0013D8LCW,"The plot synopses of other reviewers will have to do for those who want to know more about the movie's storyline. A couple of weeks ago, I found myself in a bookshop where the movie was being rented by someone, and told them ""You will LOVE this movie. It's agonizingly slow and sometimes painful, yet the ending is WELL worth sitting through the painful parts [painful as we see Zach's character going through his own changes in the way he sees the world and himself]."" I have since purchased the movie through Amazon.com, and am waiting on its delivery, and have bought the music soundtrack. All of the laudatory comments in favor of this movie here may be a bit much, yeah [especially so if you read as many of them as I just did] but I believe ""Shelter"" deserves it. The story could not be more realistic, I believe, as it is portrayed through the two male leads, and - the other reviewers are right when they say it - the eyes say more and better than words ever could, in real life OR on the silver screen.

A now ages-old phrase - ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" - can be honestly paraphrased for this movie, ""Truth is far more endearing than fiction,"" as ""Shelter"" portrays something we see hardly anywhere from Hollywood, and that is characters that are not caricatures, and portrayed by people who are not being picked for star-power, rather, people who are talented, assisting in bringing us a story worth watching, and caring about. By the way, if you are prone to tears, I would suggest watching it with some tissues at hand, as it has a tendency to evoke some ""wet"" moments.

Five stars for ""Shelter,"" and definitely a ""heads-up!!!"" for the music from the film!!! The music alone brings tears to my eyes, but the movie?!?!? All I can say is ""WOW!!!"" I have listened to the CD repeatedly for a solid week now, and only have the 1 CD in my car. Shane Mack's voice - especially so on ""Lie to Me"" - may honestly ""haunt"" you, as it has me.

3104891,5,B0013D8LCW,"I'm being a little funny with my review title (in reference to the surfer lingo) but the fact is, this is one of the best gay-themed films out there. Many of the positive reviews put out here are right on the mark. I'm not sure I can add much to them except to say that this movie seems REAL. Ok, so it may be somewhat predictable, but this is how people talk and act and how life turns out sometimes. The cool thing about it is that it is definitely uplifting. The chemistry between the lead guys is amazing.

Some of the criticisms in here are much too nitpicky. I mean, how do we know that Zach didn't park his car a few blocks away from Shaun and Gabe's house when he went to see Shaun again (thinking that Gabe could show up anytime). This isn't a detective story, where you try to figure out everything that happens that is not shown on film! And I personally didn't understand Zach's artwork, but so what? That was his passion. And someone wrote about a 'scholarship for an child'??  Did they see the same movie?! Not even in the plot!

This is one definitely to watch, and I can pretty much guarantee that if you see it once, you'll want to see it over and over. More films of this nature need to be made.",1234051200,,1213,4.197424892703863

A common criticism of the movie is that its too short.

Trevor Wright is perfect for this role.  Brad Rowe is a sincere and sympathetic character.  You really get sense of how much he loved Zach and most importantly respected his choices. The script, the locations and the actors are incredible! I recommend it.

Brad Rowe's fans ought to check out this documentary titled My Big Break, if you haven't yet.  It's about his life and was quite surprising to watch.

They seemed uncomfortable in some of the kissing scenes and like they couldn't wait to get it over with.  That said, it's a very enjoyable story about real people, real lives and real love.  The two leads are appealing and have great chemistry. Tina Holmes is a terrific actress and does a great job as the unlikeable, self centered mother who doesn't much care about her kid.  Though at the end, she also does a good job of showing the character as conflicted and sad, and lets a little of her ""mom"" side through.

3104912,5,B0013D8LCW,"This is a simple story about a young man following his heart and finding his dreams. Zach (Trevor Wright) is working class, with a crappy job as a short-order cook, an on again/off again relationship with Tori (Katie Walder), a very sick widowed father, and a feckless, self-centred single mother of a sister (Tina Holmes) whose only redeeming feature is her adorable five-year-old Cody (Jackson Wurth). Zach is Cody's only real male role model, and not surprisingly, Cody looks up to him as a father, not an uncle.

Zach has a lot of responsibilities, and since his hope of going to art school died when his mother did, and his sister got pregnant, his only joys in life are his friends and his surfing. He's aware, much more so than his privileged best friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), or his sister Jeanne, how much of life is passing him by, and what he's given up for his family, but there seems no way out. Until Gabe's handsome, gay older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe), returns to Malibu and doors open, along with Zach's heart.

I've seen reviews of this film which call it  mediocre and unambitious. Seems to me that misses the point. It's not a story of high drama. It's about small things - ordinary family dysfunctionality, ordinary dreams, ordinary love. The extraordinariness lies in Zach's selflessness and Shaun's willingness to help him out of the hole in which he's drowning. What makes this film work is the beautiful, affectionate tenderness between the two leads (both straight actors turning in gorgeous and credible performances as young gay men in love), and the strength of the acting on all sides. Every character rang true - and when even the kid didn't strike me as stupidly cute, there has to be something working. I especially loved the character of Tori, who could have come off as a heinous bitch, but was instead a rounded and likable friend to her ex-boyfriend.

Tina Holmes as Jeanne has a thankless task in an unpleasant role, but she is pitch perfect as the emotionally manipulative and immature mother and sister. Her scenes with  Trevor Wright are painfully honest. But then Wright just shines in this. He and Rowe have such chemistry together, such physical easiness - you see them as friends and as lovers, and they felt completely real to me.

It's a short film at an hour and a half, and though it takes a while to get going, it's well worth the wait, and is a positive, happy affirming portrayal of young gay people that allows them a happy ending. That in itself makes it worth the price of admission/purchase.",1230249600,8,2547,4.712359550561798
3104913,5,B0013D8LCW,"First of all, I want to be on record as SWEARING that Brad Rowe is actually the love child of Brad Pitt and Rob Lowe... just look at him!!!

This is an easy film to like.  Much of the conflict that drives the story is internal for the characters.  The young lead is quite a good actor, displaying those conflicts with his expressions more than his words - just like most college aged boys would do.  He moves between the freedom and joy of surfing and the challenges of lower socio-economic existance.  He struggles with relationships, challenged by his desire for honesty and his fear of the consequences that truth will bring.  And through it all we see him growing, in realistic ways.

I do think the movie fails in any type of exploration of the meaning of relationships between younger and older men (if early 30's can qualify as older).  I never did quite figure out the time span covered in the film, but decided I'd like the film best if it is months rather than weeks.

The surfing and waves make great symbols of change, control, collapse.  The always sunny Southern California setting adds a quality of its own, whether at the multi-million dollar house or the places next to the refineries.

The most effective mesage taken away from the movie is how true love, if between lovers, friends, family is inclusive.  It is neediness that blocks those not seen as the fount of that satisfaction.

All a little esoteric.  This movie is a pleasure to watch.  The extras, particularly the ""making of"", add a lot of value.  Though, I gotta say, I still get bummed out when straight actors, even the gorgeous ones, get to play the solid gay characters.  Yeah, I know.  I want the gay actors to be able to play straight characters, and I should be consistant.  But, I am not.",1230163200,3,1775,4.542586750788644

3104918,5,B0013D8LCW,"I love this movie. I'm not interested in either surfing or California, but that's no handicap to enjoying ""Shelter,"" because what it's really about is relationships. The screenplay is sharp and believable, the pace is exactly right, the story is engaging without being too melodramatic, and the ending is both very happy and completely believable, unusual and welcome in a gay movie.

Brad Rowe's performance is fine and understated, appropriate for the slightly older and more experienced lover, and Trevor Wright is amazing in a strong, intense, very intelligent performance. I'd never heard of him before, but I'll be looking for more.

I'm glad to see such talented straight actors willing and able to play gay in non-stereotyped roles. And I'm very grateful and surprised that neither man has the gym body that seems to be required in gay entertainment nowadays. It's so refreshing to see bodies that don't look like they've been tortured.

Tina Holmes as always is excellent, and Ross Thomas is very funny and sweet as the brother/best friend. But best of all are Jonah Markowitz's wonderful screenplay and direction.

Trevor Wright as Zach is phenomenol especially with how he can convey his feelings with a look or action and no words are spoken (most noticably the smile on the way home after the first night together and a hug with Shaun near the end)

Everyone was fantastic in this but I wanted to hit the sister character with a blunt object every time she opened her mouth, I absolutely detested her character but understand her importance to the movie (but I don't have to like it.)

3104931,4,B0013D8LCW,"I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: ""What does a film maker leave behind?"" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.

I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a ""Beatific Vision"", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.

As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.

When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.

When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.

Thank-you angels for this ""angels on earth"" experience!

3104934,5,B0013D8LCW,"I watched this movie almost like I would have watched a fairy-tale. Actually, considering, I would say Zach is a modern Cinderella... His desires always came second after his family's and he didn't even realize how much his sister (or his absent father for that matter) took him for granted. And when his chance to have a life eventually came his way he almost pushed it away. Felt bad for Shaun - who didn't deserve at all Zach's rebiffs and second thoughts - but oh, how understandable these second thoughts and self-guessing were...
It would be difficult to choose favourite moments in the movie. There were several - loved a lot the 'fast forward over few days' silent scenes - the first showing the beginning of Zach-Shaun relationship and the last one showing a glimpse of their and Cody's life, the touching moment of Zach's apology, the comic of almost-discovery by Gabe of our couple in bed and so many others.
And, if there was any doubt, there is a happy ending. To paraphrase a publishing site, maybe there is not the certitude of 'happily ever after' but there is absolute a 'happy ending for now'. Which, considering your own quota of optimism could easily be upgraded to 'ever after'.:-)
I highly recommend this movie. It will prove a very enjoyable entertainement and will leave you smiling happily at 'the end' moment.

However, there are puzzling flaws in the backstory that cause a good deal of the film to seem contrived.  For example, the chances of an eight year old student earning a scholarship to a wealthy private school seems unlikely.  Do scholarships even exist at the grammar school level?  Or, how did Shaun come to know Zach's sister and mother well enough to comment about them as he did?  What kind of relationship existed between the two families that allowed a second grade Zach and Gabe to travel the significant distance between their homes in order for their deep brotherhood to develop? And, if Zach has visited Gabe at college only once in the four years since high school, how close could they possibly remain?

3104951,4,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter was touted as being the next Brokeback Mountain when I first read reviews.  I wouldn't say it's quite to that level but it is a nice story.  I also like the fact that it's a gay themed movie focused on a love story without the need of nudity (much to the chagrin of some I'm sure).  It's this type of movie that I feel will have a more positive influence on society's acceptance of the gay community.

It's a story about a young guy who is either closeted or unaware of his gay nature until that one special person comes into his life.  It shows his struggle of accepting himself while also showing the fear he experiences while contemplating what effect the revelation of his discovery will have on his family...especially his relationship with his nephew who has come to revere him as a father.  He tries to force a heterosexual relationship but ultimately can't escape his emotional and sexual attraction to someone he's known throughout his life.  It shows the level of emotional stress that he faces not only with his sexuality but also with the support that he must provide to his family.  The complexity of the emotions is a struggle that many of us in the gay community can relate to.

3104953,2,B0013D8LCW,"I respectfully disagree with most of the other people who have commented about how great this movie is.  My personal opinion is that the bar for gay cinema has been so lowered that this passes for greatness; it really doesn't.

It's true that the film doesn't indulge in gay stereotypes:  that is, there's no campy/effete/flamboyant character to epitomize what it ""is"" to be a gay man.  The gay men in this film drink beer, and they surf.

But all the other stereotypes are there in spades.  Zach's best friend, another surfer dude, who laments ""Oh, why wouldn't you come out to me?  I'm your best friend!""  (Listen to how he refers to his gay brother and decide whether you want to be defined by your sexuality like that from then on.)  Zach's sister, who naturally doesn't want to raise her child around some ""fag,"" but who changes her mind after one impassioned speech.  And Zach's ex-girlfriend, remarkably tolerant of the fact that the guy she last slept with has moved on to sleep with guys.

Zach himself is not a gay stereotype; instead, he is an ""indie movie"" stereotype.  The troubled kid with a heart of gold who loves his family and his nephew sooooo much that he refuses to ever call his sister (mother of the nephew) out on how poorly she's raising the kid.  In almost every scene she's in, Zach's sister is busing imposing upon him to take care of Zach while she goes off galavanting with her new boyfriend who, oddly, doesn't like her kid.  The exceptions are one scene when she's loudly making out with the new boyfriend while her son is asleep, and when she's imposing on Zach to take the kid for six months to a year while she moves to another city with the boyfriend.  (For some reason, the ENTIRE CITY PROHIBITS THE INTRODUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO ITS BORDERS.)  Zach never once complains, but instead sucks it all up, giving up portions of his social life and definitely giving up his dream of going to art school on a full scholarship.

3104960,5,B0013D8LCW,"I am gay, but I dislike most of the gay movies out there. There are only a few exception: Brokeback Mountain, Borstal Boys and Beautiful Thing. All other gay movies are always victims to one of the followings: being too sensitive, or too chatty, or too corny. This is certainly an exception: no drag queens, no drugs, no gay bars, no AIDS victim, no party boys. And it's thoroughly refreshing.

Enough good thing have been said about this movie, which is now in my very short list of favorite gay movies. A lot of reviews give credit to Trevor Wright for his excellent performance. Credit well deserved. However, I think director Jonah Markowitz deserve the most credit for putting together a movie in which everything feels so natural and real.

The best part of this movie is the dialogue: It's short, precise and yet powerful. For example: the dialogue on the patio after their dinner:

Shawn: ""I admire what you are doing for Cody. You don't have to.""
Zach: ""Yes. I do.""
Shawn: ""It's a choice, Zach.""
Zach: ""It's family.""
Zach: ""The only one left.""
Shawn: ""You get that from your mom.""
Zach: ""Yeah, I know.""
Zach: ""Lucky me.""

This is a simply love story. Even though the word ""Love"" was never said in the movie, there was never one moment of doubt how much they were in love. There are lots of little things in the movie that you will recognize if you were ever in love. When Zach was driving away after his first night with Shawn, a little smile slowly crept up his face, and he just couldn't hold it anymore, and scratched his head for getting a little embarassed on the silly happiness.

Shane Mack also deserves high praises for the songs he wrote for this movie. When Zach couldn't fall asleep, flipping back and forth, the images of him with Shawn were flashing through his head. The moment wouldn't have such an emotional impact without Shane Mack's ""More Than This"" playing in the background.

The negatives I can think of is that for someone who's never been with a guy, Zach was quite adept in stripping off Shawn's cloths that night. Also, Gabe would have seen Zach's truck outside when he barged in, and he's not the kind of person who wouldn't say anything about it. Sorry, I know I am nitpicking. But if you are like me watching this movie 10 times in the first week, you would be too. :-)

I do have one issue with the cover of the DVD. If I hadn't read its review first to know what the movie is about, I would have easily dismissed it as another soft-core gay porn that's dressed up as a movie. There could be a hundred moments in the movie that would be a better cover than this bed shot. I have to believe that it wasn't picked by the director who has handled everything so tastefully without losing the erotic force. Thanks to AfterElton.com that listed it as the #3 of all time greatest gay movies, I didn't miss now-my-favorite gay movie that's not a tragedy (BBM and Borstal Boys) or a fairy tale (Beautiful Thing).

In my opinion, David Wiegand from SF Chronicle has the best review on this movie: ""Sometimes a film that otherwise relies on stock storylines and even skirts the fringes of old-fashioned melodrama can rise up on the strength of other elements. In the case of writer/director Jonah Markowitz's feature film debut, ""Shelter"" rises very high indeed, thanks to a superb performance by Trevor Wright in the lead role, a strong supporting cast, very good cinematography and, most of all, emotional authenticity.""

It was great to see a movie which wasn't steeped in gay culture,  that was about normal people going through hardships and while doing so discovering who they where and where they wanted to go in life.  The story follows Zach, a young man who instead of going to college, stayed behind to watch over his sister and her son.  His sister is a poor mother, leaving Zach to fill the parental role for his young nephew all the while trying to express himself through his art and surfing.  When his best friend's older brother Shaun  comes back into town for a month,  Zach begins to discover himself and driven by Shaun, starts to go after a better life than the one he had chosen.",1220659200,,732,4.268115942028985
3104963,5,B0013D8LCW,"I have been watching this movie incessantly for the last three weeks.
What I enjoy about this movie the most is the lack of big dramatic acting, which invariably is used in modern day cinema by actors cast to play in mildly-unrealistic to completely-incredible roles. Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright are great enough actors to make the story feel like watching a real life situation.

The bulk of the emotion in this movie is told in the actors' facial expressions. Scenes in this movie in which Zach is attempting to deal with the inner turmoil of his newly-revealed sexuality, would have been tainted and unbearable if they had been filled with exaggerated and unnecessary words. Instead you can see/feel the insult and hurt felt when Trevor Wright's he frowns, nose crunched, and in his eyes you can believe the character is thinking something along the lines of ""Please God, just give me a hole to crawl into.""

In addition because there is so much unspoken passion in this movie it makes it all the more compelling when Zach raises his voice, which happens all of three times. The first time, his sister confronts him about his relationship with Shaun and the potential detriment to her son. Zach's immediate response is defiant, a statement that he is standing up to his sister for the first time. It is an indication that the character is beginning to grow out of submission.

The second time, Gabe confronts him about his relationship with Shaun. Blindsighted and unprepared to deal with this reality, Zach raises his voice to his best friend in defense. You can see that Gabe doesn't exactly know how to comfort his friend either and immediately backs down, without letting him know that he does not wish to lose their friendship over this.

The third time, in the final scene, Jeanne's boyfriend demeans Zach's would-be-son. At this point the audience is clear on the fact that while most of the character's growth has involved his sexuality, most of the character's LIFE has revolved around his nephew. To hear this abrasive, offensive NOTHING attack Cody like this is too much after everything that Zach has been through, and Zach lashes out with a passion that actually brought a tear to my eye. We should all have someone who cares about us so.

The worst example of acting in this movie comes from the character of Billy, who has all of three lines in the darkness by a fire, and is merely there to establish the aspect that Zach's friends' lives continue to move on while his own remains fairly static.

Not a single word, facial expression, or stance is wasted in this movie. And if you're a straight guy who is afraid of GLBT-themed movies out of discomfort at seeing full frontal male nudity, have no fear.

This movie was quite different.  The movie actually had actors and actresses that could, um.....ACT! Straight or gay in real life is so unimportant especially when you can pull it off like these guys(and girls).

3105008,5,B0013D8LCW,"As always in 'gay themed' movies there is the definite temptation to play the party boy/drug user/AID victim card. It's incredibly refreshing to find a movie that doesn't pander to traditional gay male stereotypes. There have been a lot of things said here about this movie already, some incredibly insightful. Rather than try to struggle for the usual explicatives, I'll just say how & why this movie moved and touched my soul.

There were a lot of plots and subplots going on here; poverty, desperate lives being crushed and yet there was always the glimmer of hope on the horizon, art, angst of coming out and the poignancy of first time/unconditional love. And of course, how utterly exquisite to truly portray how much a sport can mean to a male and how it can anchor us even in the craziest of times. Although my life has been somewhat different, I can relate to so many levels and pieces of this movie that it's scary and uncanny at the same time. All of it...to come out as an adult when formally you've been in hiding with all your friends, to catch that one last run of the day as you chase the sun...to have the freedom (for the first time) to really love somebody of the same sex that you were always meant to love in the first place. I lived this movie through both the main characters because I've been both the main characters as I lived through poverty with hopeless, broken dreams and a unwavering loyalty to 'family', while discovering true love in the midst of chaos and ashes.

And through it all, Zack's mural was his life; his frustration, his intense sadness, his trap, his love of family, the angst of being misunderstood by everyone and finally the sublime happiness of new-found love. It's all there, the life of a man painted on a wall for the world to witness and see.

This isn't a perfect movie by any means; the 'sex scene' was stilted and phony, yet the tender kissing scenes where as good as they can get. Truly, both the main actors are gifted to pull off such a believable gay love story.  But this is a movie that you have to take in it's entirety and not something subject to be picked apart scene by scene. There were times when I shouted at the screen and times when I teared up. The relationship with Shaun and Zack's little brother (Cody) was magnificently portrayed. It's not publicized enough how fluid and positive gay men can be around impressionable boys.  The homophobic ignorance portrayed is painfully accurate in this movie; with respect to how many parents/adults think that young boys hanging around with a gay role model is 'just not right'.

I've probably seen 150+ gay themed movies in the last three yrs and this one is absolutely in the top tier of my mental queue list. Rent it, buy it and just enjoy it!  God, please give us more movies like this one.",1216339200,13,2810,4.5305719921104535

3105012,5,B0013D8LCW,"Along with ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Yossi and Jaeger,"" Shelter takes its seat as a likable and pretty love story. This is the second movie about gay surfers I have seen along with the Australian flick ""Tan Line."" In what is considered a predominantly straight world, surfers, both of these movies explore the possibilities of gays among the ranks of these members.

There seem to be a great deal of reviewers with huge amounts of information about the movie so I am going to be brief. The movie is about the love that develops between two surfers Shaun (Brad Rowe) and Zack (Trevor Wright.) Zack comes from a dysfunctional family with a sister who is a single mother and her son Cody. Zack pretty much plays a father role to Cody and babysits him a lot. Shaun comes from a rich family who has a house by the beach. They both grew up together but Shaun being older than Zack. Shaun's brother is Zack's buddy.

Zack discovers he is gay after one night of drinking with Shaun. Shaun has just returned from LA who just broke with someone and was waiting to get a new place. Shaun kisses Zack and the turmoil begins.

Jeannie, Zack's sister, decides to move to Oregon with her new boyfriend. She dumps Cody on Zack. Zack finally comes to grips with his sexuality and decides to become a family with Shaun who adopts Zack and Cody.

Zack is a very talented artist who gets accepted to an Art College with a full scholarship. Shaun is a writer for Hollywood. And Jeannie abandons her son.

That is the movie in a shell. I like how Zack is portrayed as a caring, selfless, loving young man. The movie also projects that a men gay couple can be loving parents, that is definitely a plus.

This a good movie and a great love story. The men look very masculine, with Trevor Wright having that beautiful rough exterior. Wonderful cast and super job for the director.",1215475200,3,1852,4.497023809523809

3105016,5,B0013D8LCW,"Sometimes, rarely, after having watched dozens upon dozens of disappointing films, you get lucky and come across one that not only lives up to, but surpasses all the praise that more often than not was just hype anyways. And... also sometimes, you go back to watch it a second time just to see if your first impression was correct, and you are horrified to see that you were mistaken and that this is just a lousy film and you don't know what you were thinking. Have I sufficiently confused you? Then let me just say that this film, ""Shelter"", was one of the most beautiful, surprising, well acted, noble films I've ever seen. These actors, most of whom are either unknown or not ""stars"", are so, so much better than the small but undying, rotating, irritating crop of so called superstars that monopolize every churned out piece of Hollywood garbage. The performances here are so seamless, modest, and real, that you feel that you are watching just that, real life. Of course, watching real life can be boring, and what most actors and films of today completely fail at is to not only make the story interesting, but enables it to go beyond being entertainment to give it that intangible element of realism that  truly moves you. In this film you feel their pain, joy, loneliness, frustration,  and liberation in your very gut, and that is rare for  films today, especially a ""small' film that does not bang you over the head with special effects or try and bring a tear to your eye with overacting and ear splitting sweeping music.  Though this film has a gay story line, it is relevant to anyone who is alive, and it's message about love, loyalty, and being true to yourself is for everyone. I will not go on and i will not tell you the story line as plenty of other reviewers have already done this, and some of them very well.  I will only say that as a person who grew up loving the movies and having been disappointed in 95% of all the films made in the last 25 years, it is so refreshing, enjoyable, and heartening to come across a film as beautiful as this one. It is poetry. It is perfect. It hopefully makes some people aware that there are different and positive qualities that define a ""family."" It is the best film of it's kind that I have ever seen. And the actors, director, writer, etc..should all be extremely proud of their accomplishment, and, as a disheartened, quality- starved filmgoer, i thank them all.",1215043200,9,2427,4.54462242562929

The two form a friendship again even after knowing each other for years. The chemistry between them is awesome and the one....only one...(darn) heated love scene, is electrifying. It was a good movie. The only complaint I had was I wanted more good sexy fun between the two men, and less brow beating agony. But I do get the producers were looking for mainstream, and mainstream love to see gay men punish themselves...yawn. Buy it.

3105028,5,B0013D8LCW,"When Zack, a young man (one year, I think, out of high school) reconnects with his best friend's big brother (Shaun,) long-suppressed sparks cannot be contained.

However Zack is the one solid member of his dysfunctional and crumbling family: his father is injured, his mother is dead, and his sister is unconcerned and inattentive to her 5-year old son Cody.  Zack fulfills the parental role for Cody, although at times grudgingly, as he gives up hope for a better future on the other side of the tracks and resigns himself to a life of flipping burgers.

Suddenly Zack cannot suppress his feelings for Shaun, but nobody is really thrilled with the revelation that Zack might be gay.  Zack must decide between his own needs and dreams (whatever he decides they are) and the needs and requirements of his family.

3105047,5,B0013D8LCW,"Sure ""Shelter"" had its moments of conflict and drama, but this is one of a very few gay love stories I have seen that doesn't dwell too much on the dark side of gay life in the 21st century.

Zach is a talented artist from the wrong side of the tracks who has to take care of his ""family"": A neglectful and self-centered sister, her 5 year old son, and his disabled father. Zach often dreams of leaving it all behind and pushes away his best friend and girlfriend, brooding and resigning himself to a life supporting all those around him while neglecting himself. He finds ""shelter"" so to speak in his art, surfing and skating, spending time with his young nephew who calls him ""daddy"", and eventually in the arms of an older wiser man named Shaun.

Shaun is a struggling writer visiting the beach to recover from a breakup. He is Zach's best friend's brother, and the two hit it off when they bump into one another on the beach. What follows is a touching, sexy trip as Zach realizes who he is and finds a way to break out of the rut he is in with the help of his lover and two best friends.

""Shelter"" isn't perfect, but it is a huge step forward as far as gay love stories go in my opinion. Zach and Shaun are believable characters. Self-loathing, panicking parents, and stereotypes are washed out to sea in this gay film that focuses mainly on the drama and struggles of everyday life. Zach especially is a great character, trying to hold it together and do what is best for everyone he loves. The film also features a great soundtrack, which grows on you every time you hear it.

3105051,5,B0013D8LCW,"Jonah Markovitz gets an A+ for this project. Lead actors Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe also get an A+ for creating amazing yet believable chemistry between two gay men rarely seen before on the American silver screen. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did so with Brokeback but they also had a powerhouse director Ang Lee in an epically long film. Trevor and Brad deserve extra credit points on their permanent record cards. These men know how to express themselves with their eyes when words are pointless. Trevor Wright is a young Kathy Bates in the making.

Others have been critical of Brad's character Shaun saying that he was too patient. I disagree. This guy was rebounding from a split up in L.A. but as a writer he had the awareness to see the potential in Zach as a keeper. He saw the young man's selflessness and his freedom from the typical gay baggage.

The supporting actors also contribute greatly and are almost equally developed for their smaller roles. Tina Holmes' portrayal of the alcoholic sister is well played in her desperation not to be abandoned by another man. The role was dark and non-glamerous for the actress but she, along with the direction of Markovitz, create empathy and understanding for the character. Tina Holmes's character Tori shows emotional intelligence beyond her age and beauty. Ross Thomas as Gabe is adorable and comedic yet he too is developed to show admirable depth in his care for his best friend Zach.

The production quality is a standout for a low-budget indie thanks to the dollars invested by here! Films. The soundtrack is perfect and plays a key role in the film. Shane Mack's tracks define the tone of the film.

My only quibble is that the film could have been 15 minutes longer giving us a few more dialogue scenes with Zach and Shaun.

The story is perfectly set up for a sequel. I truly hope that Jonah will pitch the idea to here! Films and we as viewers can see how the characters lives evolve near CalArts.

I bought 3 copies of the DVD for family and friends who didn't see it in its short theatrical run. I also downloaded the soundtrack from iTunes.

PS: Producer J.D. Disalvatore is a hoot with her fun blogsite The Smoking Cocktail. Her dogs are in the film in the beach scenes in San Pedro and Malibu.",1213920000,5,2271,4.634328358208955
3105052,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is an incredible love story.  But it is also much more than that.

The acting is good, the story is incredible.  The love story is sweet and simple and unexpected--finding love with your best friend's brother.

But what I find most exceptional about this film is a basic underlying theme that sometimes gay people are the ones with the common sense.  Obviously, in Zach's family, only Zach and Cody have any common sense.  Zach feels an extreme sense of obligation to Cody while it is painfully obvious that Cody's mother is lacking in maternal instinct.

I think at first many will find Jeanne, Cody's mother, to be a somewhat shocking character in her nearly total disregard for her son's well being.  Sadly, it is all too common.

In the end, Shelter is a beautiful love story where pure and simple love is found among a sad and complicated situation and it is pure magic that a family is born out of all the turmoil.

There are moments of absolute magic in this film...scenes that should melt your heart...and yet they are actually quite simple.  When Shaun is looking at Zach's book of drawings and expresses the fact that he ""get's it"" and understands the meaning in the drawings and Zach just looks at Shaun in stunned silence.  The other scene is where Shaun tries to convince Zach to come over for steaks and tells Zach to bring Cody along.  Shaun again proves he ""get's it"" in understanding Zach's total commitment to his family.  Men and situations like that are rare.",1213833600,7,1487,4.647509578544061

I found myself starting to relate to some of the parts of the story, like, when they're just laying in bed together talking and enjoying each other, my partner and I do that all the time.  When Zach was pacing back and forth deciding if he should go see Shaun, I have done that too.  Zach being ""involved"" with someone else when he has his first kiss with Shaun; this happened to me.  One other example is how Zach let himself fall for Shaun and let things happen and how this would be his first boyfriend.  My partner and I have been together since December 2002, he is my first, and we are now engaged.

Thank you to Jonah Markowitz for bringing us this movie and to Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe for making these characters so believable.  In my own opinion this movie just become the one to beat, I don't know if any other gay movie will ever come close.",1213315200,3,1101,4.23444976076555

It's an instant classic and is one of the best, most romantic films I've seen.

I happen to really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times since it came out. The cinematography is excellent and shows the beauty that can be found in the ""wrong side of the tracks"", as well as how naturally gorgeous Southern California actually is.

I really enjoyed the acting and wasn't, the combination of the writing, acting, direction and camera work gives this film a very honest feel. You can tell that everyone involved really cared about the script. All of the actors are great, but both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe shine in this production - they are both very talented and charming actors and I honestly hope that we see more from the both of them in the future.

While there are things about the ending of the movie that feel a bit contrived, the sweetness of how it unfolds really outshines any criticism I have.

3105069,5,B0013D8LCW,"Absolutely my all-time nomination for BEST Made-For-Gay-TV film is ""Shelter"" (2007), an outstanding film produced by Regent for here! TV.

Zach (Trevor Wright) is a 22 year old who is aimlessly spending his life in the working class town of San Pedro, just inland from the fancy homes of Laguna Beach.  Besides his dead-end job as a short order cook, Zach helps to take care of his disabled, widowed father, as well as his young nephew Cody, whose single, alcoholic mother also lives with them. Zach is also an avid surfer and skateboarder, but his real passion and talent is as a art, specializing in ""tagging"" walls of buildings with his creative designs.  When his best friend, Gabe, away at college, Zach assumes he'll be going surfing alone, until Gabe's older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe, who most gay fans will remember from ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss""), arrives in town to stay for a while.  The two develop a friendship ... and more, as repressed gay leanings surface once he gets to know the openly-gay Gabe.  Zach initially fights his feelings, tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, and fears the ridicule of his buddies and sister if they found out.  His sister already made it clear that she doesn't want Cody being around ""that (derrogative term for homosexual)"", and Zach worries what could happen to Cody if he is not around to help with his care.

A realistically-portrayed coming-of-age/coming out masterpiece of a film, beautifully photographed and above-average acting, music and direction. A sweet, almost lyrical story with a positive message, showing that ""love"" transcends anyone's definition of a ""family,"" to include supportive friends who help you realize your ultimate happiness in life.

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form (you could see it as seeking the holy grail of that genre, or as looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection and purchase of a film to view is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or on comments/reviews by others of you at major online sites. Re the latter, sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those I can re-watch at least every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and for some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a full review with you, as follows for this film. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

As a preface to all this, I'm not interested in telling the story here; I'm into telling 'about' the story here. And that's easy because the gay relationship part of it is one of the best on film and DVD today.

First off, it's got to be said that, whether one's straight or gay (except for those already ""out""), putting yourself ""out there"" for this type role has got to be an extremely difficult decision. Why? Because people in our backward and selectively puritanical society are going to make assumptions about you for doing so---whether they be correct or incorrect. Bearing this in mind, Director Markowitz was surprisingly fortunate in obtaining the acting services of both a Trevor Wright and a Brad Rowe. And whether taking these roles was good for their careers, both actors absolutely shine in this production.......as used to be said: these guys got Chemistry. There's a naturalness, a comfortableness between the two that's seldom been achieved in other gay romances set to film.

Also, big kudos to this director for being able to elicit/draw out such intimately physical scenes between our two leads. Kissing, especially, comes across as unforced, unrushed (except when they're ""hot"") and completely enjoyed by the characters (even if and when ""tongue"" might be involved). I'd call this kind of ""acting"" going above and beyond. Would that every American, gay romance director achieve this same degree of natural intimacy on the part of male couples; very few have. In my opinion, only French director, Christian Faure, in his 2000 French production, ""Just A Question Of Love"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-a-Question-of-Love/dp/B0008ENHXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just a Question of Love</a>) (or ""Juste Une Question D'Amour"" when looking it up on some other film websites), set the bar higher. Intimacy between the two in that film fairly crackles.

As for their individual performances:

-- Trevor Wright puts Zach across as the ultimate likable guy---one putting everyone else's needs before his own (whether they deserve it or not). He's the one often being put upon, yet he stays so positive.......no wonder that Shaun falls for him. He makes us all fall for him. And nowhere do we do so more than when, at the end of his most intimate scene, he and Shaun are lying happily face to face, and Trevor has brought Zach's expression to such a peacefully satisfied level that Shaun just has to say: ""You're so beautiful"" (and at that moment we can see he truly is). Then, our Zach can only shyly bring himself to wrinkle his nose and softly scoff: ""Shut up."" What an endearing moment.

-- Re Brad Rowe: In preparing for this shoot and the extreme intimacy of some of the scenes, someone had to lead the way. I more than suspect that person was the older and much more film-experienced 'The Brad-ster.' This becomes apparent when you listen to the DVD Special Features Voice-over Commentary by Markowitz, Brad and Trevor, and conclude that Brad's comfortably easy and low key approach was just what was needed to pull character Zach (as well as newer performer, Trevor) out of any shell of fears and doubts he might be having. In the end, it is through Brad's Shaun that we see Zach being so very fortunate to have wound up with a loving/caring person who would remove him from the undesirable circumstances in which he lived.......and, importantly, get him into the advanced art schooling he so definitely deserved.

As concerns their ""time-together"" scenes and performances, it becomes obvious from listening to specific comments by Trevor and Brad in the Voice-over that they are quite proud of their work in the love-making scenes, particularly the really intimate moments. How often could we expect to hear non-gay actors express such thoughts---knowing everyone watching the video would hear them? Not often, I suspect.

And let's not forget about Director, Jonah Markowitz. It's obvious from watching this, his first-time feature film, that he has the chops to run with the big boys. Why? Because for any film to be successful, it is the ""little touches"" a director/scriptwriter worth his salt throws in that mean the difference in a memorable production and one that isn't. Take the exciting scene we all love where Zach returns to Shaun's house and, for all practical purposes, throws himself into Shaun's arms (and bed). Markowitz doesn't just shoot this happening; instead he gives us a very emotional lead-up scene of an agonizing Zach, pacing around his little art workspace and nervously knocking things about. Now, finally, he's fully admitted to himself who he is, sexually, and what kind of relationship he wants with the one who means the most to him. At this point, he's got our sympathies and has us worked up almost as much as himself......just waiting for that next step to be taken. It's then, in the very next scene, that we see Shaun heading for his front door and the person we know is anxiously waiting there. What happens next is: Wow!!  So you see, folks, this is how a really successful director does things.

Moving on to other considerations, not everything about the film works out so well for this reviewer. While Tina Holmes does a fine job with her role as Zach's sister, Jeanne, it is not her fault that her called-for and frequently whinny/naggy, oh-poor-me, onscreen time exceeds what otherwise would have made for a better film. We'd already quickly learned that it is Zach who is the real put upon one, whose life is being stolen. Better, by far, would have been less scenes involving her and more of involving Zach/Shaun's developing relationship.

And what's my favorite scene? Well I have to say that, other than those arousing ""BGLM"" shots (Dudes, ya just gotta learn what that means by taking in the DVD Voice-over feature), my fave is definitely that quiet, easy surfside stroll taken by Zach and Shaun, their arms comfortably bumping from time to time. They begin talking of writer Shaun's last book, a gay romance novel. And then, because of Zach's glowing remarks about having read the book, it starts becoming clear to us that it's becoming clear to Shaun that Zach clearly knows about and is comfortable with Shaun's, shall we say, big sexual proclivity in life. Then, it's, like, WHOA!!!......as it suddenly hits Shaun what just might lie ahead for the two of them. It's a perfect little scene.

A final thought involving an appropriate 'mantra' for this film.......which would be: {""Little by little, the 'Master' leads the 'Student' out---capitalize those 3 letters if you will---so he can be who he really is, and comfortably so""}.  That's really the journey on which this movie has taken us. (If you actually watch this film, the terms just now used will have so much more meaning).

P.S.---And, importantly, at the very end we've learned that, like fairytales, some ""Childhood Fantasies"" can also come true (here,again, if you listened well during the screening, you'll know what this means).

P.P.S.---If you've been wonder'n about this review's title), then all ya have to do to satisfy that itch is to grab a look and listen to the DVD Special Features section, wherein the Director + Brad + Trevor walk us through that 'first kiss' scene. Very enlightening.

P.P.P.S.---As to who was holding that Video Recorder (you know, the one that shot a little video titled:  ""SKATE THIS! with GABE & ZACH,"" showing a couple of early teenage skateboarders doin their thing) the answer would likely be a younger Shaun.  Then, it hits us:  isn't it interesting that an emotionally down and vulnerable Shaun---on the downspin from a difficult relationship breakup---finds his way back to that place of pleasanter times, that place of fonder connections, that place of.......Zach.  (We've already pretty much arrived at the conclusion that he hadn't come home to see his away-from-the-area parents, or a brother he'd been seeing from time to time, anyway).

3105073,5,B0013D8LCW,"This movie is probably one of the most ""make-me-feel-good"" gay-themed movies that I have ever seen and overall a very satisfying experience. What I love about this movie is that it doesn't give the usual cliche of traumatic past or tortured soul ... it is plain sweet, sexy, and down-to-earth. Added with luscious backdrops of San Pedro beaches, surfings, sunsets, AND AMAZING soundtrack - this is basically what gay-themed movies I have long wished for.

Because falling in love could be gentle, beautiful and rewarding - even among M/M. Sometimes there is no need for over-the-top or dramatic situation. This movie is also a story about commitment to other family members and acceptance of one's sexual preference over the other.

Both main actors make the relationship work and truly believable. The sex is romantic and sensual without having to show full body nudity. When it comes to that first love making, you can feel the tension that lead up to there and it's perfect. There are also those scenes where both characters just stay in bed, look into each other's eyes ...

It sizzles ALL the way through ... and worth watching more than once. I recommended it to another friend and she loved it as much as I do. So yeah, this is one well rec'd movie.

3105097,5,B0013D8LCW,"Without a doubt, Shelter is one of my favorite gay-themed movies. The director called it the ""anti-Brokeback"" and I would have to agree. It's a beautifully written love story that just happens to revolve around two guys, one of whom is on a journey to discover his affectional orientation.

What I loved:
  * A new gay image. Both of the main characters, Zach and Shaun, are completely non-stereotypical. They just happen to be gay.
  * Happy ending. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and it's good to see that Zach and Shaun live happily ever after. Too many gay movies make it look like gay = drama and heartbreak.
  * Sex is kept to a minimum. What little they show is done tastefully. We see nothing below the waist.
  * The eye contact they share provides a level of non-sexual intimacy never before seen in a gay movie. These characters are in love. They don't have to say it, because you can see it.
  * No fag hag! Zach has an on-and-off girlfriend (Tori) at the beginning of the movie. When she starts to suspect his confusion, she backs off and gives him time to come to terms with himself. She's very much not a gay groupie.

What I disliked:
  * Too short. The movie was only 90 minutes, including credits. Some parts felt rushed. Everything was fully fleshed, but I felt it could have gone on another half hour.
  * Casting quirks. Tina Holmes' (Jeanne) performance was slightly under-par, compared to everybody else's.",1212019200,12,1430,4.549019607843137

3105103,5,B0013D8LCW,"I'm previewing ""Shelter"" for the Brisbane Queer Film Festival where it screens on Saturday 24th May 2008. ""Shelter"" shines as a film with huge heart, and one that's been made with equal care by the actors and all of the film-makers.

It's not at all like the angst-ridden abomination of a gay surf flick ""Tan Lines"". In ""Shelter"" surfing is simply a fact of life element - it's not used or abused as a device.

""Shelter"" is a beautifully edited, spectacular looking and luscious sounding film which is definitely character driven. Each of the main characters is carefully developed so that we quite soon decide that we really do care about Zach, his young nephew Cody and Zach's love interest, Shaun. We want things to work out for them.

We understand that Zach is in a bind - he's allowed himself to be the physical and emotional anchor for a progressively more dysfunctional family, but we know that he deserves much better life options. The writer and director of Shelter has done a fantastic job - not a look or word is wasted, and yet the whole pace of the film is very relaxed.

""Shelter"" deserves every accolade that any individual or Festival might care to bestow.

Straight audiences must find ""Shelter"" to be equally rewarding. The film's theme is, after all, about love, honour and commitment. What could be more wholesome than that?",1210896000,189,1345,4.730769230769231

3338696,5,B0013D8LCW,"""Pure being,"" a friend of mine once said enviously of the surfers riding the waves along the Southern California coast some thirty years ago.  Though there was a strict demarcation between the gay section of the beaches and those parts that belonged to the surfers alone, even then a few surfers hung out at night in the Breakers or one of the other gay bars along Highway One, especially in Laguna. There, what seemed so easy a life out in the Pacific, just following the next big waves one after another, became less obvious and more conflicted.  Stories about coming out have so dominated many gay films that the theme has developed into an archetype, a genre of its own with endless variations:  from dark into light, from secrets into revelation.  In Shelter, Zach is a young artist who has turned down a scholarship at CalArts in order to stay home to care for his nephew Cody.  Zach has inherited the family gene, from his mother he says.  All the concerns and nearly all the love the five year old Cody should find in his mother, Zach's sister Jeanne, he gets from Zach alone.  Zach has had a long time girlfriend, but everything about their relationship is tentative, on hold.  When he meets his best friend's older brother again after several years, they surf together, just as they used to.  But Shaun is an openly gay man who has published a novel which Zach has read.  Shaun's sexuality is no secret to Zach, but Zach's is to Shaun--as it may still be to Zach himself, at least in the sense that he has never before been with a man (or in all likelihood a woman; his responses to his girlfriend are mostly tepid, except when his real longings frighten him).  What Zach wants more than anything are family and love.  After a night during which he and Shaun kiss, Zach is happy but its meaning is still uncertain.  He rides the waves, paces the deck of the house he shares with his sister and nephew in what he calls San Pedro's ghetto, then drives back to the family house on the beach where Shaun is staying to recuperate emotionally after a boyfriend has dumped him in L.A.  What follows between Zach and Shaun is stunning in its impact upon both men.  Their coupling, however, is not filmed as soft core porn, all or nearly all about the physical alone, but as love scenes.  What matters most is the feeling shown through their eyes.  All the acting in this emotionally profound film is superb, but the love beyond words Zach and Shaun manage to express just with their eyes has almost never before been seen in movies, not even, say, in Brokeback where to some degree it was often having to be hidden by one or the other man.  What follows in Shelter is Zach's coming to understand what that love means to him for the rest of his life.  Part of this is the usual problem of coming out to his friends and to his sister, though nearly all that effort is accomplished for him; they know before he tells them. But he must also come to see himself better; he must change, too, as he tells Shaun later.  Part of that transformation is his discovering more fully who Shaun is.  Shaun has been criticized by some viewers for being too patient with Zach.  But patience is part of love, one of the virtues that help people abide all the messes we make or almost make out of our lives.  When Zach learns that Shaun has mailed his application and portfolio to CalArts, he sees, quietly, the man's generosity.  In a way, Shaun has shown that he loves Zach as kindly and patiently as Zach loves Cody.  Zach's and Shaun's erotic communion is intense.  But this is a love that is also caritas, deep, perhaps abiding.  It is his recognition of that possibiity, if not certainty that leads Zach back to Shaun, especially after a talk with his girlfriend in which he says his only regret (about being gay) is that he wanted to make a family with her.  In this moment between them, it is her goodness which allows her to encourage Zach to return to Shaun, to the different family he might find now through Shaun and with Cody.  At least, she says, he should try.  Near the end, after Zach and Shaun drive to the house to pick up Cody from Zach's sister who is moving to Portland with her rough boyfriend, Zach turns to Shaun and takes his hand in his.  It is a gesture of love between them as telling as any more passionate embrace.  The seemingly unencumbered lives both men had known together surfing when younger--Shaun the master, Zach the pupil in a running joke between them--has grown into a love that is in every sense good.  I think this is one of the best movies ever made about gay men, searchingly decent and generously spirited about love without any loss in erotic force.  It is also wonderfully realized, except in a few of the songs on the soundtrack, in both the director's eye and the hearts of all the performers, even those in relatively minor roles (Gabe is as perfect a surfer dude as one can imagine, but with more than the usual soul).  But Trevor Wright as Zach gives to his character an especially touching complexity.  Zach is in some ways still a kid, talking in the lingo of surfers, tagging buildings, riding his skateboard.  But he's also emotionally older than everyone else in his life, already committed to a way of living many people never come to.  His coming out is more painful to himself than it is to others perhaps because his need for real communion is already so great. Yet he finds it.  This is emotionally complex work for so young an actor.  But every gesture he makes, everything he expresses is true; no moment ever feels false or contrived.  What the movie leaves one with is a sense of both the hopes and ambiguities of moral being, a far more difficult, yet greater life than merely riding the waves of one's youth.",1207267200,255,5762,4.480842911877395

3338792,5,B0013D8LCW,"One of the very best ""Bambi"" coming-of-age or ""coming-out"" movies I've ever watched.  I say that in all sincerity.  I'm 63 and have been watching independent queer cinema since its origin with the 1986 seminal ""NO APOLOGIES"" gay-point-of view classic ""Parting Glances."" There have been a few films in the decades-long interim which live up to the sophistication and narrative promise of ""Parting Glances.""  ""World and Time Enough (1984), ""Latter Days"" (1992), ""Defying Gravity"" (1994), and ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" (1991, I believe) all deliver an almost miraculous depth of feeling from an impossibly paltry financial investment.  This little film ""Shelter"" is a panoply of the highs and lows of love and devotion and it truly satisfied my desire for its protagonist to achieve the joyful contentment he so deserves. ""Shelter"" is a love-ly story (in every sense of that word) and I hope you will be as pleased by it as I am.
An aside: See Brad Rowe (Shaun) at his most Robert Redford-ish in ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" with Sean Hayes as Billy, a lonely yet hopeful photographer with a tuxedo-wearing guardian angel. (Directed by Tommy O'Haver)",1492905600,10,1156,5.1005291005291005

Shelter follows Zach (Trevor Wright) who is a down on his luck artist (drawing, painting, tagging) that works in the kitchen of a diner. He doesn't really know yet, but he finds himself attracted to his best friends brother Shaun (Brad Rowe). Although both of these men are obviously straight in real life, they played their roles well and I believed that their characters were in love. The story is amazing; it has elements of homophobia, love, the amazing California life and much more. I'd say this is one of those movies that will make you sad, but will lift you up as well. Both men are beautiful and I felt their love for each other through the screen. It is rated R, but there are no explicit sex scenes. I think it had a few F-words, so that's why. I think they should've taken them out and made it PG-13, so that the teenage crowd could see  a positive, gay love story.",1487030400,8,997,4.442622950819672

3338818,4,B0013D8LCW,"With all the acclaim currently being heaped on Moonlight, I found myself reflecting that any number of more modestly-budgeted niche *gay* films have negotiated the same territory, and often done it better.  Shelter is one.  It seems at first like a relatively standard gay romance, but is quietly and subtly perceptive, and ultimately powerful.  It is also tightly-scripted, well-directed and well-acted.  It might not be as moody or as self-consciously arty as Moonlight, but nor is it slow, flaccid or tedious - as Moonlight is at times.  In short: I was greatly moved by Shelter, and not so much by Moonlight.  So if you were also somewhat underwhelmed by the Oscar-nominee, check out Shelter.

It is one of the few out there that gives those watching a happy ending, and while it would have been great to see more intimate moments between the two main characters, it still leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end.

The story did have some slow spots, and overall was a bit predictable, but as a whole was enjoyable and I would recommend it to those looking for a feel-good M/M romance.  My one dislike?  Zach's sister.  Homophobic?  Yes...but there's always going to be characters like that in same-sex movies and books.  I was more incensed with her excessive selfishness-she has absolutely no consideration for Zach and doesn't seem to care for her son like a mother should.  Her character was unlikable enough to affect my star rating by at least a half a star.

Shelter is a great addition to any M/M romance collection, and gets a 4-star rating from me.",1475193600,2,964,4.526011560693641

3338877,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is my new favorite romance movie.  The two leads, Zach (Trevor Wright) and Shaun (Brad Rowe) have an easy chemistry that makes their discovery of love a joy to watch.  The overall storyline is one covered many times in many other movies.  It doesn't break new ground, but it doesn't need to.  What it does, it does well.  And that's make the sympathetic viewer root for what they fervently hope will be a joyful ending.  It has just enough of the angst of typical coming-out stories to check the necessary boxes to fit the genre, but its focus is far more on new love, promise of commitment, and the creation of family.  Solid movie when what you want is an uplifting romance.",1464566400,,684,4.512195121951219

3338879,5,B0013D8LCW,"In my humble opinion, this gay themed movie, starring Trevor Wright and Brad Roe as two nearly lifelong friends, who in real life are both straight, while in the movie Its obvious that Trevor, while being brother to Jeanie - quite possibly the most self-centered, irresponsible, mother to one of the cutest little 5 year old muchkins with a heck of a lot of acting ability who loves his uncle Zach (Wright) since his father cut out on his wife and baby son, so even at age 5, little Cody is calling Zach his father, while uncle Zach is trying in vain to tell Cody he's just his uncle. Zack, Jeanie, and Cody live in a tiny house near the beach of a town called San Pedro, while a few miles away, lives Brad Roe's chacacter, who has his degree and written one book about all the secrets that are kept in the walls of Pacific Bluffs, and enclave of the wealthier beach & luxury loving folks. It's
Zack's dream to go to the Cali Institute of Art in LA, and that just so happens that's where Brad had just signed a lease agreement for a large condo
only a few blocks from where Zach wants to go to school, if it weren't for Jeanie, who's been using Zack as an unpaid nanny. And Zack keeps doing it for two reasons: He loves Cody like a real father and knows Jeanie is running around with a low-life house painter who hates kids, the rent is cheap, and finally Zach is keeping a secret about himself, even though he has had a gf for six years. Guess that secret, and you have the ingredients for something to happen that could change all their lives, if they could just work things out. That's enough to get up your interest, and if you think two straight guys can't act the roles of two guys in love, you'll be blown away by this movie.",1462147200,,1732,4.251515151515152
3338880,5,B0013D8LCW,The story is set in an area of Los Angeles that was once the place of fine restaurants and great shopping for the not so usual items in the 1960's. Now it is a place of poverty and very little work. I can easily identify with the characters as I too used to frequent Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach where the surfing was the best. Lots of scenes of the beautiful California coast line and the beautiful Vincent Thomas Bridge all lit up. Brad Rowe is one of the very finest actors I've had the pleasure of watching on screen and no one else but Trevor Wright could have played his character as well as he did.

I'm from LA, so I usually don't like watching films where the story is set in or filmed in this territory, and surfer movies...mehhhh, but because I have always thought highly of Brad Rowe, I gave it a chance.  Trevor Wright, I had never heard of but WOW, he really impressed me.  Not only is he a fine actor but he's amazingly good looking.  The supporting cast, especially the actress who played Zach's sister, and Gabe's bro, are all excellent as well.  The unexpected ending, I loved, and I found myself really touched by it.  It just goes to show how everything always works out for the best.  It was filmed very well and you can almost smell the run-down house out east where Zach and his family live, and the sea salt of the beach and the burgers in the burger joint.  Zach's artistic talents made for a great B story.  Obviously Zach and Gabe have always loved each other a lot, but their love has gone through some different waves (pun unintentional).  Jonah Markowitz definitely achieved something great with ""Shelter"" and got Wright and Rowe (both straight) to play gay very well.  I've seen a lot of gay films - even some very popular ones- where the directors don't get the most out of the two male leads but I'd say Markowitz succeeded in that respect and that's what made his film so great.

If I show you one sunset over the ocean & tell you that's the movie , please believe me & save yourself some money, especially at $30. Borrow it/ buy the regular used dvd..

3338990,5,B0013D8LCW,"One of my favorite movies in a long time.  Nice to see a story like this.  Very warm and touching with genuine characters.  Nothing against you WeHo guys, but nice to see a non stereotypical representation on screen.

I thought one reviewer's criticism that this was some hollow chick flick mo-equivalent to be way off.  ""No conflict, no depth, nothing but a smooth ride to the happy ending.""  I'd just like to say that (a) nobody has to die or get beat up to have dramatic legitimacy, and (b) conflict can be very subtle, especially for a young gay man figuring things out.  This kid had plenty of conflict in his life already, then added a completely new type of relationship to his life.  The importance of his nephew in his life was a big driver and that was threatened by his sister's selfishness, clear ulterior motives, and prejudice.  What if she'd freaked out and taken him out of her son's life?  I like the way the film didn't spell out some of the inner conflicts and let the viewer figure it out (although I thought that one was pretty obvious).  It seemed to me, some reviewers were looking for flaws.  One commented on the bad double entendre ""it was a good day to come out.""  ""Go out"" or ""come out"" is a very common way to describe going surfing as in ""out"" in the water.  It never occurred to me that was intended to be a play on ""coming out"" and I don't think it was.  One reason I've liked some gay themed movies is that it let's you see the experience of others different from yourself.  The Falls held that appeal for me.  I suggest  some might enjoy this film more if they took that tack in this case.  I think surfer  stereotyping in film/TV might be working against this film, but should  not.  I'm glad to see so many viewers liked it as much as I did.

I also liked the story because much of it was filmed where I grew up (no, we didn't call it ""the Bu"") and I thought the characters reflected real socal beach culture, with no over the top ""Spicoli"" stereotypes.  I may be swayed somewhat by the beach setting and the intimacy with the ocean the characters shared.  That shared love  of the ocean will resonate with  anyone who grew up with the ocean as their playground.  I liked the story line.  I liked the characters.  It is a very warm story about two nice guys; one helping the other and joining his nurturing relationship with the little boy.  Loved the ocean scenes.  Loved the music.  ""Lie  to me"" is a great song and its scene placement in this film was perfect.

Special mention to the Gabe character.  Despite the ""bros"" and ""dude"" (yes people really talk like that), he came across as genuine and warm - at times hilarious (running up the stairs ""where's my princess big brother?!).  His intonations were spot on.",1422662400,2,2753,4.401590457256461

3338996,5,B0013D8LCW,"This is a beautiful movie.  So many movies in recent times, try to show the difficulties facing gay people, and end up with tragic and depressing endings.  I loved this movie since it does such a wonderful job of showing the difficult rollercoaster ride of emotions which one can face when coming to terms with their sexuality and the narrowmindedness of those around them, but does so in a way that is uplifting and heart warming.  It shows that things can get better, despite a difficult path.  One of the subtle scenes which I liked, was the morning after Zach and Shaun made love for the first time.  Zach is driving home, and sudenly gives a big smile as he realizes this is what he truly wanted.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone -- gay, or straight.
I'm not sure why this movie is priced so much higher than most other movies. Though already rated highly, I'm sure it would gain an even higher popularity rating with a lower price, as the high price may be limiting the number of people viewing it.  If you can get past the price, I think you will find it to be the best movie in it's class.",1416700800,,1105,4.360975609756098

But Jonah Markowitz, who wrote and directed Shelter, pulls it off.  He had a story he wanted to tell and was finally able to get the financial backing to make it.  I think he did a great job!

Shelter is the story of an all-too typical, modern family.  Zach, the 'father figure', unexpectedly finds himself drawn to another man ... not in the 'let's hop in bed and have a good time' sort of way, but much deeper.  How all the relationships play out is the basis of the story.  I found the acting, by a cast of relatively unknowns, to be very good.

The DVD includes an interesting Making Of segment and a running commentary by the director and two main actors.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the three describe the filming, over the action on screen!

I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they would enjoy a M/M love story.",1414368000,,1019,4.51912568306011

3339001,2,B0013D8LCW,"I get it!!! This is a completely uncomplicated gay romance with a happy ending that a gay couple could cuddle up with and enjoy - the gay equivalent of a ""chick-flick"" [though no rhyme-equivalency would be appropriate here, since there is no nudity or sex to speak of]. The problem is that it is pure cream-of-wheat. No conflict, no depth, nothing but a smooth ride to the happy ending. Oh, there are two or three seemingly endless sequences where we simply listen to a couple of insipid pop songs...but for the folks who like this film, these sequences are probably the film's highlights. Bottom-line: it's pretty to look at;  but for anyone who wants anything approaching an interesting story-line, it's a crashing bore.",1413504000,,722,4.869918699186992

3339004,5,B0013D8LCW,"Absolutely adore this movie. Heartwarming, loving, sweet - just a perfect film to make you feel good.  I read a critical review that panned this as being a Lifetime channel like movie.  And I actually agree, it is like a Lifetime movie - but in this case it's not a bad thing - I think it is really amazingly done.  Not all movie's have to be doom and gloom - sometimes we want to walk away smiling and feeling good about love, life, etc... This movie is one of my favorite pick-me-ups, it makes my heart smile.

Also in terms of it being a ""gay surfer film"" - the director mentions that he wanted to create a life story that just happened to be about a gay person/couple, and I think he succeeded.  As a straight female, I just saw two people fall in love and a young man finally live his own life.  Even though it's hard to get one's hands on - I really hope more people get to see this lovely film.  I am so happy that I finally got to own my own copy and see the commentary and other special features.",1410220800,5,1005,4.096938775510204

3339032,2,B0013D8LCW,"Although this film has reasonably good production values, cinematography, and music, it lacked chemistry between the characters. There seemed to be no real feelings evident in the relationship. The viewer is given no background, just quick, almost wordless introductions to the characters, and the story. We are forced to guess at what each character represents. The story lacked real depth and meaning.

I understand it's a pretty film. Good looking leading characters and a charismatic child are not nearly enough to sustain this film. I long for the days of Latter Days and Big Eden. Recent entries such as E-Cupid have more entertaining content than this.",1405036800,,659,5.216981132075472

So it was nothing short of therapeutic to see this excellent film, which made it possible, maybe for the first time, for me to be able to be comfortable about being gay myself.  I'm also a photographer and appreciate the great videography of the film.  I've got a little hero worship for Trevor Wright, who I think nailed his part.",1403654400,2,500,4.231578947368421

3339057,5,B0013D8LCW,"I can't believe that I didn't see this movie when it first came to an art-house theater in our town. It was released in 2007 and is just as wonderful today.  This movie is timeless and a milestone in Cinema for this genre --  Gay Romantic Drama.  The screenplay and direction are excellent; the cinematography is spectacular (especially the scenes involving surfing and the Pacific Ocean); but most of all, the acting is so superior to that of  any other film that debuted in 2007.  Brad Rowe, in a tour de force, burns a hole in the screen with his multi-layered performance of Shaun, who is a screenwriter in Hollywood as well as a published author.  Trevor Wright is even more impressive as Zach, a ""street artist"" who works dead-end jobs and has dreams of attending CALARTS, but is hampered in doing so by his manipulative and selfish sister Jeanne.  Zach is not only a babysitter, but also a surrogate father to the adorable Cody, Jeanne's son by a long-gone lover in a string of deadbeat men.  Needless to say, Zach is trying his best to be a role model for Cody, but his on again/off again romance with girlfriend Tori is causing him to have a serious identity crisis.  Enter Shaun, the brother of Zach's best friend Gabe.  Shaun is such an endearingly good-natured and gregarious character, that Zach finds himself attracted to him more than he is to Tori. Shaun, who is older and wiser, helps  Zach out of the closet by degrees, but complications set in from all sides --- from a slightly jealous Gabe, to a belligerent sister and her lout of a boyfriend, Alan, back again to Zach who isn't  entirely sure of himself.  Brad Rowe is such a consummate actor that he can take  simple scenes like building a sand castle with Cody on the beach, or playfully asking him what he wants for dinner, and turn these incidents into pure cinematic charm.  He is so good at his craft that he calls to mind Daniel Day-Lewis, who is known for immersing himself in a role to the point of total believability. Both Zach and Shaun are so well portrayed, and the screenplay is so good that by the end of the movie you absolutely know where the title comes from---certainly it came from Zach's and Cody's situation, but even more poignant you get the feeling that for all his exuberance, Shaun's is a bruised soul (past relationships that failed) and that all three are seeking ""Shelter"" and you root for them wholeheartedly to get it.  In all probability, Mr. Rowe and Mr. Wright would have been  fellow nominees at the Academy Awards for this film had it been widely distributed, as it much deserves to have been.  I won't tell prospective viewers any more of the story from this ""Eternal Valentine"" because  I want them to experience it for themselves, but I do promise everyone that you will watch this cinematic masterpiece, directed by Jonah Markowitz, an exponential number of times.  Check out some of the other films of Trevor Wright as well as those especially of Brad Rowe.  Watch for one or  both of these fine actors to one day win an Academy Award!",1398816000,,3050,4.588560885608856

In this case poor Zach is faces with the reality of turning down a scholarship to art school to deal with his highly dysfunctional family.  I've been there before with a sister who's a terrible mother only to pick up the pieces of her son's broken heart.  Shelter is not really a gay surfer movie, that is just the thing in common that draws the two protagonists together with a common interest.  Sean is lost and he has no meaning in his life because, up until this point, he really hasn't faced any real challenges. Zach on the other hand, believes that he can somehow save his family, when he has his own issues to deal with.  Zach's biggest outlets are his surfing and his art.  Sean just happens to be the one who challenges Zach to face his homosexuality, and false sense of obligation.

It's a movie you'll want to watch over and over as you are enfolded in the struggles many young gays have aligning their needs with family obligations, but still wanting to break away. Cliches are absent, which is refreshing and the intimate scenes are just that, intimate, and tasteful; this is not a sex film. Buy it and watch often.",1382918400,3,724,4.983471074380165

The movie is about a young man (I believe a teenager), Zach who falls in love with his best friend's older brother, Shaun. I really love the progression of the story and the genuine sincerity of the love between them. There were no typical gay stereotyping like hot hunks with chiseled bodies, heavy partying and clubbing, being promiscuous or anything like that. Instead it is a wholesome feel-good love story between two average-everyday men with average-everyday bodies.

The story of the younger guy falling for the older guy and realizing his sexuality is very well done, and without full sex scenes (which may have been good to add a few :-) ) -- his anguish of living his life, taking on more responsibility than is normal for his age bracket, and accepting his potential future as a gay man is heart breaking to watch, but excellent.

3339136,5,B0013D8LCW,"This has to be one of the best gay-themed movies made thus far. The story is set in San Pedro and La Holla, CA. It's about Zach (Trevor Wright) who falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe). Shaun is the older brother of Gabe (Ross Thomas), Zach's best friend. There's roughly a 12-year difference between Zach and Shaun. Gabe goes off to college in Santa Barbara. While he's gone Zach visits Gabe's house to work on his surf board that he's left in the backyard. Unbeknownst to Zach Shaun is staying there temporarily until the lease on his new place in Los Angeles begins. He surprises Zach. Both are delighted to see each other. It's obvious that Zach has had a crush on Shaun for some time. He invites Shaun to surf with him. Shaun takes up the offer and the romance between them begins.

""Shelter"" is a coming of age story in that it's about Zach coming to terms with his sexual orientation. Being older Shaun has already come to terms with his sexuality. He helps Zach to accept who he is. There's much drama in this film as Zach not only comes to terms with his sexuality he has a very trying relationship with his sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes). She frequently puts Zach in a situation where he has to care for her five-year-old son, Cody (Jackson Wurth). But Zach loves his nephew. He is both uncle and father to him. And Cody worships Zach.

Zach and Shaun both love Cody. Shaun's very good with him and loves the funny things he says. Cody tells his Uncle Zach, ""Shaun rocks!"" The three of them make a wonderful family. Thankfully, this movie has a ""Hollywood ending"".

There are a lot of surfing scenes and beautiful footage of Southern California. Trevor Wright actually does surf and and ride a skateboard in those scenes. Both he and Brad Rowe are terrific actors. The two of them have great chemistry together. ""Shelter"" is a love story anyone would appreciate.",1373587200,,1870,4.543026706231454

Then I decided to buy it, which for me means I must've really enjoyed it.  I think it's unfair to compare this film to Brokeback Mountain, however, since the tone, story, setting, and budget are completely different for each film.  They're both great films in their own right and I enjoy both of them (and own both of them) for completely different reasons.  Shelter is sweet and hopeful, BBM is sad and achy.

The acting in Shelter is better than I expected and the little boy who plays Cody is utterly adorable.  The two leads have good chemistry and they made me believe their relationship.  The soundtrack is definitely topnotch.  I would also caution you to disregard those who describe this film as a ""gay surfing movie"" because while there is plenty of surfing, it's not a surfing movie.  That's not what the film's about.  The characters just happen to surf.  They also happen to paint and draw and write and act like immature boys sometimes, too.

This is really a film about learning who you are and accepting it, about finally letting yourself reach for the dreams you've been denying you could have.  Watching Zach's transformation and Shaun's quiet encouragement is a real treat.

3339183,5,B0013D8LCW,"The outpouring of positive feedback for this movie is obviously well deserved.  It is well paced with great sound and picture quality, impeccable direction, a lovely story, and a cast of actors perfectly suited for their roles.

Three of the main characters here (Zack, Jeanne, and Cody)are a family living together in a very humble section of San Pedro, CA which is in Los Angeles County. A beautiful, selfless young Gay man, Zack, has put his life on hold to look after his adorable nephew Cody whose mother, played by Tina Holmes, is an irresponsible, self-centered alcoholic with deplorable taste in men.  But his compassion and love are well rewarded when an older gorgeous hunk and surfing buddy, Shaun, reunites with him and eventually becomes his mentor, his ""rock"", and his lover as well a wonderful role model and support system for his little nephew.

In real life, Trevor Wright(""Zack"") and Brad Rowe(""Shaun"") are both heterosexual and are actually 12 years apart in age. If Brad Pitt makes you drool, so will Brad Rowe, and if you love a perfectly beautiful young man with the face of an angel and a smile that lights up a room like a Christmas tree, you'll love Trevor Wright.  Also, if you like Tina Holmes, I would suggest you check out another great movie, ""Edge of Seventeen"" in which she appears as a teen in love with her male ""BFF"" who comes out to her as gay.

It would be a grave injustice to dismiss this wonderful movie as just another ""coming out"" film. It's a tribute to the power of love that can be enjoyed and embraced by all open-minded audiences who appreciate a feel good romance with a happy ending.

From my vantage point, having a collection films about love and romance without ""Shelter"" would be like having a collection of classic cars without a vintage Pink Cadillac.  Along with ""Beautiful Thing"" and Jean-Claude Schlim's ""House of Boys"", ""Shelter"" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies.",1362700800,3,1996,4.731988472622478

This film relies heavily on the scenery and the actors (I suppose if the director cut out all the driving/surfing/skating scenes it would be about 30 minutes long).

Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright do such a great job and their on screen chemistry is just right for this, Tina Holmes is great (I really love/hated that character), and Ross Thomas' character seems to take over the scenes he's in.

Probably the worst thing about the film is that it had the potential to be/do so much more as a film and for the community, but then again maybe that's part of why I like it.

This story is an example of good cinema that does not trivialize us or deduce us simply to sexual animals without telling the story of our fullness as just another variation of normal social beings trying to work, play and live in loving relationships.  I am so tired of Hollywood and others reducing us to stereotypes or sex centric individuals.  Gay men and women are not socialized with respect to their realities.  We don't have proms, acceptable dating protocols, and ways to help us develop healthily into our gay bodies with other gay men.  We will never get full recognition as normal people until we are accepted as normal on the culture especially movies.  Name 5 great straight romantic  movies.  It's fairly easy.  Name 5 great gay ones and it's impossible.  The homophobes win until the gays in Hollywood and the whole industry provide good material for good actors that shows us no different from straight men and women.

  I love that the guys were open in the end, it sends a nice message out to today's gay youth. Being gay is okay and you shouldn't hide it from your family or friends. They might be hurt when you don't tell them and they find out from other people.

This movie didn't portray gays as sex hungry pedophiles that take drugs. The romance was beautiful and I could understand why one of the guys felt so unsure and confused. Some people don't know they're gay till later on in life and this movie says it can take time to get used to -nothing happens over night. You won't always be so uncomfortable in your own skin.

  BRAVO!!! I want to see more movies like this and show them to my friends in LGBT youth group. I'm sure the are more symbols and messages that can be taken from this movie. I'm going to watch it a few more times. This picture is absolutely amazing and fantastic!",1323734400,6,1154,4.26605504587156

There are sex and love-making scenes but the camera view stays above the waist. Let's be honest...Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are easy to look at from any view.

A great *feel good* film about NORMAL people, some of them just so happen to be gay. And the gay characters live *happy ever after*.

3339240,5,B0013D8LCW,"I bought this film without reading any reviews because I liked the coming of age and coming out story line. But I did not know what to expect. I've bought a lot of Gay oriented films but most of the time have been extremely disappointed by the amateur feel of the film or the terrible writing or acting or both in many films. So I really didn't know what to expect.

After watching this movie it felt like one of the best films Gay or Straight I've ever seen in my life! It was not only professionally done, but the casting was fantastic. the writing was fantastic, the acting was superb and the direction and production extremely well done!! I've rarely ever given a review of a film I've bought but this film was so good I can't stop talking about it!

The screen play and script along with the great casting and acting made the characters come alive. Their interaction was not only believable but but you felt the definite connection between them. The story was so good, the acting was so good, as was the direction and production, that the audience cannot help but become emotionally involved. So many Gay oriented films end in tragedy. This film ends with an uplifting spirit of heartfelt hope that love can conquer all and win in the end.

This is a beautiful film, a beautiful story, wonderful acting and fantastic cast, and great direction and production. It is so good that immediately after watching it I went online to buy another copy of the film to give as a gift to a friend.

This is one of the best films I've ever seen!! It should have won many Indi awards and I wonder why it didn't? I highly recommend it to anyone, Gay, Bi, Straight... it doesn't matter, this film is that good! I can't say enough about it!",1313884800,4,1727,4.421383647798742

In his free time he surfs, draws and hangs out with his best friend, Gabe, who lives on the wealthy side of town. When Gabe's older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe) returns home, he is drawn to Zach's selflessness and talent. Zach falls in love with Shaun while struggling to reconcile his own desires with the needs of his family.
Zach seems to have his head together, has a pretty girlfriend he loves very much and adores his young nephew who has no other stability than Zach in his life. He is determined to make this kid's life enjoyable in spite of family neglect. Yet there is a part of Zach that is yet undefined and he has great difficulty coming to terms with, knowing it could jeopardize his relationship with his nephew Cody.
Trevor Wright does an INCREDIBLE job portraying his character. He was very well cast for the role. He is quite good looking which doesn't hurt, but acts the part with such tenderness and realism. A very professional actor for his age. I was enthrolled by his performance. The acting of Brad Rowe was also very good and the two make a believable couple in spite of an age difference. This is a very well written script and one almost any viewer can enjoy from beginning to end. I highly recommend the film.

The way Zack stayed cool with how his sister was not taking care of her and then stepping in as the father figure was the part that put this movie on a whole other level. The way Shaun and Zack relationship evolves is one of the most believable I have ever seen and the way  Shaun GENTLY pushes Zach to better himself by giving him an application to the school that he wants to go to is how I would think a boyfriend that love his man to act.
The ending showing how  Shaun and Zach take in Zach's nephew and then how the last part moves to the beach seen closes out the movie very well.",1308528000,,899,4.073446327683616

Guy finds out he is gay, has trouble in accepting that for himself and his surrounding, but in the end everything turns out the way it should. Pretty thin story. Maybe especially for a Dutch guy like me. But the acting and the storyline are believable. And the actors are nice people, what makes it easy to sympathise with them. So yes, it's a clich. But a well done one.

I also liked the music in the movie very much. The Shane Mack songs as well as most of the others. That helps too.

This movie came without subtitles. And that's a dissapointment for those who can't hear very well and for those who don't understand english well enough. And that's a shame.

The production values are very high throughout, with great cinematography, including some amazing shots of surfing.  The script is excellent, avoiding the usual clichs and allowing the characters to talk like real people.  The actors do a great job of making the characters come alive as three-dimensional people, where even the less sympathetic characters have redeeming features.

Writer/director Jonah Markowitz brings it all together to present a powerful and moving story.  The soundtrack is also well done, with songs that enhance each scene.

The DVD has great picture quality and Dolby 5.1 audio.  Extras include a commentary track with Markowitz and the two leads, a ""making of"" featurette, a photo gallery, music video of Shane Mack singing ""Lie to Me"", and trailer.

I love the character of Zach - he's struggling with so many feeling and on the cusp of making huge life choices that weren't all his to make. I love his devotion to his nephew and his family and that he truly knows what sacrifice means and does so without much complaint.

I also love the character of Shaun, whose open heart and patience make a 'Shelter' for Zach. Not everything is cut and dry and I love the way this character is wise enough to wait for Zach to decide how to deal with his newly realized feelings.

Love does just 'happen' and this movie sums that up with grace and beauty - a really poignant piece of art that says volumes of what relationships today are truly made of and how family and lovers all overlap in our lives.",1300320000,4,1050,4.486910994764398

3339270,5,B0013D8LCW,"While watching ""Shelter,"" a rather sweet-natured story about a good-hearted, self-sacrificing young man dealing with the realization that he might be gay, I was reminded of the the Otto Preminger film of 1962, ""Advise and Consent.""  In it a young but influential senator, now happily married  and with a small child, had had sexual relations with a man while in military service who, now in poverty, is attempting to he commits suicide rather than suffer exposure, an effective if extreme solution to his problems.  CAUTION -- the next paragraphs contains spoilers to the plot of ""Shelter.""contact the senator for money and threatening to expose his past. The senator becomes so distraught with the situation before him that

This film makes one realize the distance we have (hopefully) traversed in 50 or so years.  In ""Shelter"" an artistically gifted young man, Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is helping to support his sister and her little boy, Cody (Jackson Wurth), and their ailing father, and, as a result, has given up his hopes of attending an art academy.  Zach's boyhood friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), who is straight, has an older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe), who had taught them both to surf a few years before and is known by his brother, Gabe, to be gay.  Shaun, who has returned to the area and is living at the family residence in a much nicer part of town,  reestablishes an acquaintance with Zach and a friendship begins to develop  between them.  As time goes on this becomes more than a friendship as Zach comes to terms with his sexual feelings and gradually falls in love with Shaun.  Zach's sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes), is planning to leave the area with her dolt of a male friend and intends to leave her child in Zach's care for a considerable period.  Zach's relationship with Shaun becomes known to her and she initially doesn't want her child anywhere near Shaun, but gradually comes to realize that Cody, who is very attached to Zach and now to Shaun as well, would be better off under his and Shaun's care than with her and her male friend who isn't particularly fond of Cody.  The film ends with Zach, now having broken up with his girlfriend, Tori (Katie Walder), and his little nephew now living happily with Shaun who has seen to it that Zach will get to attend art school after all.  The film was skillfully written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  The brief final scene of Zach, Cody and Shaun happily romping on the beach was apparently added some months after the film had been considered complete as both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are here seen having long hair.

The cast is generally excellent and the developing relationship portrayed between Zach and Shaun, a bit rocky at times due to Zach's uncertainty and hesitancy, being all the more captivating for that reason.  This is a dramatically and visually pleasing, well-made if rather short film about a character portrayed as being gay who does not necessarily end up as a victim of a mental breakdown, suicide or murder.  There are several scenes in this movie that are quite affecting, most notably the two scenes in which his two straight friends -- his ex-girlfriend, Tori, and his boyhood surfing buddy, Gabe  -- each in their way help put Zach back on the right track toward his relationship with Shaun, his obvious true love.

Zach is, of course, the central character of the story and all of the other characters are defined by their relationships to him. There is essentially no scene in the film in which Zach doesn't appear and the title could easily have been ""Zach's Story.""  How the title of ""Shelter"" was chosen isn't exactly clear to me.  Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe, both straight actors, bring a degree of warmth and believability to their characters that is quite amazing.

Incidentally, in the commentary track, director Jonah Markowitz erroneously refers to the suspension bridge in San Pedro, shown several times in the film, as the Saint Thomas Bridge.  The correct name is the Vincent Thomas bridge.

UPDATE -- 7-11-14:  Well, I held off for as long as I could and finally gave in and bought into the imported region-free Blu-ray of ""Shelter.""  I  had some trepidation.  ""Shelter"" was originally shot as a 16 mm negative, blown up to a 35 mm print, so I expected the possibility of seeing little improvement with Blu-ray.  Not so at all!  The improvement in detail and contrast is apparent from the first frame.  The sound is DTS optional for 5.1 and 2.0 stereo and is an improvement over the DVD version in that respect as well.  And there was no compatibility problem.  Only disappointment -- it doesn't include the commentary track available on the original.  But I have the DVD version tucked into the same case with the Blu-ray, so no big deal.  Worth every cent.",1297468800,4,4787,4.766990291262136

One small problem is at the end. They didn't tie up the loose end of who will look after a certain someone with back problems.

Jan 2011. Since I wrote my review, I've viewed a bunch of gay-themed movies. And it's really hard to find a nice, well-acted, directed, gay love story. This is more a coming out/love story but it's still sooooo nice. And tops the list of gay movies. I feel it's up there with Latter Days, Just Say Love, Thirteen or So Minutes (a short film), All Over the Guy and Antartica (I liked how straight forward the movie showed gay relationships).

His life wasn't easy by any means and he made major sacrifices for his family. The struggles the characters encountered were very real and relevant.

I have since watched the film many times at home, again introducing as many people as I could to it.

My opinion of the film has, since recently, changed ever so slightly though.

I'm not sure the film was nearly as brilliant as i (and judging by the reviews on Amazon everyone else who saw it) thought it was.

If you think about it, the story isn't that original, virtually every gay film of the last 10 years sings the same tune. And while Shelter is better executed than most other films of this genre (both gay and straight), its inherent weakness shows as the film caves in on itself mid way (as soon as the first obstacle arises)

Despite this, I do still believe that Shelter is worth seeing, as mentioned, the film is well made. The direction in the first half is sturdy, the cinematography, although hardly sublime, places you as the viewer in the perfect mood, and I loved most of the music used. The actors did exactly what was necessary to pull Shelter off, and after watching, it feels as though they are still there.

Most importantly the characters are well written, something that is tragically missing in most films of this kind.

'Shelter' is one such movie, which has as one of its best selling points, the 'normal' characters. Perhaps it is profound that the gay characters in this movie, are 'normal' in that they are love struck, confused, and yet function as every other person in society. They are not dying of Aids, nor are they subject to the frivolity of stereotypical gay casting. There is no neurosis, but rather an honest exploration of emotions. These gay men work, surf and love.

Most pleasing is the peace they find within themselves, despite how other characters react to their relationship. In short, a wonderful portrait of an alternative love, coloured in a way which sensitive without being condescending or stereotypical.",1277424000,2,954,4.888888888888889
3339298,5,B0013D8LCW,"I just recently started renting gay movies online. I never have before because so many of them are just campy, soft porn or just about the same thing (guys trying to get laid). Shelter is one movie which has made me very glad I did start renting this genre. The first thing that made me interested was, of course, the main characters. (Shaun is my ideal dream man.) But, after I started watching the movie, I realized there was so much more to it than the usual hot actors. I'm usually not too impressed with the storyline in a lot of the movies I watch because so many of them are the same thing over and over. Shelter immediately drew me in and made me want to watch more. So seldom do you see any romantic movies that show such compassion, challenge, sacrifice and realistic day-to-day struggles. I couldn't help but want everything to start going well for Zach, especially after he ran into Shaun. Zach had such responsibilities and character for someone so young. His sacrificing his dream of being an artist so he could take care of his nephew really touched my heart. I could definitely relate to the difficulties he had coming out to his friends and family. The movie was well written. The chemistry was off the charts. The character development was very well done. This is a movie I would truly want my friends and family (both gay and straight) to watch. It was a movie that left me with that happy lumpy feeling in my chest and the sparkle of happy tears in my eyes. It will definitely be in my ""Favorites"" section of my movies.",1277164800,3,1539,4.460992907801418
3339299,5,B0013D8LCW,"I'm so jealous of young gay men today!  They get to go to the movies and see gay characters that are three dimensional and well-developed; homosexuality is just one aspect of their personalities and not necessarily their defining characteristics.  Gone are the campy clowns, ubiquitous drag queens, and tragic AIDS victims that were required in the movies I grew up watching.  In movies like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Shelter"", the story is about two people falling in love who happen to be gay, which results in a much more realistic movie, and one which a wider audience can, I think, appreciate.

The photography in ""Shelter"" is absolutely top-notch.  I used to live in L.A., and I have never seen so many beautiful sunsets in my life!  The surf photography makes you want to run out and buy a board immediately and the footage while the actors are driving makes you feel like you are in the car with them.  I think there is enough creative camera-work to keep any fan of independent films happy.  Watch for how the shots of ""Zach's"" art transition smoothly into shots of buildings in the film, underlining the the title.

I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of acting in this film.  Whenever I see a movie in which the gay characters are portrayed by straight actors, I must admit I watch with a critical eye, but Brad Rowe and especially Trevor Wright, do an excellent job here.  They really portray the intimacy between their characters, not just the lust.  My favorite scene is when they are just lying in bed talking, and you can see in Zach's eyes how this relationship has become ""shelter"" from the stress of his life.  I also love how Trevor Wright appears 16 when he is happily looking at Brad Rowe's character, but looks like he's pushing thirty when burdened by the weight of expectations from others.  Tina Holmes also does a terrific job; somehow you feel sympathy for her character despite the terrible choices she makes.

I guess I'm biased, because this film is now one of my all-time favorites!  I could, and will, watch it over and over again.  A critic quoted on the DVD package calls this film an ""instant classic"", and I am in complete agreement because I believe gay men 10 years from now will be able to appreciate it just as much as we can today.",1276041600,5,2286,4.632754342431761

He is stuck in a painful life.  He escapes by surfing, by doing art when he can and by taking care of his nephew Cody (Jackson Wurth).  Change comes when he falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe).

This story is brilliantly written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  It fits together beautifully with no false notes.  Though all of the actors are excellent, I would like to single out Trevor Wright.  He was able to show a young man with his emotions on hold and then show the intense joy experienced by the same young man when he finds love.  Extraordinary.  You will want to see this film many many times.",1274832000,3,752,4.511111111111111

The actors are phenomenal, and several scenes and the scenery can take your breath away.  The montages should have editing awards and the sound track is so wonderful if you are any thing like me you will start looking for Shane Mack's CDs.

  Love is a powerful emotion and in this movie, Jonah Markowitz (writer/director) takes you to all the corners of it.  From the young man who has loved his family so unconditionally that his wants and needs are never thought about.  To the friends he has loved, cherished and respected.  And especially to the man he comes to love who teaches him what it's like to be on the receiving end and valued for the person he is first.

  I'm a 47 year old woman who has been reading romance books for almost 30 of those years.  It's rare for any movie to capture so many sides love.  I see praises for this movie as the best gay romance.  That is almost an insult to this movie, to limit it as such.  This is one of the best romance (happy ending) movies I have seen in a very, very long time.  If you're looking for a romance that will bring many emotions to the surface look no more.
BUY WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER, I HAVE!!!

It has grown on me since I first saw it and it's one of my 2 favorite ""gay movies"" - but I definitely don't think you need to be gay to like it.  (The other favorite is a French film, ""Just a Question of Love"".)  The dramatic tension in the story is based on simple, generally realistic connections and relationships between people.  Although it is didactic, it doesn't rely on or need melodrama or common gay stereotypes to produce impact; and you'd have to be pretty cynical and jaded not to be affected by it.  The story and characters are engaging, the acting is good, the production quality is good, the screenplay is pretty good, and the soundtrack supports the feel of the film.  Technically it's not a 5 star film, but it has qualities that work for me and raise it above the ordinary.  In short, Shelter is beautiful and heart-warming in its simplicity.",1268697600,,1012,4.451086956521739

What makes it work however, are the repsponsibilites he assumes for his family and the tensions that arise when he can no longer deny his loneliness for another male.  This comes in the form of his best friend's older brother.  The warmth of their relationship is beautifully wrought.  One begins to feel that there's a future waiting for this young man, even as he wrestles with his responsiblities at home and the desires that awaken him to the promises that life holds.

3339321,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is about Zach, a guy who just graduated high school and now is at a crossroads for his future. For a long time, he's been a father figure for his nephew, Cody, and he's been trying to be a good boyfriend for his on-again, off-again girlfriend. Meanwhile, he really wants to break free from it all and pursue his dream of becoming an artist. To make things even more confusing, he discovers he is gay when he begins hanging out with his friend's older brother.

Shelter is a wonderful movie because it's not just a ""gay movie."" Zach being gay is only one of the beautifully interwoven conflicts of this movie, not the only one. In addition, the intimate scenes are done tastefully and are not hardcore (which might be a detriment to some, but I think it helps preserve the art-like feel to it). It seems to me to be very realistic and enjoyable to watch. One minor thing which may be a problem for some is that there is quite a bit of swearing. Not a big deal for me, personally, but something that may bother others.

I'd recommend buying this movie because it has definite replay value and I'd suggest anyone watch it, not just LGBT supporters.",1263686400,,1153,4.459715639810427

3339325,3,B0013D8LCW,"I was disappointed after finishing this movie, especially after all the rave reviews.  Maybe it's just me, but why are there so many gay movies with the same types of plots?  Homophobia, AIDS, coming out...always seems to be the same boring sort of thing.  This movie was mainly the coming out and homophobia storyline.  It is 2009 - most gay guys I know are out and the majority of straight people I know are OK with it.

How about we finally make a movie focused on true love, sensuality, good times between gay characters without any of the conflicted feelings of coming out or dealing with homophobic idiots?  I was expecting that in this but there are very few moments of romance in this movie and most of them are ruined by someone who seems to be uncomfortable with actually getting out of that frickin closet or by his homophobic sister.

I felt bad for Shawn as if he deserved to be treated a lot better instead of having to deal with a straight/gay split personality type that is more focused on pleasing his stupid homophobic, irresponsible sister (that isn't very nice by the way) than throwing himself into a relationship that is very real, very loving and supportive, and could be so much more.  In the end, it was just an OK movie, a lot like other gay movies I've seen.  Might be worth a rent, but not worth buying.",1260230400,5,1331,4.4896265560165975

3339327,5,B0013D8LCW,"Viewing Shelter was like watching a miracle unfold before my eyes. While staying at a friend's house over the Thanksgiving holiday, serendipity intervened and allowed me to catch this sublimely acted and beautifully nuanced piece.  I don't think I'll ever be the same.

To me, what often separates the good from the great when it comes to film is that good movies manage to come up with something new while great movies are able to make standard material, even the highly cliched (boy meets boy/girl), seem completely original, authentic, and fresh. Shelter definitely falls under the latter description. What is miraculous is that it went a step further by having the narrative, music, and visuals completely wash over the viewer - like surfing a giant wave. The result is a sense that the film is an intimate chronicle of one's own journey for affirmation and acceptance, even if the details of one's life are completely different.

Just in time for the holidays, this DVD definitely tops my Christmas Wish List but in more ways than one: The soundtrack is beyond amazing and I hope to own that soon. Although I typically avoid movies that are made out of books, I would love to see the reverse take place and have a book made out of this movie. (It could be fictitiously penned by and written from the perspective of the character of Shaun, since he was a writer.) I also hope to see a sequel or a TV series even. I've read dismissive comparisons to the O.C., but if the Here! network (or any courageous channel) needed to put a contemporary spin on the typical family drama, I think this would be a great launching point. I kept yearning to see more as the characters moved forward with their lives and their relationships matured.

One could tell that everyone involved in the production, cast and crew, were totally invested in making the film. It's easy to understand why audience members like myself have been pulled in so passionately and completely.",1259452800,4,1959,4.752941176470588

It was about realizing your dreams, manifesting them through multiple challenges, and about the sacrifices that Love sometimes requires.  It was realizing that it was better to live honestly, be true to your nature, and of overcoming one's fears. I was impressed by the simplicity of the scenes and the richness in their content.  I liked the choice of neighborhoods and the lack of pretentiousness.

It showed the troubles with coming to the Fact that he actually did like another person and that it Happened to be a Guy.  Also liked the fact that you could just look at those two and never even think that they would be a couple. They could actually just pass off as two Best Friends.

Heck, [...]would of even been worth it.  This is one of my favorite romance films, gay or straight, and even though the technical presentation on the DVD is a bit underwhelming (the picture is soft, but the sound is fine, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1), that would be an invalid reason to miss a great of film as this.

If you are buying this DVD solely with the purpose of demoing your Home Theater system in the terms of picture quality, you'll be a bit disappointed.  But who am I kidding?  This isn't some action flick or a ridiculously high budget and loud special effects extravaganza.",1252368000,,961,4.558139534883721
3339333,4,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter doesn't rise to the level of great filmmaking but it's a really nicely made movie that's heart-warming and ultimately enjoyable to watch. To be sure, the script has too many ""dudes"" and ""bros"" and lots of guys catching waves. But it's no more a surfer movie that Brokeback Mountain was a cowboy movie. Surely that's part of the storytelling vehicle, but it's the human interactions that matter.

The other downside is that director Jonah Markowitz could have made a sexier film without crossing the line into soft porn. Shelter is tamer sexually than it needs to be. Honestly, would two guys who'd made love all night wake up together the next morning wearing underwear?

I occasionally found the music soundtrack somewhat distracting, even though some of the songs were good.

Still, Shelter is well-made film with a fairly good script, fine performances and excellent cinematography and film editing. The surfing and ocean scenes were beautifully filmed and edited.

So what if it has a somewhat predictably happy ending? Not every story of gay men ends with tragedy or heartbreak. This film deals with subject matter about which I'm personally familiar - dealing with your own sexuality and trying to decide your own future while playing father figure to your sister's offspring.

Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is caring and sensitive while being tough at the same time. His art and his surfing are his escapes from the realities of every day life.

Shaun, played by Brad Rowe, has returned home to lick his wounds after the breakup of his relationship but finds himself falling for Zach, the best friend of his younger brother Gabe. Shaun taught Gabe and Zach to surf and its surfing that brings Shaun and Zach together.

The movie shows how conflicted Zach is about his sexuality. There's the moment when after a night of drinking together he allows Shaun to kiss him, only to wake the next morning running away from what happened. He returns the stares of another surfer in a beach parking lot, but turns away when he becomes uncomfortable. He becomes standoffish with Shaun each time he gets questions about his sexuality from his sister Jeanne, with whom he lives and whose he is father figure.

He initially gives in, but backs away when he's unsure of how to deal with all the pressures in his life while loving another man.

Shaun is patient, but I don't believe overly so. There are moments when Shaun pushes for what he wants but backs away when he realizes he's pushing too hard.

Overall, I see places where some improvements could have made this good movie into an excellent one. Still, it is a good, very enjoyable movie and one worth adding to your DVD collection.",1251763200,4,2691,4.817787418655097

That is so awesome!!! I'm glad they made a movie like this to show how gays really are. We're not ""perverts"" as we are often portrayed but real ""normal"" people like anyone else with feelings, connections, etc. I especially loved the ending as well.

3339360,4,B0013D8LCW,"""Shelter"" has a lot going for it.  An interesting and credible screenplay, an attractive and professional cast, some excellent surfing action footage and impressive outdoor settings.  Most of all, it succeeds in establishing characters that the viewer comes to care about a great deal.  The story goes well beyond some of the usual gay coming of age genre flicks.  It avoids soft porn titillation and sexual fantasy in favor of presenting the developing affection between the two lead characters--Zach and Shaun.  And it does not pretend that there are not other things going on in those characters' lives.  In the case of Zach, a major load of family obligations while facing of a bleak future.

The film also demonstrates--pretty accurately in California, at least--the transition from rejection to unconditional acceptance that gay and lesbian people are seeing these days.  The unquestioning reassurance that best friend Gabe (Shaun's brother) gives to Zach is touching and, I think, not unrealistic for that generation.  This is repeated later by Torrey, Zach's girlfriend.  This kind of acceptance was unimaginable for most gay people 20 or even 15 years ago.  It is extremely touching and gratifying to see it expressed now.

""Shelter"" is a very good indie film that fully deserves its apparent success.  There have been many gay genre films that have covered the same material but without the skill and sensitivity that are present in this film.  ""Shelter"" sets a kind of standard that I hope will be regularly exceeded in the future as gay-themed stories receive the kind of mainstream production that they might deserve.",1240185600,3,1630,5.14828897338403
3339361,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is a defining film for the gay community and stands shoulder to shoulder with Brokeback Mountain. For all the criticism about its imperfections on plot line and lack of sexual content, the movie depicts an ordinary situation for a young disenfranchised man with raw talents and suppressed aspirations. Movie critics were looking for gay stereotypes in such films, and the lack of it should be celebrated as a hallmark that the time of acceptance has come to mainstream markets.

Trevor Wright delivers a masterful performance as a rebellious, dissatisfied artist with a confused sexuality. He embodies the angst of someone having to put off his dreams and goals for the betterment of others. The camaraderie between him and Brad Rowe is easy and believable. The scenes of intimacy speaks to a couple who has found a connection beyond sexuality and physical needs. Through a simple smile, a look of trust, and a gentle caress, Trevor has conveyed what gay relationships (or any romantic relationships) are really about - connecting with that one individual that makes you feel like the top of the world every day.

By portraying intimacy rather than lust, this movie has successfully recast sexuality as an aspect rather than the entire identity of a person. That assertion in itself makes this a brave film by refusing to bend to perceived gay norms. It is no wonder that this movie had consistent connected with people old and young, gay and straight, rich and poor - the truth is powerful. Look no further than the hundreds of positive Youtube reviews for confirmation.

I hope that Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe will get more work - they have truly done gay and lesbians a service by doing this film and should be rewarded somehow.",1240099200,7,1740,4.8915254237288135

3339364,4,B0013D8LCW,"This is just one of those rare great movies you'll find in gay cinema.  It has a story that is unique and poignant, great writing, and some great acting.

What it's missing is the sexual tension.  I don't see those looks of lust between Zack and Sean.  When they're not in bed together, they act as if they're two straight guys hanging out.  Yes, it's clear that they learn to deeply care for each other and be vulnerable - but that's not lust.  Every moment leading up to the make-out session is without sexual tension.  No lingering looks or ever so slightly too long touches.  Not that we need that to be over-the-top, but we something - anything!  People that are about to hook-up need to look to each other as if they're wanting each other -- which they don't.  Frankly, it just seems under-rehearsed.

Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright never seem to take on their characters as whole different people than who they, themselves as the actors, are.  The way they walked, moved, spoke -- it just didn't seem that there was any stretching or altering of themselves to play these characters.  They never change their own individual vocal patterns or posture to become different characters.  We've all seen many straight men play gay characters.  But this was the first time I was really just not buying it. I didn't believe either of them were gay.  I understand and appreciate not wanting to ""act gay,"" but all gay men have this look about them that says they've been through repression and hard-times.  They just didn't.  It's hard to explain - but it wasn't there. This resulted in the sex scenes' passion to be mediocre -- hot, but mediocre.

In addition, I got a distinct feeling that the Zack/Sean relationship needed to be explored and analyzed more by these actors.  I saw an interview where Rowe said that he got the script three days before filming.  It shows.

Sadly, it's the film's star, Trevor Wright, who never really rises to the occasion in his acting.  He never seems to truly makes Markowitz's lines his own for most of the movie.  He never fleshes-out a character that would really speak these lines.  All his subtexts and actions seemed very directed and mannered.  It was clear that he did a lot of work as an actor to understand Zack's story, but rarely did I see the inner torment a gay man who's scared to come-out goes through.  It just wasn't enough to really succeed.

Brad Rowe is an incredibly natural actor - making Markowitz's words his own and really come to life.  We grew to like Sean and feel he was a real person.

Tina Holmes was the stand-out actor of this film.  She embodied Jeannie, made her relatable, and earned our understanding and sympathy.  We can tell she understood and empathized with the character's situation.  She's a great actress and did a phenomenal job.

In the end, it's because the film is so touching that makes the audience root for it.  It touches any romantic's heart.  I highly recommend that everyone watch this.  Slightly critical of this movie, I was.  Disappointed, I absolutely wasn't.",1239753600,2,3050,4.652908067542214

What amazes me is how authentic it feels, whether we are watching surfers, ""dudes"" around the campfire and their girlfriends, the life of a short-order cook and devoted uncle, or two young men falling in love.  It made my heart ache, just like real life sometimes.

Beyond the romantic love story, the film is a testimonial to family love:  kindness, loyalty, tolerance and solidarity.  Without making a too-obvious statement, it delivers the highly political message that gay men have a place in family life and, in some cases, are the anchor for everyone else.  The main character, Zach, never questions the rightness or inevitability of his commitment to his nephew and his sister, and although several other characters talk about his making a ""choice,"" we see (and he tells us) that it is a given, not a choice.  In view of the circumstances he faces -- nowhere job, collapsing home environment, impossible future -- he is truly heroic just to carry on.  It is inspiring to see him struggling to find love for himself while meeting all of the standards he has set for himself with respect to others.

Trevor Wright's performance is extraordinary.  He seems so completely natural that it doesn't feel as if he is acting at all.  Since this is the only time I've ever seen him, I can only wonder whether he could bring the same conviction to another role, but he totally inhabits this one.  The subtle ways that his character expresses his affection for the little boy are credible and affecting.  He is very likeable and lovable.

A couple of weeks ago, I found myself in a bookshop where the movie was being rented by someone, and told them ""You will LOVE this movie. It's agonizingly slow and sometimes painful, yet the ending is WELL worth sitting through the painful parts [painful as we see Zach's character going through his own changes in the way he sees the world and himself]."" I have since purchased the movie through Amazon.com, and am waiting on its delivery, and have bought the music soundtrack. All of the laudatory comments in favor of this movie here may be a bit much, yeah [especially so if you read as many of them as I just did] but I believe ""Shelter"" deserves it. The story could not be more realistic, I believe, as it is portrayed through the two male leads, and - the other reviewers are right when they say it - the eyes say more and better than words ever could, in real life OR on the silver screen.

A now ages-old phrase - ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" - can be honestly paraphrased for this movie, ""Truth is far more endearing than fiction,"" as ""Shelter"" portrays something we see hardly anywhere from Hollywood, and that is characters that are not caricatures, and portrayed by people who are not being picked for star-power, rather, people who are talented, assisting in bringing us a story worth watching, and caring about. By the way, if you are prone to tears, I would suggest watching it with some tissues at hand, as it has a tendency to evoke some ""wet"" moments.

Five stars for ""Shelter,"" and definitely a ""heads-up!!!"" for the music from the film!!! The music alone brings tears to my eyes, but the movie?!?!? All I can say is ""WOW!!!"" I have listened to the CD repeatedly for a solid week now, and only have the 1 CD in my car. Shane Mack's voice - especially so on ""Lie to Me"" - may honestly ""haunt"" you, as it has me.

Many of the positive reviews put out here are right on the mark. I'm not sure I can add much to them except to say that this movie seems REAL. Ok, so it may be somewhat predictable, but this is how people talk and act and how life turns out sometimes. The cool thing about it is that it is definitely uplifting. The chemistry between the lead guys is amazing.

Some of the criticisms in here are much too nitpicky. I mean, how do we know that Zach didn't park his car a few blocks away from Shaun and Gabe's house when he went to see Shaun again (thinking that Gabe could show up anytime). This isn't a detective story, where you try to figure out everything that happens that is not shown on film! And I personally didn't understand Zach's artwork, but so what? That was his passion. And someone wrote about a 'scholarship for an child'??  Did they see the same movie?! Not even in the plot!

3339409,5,B0013D8LCW,"This is a simple story about a young man following his heart and finding his dreams. Zach (Trevor Wright) is working class, with a crappy job as a short-order cook, an on again/off again relationship with Tori (Katie Walder), a very sick widowed father, and a feckless, self-centred single mother of a sister (Tina Holmes) whose only redeeming feature is her adorable five-year-old Cody (Jackson Wurth). Zach is Cody's only real male role model, and not surprisingly, Cody looks up to him as a father, not an uncle.

Zach has a lot of responsibilities, and since his hope of going to art school died when his mother did, and his sister got pregnant, his only joys in life are his friends and his surfing. He's aware, much more so than his privileged best friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), or his sister Jeanne, how much of life is passing him by, and what he's given up for his family, but there seems no way out. Until Gabe's handsome, gay older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe), returns to Malibu and doors open, along with Zach's heart.

I've seen reviews of this film which call it  mediocre and unambitious. Seems to me that misses the point. It's not a story of high drama. It's about small things - ordinary family dysfunctionality, ordinary dreams, ordinary love. The extraordinariness lies in Zach's selflessness and Shaun's willingness to help him out of the hole in which he's drowning. What makes this film work is the beautiful, affectionate tenderness between the two leads (both straight actors turning in gorgeous and credible performances as young gay men in love), and the strength of the acting on all sides. Every character rang true - and when even the kid didn't strike me as stupidly cute, there has to be something working. I especially loved the character of Tori, who could have come off as a heinous bitch, but was instead a rounded and likable friend to her ex-boyfriend.

Tina Holmes as Jeanne has a thankless task in an unpleasant role, but she is pitch perfect as the emotionally manipulative and immature mother and sister. Her scenes with  Trevor Wright are painfully honest. But then Wright just shines in this. He and Rowe have such chemistry together, such physical easiness - you see them as friends and as lovers, and they felt completely real to me.

It's a short film at an hour and a half, and though it takes a while to get going, it's well worth the wait, and is a positive, happy affirming portrayal of young gay people that allows them a happy ending. That in itself makes it worth the price of admission/purchase.",1230249600,8,2547,4.712359550561798
3339410,5,B0013D8LCW,"First of all, I want to be on record as SWEARING that Brad Rowe is actually the love child of Brad Pitt and Rob Lowe... just look at him!!!

This is an easy film to like.  Much of the conflict that drives the story is internal for the characters.  The young lead is quite a good actor, displaying those conflicts with his expressions more than his words - just like most college aged boys would do.  He moves between the freedom and joy of surfing and the challenges of lower socio-economic existance.  He struggles with relationships, challenged by his desire for honesty and his fear of the consequences that truth will bring.  And through it all we see him growing, in realistic ways.

I do think the movie fails in any type of exploration of the meaning of relationships between younger and older men (if early 30's can qualify as older).  I never did quite figure out the time span covered in the film, but decided I'd like the film best if it is months rather than weeks.

The surfing and waves make great symbols of change, control, collapse.  The always sunny Southern California setting adds a quality of its own, whether at the multi-million dollar house or the places next to the refineries.

The most effective mesage taken away from the movie is how true love, if between lovers, friends, family is inclusive.  It is neediness that blocks those not seen as the fount of that satisfaction.

All a little esoteric.  This movie is a pleasure to watch.  The extras, particularly the ""making of"", add a lot of value.  Though, I gotta say, I still get bummed out when straight actors, even the gorgeous ones, get to play the solid gay characters.  Yeah, I know.

3339415,5,B0013D8LCW,"I love this movie. I'm not interested in either surfing or California, but that's no handicap to enjoying ""Shelter,"" because what it's really about is relationships. The screenplay is sharp and believable, the pace is exactly right, the story is engaging without being too melodramatic, and the ending is both very happy and completely believable, unusual and welcome in a gay movie.

Brad Rowe's performance is fine and understated, appropriate for the slightly older and more experienced lover, and Trevor Wright is amazing in a strong, intense, very intelligent performance. I'd never heard of him before, but I'll be looking for more.

I'm glad to see such talented straight actors willing and able to play gay in non-stereotyped roles. And I'm very grateful and surprised that neither man has the gym body that seems to be required in gay entertainment nowadays. It's so refreshing to see bodies that don't look like they've been tortured.

Tina Holmes as always is excellent, and Ross Thomas is very funny and sweet as the brother/best friend. But best of all are Jonah Markowitz's wonderful screenplay and direction. This movie is smart, subtle, immensely entertaining, entirely believable, and never boring, predictable, or depressing. I love it.",1229385600,,1254,5.2288557213930345

That being said this is a beautifully acted and paced story that will tug at your heart strings. Every time I watch it I fall in love with it all over again. Trevor Wright as Zach is phenomenol especially with how he can convey his feelings with a look or action and no words are spoken (most noticably the smile on the way home after the first night together and a hug with Shaun near the end)

Everyone was fantastic in this but I wanted to hit the sister character with a blunt object every time she opened her mouth, I absolutely detested her character but understand her importance to the movie (but I don't have to like it.)

So watch it now.. and later too. And if you haven't already watch it with the commentary. In fact I think it is time to watch it right now.. I am in need of a BGLM.

3339428,4,B0013D8LCW,"I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: ""What does a film maker leave behind?"" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.

I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a ""Beatific Vision"", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.

As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.

When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.

When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.

Thank-you angels for this ""angels on earth"" experience!

The movie has some great scenes of surfing and skateboarding, as well as ""bombing"" the suburbs with graffiti art.  In many respects, the movie combines various subcultures in a new and innovate hybridized form.  Surfing, graffiti, and the gay world meet and intermingle in this novel refreshing film.  The love scenes and the kissing are so tender.  The emotions of the actors are so intense that I felt as though I was a participant in the movie.  I was not merely a spectator, but was involved in this film completely.  Seeing Zach's evolution was truly uplifting and inspiring.  This is not simply a ""gay film.""

3339431,5,B0013D8LCW,"I watched this movie almost like I would have watched a fairy-tale. Actually, considering, I would say Zach is a modern Cinderella... His desires always came second after his family's and he didn't even realize how much his sister (or his absent father for that matter) took him for granted. And when his chance to have a life eventually came his way he almost pushed it away. Felt bad for Shaun - who didn't deserve at all Zach's rebiffs and second thoughts - but oh, how understandable these second thoughts and self-guessing were...
It would be difficult to choose favourite moments in the movie. There were several - loved a lot the 'fast forward over few days' silent scenes - the first showing the beginning of Zach-Shaun relationship and the last one showing a glimpse of their and Cody's life, the touching moment of Zach's apology, the comic of almost-discovery by Gabe of our couple in bed and so many others.
And, if there was any doubt, there is a happy ending. To paraphrase a publishing site, maybe there is not the certitude of 'happily ever after' but there is absolute a 'happy ending for now'. Which, considering your own quota of optimism could easily be upgraded to 'ever after'.:-)
I highly recommend this movie. It will prove a very enjoyable entertainement and will leave you smiling happily at 'the end' moment.

However, there are puzzling flaws in the backstory that cause a good deal of the film to seem contrived.  For example, the chances of an eight year old student earning a scholarship to a wealthy private school seems unlikely.  Do scholarships even exist at the grammar school level?  Or, how did Shaun come to know Zach's sister and mother well enough to comment about them as he did?  What kind of relationship existed between the two families that allowed a second grade Zach and Gabe to travel the significant distance between their homes in order for their deep brotherhood to develop? And, if Zach has visited Gabe at college only once in the four years since high school, how close could they possibly remain?

3339448,4,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter was touted as being the next Brokeback Mountain when I first read reviews.  I wouldn't say it's quite to that level but it is a nice story.  I also like the fact that it's a gay themed movie focused on a love story without the need of nudity (much to the chagrin of some I'm sure).  It's this type of movie that I feel will have a more positive influence on society's acceptance of the gay community.

It's a story about a young guy who is either closeted or unaware of his gay nature until that one special person comes into his life.  It shows his struggle of accepting himself while also showing the fear he experiences while contemplating what effect the revelation of his discovery will have on his family...especially his relationship with his nephew who has come to revere him as a father.  He tries to force a heterosexual relationship but ultimately can't escape his emotional and sexual attraction to someone he's known throughout his life.  It shows the level of emotional stress that he faces not only with his sexuality but also with the support that he must provide to his family.  The complexity of the emotions is a struggle that many of us in the gay community can relate to.

3339450,2,B0013D8LCW,"I respectfully disagree with most of the other people who have commented about how great this movie is.  My personal opinion is that the bar for gay cinema has been so lowered that this passes for greatness; it really doesn't.

It's true that the film doesn't indulge in gay stereotypes:  that is, there's no campy/effete/flamboyant character to epitomize what it ""is"" to be a gay man.  The gay men in this film drink beer, and they surf.

But all the other stereotypes are there in spades.  Zach's best friend, another surfer dude, who laments ""Oh, why wouldn't you come out to me?  I'm your best friend!""  (Listen to how he refers to his gay brother and decide whether you want to be defined by your sexuality like that from then on.)  Zach's sister, who naturally doesn't want to raise her child around some ""fag,"" but who changes her mind after one impassioned speech.  And Zach's ex-girlfriend, remarkably tolerant of the fact that the guy she last slept with has moved on to sleep with guys.

Zach himself is not a gay stereotype; instead, he is an ""indie movie"" stereotype.  The troubled kid with a heart of gold who loves his family and his nephew sooooo much that he refuses to ever call his sister (mother of the nephew) out on how poorly she's raising the kid.  In almost every scene she's in, Zach's sister is busing imposing upon him to take care of Zach while she goes off galavanting with her new boyfriend who, oddly, doesn't like her kid.  The exceptions are one scene when she's loudly making out with the new boyfriend while her son is asleep, and when she's imposing on Zach to take the kid for six months to a year while she moves to another city with the boyfriend.  (For some reason, the ENTIRE CITY PROHIBITS THE INTRODUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO ITS BORDERS.)  Zach never once complains, but instead sucks it all up, giving up portions of his social life and definitely giving up his dream of going to art school on a full scholarship.

3339457,5,B0013D8LCW,"I am gay, but I dislike most of the gay movies out there. There are only a few exception: Brokeback Mountain, Borstal Boys and Beautiful Thing. All other gay movies are always victims to one of the followings: being too sensitive, or too chatty, or too corny. This is certainly an exception: no drag queens, no drugs, no gay bars, no AIDS victim, no party boys. And it's thoroughly refreshing.

Enough good thing have been said about this movie, which is now in my very short list of favorite gay movies. A lot of reviews give credit to Trevor Wright for his excellent performance. Credit well deserved. However, I think director Jonah Markowitz deserve the most credit for putting together a movie in which everything feels so natural and real.

The best part of this movie is the dialogue: It's short, precise and yet powerful. For example: the dialogue on the patio after their dinner:

Shawn: ""I admire what you are doing for Cody. You don't have to.""
Zach: ""Yes. I do.""
Shawn: ""It's a choice, Zach.""
Zach: ""It's family.""
Zach: ""The only one left.""
Shawn: ""You get that from your mom.""
Zach: ""Yeah, I know.""
Zach: ""Lucky me.""

This is a simply love story. Even though the word ""Love"" was never said in the movie, there was never one moment of doubt how much they were in love. There are lots of little things in the movie that you will recognize if you were ever in love. When Zach was driving away after his first night with Shawn, a little smile slowly crept up his face, and he just couldn't hold it anymore, and scratched his head for getting a little embarassed on the silly happiness.

Shane Mack also deserves high praises for the songs he wrote for this movie. When Zach couldn't fall asleep, flipping back and forth, the images of him with Shawn were flashing through his head. The moment wouldn't have such an emotional impact without Shane Mack's ""More Than This"" playing in the background.

The negatives I can think of is that for someone who's never been with a guy, Zach was quite adept in stripping off Shawn's cloths that night. Also, Gabe would have seen Zach's truck outside when he barged in, and he's not the kind of person who wouldn't say anything about it. Sorry, I know I am nitpicking. But if you are like me watching this movie 10 times in the first week, you would be too. :-)

I do have one issue with the cover of the DVD. If I hadn't read its review first to know what the movie is about, I would have easily dismissed it as another soft-core gay porn that's dressed up as a movie. There could be a hundred moments in the movie that would be a better cover than this bed shot. I have to believe that it wasn't picked by the director who has handled everything so tastefully without losing the erotic force. Thanks to AfterElton.com that listed it as the #3 of all time greatest gay movies, I didn't miss now-my-favorite gay movie that's not a tragedy (BBM and Borstal Boys) or a fairy tale (Beautiful Thing).

In my opinion, David Wiegand from SF Chronicle has the best review on this movie: ""Sometimes a film that otherwise relies on stock storylines and even skirts the fringes of old-fashioned melodrama can rise up on the strength of other elements. In the case of writer/director Jonah Markowitz's feature film debut, ""Shelter"" rises very high indeed, thanks to a superb performance by Trevor Wright in the lead role, a strong supporting cast, very good cinematography and, most of all, emotional authenticity.""

It was great to see a movie which wasn't steeped in gay culture,  that was about normal people going through hardships and while doing so discovering who they where and where they wanted to go in life.  The story follows Zach, a young man who instead of going to college, stayed behind to watch over his sister and her son.  His sister is a poor mother, leaving Zach to fill the parental role for his young nephew all the while trying to express himself through his art and surfing.  When his best friend's older brother Shaun  comes back into town for a month,  Zach begins to discover himself and driven by Shaun, starts to go after a better life than the one he had chosen.",1220659200,,732,4.268115942028985
3339460,5,B0013D8LCW,"I have been watching this movie incessantly for the last three weeks.
What I enjoy about this movie the most is the lack of big dramatic acting, which invariably is used in modern day cinema by actors cast to play in mildly-unrealistic to completely-incredible roles. Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright are great enough actors to make the story feel like watching a real life situation.

The bulk of the emotion in this movie is told in the actors' facial expressions. Scenes in this movie in which Zach is attempting to deal with the inner turmoil of his newly-revealed sexuality, would have been tainted and unbearable if they had been filled with exaggerated and unnecessary words. Instead you can see/feel the insult and hurt felt when Trevor Wright's he frowns, nose crunched, and in his eyes you can believe the character is thinking something along the lines of ""Please God, just give me a hole to crawl into.""

In addition because there is so much unspoken passion in this movie it makes it all the more compelling when Zach raises his voice, which happens all of three times. The first time, his sister confronts him about his relationship with Shaun and the potential detriment to her son. Zach's immediate response is defiant, a statement that he is standing up to his sister for the first time. It is an indication that the character is beginning to grow out of submission.

The second time, Gabe confronts him about his relationship with Shaun. Blindsighted and unprepared to deal with this reality, Zach raises his voice to his best friend in defense. You can see that Gabe doesn't exactly know how to comfort his friend either and immediately backs down, without letting him know that he does not wish to lose their friendship over this.

The third time, in the final scene, Jeanne's boyfriend demeans Zach's would-be-son. At this point the audience is clear on the fact that while most of the character's growth has involved his sexuality, most of the character's LIFE has revolved around his nephew. To hear this abrasive, offensive NOTHING attack Cody like this is too much after everything that Zach has been through, and Zach lashes out with a passion that actually brought a tear to my eye. We should all have someone who cares about us so.

The worst example of acting in this movie comes from the character of Billy, who has all of three lines in the darkness by a fire, and is merely there to establish the aspect that Zach's friends' lives continue to move on while his own remains fairly static.

Not a single word, facial expression, or stance is wasted in this movie. And if you're a straight guy who is afraid of GLBT-themed movies out of discomfort at seeing full frontal male nudity, have no fear.

This movie was quite different.  The movie actually had actors and actresses that could, um.....ACT! Straight or gay in real life is so unimportant especially when you can pull it off like these guys(and girls).

3339505,5,B0013D8LCW,"As always in 'gay themed' movies there is the definite temptation to play the party boy/drug user/AID victim card. It's incredibly refreshing to find a movie that doesn't pander to traditional gay male stereotypes. There have been a lot of things said here about this movie already, some incredibly insightful. Rather than try to struggle for the usual explicatives, I'll just say how & why this movie moved and touched my soul.

There were a lot of plots and subplots going on here; poverty, desperate lives being crushed and yet there was always the glimmer of hope on the horizon, art, angst of coming out and the poignancy of first time/unconditional love. And of course, how utterly exquisite to truly portray how much a sport can mean to a male and how it can anchor us even in the craziest of times. Although my life has been somewhat different, I can relate to so many levels and pieces of this movie that it's scary and uncanny at the same time. All of it...to come out as an adult when formally you've been in hiding with all your friends, to catch that one last run of the day as you chase the sun...to have the freedom (for the first time) to really love somebody of the same sex that you were always meant to love in the first place. I lived this movie through both the main characters because I've been both the main characters as I lived through poverty with hopeless, broken dreams and a unwavering loyalty to 'family', while discovering true love in the midst of chaos and ashes.

And through it all, Zack's mural was his life; his frustration, his intense sadness, his trap, his love of family, the angst of being misunderstood by everyone and finally the sublime happiness of new-found love. It's all there, the life of a man painted on a wall for the world to witness and see.

This isn't a perfect movie by any means; the 'sex scene' was stilted and phony, yet the tender kissing scenes where as good as they can get. Truly, both the main actors are gifted to pull off such a believable gay love story.  But this is a movie that you have to take in it's entirety and not something subject to be picked apart scene by scene. There were times when I shouted at the screen and times when I teared up. The relationship with Shaun and Zack's little brother (Cody) was magnificently portrayed. It's not publicized enough how fluid and positive gay men can be around impressionable boys.  The homophobic ignorance portrayed is painfully accurate in this movie; with respect to how many parents/adults think that young boys hanging around with a gay role model is 'just not right'.

I've probably seen 150+ gay themed movies in the last three yrs and this one is absolutely in the top tier of my mental queue list. Rent it, buy it and just enjoy it!  God, please give us more movies like this one.",1216339200,13,2810,4.5305719921104535

3339509,5,B0013D8LCW,"Along with ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Yossi and Jaeger,"" Shelter takes its seat as a likable and pretty love story. This is the second movie about gay surfers I have seen along with the Australian flick ""Tan Line."" In what is considered a predominantly straight world, surfers, both of these movies explore the possibilities of gays among the ranks of these members.

There seem to be a great deal of reviewers with huge amounts of information about the movie so I am going to be brief. The movie is about the love that develops between two surfers Shaun (Brad Rowe) and Zack (Trevor Wright.) Zack comes from a dysfunctional family with a sister who is a single mother and her son Cody. Zack pretty much plays a father role to Cody and babysits him a lot. Shaun comes from a rich family who has a house by the beach. They both grew up together but Shaun being older than Zack. Shaun's brother is Zack's buddy.

Zack discovers he is gay after one night of drinking with Shaun. Shaun has just returned from LA who just broke with someone and was waiting to get a new place. Shaun kisses Zack and the turmoil begins.

Jeannie, Zack's sister, decides to move to Oregon with her new boyfriend. She dumps Cody on Zack. Zack finally comes to grips with his sexuality and decides to become a family with Shaun who adopts Zack and Cody.

Zack is a very talented artist who gets accepted to an Art College with a full scholarship. Shaun is a writer for Hollywood. And Jeannie abandons her son.

That is the movie in a shell. I like how Zack is portrayed as a caring, selfless, loving young man. The movie also projects that a men gay couple can be loving parents, that is definitely a plus.

This a good movie and a great love story. The men look very masculine, with Trevor Wright having that beautiful rough exterior. Wonderful cast and super job for the director.",1215475200,3,1852,4.497023809523809

3339513,5,B0013D8LCW,"Sometimes, rarely, after having watched dozens upon dozens of disappointing films, you get lucky and come across one that not only lives up to, but surpasses all the praise that more often than not was just hype anyways. And... also sometimes, you go back to watch it a second time just to see if your first impression was correct, and you are horrified to see that you were mistaken and that this is just a lousy film and you don't know what you were thinking. Have I sufficiently confused you? Then let me just say that this film, ""Shelter"", was one of the most beautiful, surprising, well acted, noble films I've ever seen. These actors, most of whom are either unknown or not ""stars"", are so, so much better than the small but undying, rotating, irritating crop of so called superstars that monopolize every churned out piece of Hollywood garbage. The performances here are so seamless, modest, and real, that you feel that you are watching just that, real life. Of course, watching real life can be boring, and what most actors and films of today completely fail at is to not only make the story interesting, but enables it to go beyond being entertainment to give it that intangible element of realism that  truly moves you. In this film you feel their pain, joy, loneliness, frustration,  and liberation in your very gut, and that is rare for  films today, especially a ""small' film that does not bang you over the head with special effects or try and bring a tear to your eye with overacting and ear splitting sweeping music.  Though this film has a gay story line, it is relevant to anyone who is alive, and it's message about love, loyalty, and being true to yourself is for everyone. I will not go on and i will not tell you the story line as plenty of other reviewers have already done this, and some of them very well.  I will only say that as a person who grew up loving the movies and having been disappointed in 95% of all the films made in the last 25 years, it is so refreshing, enjoyable, and heartening to come across a film as beautiful as this one. It is poetry. It is perfect. It hopefully makes some people aware that there are different and positive qualities that define a ""family."" It is the best film of it's kind that I have ever seen. And the actors, director, writer, etc..should all be extremely proud of their accomplishment, and, as a disheartened, quality- starved filmgoer, i thank them all.",1215043200,9,2427,4.54462242562929

The two form a friendship again even after knowing each other for years. The chemistry between them is awesome and the one....only one...(darn) heated love scene, is electrifying. It was a good movie. The only complaint I had was I wanted more good sexy fun between the two men, and less brow beating agony. But I do get the producers were looking for mainstream, and mainstream love to see gay men punish themselves...yawn. Buy it.

3339525,5,B0013D8LCW,"When Zack, a young man (one year, I think, out of high school) reconnects with his best friend's big brother (Shaun,) long-suppressed sparks cannot be contained.

However Zack is the one solid member of his dysfunctional and crumbling family: his father is injured, his mother is dead, and his sister is unconcerned and inattentive to her 5-year old son Cody.  Zack fulfills the parental role for Cody, although at times grudgingly, as he gives up hope for a better future on the other side of the tracks and resigns himself to a life of flipping burgers.

Suddenly Zack cannot suppress his feelings for Shaun, but nobody is really thrilled with the revelation that Zack might be gay.  Zack must decide between his own needs and dreams (whatever he decides they are) and the needs and requirements of his family.

3339544,5,B0013D8LCW,"Sure ""Shelter"" had its moments of conflict and drama, but this is one of a very few gay love stories I have seen that doesn't dwell too much on the dark side of gay life in the 21st century.

Zach is a talented artist from the wrong side of the tracks who has to take care of his ""family"": A neglectful and self-centered sister, her 5 year old son, and his disabled father. Zach often dreams of leaving it all behind and pushes away his best friend and girlfriend, brooding and resigning himself to a life supporting all those around him while neglecting himself. He finds ""shelter"" so to speak in his art, surfing and skating, spending time with his young nephew who calls him ""daddy"", and eventually in the arms of an older wiser man named Shaun.

Shaun is a struggling writer visiting the beach to recover from a breakup. He is Zach's best friend's brother, and the two hit it off when they bump into one another on the beach. What follows is a touching, sexy trip as Zach realizes who he is and finds a way to break out of the rut he is in with the help of his lover and two best friends.

""Shelter"" isn't perfect, but it is a huge step forward as far as gay love stories go in my opinion. Zach and Shaun are believable characters. Self-loathing, panicking parents, and stereotypes are washed out to sea in this gay film that focuses mainly on the drama and struggles of everyday life. Zach especially is a great character, trying to hold it together and do what is best for everyone he loves. The film also features a great soundtrack, which grows on you every time you hear it.

3339548,5,B0013D8LCW,"Jonah Markovitz gets an A+ for this project. Lead actors Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe also get an A+ for creating amazing yet believable chemistry between two gay men rarely seen before on the American silver screen. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did so with Brokeback but they also had a powerhouse director Ang Lee in an epically long film. Trevor and Brad deserve extra credit points on their permanent record cards. These men know how to express themselves with their eyes when words are pointless. Trevor Wright is a young Kathy Bates in the making.

Others have been critical of Brad's character Shaun saying that he was too patient. I disagree. This guy was rebounding from a split up in L.A. but as a writer he had the awareness to see the potential in Zach as a keeper. He saw the young man's selflessness and his freedom from the typical gay baggage.

The supporting actors also contribute greatly and are almost equally developed for their smaller roles. Tina Holmes' portrayal of the alcoholic sister is well played in her desperation not to be abandoned by another man. The role was dark and non-glamerous for the actress but she, along with the direction of Markovitz, create empathy and understanding for the character. Tina Holmes's character Tori shows emotional intelligence beyond her age and beauty. Ross Thomas as Gabe is adorable and comedic yet he too is developed to show admirable depth in his care for his best friend Zach.

The production quality is a standout for a low-budget indie thanks to the dollars invested by here! Films. The soundtrack is perfect and plays a key role in the film. Shane Mack's tracks define the tone of the film.

My only quibble is that the film could have been 15 minutes longer giving us a few more dialogue scenes with Zach and Shaun.

The story is perfectly set up for a sequel. I truly hope that Jonah will pitch the idea to here! Films and we as viewers can see how the characters lives evolve near CalArts.

I bought 3 copies of the DVD for family and friends who didn't see it in its short theatrical run. I also downloaded the soundtrack from iTunes.

3339549,5,B0013D8LCW,"Shelter is an incredible love story.  But it is also much more than that.

The acting is good, the story is incredible.  The love story is sweet and simple and unexpected--finding love with your best friend's brother.

But what I find most exceptional about this film is a basic underlying theme that sometimes gay people are the ones with the common sense.  Obviously, in Zach's family, only Zach and Cody have any common sense.  Zach feels an extreme sense of obligation to Cody while it is painfully obvious that Cody's mother is lacking in maternal instinct.

I think at first many will find Jeanne, Cody's mother, to be a somewhat shocking character in her nearly total disregard for her son's well being.  Sadly, it is all too common.

In the end, Shelter is a beautiful love story where pure and simple love is found among a sad and complicated situation and it is pure magic that a family is born out of all the turmoil.

There are moments of absolute magic in this film...scenes that should melt your heart...and yet they are actually quite simple.  When Shaun is looking at Zach's book of drawings and expresses the fact that he ""get's it"" and understands the meaning in the drawings and Zach just looks at Shaun in stunned silence.  The other scene is where Shaun tries to convince Zach to come over for steaks and tells Zach to bring Cody along.

I found myself starting to relate to some of the parts of the story, like, when they're just laying in bed together talking and enjoying each other, my partner and I do that all the time.  When Zach was pacing back and forth deciding if he should go see Shaun, I have done that too.  Zach being ""involved"" with someone else when he has his first kiss with Shaun; this happened to me.  One other example is how Zach let himself fall for Shaun and let things happen and how this would be his first boyfriend.  My partner and I have been together since December 2002, he is my first, and we are now engaged.

Thank you to Jonah Markowitz for bringing us this movie and to Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe for making these characters so believable.  In my own opinion this movie just become the one to beat, I don't know if any other gay movie will ever come close.",1213315200,3,1101,4.23444976076555

I guess that technically makes it a gay film, but it's so much more. This movie could be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. It's an instant classic and is one of the best, most romantic films I've seen.

I happen to really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times since it came out. The cinematography is excellent and shows the beauty that can be found in the ""wrong side of the tracks"", as well as how naturally gorgeous Southern California actually is.

I really enjoyed the acting and wasn't, the combination of the writing, acting, direction and camera work gives this film a very honest feel. You can tell that everyone involved really cared about the script. All of the actors are great, but both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe shine in this production - they are both very talented and charming actors and I honestly hope that we see more from the both of them in the future.

While there are things about the ending of the movie that feel a bit contrived, the sweetness of how it unfolds really outshines any criticism I have.

3339566,5,B0013D8LCW,"Absolutely my all-time nomination for BEST Made-For-Gay-TV film is ""Shelter"" (2007), an outstanding film produced by Regent for here! TV.

Zach (Trevor Wright) is a 22 year old who is aimlessly spending his life in the working class town of San Pedro, just inland from the fancy homes of Laguna Beach.  Besides his dead-end job as a short order cook, Zach helps to take care of his disabled, widowed father, as well as his young nephew Cody, whose single, alcoholic mother also lives with them. Zach is also an avid surfer and skateboarder, but his real passion and talent is as a art, specializing in ""tagging"" walls of buildings with his creative designs.  When his best friend, Gabe, away at college, Zach assumes he'll be going surfing alone, until Gabe's older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe, who most gay fans will remember from ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss""), arrives in town to stay for a while.  The two develop a friendship ... and more, as repressed gay leanings surface once he gets to know the openly-gay Gabe.  Zach initially fights his feelings, tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, and fears the ridicule of his buddies and sister if they found out.  His sister already made it clear that she doesn't want Cody being around ""that (derrogative term for homosexual)"", and Zach worries what could happen to Cody if he is not around to help with his care.

A realistically-portrayed coming-of-age/coming out masterpiece of a film, beautifully photographed and above-average acting, music and direction. A sweet, almost lyrical story with a positive message, showing that ""love"" transcends anyone's definition of a ""family,"" to include supportive friends who help you realize your ultimate happiness in life.

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form (you could see it as seeking the holy grail of that genre, or as looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection and purchase of a film to view is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or on comments/reviews by others of you at major online sites. Re the latter, sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those I can re-watch at least every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and for some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a full review with you, as follows for this film. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

As a preface to all this, I'm not interested in telling the story here; I'm into telling 'about' the story here. And that's easy because the gay relationship part of it is one of the best on film and DVD today.

First off, it's got to be said that, whether one's straight or gay (except for those already ""out""), putting yourself ""out there"" for this type role has got to be an extremely difficult decision. Why? Because people in our backward and selectively puritanical society are going to make assumptions about you for doing so---whether they be correct or incorrect. Bearing this in mind, Director Markowitz was surprisingly fortunate in obtaining the acting services of both a Trevor Wright and a Brad Rowe. And whether taking these roles was good for their careers, both actors absolutely shine in this production.......as used to be said: these guys got Chemistry. There's a naturalness, a comfortableness between the two that's seldom been achieved in other gay romances set to film.

Also, big kudos to this director for being able to elicit/draw out such intimately physical scenes between our two leads. Kissing, especially, comes across as unforced, unrushed (except when they're ""hot"") and completely enjoyed by the characters (even if and when ""tongue"" might be involved). I'd call this kind of ""acting"" going above and beyond. Would that every American, gay romance director achieve this same degree of natural intimacy on the part of male couples; very few have. In my opinion, only French director, Christian Faure, in his 2000 French production, ""Just A Question Of Love"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-a-Question-of-Love/dp/B0008ENHXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just a Question of Love</a>) (or ""Juste Une Question D'Amour"" when looking it up on some other film websites), set the bar higher. Intimacy between the two in that film fairly crackles.

As for their individual performances:

-- Trevor Wright puts Zach across as the ultimate likable guy---one putting everyone else's needs before his own (whether they deserve it or not). He's the one often being put upon, yet he stays so positive.......no wonder that Shaun falls for him. He makes us all fall for him. And nowhere do we do so more than when, at the end of his most intimate scene, he and Shaun are lying happily face to face, and Trevor has brought Zach's expression to such a peacefully satisfied level that Shaun just has to say: ""You're so beautiful"" (and at that moment we can see he truly is). Then, our Zach can only shyly bring himself to wrinkle his nose and softly scoff: ""Shut up."" What an endearing moment.

-- Re Brad Rowe: In preparing for this shoot and the extreme intimacy of some of the scenes, someone had to lead the way. I more than suspect that person was the older and much more film-experienced 'The Brad-ster.' This becomes apparent when you listen to the DVD Special Features Voice-over Commentary by Markowitz, Brad and Trevor, and conclude that Brad's comfortably easy and low key approach was just what was needed to pull character Zach (as well as newer performer, Trevor) out of any shell of fears and doubts he might be having. In the end, it is through Brad's Shaun that we see Zach being so very fortunate to have wound up with a loving/caring person who would remove him from the undesirable circumstances in which he lived.......and, importantly, get him into the advanced art schooling he so definitely deserved.

As concerns their ""time-together"" scenes and performances, it becomes obvious from listening to specific comments by Trevor and Brad in the Voice-over that they are quite proud of their work in the love-making scenes, particularly the really intimate moments. How often could we expect to hear non-gay actors express such thoughts---knowing everyone watching the video would hear them? Not often, I suspect.

And let's not forget about Director, Jonah Markowitz. It's obvious from watching this, his first-time feature film, that he has the chops to run with the big boys. Why? Because for any film to be successful, it is the ""little touches"" a director/scriptwriter worth his salt throws in that mean the difference in a memorable production and one that isn't. Take the exciting scene we all love where Zach returns to Shaun's house and, for all practical purposes, throws himself into Shaun's arms (and bed). Markowitz doesn't just shoot this happening; instead he gives us a very emotional lead-up scene of an agonizing Zach, pacing around his little art workspace and nervously knocking things about. Now, finally, he's fully admitted to himself who he is, sexually, and what kind of relationship he wants with the one who means the most to him. At this point, he's got our sympathies and has us worked up almost as much as himself......just waiting for that next step to be taken. It's then, in the very next scene, that we see Shaun heading for his front door and the person we know is anxiously waiting there. What happens next is: Wow!!  So you see, folks, this is how a really successful director does things.

Moving on to other considerations, not everything about the film works out so well for this reviewer. While Tina Holmes does a fine job with her role as Zach's sister, Jeanne, it is not her fault that her called-for and frequently whinny/naggy, oh-poor-me, onscreen time exceeds what otherwise would have made for a better film. We'd already quickly learned that it is Zach who is the real put upon one, whose life is being stolen. Better, by far, would have been less scenes involving her and more of involving Zach/Shaun's developing relationship.

And what's my favorite scene? Well I have to say that, other than those arousing ""BGLM"" shots (Dudes, ya just gotta learn what that means by taking in the DVD Voice-over feature), my fave is definitely that quiet, easy surfside stroll taken by Zach and Shaun, their arms comfortably bumping from time to time. They begin talking of writer Shaun's last book, a gay romance novel. And then, because of Zach's glowing remarks about having read the book, it starts becoming clear to us that it's becoming clear to Shaun that Zach clearly knows about and is comfortable with Shaun's, shall we say, big sexual proclivity in life. Then, it's, like, WHOA!!!......as it suddenly hits Shaun what just might lie ahead for the two of them. It's a perfect little scene.

A final thought involving an appropriate 'mantra' for this film.......which would be: {""Little by little, the 'Master' leads the 'Student' out---capitalize those 3 letters if you will---so he can be who he really is, and comfortably so""}.  That's really the journey on which this movie has taken us. (If you actually watch this film, the terms just now used will have so much more meaning).

P.S.---And, importantly, at the very end we've learned that, like fairytales, some ""Childhood Fantasies"" can also come true (here,again, if you listened well during the screening, you'll know what this means).

P.P.S.---If you've been wonder'n about this review's title), then all ya have to do to satisfy that itch is to grab a look and listen to the DVD Special Features section, wherein the Director + Brad + Trevor walk us through that 'first kiss' scene. Very enlightening.

P.P.P.S.---As to who was holding that Video Recorder (you know, the one that shot a little video titled:  ""SKATE THIS! with GABE & ZACH,"" showing a couple of early teenage skateboarders doin their thing) the answer would likely be a younger Shaun.  Then, it hits us:  isn't it interesting that an emotionally down and vulnerable Shaun---on the downspin from a difficult relationship breakup---finds his way back to that place of pleasanter times, that place of fonder connections, that place of.......Zach.  (We've already pretty much arrived at the conclusion that he hadn't come home to see his away-from-the-area parents, or a brother he'd been seeing from time to time, anyway).

3339570,5,B0013D8LCW,"This movie is probably one of the most ""make-me-feel-good"" gay-themed movies that I have ever seen and overall a very satisfying experience. What I love about this movie is that it doesn't give the usual cliche of traumatic past or tortured soul ... it is plain sweet, sexy, and down-to-earth. Added with luscious backdrops of San Pedro beaches, surfings, sunsets, AND AMAZING soundtrack - this is basically what gay-themed movies I have long wished for.

Because falling in love could be gentle, beautiful and rewarding - even among M/M. Sometimes there is no need for over-the-top or dramatic situation. This movie is also a story about commitment to other family members and acceptance of one's sexual preference over the other.

Both main actors make the relationship work and truly believable. The sex is romantic and sensual without having to show full body nudity. When it comes to that first love making, you can feel the tension that lead up to there and it's perfect. There are also those scenes where both characters just stay in bed, look into each other's eyes ...

It sizzles ALL the way through ... and worth watching more than once. I recommended it to another friend and she loved it as much as I do. So yeah, this is one well rec'd movie.

3339594,5,B0013D8LCW,"Without a doubt, Shelter is one of my favorite gay-themed movies. The director called it the ""anti-Brokeback"" and I would have to agree. It's a beautifully written love story that just happens to revolve around two guys, one of whom is on a journey to discover his affectional orientation.

What I loved:
  * A new gay image. Both of the main characters, Zach and Shaun, are completely non-stereotypical. They just happen to be gay.
  * Happy ending. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and it's good to see that Zach and Shaun live happily ever after. Too many gay movies make it look like gay = drama and heartbreak.
  * Sex is kept to a minimum. What little they show is done tastefully. We see nothing below the waist.
  * The eye contact they share provides a level of non-sexual intimacy never before seen in a gay movie. These characters are in love. They don't have to say it, because you can see it.
  * No fag hag! Zach has an on-and-off girlfriend (Tori) at the beginning of the movie. When she starts to suspect his confusion, she backs off and gives him time to come to terms with himself. She's very much not a gay groupie.

What I disliked:
  * Too short. The movie was only 90 minutes, including credits. Some parts felt rushed. Everything was fully fleshed, but I felt it could have gone on another half hour.
  * Casting quirks. Tina Holmes' (Jeanne) performance was slightly under-par, compared to everybody else's.",1212019200,12,1430,4.549019607843137

3339600,5,B0013D8LCW,"I'm previewing ""Shelter"" for the Brisbane Queer Film Festival where it screens on Saturday 24th May 2008. ""Shelter"" shines as a film with huge heart, and one that's been made with equal care by the actors and all of the film-makers.

It's not at all like the angst-ridden abomination of a gay surf flick ""Tan Lines"". In ""Shelter"" surfing is simply a fact of life element - it's not used or abused as a device.

""Shelter"" is a beautifully edited, spectacular looking and luscious sounding film which is definitely character driven. Each of the main characters is carefully developed so that we quite soon decide that we really do care about Zach, his young nephew Cody and Zach's love interest, Shaun. We want things to work out for them.

We understand that Zach is in a bind - he's allowed himself to be the physical and emotional anchor for a progressively more dysfunctional family, but we know that he deserves much better life options. The writer and director of Shelter has done a fantastic job - not a look or word is wasted, and yet the whole pace of the film is very relaxed.

""Shelter"" deserves every accolade that any individual or Festival might care to bestow.

Straight audiences must find ""Shelter"" to be equally rewarding. The film's theme is, after all, about love, honour and commitment. What could be more wholesome than that?",1210896000,189,1345,4.730769230769231
