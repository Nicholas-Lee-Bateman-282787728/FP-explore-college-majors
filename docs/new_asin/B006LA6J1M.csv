8741280,1,B006LA6J1M,"This DVD might be OK if you plan to watch it with your children, interpreting and repeating. You would probably use the remote a lot.

If you are trying to learn Hindi on your own, you won't find it much help. Each word is repeated only once, so if you don't get it that first time, you don't get it. Some of the visuals are just baffling. When a girl enters a house and appears from a second floor window, what does that mean? I didn't know, and there was no way to learn. Finally, there are longish periods with just random images, and no audio. You aren't learning anything then.

The DVD does include three languages, and in that way it is unique. But if you want to learn Hindi, or teach it to your children, buy ""Exploring Hindi"". You will spend MUCH less money and get a much more useful DVD. Most words are repeated many times, so you can learn them. The production values are better. And the children are at least as cute.",1154044800,2,931,4.254237288135593
