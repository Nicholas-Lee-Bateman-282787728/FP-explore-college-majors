8247347,4,B0012R1R2A,"When I was growing up in the late 70's/early eighties, this show was known as ""The Iron Samurai""(don't ask me why) when it was shown on a local tv channel. I'm so happy that Media Blasters has decided to release the series. I purchased ALL 6 Dvds in the set to complete the first season of the show. Here's hoping they decide to release the next 2 seasons, otherwise I might have to go Ogami on somebody.",1239408000,,404,4.259740259740259
8247348,1,B0012R1R2A,"I live in Japan and love this classic old tv show. Here it is held in much higher esteem than the movie of the same name (long available in the US). I was very happy when I found out about the recently released US edition, as my Old Japanese comprehension is not that great.  I ordered Vols 1-3.

However when my order arrived several (half?) of the discs were loose in their box and horribly scratched, unreadable by my player. I have ordered plenty of dvds off amazon to Japan w/no previous problems so it is probably a Tokyo Shock problem.  The episodes I was able to see were excellent as expected, and it was great being able to understand the complex plots better w/subtitles.  I would love to order the rest of the series, however will not do so until I firgure out how to get a refund/ exchange my scratched copies and get assurance that the boxes have been improved.

The stories are great, the actor is apparently a classically trained Kabuki actor famous in Japan, and he brings a great prasence to the part (unlike the movie actor, apparently).  I highly recommend this TV show. 5 stars for all episodes. However Tokyo Shock and the dvd boxes they used rate -4 stars for a total of 1 star.

PS the price is less than 1/4 of the Japanese domestic dvd of the tv series (someone was complaining about the price below).",1231286400,5,1327,4.413934426229508
8247349,5,B0012R1R2A,"This is an excellent TV series, not as bloody as the films but it is more faithful to the original Manga books.
My biggest criticism is that Media Blasters are only putting two episodes per disc. Apart from the cost, that's an AWFUL lot of DVD's taking up shelf space.
The good news is that there will be a box set, the bad news is it could be some time coming.
Even though I have bought the first two releases (and enjoyed them enormously) I think I'll wait for the Box Set.",1215561600,10,475,4.173913043478261
8247350,2,B0012R1R2A,"As it should be, this rating is for this particular release, NOT THE CONTENT.
The TV show is great,  it gets 4 - 5 stars.

But this is another overpriced american release...  5 episodes per volume?

You should never have to pay more than $1 per episode.
~70 episodes divided by 5 per volume  times $20 per volume???

That's $280 for only 3 seasons!!!!

Typically a season box is between $20- $35.  They've jacked the price up because fans will pay for it.  It's really sad.  It happened with Star Trek, Twilight Zone, etc.  I'll have to wait till they go on clearance or get the Hong Kong release.",1211932800,8,597,4.385321100917431
8247351,5,B0012R1R2A,"It's finally here! The TV show that spawned some 10 Lone Wolf & Cub/ Shogun Assassin movies. The show ran for three years, with over 20 episodes in each season. The show holds up better over time than the movies which suffer from a cheesy 70s soundtrack and gallons of bright red paint/blood. For the most part the plots in the movies come directly from the TV show, so you may get that ""Haven't I seen this before?"" feeling.

The premise for the show is basically the same as the movies. Ogami Itto, high executioner for the shogun has his family murdered and is framed for plotting to kill the shogun. He is ordered to commit suicide, but instead goes on the run with his son Daigoro as an assassin for hire, working for anyone that can pay his 500 gold fee. Lord Retsudo and his Yagyu clan, who has been charged with killing Ogami by the shogun and also wants revenge for Ogami being chosen as high executioner over Retsudo's own man, constantly pursues him.

While the movies can best be described as blood and gore action movies, the TV show is more focused on a deeper story, mainly centered on the concept of samurai honor. For example, Ogami teaches his son that a samurai never begs. When Daigoro gets separated from his father (which happens quite a lot!) he nearly starves to death, yet still refuses to take handouts from kindly strangers. There is still plenty of action and sword fights (and yes, the Gatling gun baby cart is still there!), but it's not just mindless Rambo-esqe violence.

I only wish the release format they are using was different. This set apparently contains four 1-hour episodes. There are over 70 episodes in the series. It could take several years to release the entire run!

UPDATE: My guess about 4 episodes in this release was incorrect. There are 5 episodes total on 2 DVDs, which make it a slightly better value. Also they have updated the subtitles, although I cannot tell if it's for better or worse. You may notice subtle changes like Ogami Itto is now Itto Ogami, and ""My sword and son are for hire"" is now ""My son and expertise are for hire"". I assume they've been change to more accuratly translate what is being said, but that doesn't mean it's easier to understand.",1206230400,11,2216,4.560301507537688
