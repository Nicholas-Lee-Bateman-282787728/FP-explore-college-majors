5857974,2,B00DV208EW,I gave it two star for the beautiful imagery. but the film is hard to watch as it is creationism propaganda desperately masquerading as a documentary. This movie uses argumentum ad lapidem and proof by assertion to dismiss evolution. I just find it ridiculous that people who believe in god can't seem to believe that an all knowing creator wouldn't give it's creations the ability to adapt to their enviroment.

The animals in the video are nothing short of extraordinary and resilient creatures but had they gone extinct they'd have joined a very long list of already extinct species. It isn't a miracle.. These animals are still born with birth defects, are vulnerable to sickness, have violent and predatory natures. To survive is to be alive, obviously most people underestimate what that means. The random factors that come into play when surviving are enormous. The odds that helped the bee's survive their first generation have an equivalent amount of odd that could've sent them into extinction like many other species. DNA memory and evolution is the only plausible explanation, for if everything was created... who created the creator.. Lets get real here people. Go to college!",1491264000,8,801,5.122137404580153

5858035,1,B00DV208EW,This movie is Christian brain rot. Not sure why it popped up in my recommendations.,1487548800,,83,4.6
5858036,1,B00DV208EW,"I walked away from this film more convinced than ever that evolution is accurate. I don't think that was their intention, but I am grateful nonetheless.

Throughout modern history, creationists have had various opportunities to present their most compelling arguments in a rigorous scientific forum to determine whether their views really do warrant deeper consideration. In each instance, they have failed to pass the test of scientific rigor.

Modeling itself off of the science-for-laypersons documentary style that is fashionable these days, this film could be considered a public airing of creationist arguments for laypersons to consider. It's well produced, visually engaging, and has the requisite cool, young, energetic guy. It also mixes in enough credible science in its preface for each animal that a poorly educated (or actively deceived person) could be convinced that its authoritative tone and production quality are speaking some sort of truth.

But, alas, they are not. Without explaining why, of all the many creation myths throughout human history they chose a rather misguided interpretation of the biblical one. Not sure why that rose above the others unless they began with that bias and just wanted to try to reinforce it.

After the scientifically-sound build up for each animal, the narrator throws his proverbial hands up with decidedly unscientific assertions that there's no way bison stomachs, camels' adaptation to intense desert sand, or wolves' adaptation to intense cold could exist without some designer. He asserts that because bison lungs are vulnerable they must have been created for the Native Americans who immigrated to North American about 11 - 15,000 years ago. It makes no sense. At one point, the movie claims a frog becomes a princess. It's hard to tell if they're serious because it's in context of denying some fish evolving to terrestrial beings.

The entire undertaking is profoundly weak and intellectually lazy, perhaps even a sinfully deceptive attempt to manipulate the poorly educated on this topic who don't know a scientific theory is not like general use of the term theory (see the first comment below for an example of this confusion).

One of the more bizarre segments is early on talking about bees. They think that because bees just know how to build honeycombs or respond to a dance from the queen, it must have been by design. They then make a bizarre assertion that because bees instinctively know efficient patters for pollination, that they must be doing a conscious mathematical calculation every time with its tiny brain. One need only look at the vast amount of instinctual behavior we do on a regular basis that we don't consciously think about, calculate, analyze. Every animal is born with instincts for its species - think of flocks of birds simultaneously turning in a moment. They're not sharing physics equations back and forth among one another.

A little further up the bizarre scale, they make an argument that because the various dog breeds we've created over mere centuries are still traceable to the wolf, it must be evidence that species can't rise and fall, leading to entirely new species without a direct genetic link. This whole argument is simply astonishing in its ignorance of evolutionary theory.

The pinnacle of absurdity comes in the final segment where they use the harmonious sound of crickets when slowed down and limited to a specific sound range as some sort of proof of God. They don't explain how, certainly don't reference any studies that make that connection.

But that beautiful music crickets make does point to the possibility of something more realistic - which is harmonious tuning to the universe's beautiful mathematical eloquence. It's important to keep in mind that this obsession with denying evolution emerged in the mid-nineteenth century mostly in a poorly educated rural America and has entrenched there ever since as fundamental literalism has taken root there like no place else. The more cosmopolitan Catholic Church, the one Jesus of the Bible directed to be built, has never denied evolution. In fact, a Jesuit priest and scientist first proposed the big bang theory.

So, one does not need to hold to this creation myth in order to be Christian.",1487548800,9,4272,5.151515151515151
5858037,5,B00DV208EW,"Evolution ""science"" tells us that random mutation plus millions of years of time can produce the amazing diversity and complexity we see in nature. However probablility mathmatics affirms that even billions of years of randomness could not produce the intricate complexity we see illustrated in the examples highlighted in this film.

But when understanding goes beyond our capabilities some people give up and simply assign the mystery to a grand designer of some kind who created it all. As proof they cite the utter complexities of the world around us and how any form of trial and error or the harsh realities of evolution could not possibly be the answer, not seeing the irony of their solution; the existence of a god-like designer, an equally fantastic theory.
There are many things we may never fully understand, but scientific inquiry must continue, it is the promise and the engine of our civilization's growth.

5858140,1,B00DV208EW,"I rented this because the photography looked stunning - and it is. I stopped watching because it was not possible to accommodate the narrative's intrusive  hypothesis that the beauty and complexity of nature is not evidence of natural selection, it is evidence of a Being who creates with the same kind of intention we do because ""look at the honeybee, how did that happen? Science can't explain that.""

Really? Hey, guess what? It's the Information Age! You can ""Google It,"" now There is an amazing body of research and exploration about bees, and yes, there are bee fossil records (not like that would matter to this group) revealing the amazing history and geographic diversity in the ways these insects have evolved into different strains, going back billions of years into our planet's history.

This movie could have easily gone in a much more authentic direction. Totally disappointing, because the intuition that the life around us is a manifestation of Spirit is the deepest truth we may encounter. When we investigate this intuition by being present to this moment, there may be actual knowing, the direct experience of what is true. But the first thing we do when we consciously encounter evidence of Spirit is infuse it with human ego and start making up stories about it.

The unfathomable mystery of life does not need human doctrine and dogma to explain it, and science does not contradict it in any way. The premise that science and spiritual experience are mutually exclusive totally ruined the movie. Science investigates the evidence of existence, which only reveals the nature of Spirit on deeper and more profoundly mysterious levels. We can be fully engaged with this mystery, instead of becoming immersed in stories about it. This is far more productive than promoting ignorance in order to preserve what can only be described as delusions, and then getting into life and death fights over whose delusions represent ""the truth.""",1453507200,16,1951,5.030959752321982

With all the education that is available in our Public School Systems, this information appears to has been withheld from this education.  It's great to hear the rest of the story and to get the full truth. Those who insist on believing evolution are simply very unscientific.  Try to convince someone that your cell phone was not designed... but was a random act of chance and time.  They would call you a fool.  Yet our bodies and creation all around us are extremely more complex than the greatest of our technological designs. And yet some people call creation random chance, time & evolution?  We are so bombarded with a one-sided perspective. I encourage people to watch this and other films like this simply see the another side of the story.  There is no denying that there is a designer.  We are here on purpose and for a purpose.  You who are reading this comment are an amazing and awesome creation by God for a purpose.  I encourage you to follow your heart and what You observe around you, not by just what you are told.  This DVD will help you get a little more perspective that you should find very thought-provoking. Those who attack these perspectives, for some reason, tend to get defensive very quickly.  If my perspective is just living a fantasy, then why don't people get mad at people who celebrate Santa Claus.  I simply encourage you to watch this and open your heart and mind to some other perspectives that may revolutionize the way you think. Thanks for a great film.",1514419200,,1612,4.670212765957447

This is all found in the pointless segments they have in-between each animal discussed, pointless because we don't need a history of the American Revolution, Native American hunting of bison, or modern American hunting of elk in a documentary that is supposed to be about God's design in creation.
