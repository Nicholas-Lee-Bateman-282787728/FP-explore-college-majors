5053391,1,B0073HYCH0,"If you can imagine a script written by 6th grade boys for an adult audience then you've seen this movie.
Hitler and fellow Nazis build a massive caverned city with super advanced technology beneath Antarctic ice without being seen and despite all the implausibilities (impossible -80 degree freezing conditions, needing massive resources, not being seen while doing so). Over a period of decades they exist and manage to capture Antarctica researchers to experiment upon. Their goal is to destroy all of the world with this space ship they constructed under the ice. All is foiled by a couple of captive researchers disarming all the Nazis and escaping to freedom. Really bad post edited CGI of a hole in the space ship dooming it to fall.

Really bad effects - ice looks like styrofoam cutouts, toy models for the buildings and vehicles. Equally bad acting and dialogue. Has Jake Busey and a lot of actors experienced in video shorts & TV spots so that should prepare you. Actors could only manage a few words of dialogue at a time while simultaneously forgetting what facial expression was suppose to go with what they said. Cheap props like laser guns with post edited flashes and sounds effects like they were purchased at Toys R'Us.",1335398400,19,1237,4.862559241706161

The audience should be aware:  this is not a massively-budgeted Hollywood Blockbuster; this film should be compared to the productions of American International Pictures or Allied Artists, (at their peak fifty years ago.)  By classic ""B-Movie"" standards, this one is top-notch!  If this somehow finds its way onto the big screen, I would definitely pay to see the movie in a theater.

This cool concept was what made made me want to see the movie, but unfortunately the acting, special effects (both makeup and CGI), cinematography, and production values were all far below par.

5053428,3,B0073HYCH0,"If you are pre-disposed to think that any story taking place in the center of the Earth is ridiculous, but decide to watch this movie anyhow, then knock yourself out.  You will undoubtedly find it ridiculous.

If you are going into this film expecting logic and rationality, then I have to wonder if you read its title.

Perhaps you didn't know it was an Asylum film, and that it showcases all the highlights (or lowlights) of classic Asylum films - bad acting, goofy dialog, unrealistic scripts and plotlines, and generally poor special effects.  But, did you read the title?  Even if you weren't aware that it was an Asylum film, I'm only going to cut you a little slack if you were disappointed by this flick's silliness - there comes a time when people have to step up to the plate and accept responsibility for their choices.  And if you choose a movie called Nazis at the Center of the Earth and then complain about it later, I'm just not feeling it.

I think the film is incredibly faithful to itself.  Does it have Nazis in the story? - oh boy, you bet.  Does it take place in the center of the Earth? For a substantial part of the film, yes.  Voila! here is a perfect example of a film that sets up certain expectations and then meets them with flair!  For instance, I've always considered the swastika to be a perfect symbol for evil, but the brains behind this film chose to hang a BACKWARD swastika when The Leader makes his surprise appearance.  I mean, how evil is that?  A BACKWARD swastika?  That's got to be, like, the absolute acme of evil.

And then too, what sort of crazy inspiration led to casting Jake Busey in this film?  Who knows what they had to offer up to tempt him away from other projects he had going on.  I don't know about you, but I have to say, Tr&egrave;s bien!

There are, admittedly, two scenes in this movie which border on the limits of good taste.  No, you say, but yes, there are.  Most Asylum films I've seen are schlocky and ridiculous, but usually so silly as to be rendered harmless.  This one carries an edge to it that may be offensive to some.  Whether it was an anti-abortion PSA in the making, or just the happy folks at Asylum's way of squirm-inducing film technique, I don't know, but it worked both ways for me.  Surprisingly, there was also an unexpected plot twist in the film's final third that I won't give away, but if you've read any other reviews, you'll know about anyway.  I didn't see it coming, and it was pretty funny in an over-the-top, absurd sort of way.

The best Asylum film I've seen yet is Abraham Lincoln Vs. Zombies - how does Nazis at the Center of the Earth stack up next to that pearl?  Until the last twenty minutes, I say it hangs in there pretty well, sometimes worse, sometimes a little better.  (Is it just me, or does Dominque Swain look adorable in a Nazi uniform or what?)  Unfortunately, things seem to fall apart near the end, as if the strain of holding everything together was just too difficult for the folks involved.  I'm going to stick with 3 stars, because it's better than any of the Mega Shark movies, or even Mark Decascos in I am Omega.  Believe it or not, its even better than They Saved Hitler's Brain, and that's saying something.  Heil Busey!

Trust the Chief.",1356998400,2,3264,4.4336134453781515
5053429,3,B0073HYCH0,"Okay to clarify two things, 1 I know that this was meant to be a parody of iron sky, and wolfenstien 3D.  And 2. It's the Asylum.  I paid to watch a needlessly violent and cheesy movie and that's what I got.  For the people who claim that this movie was written by 10 year olds let me just say that ain't so.  The Asylum actually did their research as back in 1939 the Nazis did send out a small escapade to build basses in Antarctica.  They even say where they got there source material from in the directors commentary. Also I take offense to anyone who says that this is the worst movie of all time.  If you really belive that, then you just haven't seen enough bad movies.  Yes the characters can be annoying and I didn't find anything that I liked  outside of the novelty of the story taking place in the center of the earth.  Though there was one scene early on when they were underneath the ocean surrounded by whales with nothing but a thick ice barrier to safeguard themfrom the ocean that did, for a brief moment add tension.  I also like the practical effects from when the Nazis surgically someone's face of.  Though it becomes comical towards the end when the main characters try to fight back and rip the jello like face off of one of the Nazi drones.  It's funny and it made me laugh but it just didn't work with the tone that the rest of the scene had at the time.  The music is pretty good and the creepy atmosphere is complemented by surprisingly decent lighting.  Seeing as most Asylum films consist of having a skitsofrantic camera man just standing in one place for a few seconds and then shake it like there's a 9.5 magnitude earthquake the very next, seeing a film that actually has decent action and a camera that competently follows it is a treat. My one biggest complaint is that towards the end of the film there is a forced abortion scene where the Nazis use a fetus's regenerative properties to re-animate Hitler's head in a jar.  Now I'm not sure if the Asylum is trying to send a subliminal message that If you support abortion, then you are just as bad as Hitler, but I like to think that it's just there for shock value and mindless fun.  The ending is not particularly great, and the special effects are about what you would expect out of a ps2 game.  Still it definitely won't appeal to everyone, and as a movie  by itself I just can't imagine it gaining anything more than small cult status, if that.  But It definitely shows that the Asylum is trying harder to make their films watchable and in that respect all I can say is that they did a decent job, and if they keep uping the quality of there movies like this one small step at a time, then who knows,  maybe ten years from now they will make a smash hit that people will actually be running to theaters to see.  All I can say for now is that wheather it's a good thing or a bad thing, after watching all the mega shark films, american warships, and transmorphers 1 and 2, this is the most watchable thing The Asylum has ever produced. 3.5/5 stars",1356480000,10,3038,4.313380281690141

I and my friends love to get together with some beers and popcorn and laugh at the ridiculousness of movies like ""Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies,"" so we were looking forward to this movie featuring zombie Nazis and mecha-Hitler. Sounds like a great time, right?

WRONG. ALL OF THE WRONG. This is a disturbing movie with multiple scenes of sexual violation and explicit and graphic violence. I love the ridiculous, but this isn't even ridiculous. It's just horrific and disgusting and made everyone at movie night feel complicit in the violence. Not even the appearance of mecha-Hitler at the end could save this movie. I am extremely sorry to have ever wasted $4 and 2 hours of my life on this, and would suggest that anyone looking for a cheesy good time stay far, far away from this. You can't laugh at this. You can't make fun of it. You just have to sit there while zombies rape women and Nazis peel people's faces off. If you like that, then I guess this is your movie, but if you're just looking for a fun time with friends, pick literally anything else.",1346889600,5,1114,4.57
5053435,3,B0073HYCH0,"There is nothing like a remake of ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" to save this summer's mediocre 3D blockbuster film selection. This is a 21st Asylum adaptation complete with a trip under the Antarctica ice with bad special effects and Jake Busey. If you laughed at that spider thing in ""The Wild Wild West"" wait until you get a gander of Hitler.

The production includes all the reasons we must watch bad films honoring the Ed Wood tradition. The plot was inane. The special effects were fake looking. The acting was comical. The dialouge was a face ripping Paige turner.

Jake Busey, ""When you live in the Antarctica for 10 years you hear things.""

This film does have something not normally in an Asylum film... F-bomb, rape, nudity (Maria Pallas, first movie credit)

WARNING: The title is misleading. They are NOT at the center of the Earth and this is NOT a zombie film as implied by the cover art",1346630400,3,899,4.635220125786163
5053436,2,B0073HYCH0,"With a title like this, how can a cult film fan turn it down?  After all, who else would this film be aimed at?
Unfortunately, a cool title and wacky premise is all the movie really has going for it.  I mean, it is just barely interesting enough to sit through(and that's being generous, judging from the reviews here and other sites).
The wonderful folks at Asylum(a cult film company that makes Full Moon look like Paramount) must think cult film fans are real idiots and will greet anything cheap and offbeat with open arms.  Sorry, but you need a bit more than a snappy title and crazy ideas to make a cult classic.  It's all in the execution.
The plot(if you really care, and if the title hadn't tipped you off) is about a bunch of scientists in Antarctica(nobody in this movie looks cold) who are captured by Dr. Josef Mengele and his Nazi goons, who have been living under the frozen surface for decades.  How have they been living there for so long?  By swapping out body parts of course!  Fresh body parts are hard to come by in Antarctica, so Mengele has employed a traitorous scientist, Jake Busey, to lure scientific teams into the hands of the Nazis.  This newest batch is wanted, not just for their parts, but their scientific expertise.  You see, the Nazis are still hellbent on world domination, and they need to get their robot Hitler up and running before they can proceed with their ""Fourth Reich"" scenario. Hitler's head has been preserved, and attached to what looks like the evil ""Cain"" robot from Robocop 2.
Will our scientist heroes free themselves from the clutches of the Nazis and stop their dastardly plan?  Of course they will!  Like they'd make a movie where the Nazis actually succeeded in their plan and took over the world!
Again, plotwise, it's schlock heaven, but realitywise, it's crap.  One of my biggest gripes about this(and so many of it's kind made these days) is that CG is relied on for damn near EVERYTHING!  I realize in this day and age, that this is the most economic way to get a film made, especially a cheap exploitation-type film.....But I really don't care.  It's lazy and looks terrible, absolutely terrible.  It looks so bad that it is a major distraction, and half the time you're wondering if you're watching a movie or a Playstation game.  Of course, anymore the lines are becoming blurry between the two.
But other than that(which is a big deal) there isn't much else engaging going on.  There's alot of crazy stuff you could do with the concept, but it's all kinda halfassed here.  The actor playing Mengele is decent, as is some of the mutant Nazi makeup(yes, the only thing that isn't CG!), and those things very well may be the only things that kept me(barely) holding on for almost 90 minutes.
You're much better off revisiting Ilsa-She Wolf Of The SS, an exploitation flick done right......and on about a third of the budget of this film!",1346630400,,2902,4.623781676413255
5053437,4,B0073HYCH0,"Nazis at the Center of the Earth tells the tale of some researchers in Antarctica that are abducted by a team of masked troopers. They end up being dragged deep underground to a continent at the center of the earth. To which they end up finding out that nazi survivors are planning for the return of the Third Reich. I'll admit, when you watch, you'll be going ""Wha..?"" but, overall, it isn't too bad of a story.

Despite what other reviewers here have to say about Asylum, I think there is an audience for these type of movies(most people are just too afraid to admit it). Course, there has to be an audience. They have to be making a profit or else Asylum would've folded a long time ago. I stated it one time before in another review that it really gets to me how people go on about how Asylum makes these bad movies and they aren't worth buying. I'll admit, not every film that Asylum does is a winner but not every film they do is a loser either. They've did some good movies, even some original movies. Some examples are: Dragon, H.G.Wells War of the Worlds, War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave, 2-Headed Shark Attack, Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse, Sunday School Musical, Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus, Mega Python vs. Gatoroid, Sherlock Holmes, Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, Celebrity Sex Tape, 6 Guns, MILF, Journey to the Center of the Earth among others. Most of Asylum's films, just like Full Moon Pictures and others, are goofy fun to watch. As long as they keep their films affordable, like they have been, I'll continue to support their films.

Now, what do I think of the movie itself? Glad you asked,lol. Well- way out there story aside, Nazis at the Center of the Earth is a decent watch. Jake Busey and Dominique Swain put in good performances. CGI, I'm afraid, was awful..compared to some I've seen in Asylum's other movies. Overall, I like it. I've seen far worse, believe me. Far far worse but this one is good enough that I will probably watch over again. Recommended.",1346457600,,1991,4.543175487465181

Like the first guy said, If your a fan of really bad Scifi, then this movie is for you.  I should have rented it before I bought it. It would have been cheaper, and it wouldn't be in my collection.  On a better note, The Asylum does put out some pretty good B rate stuff.  Later Dudes.",1344124800,,485,3.9587628865979383
5053441,1,B0073HYCH0,"""Nazis at the Center of the Earth"" is just bad. Not bad in a ""good"" way. Not so bad that it is funny. It is just really, really bad. I actually did force myself to watch it all the way through, but couldn't do it in one sitting (it took four). I generally like Sci-Fi movies that other reviewers pan, but this is one case where I really wish my better judgement had won out.

If you really must see every bad movie ever made, here is what you can expect:

No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on a group of scientist stationed in an Antarctic research base. As the title implies, they stumble upon a secret hidden Nazi base and the terror begins. This cool concept was what made made me want to see the movie, but unfortunately the acting, special effects (both makeup and CGI), cinematography, and production values were all far below par. It never delivers real suspense or much excitement. Also, there is some of the required nudity but it seems to have been added just to check it off as ""included"". Mostly there are disturbing scenes that I can never unsee.  The only enjoyable part of the movie comes in around the 1:26:15 mark when the credits begin to roll.

Avoid!

5053442,1,B0073HYCH0,"The Asylum has the reputation of putting out quickly produced rip-offs of major studio movies. Well they have gone across the Atlantic to ""borrow"" their next production. A Finish/German/Austrailian co-production called IRON SKY in which as a last ditch effort to save the 3rd Reich in the form of a base on the moon comes to fruition in 2018 when they return. The Asylum moved the new base to Antarctica and into the earth,added Josef Mengele,some flesh transplants and flesh eating bacteria bombs to this mess. I like some of the Asylum films because they are fun and SOMETIMES are pretty good. But after recently seeing IRON SKY this was painful to watch. The sets were pretty much non existant using warehouses for all the interiors( don't think a cinder block wall would be found inside a UFO).The only effects that worked were the air battles at the end and the ""machine"" Mengele is trying to get to work.

That being said....what do you expect from a movie with a title like this from the people at ""Asylum Home Entertainment""? They shot it in 12 days for chrissakes.

It takes place in Antarctica, but none of the actors look like it is cold outside. CGI is ridiculously cheesy (typical of a SyFy movie), far too many closeups of the actors' faces on the outside shots (clearly an attempt to conceal the fact they are on a movie set) and SPOILER ALERT! the worst ""robot Hitler"" CGI you can imagine.

Nothing that happened in this movie surprised me one bit, and it is clear to see why Dominique Swain's and Jake Busey's careers circled the drain at least a decade ago.
