8765088,2,B01HDHA9QW,"Sins of the Guilty is an urban drama. Vanessa Johnson (Trina McGee) has left her wealthy suburban family  and trust fund  to move into the city and pursue her art. A talented dancer, shed rather live on the gritty edge of the city than continue her pampered existence. She thinks she knows what shes doing, but finds herself in over her head when a dangerous romance starts to dominate her life. Her new lover (Bret Grantham) is just launching a glamorous fashion photography start-up, but hes bad news, cheating his partner and brazenly sleeping with other women. When he gets violent with Vanessa, she turns to a paranormal seer for guidance. A double murder throws her life into an ever-escalating tailspin.

Reminiscent of such films as Enough, Fear, and Sleeping With the Enemy, the film proceeds along a traditional path so that the viewer knows well before Vanessa that her boyfriend is trouble. Its never quite clear why she cant pursue her career while living comfortably, but if she did, thered be no movie.

Ms. McGee is certainly attractive, but has a lot to learn about acting. She tends to be bland in most scenes and when shes supposed to be terrified, looks like shes acting badly. This hurts the film and distances us from the story. What starts as a young womans quest to become independent changes directions and, in its second half, becomes a murder who-done-it. The film might be OK for a TV movie, but it lacks originality and star power.

The only bonus features on the unrated DVD release are trailers for Sins of the Guilty and Confessions of Isabella.",1476835200,5,1577,4.740875912408759
