2701807,1,B000LC3IE2,"Was the boat anchored, and perhaps there was a large rope or chain running back up?",1172620800,,83,4.25
2701808,3,B000LC3IE2,"Sequels really are miss or hit propositions and the rule of thumb these days is that if the two film scores a star less than the original then they are way ahead of the came.  Given all the sequels that are out there the number that are as least as good (e.g., ""The Godfather 2,"" ""Aliens"") let alone better (e.g., ""Spider-man 2""), are extremely rare.  ""Open Water 2"" (a.k.a. ""Adrift"" in Europe), had a chance of being as good as the original ""Open Water,"" but the ending is a bit too melodramatic for my taste.  However, it is nice to see plot justified nudity, which might be an even greater cinematic rarity these days.

The set up is that a group of high school friends get together for a getaway on the yacht of Dan (Eric Dane), who is already having fun with Michelle (Cameron Richardson), his girlfriend of a fortnight when the others get on board.  Amy (Susan May Pratt) and James (Richard Speight Jr.) bring aboard their baby daughter Sarah, and then there are Lauren (Ali Hillis) and Zach (Niklaus Lange), who appear to finally be single at the same time.  Getting Amy on board is a big deal because when she was a little girl her father had a heart attack and drowned while they were swimming, so she has an understandable case of aquaphobia and walks around on deck with a life preserver on.  When Dan grabs her and jumps into the water she absolutely freaks and the next thing we know everybody else is in the water with her.  Then somebody notices that the ladder on the yacht was never deployed and they have no way of getting back on board.

The movie is one of those that is ""based on actual events,"" although I think in this case it is just the basic idea of everybody on board being in the water and not being able to get back on the boat is the extent to which this story is based on actual events (to wit, this situation has happened more than once in the history of the world).  Consequently, it is the basic situation that rings true and not the number of people in the water, what they had, the baby on board, or the rest of what the screenwriters came up with here.  Maybe some of what they try to do to get back on board were things that have happened in real life or then again they might be the rest of creativity by the writers and actors.  For me the key thing is that this is a plausible situation and for somebody who watches the first episode of ""Survivor"" each season and halfway through comes to the conclusion that I would be dead at this point long before I was ever voted off the island it is relatively easy to relate to the sheer terror it invokes.

With a half-dozen people in the water instead of only two there are exponentially more opportunities for conflict between the characters, which this film goes out of its way to exploit.  Several times I found myself thinking that these people would be in better shape if the right way would just die because addition by subtraction seemed like a reasonable response to the deteriorating situation.  However, it really is the situation more than the characters that matters here because the whole idea of what would you (or could you) do in this situation is the entire hook of the movie.  Unlike the first ""Open Water"" film, where the abandoned couple are floating in the ocean, dodging sharks and waiting for somebody on their charter to figure out they are missing, safety for these people treading water is so close they can touch it.  They just have to find a way to get back on board.

This is where ""Open Water 2"" finds itself treading water, because for every bright idea that these people come up with there seems to be a corresponding act of stupidity.  Your enjoyment of this 2006 film will depend entirely on how much of this you can take before such things ruin the film for you.  The cell phone scene just about did me in, but I remained interested in the pragmatics of the situation, trying to think what they could do to save their lives and knowing that it was not going to be soon enough to ever save them all (a larger casts insures more deaths).  For me the ending is what caused me to round down instead of up on this film.  It is a good thing I was watching it on DVD instead of a theater (not that it ever came any where near the Zenith City), because I had to stop when the credits rolled and go back to make sure I understood what I was seeing (I still am not sure how to read the final three shots).  But the end game of ""Open Water 2"" wants to have its cake and eat it too, and opts for emphasizing the psychological problems of the characters over the practical considerations of staying alive, which is where melodrama swamps the decks of this film.",1172620800,3,4666,4.344073647871117
2701809,2,B000LC3IE2,"I saw the first Open Water and thought it was pretty good .

This one was pretty good as well, i didn't expect much from it at all but it wound up being decent. No sharks in this one

but the tension builds up pretty well. The unknown actors were decent, the boat was cool and overall I would say it's worth a rental at least if you get a 3rd one freebie deal going .",1172448000,,367,3.8157894736842106
2701810,4,B000LC3IE2,"What is wrong with some of the people who reviewed this movie?

Would you be more satisfied to see severed limbs and half toros floating around in the water? Do you really need to see Jaws coming up through the water to be frightened? The scary thing about this film is the fact that they can't get back on their boat after swimming in the ocean. Someone forgot to lower the ladder and they are stuck, floating around next to the boat which is too high to climb. They are exausted and cold and scared of what's in the water around them. Get it? It's the unseen that scares them!

It's the human mind imagining things around and below them. It's the fact that safety is only a few feet away, AND THEY CANNOT GET THERE. That's the scary part. Good God people, don't you realize the irony of the situation?

I think people are too wrapped up in the hoopla surrounding huge budget, star cast movies and forget the pleasures to be found in a small movie like this one. If you are curious and want to see this movie, then see it!",1172448000,6,1023,4.262886597938144
2701811,2,B000LC3IE2,"This has got to be one of the dullest films I have rented in a while. The pretty much took the same idea as the original and made another with a slightly different plot line. It would seem that 2007 is the year of sequels, and this is one that probably could have gone without being made. Oh well, thats what rentals are for I guess, try it before you buy it.",1172361600,3,359,4.0
2701812,1,B000LC3IE2,"Hello, I have just finished watching the trailer and reading over the story sevral times, I'd like to say now: no I have not seen it, nor do I want to see it, nor do I belive that anyone should. I would not buy it, I would not rent it, and I would rather watch 24 hours of a baby-picture slideshow while hearing the parents fawn over their little bundles of fat than watch this movie for free. The errors in plot are horrifing. The title fits it in the sense of yet another movie that should never have been conceived about people drowning. The website is a waste of a domain name. I am deeply concerned for the well being of America.

  Furthermore,  I'd like to digress about the state of the average immature mind.  This film is terribly marketed as a horror film, but most shallow individuals would be more drawn to the possibility of sex, then that of a good story.  I can assure the readership of this review that all postive posters preceding this one are males between the age of 13 and 20.  The hint of exposed mammaries is enticing to some pathetic souls.  Please spend some time trying to aquire social strength, rather then fawning over.........you get the picture.

  Note, the most educated post has been one built to flame this movie. It deeply saddens me that evolution is acting so slowly as to allow people to profit from a creation such as this. Not only was the idea approved, but people will actually watch this rubbish. You should be ashamed of yourself if you made the error of wasting money and/or time on this epitome of mental decline. I hope only that you have made it to this review before you made the error so many others most likely have, and I apologise on behalf of all those who have posted before me for their waste of your precious time.

2701813,5,B000LC3IE2,"I enjoyed this movie so much more than the first ""Open Water"" movie.  This movie had a lot more to the plot and characters.  Although there were no sharks in the movie, some parts are really spine-tingling.

2701815,2,B000LC3IE2,"This movie is mildly diverting at best... And shameful for insinuating there might be sharks by posing as a sequel to OPEN WATER.

2701829,3,B000LC3IE2,"You can't help but curse at the screen the entire movie. It's literally one bad decision after another. I was even screaming at life jacket girl, for walking the way she was near the rail like that. She knew he was right behind her, prowling like a cat ready to pounce. She invited him to throw her over, it was so obvious. A girl knows when a guy is in ""throw you in mode"", it's built in to our brains. Then they get stuck, and of course, the ladder isn't down. Somehow, by some stroke of a miracle a cell phone happens to ring and be hanging in a pant pocket over the side of the boat, that they reach with relative ease. Only to all scream at once into the receiver at some singing girls, and then angrily throw it in the water like they were at a nightclub all drunk, and then lost signal. I was laughing at the sheer nonsense at that point. Don't get me started at how ALL of this : cranial injury, stabbed to death, and suicide by drowning all occur, I'd say in give or take 3-5 hours after realizing they are stuck with no ladder. The sun hasn't even set, and they're like down to half of them.
The baby is the only real safe one during this whole movie. She was smart, just chill all dry and warm on the boat until mommy, daddy and their drunk 30-something friends kill themselves in the course of 3 hours.  I literally heard about a dog that was found swimming in the ocean after his owners boat sunk. He might have been in that ocean for days, weeks. These people need a lesson from that pooch! Over all I did give the movie 3 stars, because I couldn't stop watching it. It drew me in, and made me want to punch someone, but hey I was intrigued enough to finish it.",1511568000,,1675,4.122324159021407

2701926,2,B000LC3IE2,"This film is one of silliest things I ever watched and has definitely NOTHING in common with the real ""Open Water"" film. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

A group of five old high-school friends as well as the girlfriend of one of them and the baby of another go for a weekend cruise on a yacht. At one moment all the six adults will find themselves in the water, with the baby abandoned alone on board - and they cannot climb back... The film is basically about what follows this unexpcted development.

The whole situation already doesn't make much sense, considering that six young, strong and healthy people would find a way out of this situation in like five minutes - after all a yacht is not a super-tanker, it is not THAT high above water... But OK, for the sake of the film I was ready to accept that for some reason they cannot make it back to the yacht.

However everything what follows is such an accumulation of human most irrational stupidity that I simply refuse to believe that it is possible to assemble incidentally such a bunch of morons and @holes in one place at one time - you would probably have to make a world wide casting for that... In fact those six people are so impossibly awful AND stupid that it is simply impossible to relate to  them - to my considerable shame at one moment I actually started to root for the merciless ocean...))) I just wanted the mother of the baby to survive, but (SPOILER HERE) towards the end I changed my mind even in that aspect...

Actors in this film were all unknown to me and after seeing it I want it to stay that way.

I didn't like this film. The only reason to possibly see it is if one day you really are in a particularly nasty, vicious, ugly, bloodthirsty mood and you simply feel like watching some annoying morons dying horrible, ridiculous, perfectly avoidable deaths... Otherwise AVOID!",1400630400,2,1891,4.498542274052478

2702060,3,B000LC3IE2,"Foolishness reigns supreme in Open Water 2: Adrift (2006), an adventure where a group of friends taking a pleasure cruise, wind up swimming for much longer than they anticipated.  Minor spoilers follow.

Two couples, one with an infant daughter, board the Godspeed, a yacht owned by their friend Dan (Eric Dane), and head out to sea for a relaxing cruise.  The boat stops, and four of the party of six jump in the ocean for a little swim.  Amy (Susan May Pratt), the mother of the child has a fear of water, and is reluctant to enter.  In fun, Dan picks Amy up and jumps into the ocean carrying her in his arms.  Unfortunately what was intended as a joke has tragic consequences, as no one thought to lower the ladder, and panic sets in as the group of six discover that they are unable to get back onto the boat.

The disaster occurs about 20 minutes in, and for most of the remaining 70 minutes, the cast are treading water.  The group appears to have few options, but one interesting scheme they do come up with, is to strip off their clothing, and tie them together make a rope.  It's an idea with some promise, but unfortunately when one of the heavier in the group attempts to climb up onto the boat, the rope tears.

Naked in the water, one might expect hypothermia or fatigue to set in rather quickly, but other misfortunes strike the group first, which gradually begins to grow smaller.  Dan's reckless act caused the dilemma, but there's no shortage of irrational behavior misfortune, such as when a character panics while investigating the underside of the boat, and then gets severely injured while attempting to surface.

Matters do drag on for too long, until finally a solution presents itself, but to the very end the behavior of these people seems out of touch with reality.  A film that tests your masochistic proclivities, Open Water 2 is not a fun time, but may be entertaining in a very dark twisted sort of way.

Despite the farfetched story, the cast does a fairly good job of acting, considering that they are swimming through much of the film, and supposedly naked to boot.  Fate is certainly not kind to these poor souls, but at least they do not have to contend with sharks, as was the case in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B00064AE0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>&nbsp;(2003).",1356048000,,2388,4.8617283950617285

 Yes, there were pretty big implausibilities in the storyline but what I really liked about this movie was the agonizingly helpless nature of the situation - being so close to the boat but unable to board-. Kind of like locking your keys in your car x10000- and how it affected the personalities as peoples true natures are revealed..  It's the kind of movie that makes you want to yell at your tv, but I thought the charactors were pretty well developed, and the way the filming was done was one of the best things about watching this movie.

2702063,4,B000LC3IE2,"Clearly intended for an audience who can appreciate such studies. I suspect many reviewers were hoping for more 'action' - sharks obviously - and were disappointed to discover only the human drama.

Despite the dramatic foundation being boilerplate, this is actually based on several terrifyingly real-life incidents: Deep into an ocean voyage the passengers of a small craft are, by virtue of accident and incompetence, caught off their luxury sail boat. With no access to get back onboard, they begin to tread water in a vain hope that staying with the ship gives them a chance at rescue. But not having filed any voyage plan, telling someone where they were going, and/or their expected arrival - no one will come.

Once they realize that there's no hope for rescue, playful self-assured shells of civility dissolve away, revealing their true personalities and deep inner selves. And it ain't pretty.

Minor grudges become full blown emotional explosions, past differences rise to the surface and petty jealousies warp into pure hatred. Once past the adrenaline, the truth settles in. All that remains is how they choose to face their end.

One by one, some by choice and others meeting the cold hand of nature, they disappear under the water.

Sturdy storytelling that completely loses its razor edge with the ambiguous last scenes. Unfortunate. I'm no pedestrian viewer who has to have a ""Hollywood"" final. And I definitely don't have a weepy need to spare sacred cows - like having a character survive. But the existential ending truly cheapens the suffering that the characters go through, leaving the film hollow and empty.

Rent it for the drama alone. Skip the last few minutes, as your emotional investment will be tossed to the side in favor of the director's absurd attempt at a gotcha twist.

Movie Note:

- It may seem incredibly improbable, but check out the names ""MV Joyita"" and ""Mary Celeste"". Dark, inexplicable mysteries that have haunted sailors and investigators for years.

Even as recent as 2007 this actually happened. Google the ""Kaz II"". To date no theory has ever fully explained what happened to her vanished three-man crew. She was found floating off the Great Barrier reef with fuel, food, water onboard and completely seaworthy. No blood, no destruction, nothing out of order.

2702064,4,B000LC3IE2,"A seafaring birthday celebration takes a turn for the terrifying when the passengers of a luxury yacht forget to lower the automated ladder before jumping into the ocean for a playful swim. It was a perfect setting for a relaxing weekend at sea, but sometimes even the best-planned trips can take an unexpected turn for the worst. After diving into the ocean and realizing to their horror that they have forgotten to lower the safety ladder, the friends who had set out for a simple weekend getaway realize that they have become helplessly stranded in the middle of the ocean. The sheer sides of the yacht are impossible to climb, and now the group is growing increasingly desperate. As the grim reality of their helpless situation slowly begins to dawn on the doomed friends, hydrophobic Amy (Susan May Pratt) struggles to maintain her composure after realizing that her baby daughter Sarah is helpless and alone aboard the boat.

2702066,2,B000LC3IE2,"I can't give this a one star simply because it does keep you watching in order to find out what happens. Many movies don't even have that. This is the first, and perhaps last, movie review I'll give. I enjoyed and agreed with Jack Baker's review so I'll use some of the names he gives to these characters, also.

Firstly, you will see no sharks, or any other fish in this film. These actors were prohibitively expensive. There is little if any character development outside a token little bit given to Hydrophobic Woman. The six people (not including the baby) who take the yacht off the coast of Mexico are so generic and uninteresting, with little to like about any of them, that I couldn't remember any of their names two days after viewing it. Think decadent yuppies and soccer moms leaving their suburban McMansions to inflict themselves on Mexico. They elicit all the sympatico you'd get watching a sinking ship with Bill Gates, Dick Cheney, and Nancy Pelosi on board. Who cares?

We have two thirds of the adult yacht population swimming beside the yacht when Jerky Guy grabs Hydrophobic Woman and jumps into the ocean with her, despite her protestations. This is the first of Jerky Guy's Charlie Brown-like touches of death.
Everything he touches turns to $%^t. No one has remembered to lower the ladder to get back aboard the deck, which rises 8 feet above their bobbing heads. No one has even bothered to lower the anchor. These people are in the water all day and some of them deep into the night. Hypothermia would occur very quickly unless that water was very near 98.6 degrees, but not in this movie, even though none of them are wearing wet suits.

Brainy ideas to get back aboard include: grabbing Jerky Guy's helium voiced trophy girlfriend's porpoise float and popping it trying to jump from it to the deck, trying to climb up the flag hanging from the stern, and taking off all their swimsuits and cutting them up to make rope, which they toss up to the deck. Instead of having a light weight person like one of the women try to scale it, Jerky Guy, manliest man among men, breaks both the rope and the flag with his refrigerator weight. Hydrophobic Woman's hubby gets the idea to dive under the boat to find a way in from that angle, failing to realize that trying to enter a boat from below the water line is like trying to exit a plane at 36,000 feet, or astronaut Maxwell Smart exiting his space capsule while forgetting his suit. To increase the melodrama, he decides to bash his head on the keel while trying to surface and get a breath, in the process fracturing his skull.

Meanwhile, Birthday Guy is so incensed at their predicament that he finally grabs the knife, swims to the side of the yacht, and tries to use the knife blade as a wedge in the ladder door crack to get a handhold to leverage himself up. Jerky Guy, upon seeing his precious yacht being manhandled, attacks Birthday Guy, and with his Charlie Brown ""All I got is a rock"" touch of death, Jerky Guy accidentally stabs Birthday Guy and then drops the knife into the deeps. Great clouds of blood spew from Birthday Guy, causing Jerky Guy's helium voiced trophy girlfriend to freak, fear sharks, and swim off and drown. Swimmer Girl finally lets go of Birthday/Stabbed Guy, releasing him to the deep along with their rope of swimsuits, to prevent them from trying that trick again.

Feeling immortal, and seeing no instant help, Swimmer Girl takes off swimming with perfect aplomb, leaving for the horizon in a vast sea of emptiness, no compass, no direction, no nothing. We never see her again. Possibly she makes Guam, or is even STILL swimming. Come back soon, we'll be waitin' for ya. Concussion Guy succumbs and is jettisoned. Jerky Guy, feeling sorry for himself, swims a quarter mile from the yacht, which never seems to drift anywhere, and attempts to locate the knife on the bottom of the ocean. We see him taking a mini vacation for several hours of very deep diving, searching for the knife. We have no idea how deep it is, but Jerky Guy uses his swimming mask to scan the deeps with his laser vision eyes. He takes magnanimously deep breaths and dives to the bottom, presumably U.S.S. Scorpion crush depths of two miles, but remember he has taken VERY deep breaths before diving.

Well, I won't continue, but you can deduce the idea with this movie. It's almost an unintentional comedy.",1306022400,16,4390,4.621794871794871
2702067,1,B000LC3IE2,"This is one of those movies where you find yourself talking to the TV as though the characters in the film will actually hear you giving them advice - advice they desperately need. The few things they could have done to save their lives they don't come anywhere near considering, while most of their other decisions are trumped by human stupidity. There's one brilliant moment where the film's main idiot realizes he's an idiot and confesses his idiocy and.... well, that's about it.

The scenario is interesting: A bunch of friends partying on a yacht fail to lower a ladder - or even an anchor - over the side before they all jump in for a swim. Stuck out in the middle of nowhere they're forced to tread water until fatigue, injury, or idiocy draw them to certain doom. And oh yeah - someone left the baby on board alone.

The movie balances on the brink of potential off and on, but just when you think it'll get good it turns to crap. Overall, what you hope will be a happy ending is just plain depressing. Why tell these stories? What's the point? There's no life lesson here. There's no survival skills taught or even learned. The film just showcases how inept most people are today at practical means of survival. As educated as we all appear to be, if we were left to survive anywhere outside of our pleasant human comforts we'd die.",1303948800,7,1342,4.495901639344262
2702068,3,B000LC3IE2,"When a group of friends get together for a day trip on their yacht in Mexico, they are stranded in the ocean after jumping in the water to go for a swim without dropping the ladder. With no way to get back on board and no help in sight, they each face panic, dehydration, and fatigue as they struggle to find a way to safety. Although it was originally intended as its own stand-alone feature, ADRIFT was quickly sold as a sequel to the 2003 hit OPEN WATER to cash in on the earlier film's success. Whether or not this helped or hurt its popularity is debatable. ADRIFT bases itself on the same terrifying, real-world scenarios that made OPEN WATER so unique, but this situation is made that much more ironic in that the characters' salvation lies just inches out of reach. The friends quickly turn on each other and begin to point the blame as soon as they realize how serious the situation is, until finally coming to their senses and making every logical attempt to save themselves. This is where ADRIFT succeeds over anything else in presenting intelligent and believable characters that just made a stupid (but deadly) mistake. Unfortunately, Hans Horn feels the need to throw in two unnecessary plot elements, one being the stereotypical backstory where one of the characters had a traumatic childhood experience with water, and the other being a baby that is left aboard the ship. These things aside, ADRIFT is a decent companion piece to OPEN WATER that compliments it thematically and offers good acting for the size and scale.

2702115,1,B000LC3IE2,"Open Water 2: Adrift (Hans Horn, 2006)

I was one of those who really liked the original Open Water. When I heard there was a sequel, I figured it was going to be terrible. But then it started showing up on IFC rather than the Syfy Channel, and that got me thinking it might actually be better than I was giving it credit for. I was wrong; it's inestimably worse. I watched this right after La Papesse (q.v.), which was the worst movie I'd seen in quite a while. Well, that record didn't stand long.

Plot: a bunch of young-and-beautifuls head out on a boat for one's birthday. They all go out for a swim (save one, who has an ocean phobia and a daughter--hey, can you guess who the final girl is in this flick?, but she gets thrown in by one of her so-called pals) and forget to let down the ladder. And yes, there they are, stuck in the water right next to the boat but unable to get onto it.

While Open Water 2 is more technically competent than La Papesse, that's the only thing it's got going for it. Could Adam Kreutner (Dead Fish) have shoehorned any more clichs into this movie? Actually, he probably could have, but I haven't been able to figure out how, from the stupid opening sequence (which makes you think you're getting a movie that's far more thematically linked to the original than you actually do) right down to the horrid music that plays during the ending you know is coming before you even start watching this movie. In short, everything Open Water did correctly, this pathetic excuse for a sequel screws up. A terrible, terrible movie. (half)",1282608000,2,1566,4.430555555555555
2702116,1,B000LC3IE2,"There be Spoliers Ahead, Yar!  Actually, it's pretty much a complete plot summary, so consider yourself warned.

I caught this movie on the Independent Film Channel not that long ago.  A caveat: ordinarily, I pretty much stick to reviewing things that I like, simply because usually I don't care enough to waste my time on the things that I don't.  I'm going to have to make an exception for this movie.  The plot is pretty basic: a group of college friends get together on the luxury yacht belonging to one of the guys.  They decide to go for a swim in the ocean, leaving the owner of the boat aboard with one of the women and her baby.  The woman is hydrophobic, caused by a tragedy in her past, revealed through clumsy flashback sequences.  The guy who owns the boat grabs the hydrophobic woman and jumps off the side of the boat with her, which terrifies her and sends her into shock.

So now all six adults are in the water and the baby is on the boat alone.  And none of these idiots were smart enough to lower the ladder on the boat, trapping them in the ocean as the sides of the boat are too high to climb.  Between them, they have one diving mask and one diving knife.  They try to make a rope from their swimsuits, which fails. The hydrophobic woman's husband takes the mask and swims underneath the boat, looking for a way to get back aboard.  UNDERNEATH the boat, as if there might be a magic door down there somewhere.  He, of course, bumps his head hard enough to concuss himself, because obviously there needed to be more melodrama.  And then, the other two guys get in a fight after the third guy tries to use the knife to punch holes in the side of the boat to create hand holds to pull himself up.  The boat owner freaks and they fight, which leads to the third guy being stabbed.

As if that isn't enough, we learn that the boat doesn't even belong to Mr. jerky boat owner, but to his boss.  Turns out he's a miserable failure trying to impress his old college buddies.  Meanwhile, stabbed guy dies, boat ""owner's"" girlfriend gives up and drowns, and then hydrophobic lady's husband also succumbs to his concussion.  Stabbed guy's wife is a swimmer, so she sets off for shore, never to be heard from again.  That just leaves hydrophobic lady and her flashbacks of her dad drowning, jerky guy, and the screaming baby on the boat.  If you said that all this movie needs in order to get worse is a raging storm, you win a prize.

During the storm, hydrophobic woman and jerky guy realize stabbed guy was on to something when he was hacking at the side of the boat (which jerky guy killed him over).  Jerky guy wedges the lens from the scuba mask in the hole stabbed guy punched in the side of the boat and hydrophobic lady stands on his hands and is able to reach the railing and haul herself over.  She lowers the electric ladder and jerky guy initially comes on board, but distraught that he essentially killed almost all of his friends, he chooses to go back in the water, so hydrophobic lady has to face her fear to go save him.  Hydrophobic lady and her baby are rescued the next day by the Coast Guard.  Jerky guy is shown laying face down on the deck, but it's not clear whether he's alive.  FIN. If you've read this far, I just saved you from watching two hours of this slop.  You're welcome.

This was perhaps the most awful movie I've ever seen.  The acting and plot were just terrible.  This was based on a true story, so I can only hope that the screenwriter exaggerated the events to play up the drama.  A couple of closing thoughts: 1.  If I was hydrophobic, you'd never get my butt anywhere near a boat.  2.  What happened to the woman who struck off alone?  Did she drown?  Did she reach shore?  Was she rescued by sea turtles and Captain Jack Sparrow?  I need closure here, people.  3.  Why did I watch all of this movie?  Apparently, I really , really hate myself.",1273017600,22,3899,4.342105263157895

Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to scale the giant pleasure craft. Now what? Well, it's time to float around for the rest of the movie's duration. Thankfully, they do make several attempts to escape their watery fate. Many accidents happen, personal secrets are revealed, and deaths ensue. Glub-Glub.

Go on one and jump over. Then look up. Try to imagine getting up without a ladder. In life situations panic sets in, you can't think straight. As a mom myself, if your child is stranded, that would put additional worry in.

This movie was excellent. It truly showed the fear and the things that can happen. The ocean is a cruel place. It's based on a true story of things that happened, it easily could happen to anyone. All it takes is too much to drink or one moment of fun without thinking. Everyone jumped in to swim, thinking someone else would lower the ladder.

We have the video and I'll watch it again. The only bad part is the ending. From reading I've found that Amy and her daughter survive, and speculation says Dan does as well.",1259107200,4,897,4.3017751479289945
2702119,2,B000LC3IE2,"This movie is aptly names: adrift.  It meanders through one entirely too long of a scene.  The writers must have been suffering from writers block but they didn't wait until it cleared before they wrote this script.

Six friends (and that's a stretch of a term) go on a yacht for a vacation.  They decide to go for a swim, but nobody bothered to put the boat's ladder down so they could get back in.  They try jumping only to find you can't jump in water.  They make a rope out of their swimsuits but instead of having one of the lighter women try climbing up it, one of the beefy men try.  Of course it breaks.

One by one they all die either from drowning or by murder.  In the end, the mom and her baby durvive as does the idiot who got them into the mess in the first place.  Normally these kinds of characters are for sure to be killed, but this movie keeps him around.  Hopefully they don't use him in Open Water 3 or if they do they use him as shark bait.

Of all the characters, the baby played her part the best.  In fact she should have been the only one paid for her role.  The adults are all stupid or morons, or both.  The mom wore a life preserver throughout the film because she had a fear of the water.  It is almost as if she's dreading something more than just the water, like she somehow knew this movie would require more than a life preserver to save it.

Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this film, but it just struck me as a real waste of my time to sit through it all the way.",1258761600,,1498,4.040816326530612
2702120,5,B000LC3IE2,"This is the sequel to Open Water and I must say, it's just as creepy and unsettling as the first.

This is because much of the movie is silent and takes place in the water, as the young adults have no choice but to be stuck in the ocean and spend the whole time swimming around the boat (because they forgot to lower the ladder- oops, what a horrible unfortunate mistake).

For the most part, the young adults gradually die off one by one, as they either sink, get frustrated and drowned, or hit their head on something and pass out.

There's a lot of emotion in this film and concern whether the remaining young adults were going to survive the horrible ordeal, since the original Open Water had an incredibly shocking ending, you pretty much expected the same kind of conclusion here.  The ending in this movie isn't as good as the ending in the original, but pretty good nonetheless since it leaves you guessing.

The fact that one of the young adults was terrified of the water because of something that happened in her past ended up playing a pretty important part of the storyline- in the beginning, she was constantly hesitating whether she wanted to get in the water or not.

An interesting part of the story was how this same woman brought her baby daughter on board the ship, and while the young adults were struggling to get back inside the boat after forgetting to lower the ladder, the baby could be heard crying in the background.  I wondered at first whether the crying baby would be included as part of the storyline for added realism, and luckily it was.  Nice detail.

The reason the young adults ended up in the water in the first place is because one of the guy friends grabbed his female friend and threw her in the water with the rest of the gang, and in the process didn't even think whether the ladder was lowered or not.  Dumb move.

I'm surprised sharks didn't enter the picture, but they almost did at one point.  Very good sequel to a series that has become popular for its unpredictable plot twists and realistic setting.",1248134400,4,2050,4.495956873315364

It would been over in 20 minutes. Of course those things didn't work.

Aside from the young blonde, I didn't thing the characters were ditzy, dumb, or stupid. I thought they were quite good and the acting was great. And the way things unfolded I thought were very believable.

The added suspense of the baby left on board, crying in hunger and lonliness, with the parents feeling horribly helpless, was heartbreaking.

Throughout the whole movie I was left to think what I would do in this situation. It was a psychological Thriller.

My only knock was the ending had two contradicting endings, which left me confused, and I felt a little cheated.

2702122,4,B000LC3IE2,"Others have covered this film well so I will simply add this: I surfed into this film on Dish and, as the former skipper of a 54' sailboat similar to the one shown, the synopsis immediately drew my attention.

This and similar situations happen all too frequently. As others have said, I was on the edge of my seat much of the last two thirds of the movie. Like the actors in this film, most guests aboard a small vessel do not realize they are putting their lives in the hands of the boat's skipper. My recommendation is to take a good look at the skipper before getting aboard and ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to hang your life on. The sea, mountain peaks, and the like can be VERY unforgiving which is a way of saying that you can get 99 things in a hundred right and still die because something obvious is overlooked. This film should be mandatory viewing for anyone planning to hop aboard a friend's boat for a sunny day on the water. Nuf said on that...

I found most of the plot set in the water credible. It's a big ocean and most of it contains no preditors. Also, if something was going to get done, it would have had to have happened in the first hour or two because of hypothermia and rapid loss of strength. Thus, the final solution for those that remained just was not believable. By the end of the film, everyone should have perished. Ironically, who ever found the boat would have been left with a Bermuda Triangle style mystery. My biggest concern from the beginning was that the wind would come up and start blowing the boat forcing the crew to swim to stay along side. A breeze did come up that was plenty to move a boat with that much freeboard... yet it stayed amazingly stationary without the benefit of anchor.

The crew did start down the road to a solution almost immediately but the plot turned in a different direction in a credible way. Remember, it is hard to think straight when people are wet, cold, tired, having to keep their mouth above water continuously, and otherwise paniced. I am willing to bet good money that with a guy in the water on either side of the lightest woman, she could have gotten a foot into the palm of each guy's hand, then get a foot on each shoulder, and stretch for the toe rail or lifeline. Failing that, the men could get a palm under each of her feet and hoist her up to the toe rail, lifeline, etc. However, once the crew lost their strength they were goners. The moral of the story is pick your skipper well and speak up if you see ANYTHING that you think could turn into a problem... he needs all the eyes and ears the crew can bring to bear in any whether conditions.",1239753600,7,2656,4.297405189620759

It WAS entertaining and unpredictable, it DID command my attention, and the premise IS compelling. I have to recommend a movie that manages to accomplish all that.

Open Water 2 features a small group of friends stranded in the ocean because everyone had jumped off the side of the boat, and no one had taken the responsibility to pull the ladder down. They have no way of getting back on. Everyone is in the water except a hungry, wailing infant, while her mother listens as she fights to stay afloat in the ocean.

The owner of the yacht is inexperienced, emotionally distraught, and drunk.  They're all in way over their heads out there (pun intended), but the movie's not dumb just because they are. It's possible to imagine yourself caught in this hopeless scenario on a private yacht involving a lot of flirting and alcohol, with people who have no business being in the deep end of a pool, much less aboard a vessel like this.  Thus I rate it scary and suspenseful enough to make for decent entertainment, especially since it claims to be based on a true story.",1235606400,2,1308,5.065116279069767
2702124,3,B000LC3IE2,"I, like most other viewers, didn't have very high expectations here but was hoping for some good suspense and some scares.  This movie was supposedly based on a true story and I can believe it is.  If you were to write down everything that happens on paper in order it does make sense and could have made for quite a good movie but it just didn't fully succeed.

It grabbed me in at the beginning with the 4 friends videotaping themselves.  I thought it really showed the closeness and bond between them all.  Then we go ahead 5 years and there is a reunion.  I didn't find the characters to be stereotypes but agree you found out little about them.  I thought the actors did very well with what they had.  I did believe the love and commitment between the married couple and found my concentration centering on them and their child.  I found their acting very believable and I felt for them.

I think one reason this film does not work is because a viewer knows it takes place on the sea and danger happens.  One does expect scares but nothing much happens here.  When they first end up in the water with no way back onto the boat I think the film succesfully shows their growing terror and taps into all viewers fear of water and such a situation.  It had me for a little while.  But then the movie was just too long, very little happened and the suspense did not remain.  I believe if the film was better written it could have held the suspense throughout but it just lost steam.

It grabbed me enough that I watched the whole thing and I certainly don't think it was terrible.  The premise was good and as I said before I think the actors did quite well with what they were handled.  But it just could have been so much better.",1220745600,,1731,4.306501547987616

There are some good performances in the film, and the irony of how they got themselves into this pickle is a great set-up. But there are just too many acts of stupidity. When Lauren decides to swim off to shore & no one stops her, I just had to laugh. I mean, seriously??? That's not even to mention the rope ( which they let go adrift with a corpse when they could have used it to try again... argh!), the cell-phone, the knife etc etc. I understand that people in this situation don't think very clearly, but it also seemed like a lot to ask that we identify/empathise with such a spoiled, entitled and idiotic crowd.
The ""ambiguous ending"" is also ridiculous. They should have stuck with the first choice and let the screen fade out without trying to have their second ending, which by itself also didn't make any sense ( crying baby, preserver still in the water,ladder down, etc)

THE ASPECT OF BEING LOST IN THE WATER AND NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT WAIT TO DIE IS A HAUNTING REALITY THAT IS SCARY IN MY BOOK.

THIS MOVIE PUSHES THE FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE SITUATION. MIX IN A CRAZY FRIEND NAMED DAN WHO HAS NOT GROWN UP AND IS RECKLESS TO THE POINT OF CAUSING DEATH OF OTHERS AND YOU HAVE A STORY THAT UNFOLDS WITH FRIENDS BECOMING ANGRY WITH ONE ANOTHER AS THERE LIVES ARE SLOWLY FALLING AWAY.

In most horror films we fully expect that somebody does something incredibly stupid, resulting in all of them being in ""quite a kettle of fish, Ollie"".  However, the characters in this movie don't have enough brains amongst them to even get the boat out of the harbor, much less solve their dilemma.

Hmmm, with six extremely healthy adults (plenty of flexibility and stamina, one would presume, judging from the shape of their buns) caught overboard without a paddle....or the ladder, I was wondering what the rest of the 45 minutes of the movie would be about. Maybe the party where they laugh at how wrinkle-dee they got during their hour in the drink? Ah, but, no.... There were at least half a dozen ways they could have gotten back up onto the deck, without any fatalities involved. But, alas, they were just too stupid.

The actor who played the sea-o-phobic lady was the only believble character. She gave a wonderful performance, even amidst a sea of bad actors, bad plot, and the longest day in the history of the open ocean. Did anyone else wonder if the sun would EVER set? What was up with that?

I have a problem with ambiguous endings. I'm too anal, and really need things tied up neatly.  Even if it means they all end up as chum. So, the one thing I was counting on, ie., the mom reuniting with the baby (who was able to find her binky but was unable to feed herself) and everything being just fine ever after, was blown...or was it, I don't know!

2702141,3,B000LC3IE2,"""Open Water 2: Adrift"" is one of those ""in name only"" sequels in that they're connected only by theme - people trying to survive in the open ocean.  In this case, a group of five attractive friends in their 30s reunite on a luxury yacht.  We're first introduced to the five friends via flashback to one of their vacations five years earlier.  Now, Amy and James are married and have an infant daughter.  Zach and Lauren aren't dating but flirt and obviously like each other.  Finally, there's the sexist, egotistical owner of the yacht - Dan.  When the others arrive on the yacht, they find that Dan has made yet another sexual conquest in the form of the sexy 20-something Michelle, who joins the five friends for some ocean-going fun.  The friendships aren't ever fully spelled out (Dan and Amy seem to have some past together, for example); however, they clearly care about each other, but there's some tension as well.

The six friends cruise to somewhere far offshore the coast of Mexico and start to drink.  They all seem to be having fun except for Amy, who is extremely afraid of the water due to a childhood trauma.  As Amy puts her baby down for a nap, several of the others decide to go for a swim.  When Amy arrives on the deck, only Dan is left, and he decides to try to ""help"" her conquer her fear of water....by picking her up and jumping overboard.  Bad idea.  Not only does Amy go into shock, but everyone realizes that Dan didn't seem to lower any kind of ladder so that they can climb back aboard.  Thanks Captain Dan!  As they frantically look for some way to get onto the yacht, they slowly begin to realize that they are in deep trouble.  The rest of the plot is difficult to describe without providing any spoilers, but suffice to say that the group continues to make some incredibly bad decisions that lead to tragedy.

I greatly enjoyed the first ""Open Water"" movie, which was a low-budget hit that provided some nice surprises.  Nevertheless, I had very low expectations for this straight-to-DVD sequel, which was not created by the same people as the first movie.  However, I occasionally enjoy a high-concept piece of claptrap like this movie, so I decided to give it a try - and I was glad I did.  Although the movie is low budget and the script could have used some beefing up, ""Open Water 2"" provided some enjoyment, although admittedly rather dumb enjoyment.  This movie is one that you should probably not overthink, because you could easily spend the 135 minutes second-guessing everything the characters do.  Quite a few aspects aren't very realistic, including the amount of strength the friends still have after hours in the water.  In addition, these characters are somewhat annoying at times and clearly not meant to be particularly intelligent; however, their plight still provided some tension, especially as Amy realizes the consequences for her napping baby if they are not able to get back onboard.  It's definitely the kind of movie that might make you wonder whether you could make similar mistakes and how you'd try to save yourself.  Not bad overall.",1205020800,,3098,4.692592592592592
2702142,4,B000LC3IE2,"Thought this movie was quite realistic in its possibilities and speculation about being ""Adrift"" on the ocean. I can preface this as I have gone 20 miles offshore on the Gulf of Mexico and the engine of our boat failed. Anchor would not hold and GPS was fried. We got extremely lucky, fortunate or blessed as we floated near an offshore oil platform that another boat was fishing. We frantically waved for their aid, and help was rendered as we began our 4 hour tow back to port.  Some of you may say, just use your cell phone(DUH?), and we did. But, without the GPS positional coordinates to give to the Coast Guard, we were headed for Cuba on a fast moving current and wind, and could no more tell them where we were than the correct direction in which we were headed.  And, YES, saltwater destroys any electronics (a cell phone) that it come in contact with as I have ruined one in the same manner as in the movie.
Anyways, I was a presumptuous, callow, small craft captain that did not plan correctly, just as the character, Dan (the idiot), failed to plan. It happens...  You want to take your friends offshore, have fun and impress them.  During my ordeal, I accomplished none of these goals and those friends have not spoken to me since I dropped them off at their home 20 hours after we had set out for a great day on the deep, open blue.  That was 5 years ago. To say this movie is ineffectual is simply an error in ones personal judgement.  I do not really think those who have not ever been out on the OPEN sea in a 30' something craft (not a cruise ship guys) :) , or have ever spent any significant amount of time on the briny water snorkeling, fishing, diving, etc, can truly appreciate what this film is trying to accomplish.  You are just not able to appropriately empathize if you have no platform or basis from which you make your judgement of this movie.
I found it quite funny that this movie received a 42% review/approval at rotten tomatoes website, and 'The Descent' (which I had seen just before this film) received an 84% review/approval. I thought 'The Descent' was another very poorly acted, non-scary, excuse movie to get young, hot, dynamic chicks in tight clothing eaten or hacked up in another uninteresting way.  The reviews % should be reversed...but, what do I know, right?  I also find humor in those who criticize the movie for the ""silly"" and ""unecessary"" reaction of the boat party to their impending doom i.e. swimming away and drowing themselves, fighting, not figuring out how to save themselves, etc.  I would really like to put the 6 most negative of these reviewers together on that boat, and watch the complete chaos that would ensue. Easy to talk big boy from a computer screen and soft comfy chair about what you would do.
Anyways, I digress and do apologize.  'Open Water: 2' was truly gripping and had me sitting forward on my living room couch for much of the film.  My personal experience was truly scary, a lesson learned and a real situation that actually had me contemplating and reflecting on my own possible demise while drifting helpless with a crew looking to me for answers to their questons that I did not have.  This experience I will never forget, and the movie was able to reopen those indelible memories, fraying my nerves and making me shudder, once again. I thought the movie was quite well acted and portrayed, and I was moved emotionally...",1202169600,38,3408,4.549019607843137
2702143,2,B000LC3IE2,"The original Open Water was an interesting independent movie based on true events that had some good moments of suspense and a good ending.  Open Water 2 shares none of those qualities.

I almost immediately disliked all the characters, some of the scenes were preposterous (as others have mentioned, let's have the heaviest person climb up!), the interpersonal tension was overdone (to hell with trying to figure out a way out, let's just argue some more), and the ending was [multiple expletives deleted] insulting, or should I say endings?  And not just the last 2 scenes, the mother's decision/action before them was laughable.
I'll give it 2 stars because it was well shot and I have definitely seen worse.  If you haven't seen the original, your time will be better spent watching it and skipping this one.",1200096000,5,812,4.905109489051095
2702144,3,B000LC3IE2,"The first thing that must be emphasized about ""Open Water 2: Adrift"" is that it is NOT a sequel to ""Open Water."" It does not share any of the creators, actors, or characters from that earlier film. The reason this movie is  linked to ""Open Water"" is that it shares a similar situation: people have been accidentally stranded at sea and must survive the elements while  desperately hoping to be saved. Thus, you do not need to have seen the original ""Open Water"" to understand this film.

Another point which needs to be made is that ""Open Water 2"" does NOT feature sharks, which were a big part of the original ""Open Water"" plot. The main common link that the films share is that both are low-budget horror movies which emphasize primal, psychological terror at sea instead of action and special effects. If the viewer is cool with that, he or she is likely to find ""Open Water 2"" entertaining.

""Open Water 2"" features a cast of several people (the biggest ""name"" actor currently being Eric Dane of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame) in peril, as opposed to just the two main characters stranded in ""Open Water."" This lends itself to a more ""traditional"" horror film setup, in which you expect multiple characters to get ""killed off"" over the course of the film as you wonder which ones (if any) will ultimately make it out alive. The film does a surprisingly good job of maintaining suspense throughout (although throwing some sharks into the mix would have helped jack up the fear factor even more.) The agonizing reality of the boat remaining JUST OUT OF REACH of the characters, as well as the fact that a baby is alone on the boat, adds a great deal of tension.

The ending of the movie, as many others have commented, is where the film runs into trouble. While a few have praised it as ""ambiguous,"" the word ""frustrating"" is much more appropriate. I had to go back and watch it again, unsure of what had happened. It seems to me like two endings were shot for this film (a common practice), and the filmmakers were unsure about which one to go with, so they basically just used them both! I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be intentionally vague: the ""first"" ending plays, and it seems like the credits should come up (the camera even pulls back, as you often see at the end of a film.) But suddenly there's an unexpected cut, and the ""second"" ending comes up, which appears to directly contradict what was just shown moments ago!

In my opinion, it would been much more satisfying if the director had simply chosen one ending and stuck with it. The unused conclusion could have been included as a ""deleted scene"" or ""alternate ending"" among the dvd bonus materials. When you spend an hour and a half watching a movie to see who survives, do you really want to be saying ""huh?!"" at the end? Ambiguity may work well in more artistic films, but ""Open Water 2"" is a basic survival story and there's no reason why it shouldn't have a coherent, clear ending.

However, if you can deal with a questionable ending, the rest of ""Open Water 2,"" while hardly a classic movie, is entertaining enough. If you liked the first ""Open Water,"" you'll probably want to check this one out too.",1194048000,4,3175,4.559649122807017
2702165,1,B000LC3IE2,"You know a film is bad when you are realy lost to find anything positive to say after it.  Not the actors, the plot, nothing.  A group of idiots go on a boat (whoopse sorry Yacht) jump overboard then realise that they forgot to lower the ladder first!

This realy has got to be one of the worst plots ever thought of and all this 'based on a true story' or rather 'loosly on a true story'  Yeh just how loose?  The 6 drunk idiots on a boat?  Sorry but unless I have some actual proof I don't belive a word of it.

Problems with this film are 1. The characters are basically just rich idiots so the viewer frankly doesnt realy care what happens to them.  (Good example of this is leaving the baby on board while they get drunk and go for a swim) 2. Instead of realistically thinking through how they can actually get back on board they just argue, have the odd fit of temper, swim off for a bit then come back and various other pointless acts which lets face it, if you realy where stuck in this situation you would channel all efforts into getting back on board not swiming in circles.  3. The so called 'confession' of the boat owner towards the end, no it doesnt make you relate to him or any of the others more just makes you think of him as more of a prat than before.  4. There is just no realism to any of it, open water had some suspence, you felt sorry for the 2 characters who were just decent people taking a holiday that went horribly wrong not a group of idiots deviod of brains or responsibility.

And how the film ends.....you will be kicking yourself you ever put yourself through the hour and whatever of this rubbish.

Because of one silly (but not implausible) mistake, they cannot get on board again. And no one (except a little baby) remains on board to help them out.

Some viewers would think the premise is impossible, but German director Hans Horn insists this film is inspired by what really happened. I don't know, but if so, the film must be based on the real events very loosely. Tagline of ""Open Water 2: Adrift"" reads ""Fatigue. Hypothermia. Death,"" and probably the death would be a very slow one in reality. However, the film's muddled script quickens it in sometimes most incredible ways.

I cannot write about how incredible it could be because to explain means to reveal some of the crucial parts of the story. But I can say that these people are not without some tools when they dropped into the water. While looking at the characters floating and struggling in the water, most of us would say to ourselves, ""Why don't they...?""

Of course people in a panic and fear do ridiculous mistakes. But when they continue to mistake in this way, audiences just begin to care less and less about the characters -- and most of them are not exactly likable persons when they first showed up (how many of us would throw your wife overboard who is clearly terrified?). A little baby crying on board may be there to heighten the suspense, but it just doesn't work, and the weak conclusion only confuses us.",1186790400,4,1523,4.654275092936803

I gave this film 2 stars because if you manage to watch this film and then go to ""Extras"" to watch the making of featurette you will laugh your head off! This film is so bad that the making of feature is absolutely hysterical as the retarded cast replays every single scene and the incompetent director tries to describe his thought process in creating his self-imagined chef d'oeuvre.

I would love to meet the fools whose ""true story"" this is supposedly based on. The whole film is about jocks on a yacht... one of them grabs a woman with hydrophobia and forces her off the boat and into the water below (they are in the middle of the ocean).  Then, in this sea of stupidity, every one else (except the sleeping baby), jumps in after them... but forgets to put down the ladder... so they have to tread water for hours and hours as the boat is too big for them to reach the deck.  Fights, cuts, lots of blood in the water... yet mysteriously NO SHARKS appear. Apparently a shark wrangler wasn't in the budget this time around.

2702169,3,B000LC3IE2,"Open Water II, based on ""real events"" follows the dim witted tragedy of a group of partying 30-somethings who, drunk, leap overboard on their yacht for a swim, only to realize they did not let down the ladder and have no way to climb back on board.  The scenario is made more tragic because a baby is left alone onboard.  The film begins by trying too hard to make the characters and their friendship seem ""real"".  The character development is forced and made more annoying by showing the characters through the lens of a ""home-movie"".  Luckily all but the most well known of the cast, Eric Dane of Grey's Anatomy, actually do a really good acting job.  You will laugh out loud at the insincerity of his over the top confessional scene towards the end of the movie.  The movie gets better and entertaining once the group of friends find themselves overboard.  Panic sets in, and one by one the friends (predictably) die.  Suspense is sustained by the sheer awfulness of the situation.  The final act of bravery of one of the two survivors is really unrealistic and the ending leaves you wondering if they really did survive.  This is a mildly entertaining romp for anyone who enjoys the ""survival"" genre or the scare of contemplating being lost at sea.",1182729600,4,1252,4.65

2702171,5,B000LC3IE2,"After reading the premise of this movie, I just had to see it.  Six friends jump off a yacht to take a swim in the ocean, only to realize that they are royally screwed because nobody thought to let the ladder down.  In other words, they've jumped in and they can't get up.  As one of the characters actually says, the circumstances would be funny if they weren't so serious.  Honestly, I expected this to be some kind of B-movie I could laugh at.  Instead, it's a polished production, and there's nothing funny about it.  You won't be traumatized by any means, but this is one deadly serious film that almost forces you to imagine yourself in the same situation.  For me, it was like having claustrophobia out in the middle of the ocean - a weird concept, of course, but that's how it made me feel.  I'm really surprised that the film gets so many lukewarm and negative reviews.  I found it intense, and I was delighted that things didn't play out the way I expected.  The director threw us a curveball at the end, with a pretty ambiguous ending, but after a little thought I can't even criticize that decision, as I believe it ties in with the real story that inspired the film.

A group of old friends get together for a weekend on the high seas, and it looks like a good time will be had by all on board Dan's (Eric Dane) luxurious yacht.  (Of course, to really enjoy the cruise, you sort of need to be on the yacht most of the time - aye, that's the rub.) Three guys, three gals, and a baby whose mother has a major water phobia make up the passenger manifest.  Some viewers don't seem to like some of these characters, but we really don't get to know any of them intimately before the real drama begins.  They're basically just normal people, and that helps put you into the ""what would I do in their situation?"" mindset.

Let's just look at some of the things we can learn from this movie.  1) If a childhood tragedy has given you a major water phobia, you might want to just pass on the private yacht vacation thing, especially if you have a baby to take care of.  2) Out of every six people, at least one of them is the kind of jerk who will try to cure a friend's fear of the water by picking her up and jumping into the ocean with her.  3) This one's really important - don't forget to let the ladder down before you and everyone else on board go for a swim in the ocean because you cannot get back up on the yacht without said ladder.  4) In this kind of dangerous situation, don't fight over the very sharp knife.  5) When ""nuding up"" to make a rope out of your clothes, let the lightest person - not the biggest guy - try to climb up the ""rope"" first.  6) When desperately trying to get back to the surface after a dive, watch your freakin' head.  7) When facing such a ""what a stupid way to die"" situation such as this, you learn a whole lot about your friends.

Open Water 2: Adrift (which is its own film and not a true sequel to Open Water) turned out to be really intense.  Desperation comes quickly and only grows as the whole situation worsens.  A full 2/3 of this film takes place in the ocean itself.  I know you're probably expecting a shark attack to come along at some point - I know I was - but don't be disappointed by the complete absence of deadly oceanic predators in this film.  I think a shark attack would have actually hurt the story, as it would have taken something away from the intensely personal tragedy these poor people have to face.  With no outside threat to unite against, these characters quickly turn against one another, making their situation even direr in the process.  Then you have the sounds of the baby crying every now and again, adding even more to the angst the characters are feeling and emoting, especially the child's mother Amy (Susan May Pratt).  Some viewers are going to quibble and go into a ""they should have done this or that"" kind of mania as they watch the film, but I found it really quite realistic in terms of the situation.

My first reaction to the film's ending was less than enthusiastic - it's one of those ""please don't end it like this --- aaaarrgghhh"" types of ending.  After reading one of the director's comments and taking a few moments to reflect on it, however, I find myself having no problem whatsoever with the ambiguity of that final minute.  Not surprisingly, I think this is a great, underrated movie; it certainly exceeded my somewhat low expectations by leaps and bounds.",1180137600,55,4463,4.351449275362318
2702172,3,B000LC3IE2,"At the moment I'm too lazy too review the whole movie myself. Anyways, I basically agree with what everyone else has been saying. I mean, if you have a rope made of something as flimsy as wet swimsuits, you narrow it down to the two women, and ask them who weighs the LEAST. Then you put your friggin hand under one of their feet as they climb and HELP THEM make it up there!!! God that frustrated me. NO wonder the friggin thing tore. And the supposed captain/owner of the yacht guy. Yeah, he shouldn't be acting. I watched 'The Making of Adrift' and he's just as cocky and egotistical in real life as his character! However, I disagree with everyone who says it was so ""stupid"" of them to forget to drop the ladder. I think that's merely a careless, very easy-to-make mistake. I mean, your're partying on a boat, and someone jumps in and everyone follows. I can see myself forgetting to think ahead and put the ladder out before I take a swim. It doesn't mean I'm retarted.

Negative thoughts aside, My God, intense film, with excellent* acting from Susan May Pratt. Aside from the parts where you want to shout ""You dumbasses!"" and ""Oh, c'mon."" I found it to be a very believeable and realistic storyline. The baby on the ship had to be the most cringe-inducing aspect.

As for the comment made about the first Open Water, and how they never made it clear how they were left behind. Let me explain- You have to watch the scene carefully.. but you'll notice that the man on the boat in charge of the headcounts is basically an idiot. He scribbles down on a pad the number of people who are out scuba-diving, and forgets to add that hyper/weird guy who decides to jump in at the last minute. So already the count is off, and, thinking they have everyone back on the boat, and not being able to see the couple left behind since they're way under the surface, the boat takes off.

Oh yeah, I HATED the ending. Pick one or the other!! Or at least make it clear which actually happened. It seems like the whole movie built to that point, and the director lets us down with that fuzzy, surreal ending that never satisfies our need to know if they and the baby survived!!",1179619200,3,2166,4.396508728179551
2702173,4,B000LC3IE2,"I rented this DVD half-expecting a cheap knockoff of the original, and was pleasantly surprised to find a nail-biter of a suspense film with a high quality of acting and production.

A group of twentysomething high school friends gather for a yaghting trip in celebration of one of their birthdays. Things go horribly wrong when, in their beered-up revelry, they all decide to jump ship and go for a swim. Panic ensues when they realize no one dropped the ladder and they have no way of getting back on the boat.

There are some stunning moments of suspense as the characters try to figure a way out of their situation. One scene in which a character delves deep into the water and knocks his head on the ship following a frantic rise to the surface will cause any viewer to cry out in vicarious pain.

The movie's star turn undoubtedly belongs to Susan May Pratt, who completely owns the screen every time she appears. Her turn as a suffering mother who entered the water involuntarily is easily the most sympathetic performance.

Some reviewers have complained that there's no character development to be found in this film. Actually, we learn quite a bit about the supposed ""owner"" of the yaght. His confession about his professional life is straight out of ""Death of a Salesman.""

This movie is not a sequel to the original ""Open Water,"" which may be a superior film. Rather, it's basically a movie with the same premise. Here, at least, it's easy to understand how the characters became stranded - In the first movie, it's all but impossible to figure out how the characters got left off the ship.

The biggest weak point here is the ending...or ""endings,"" as the film seems to sport two distinctly different conclusions. Either way, though, this is a good entertainment and deserves viewing from anyone intrigued by the idea of a group of people being literally lost at sea.",1179532800,6,1880,4.73394495412844

For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!

Although there are no sharks in this movie or limbs being ripped of, the realism of something like that actually happening to someone is there.  Granted, you would have to be stupid to not put the ladder down and shame on them for not having a back up plan if that should happen.  I would hope a yacht like that would have a safety button down by the propellor just incase that should happen.  Still though, if you found yourself in that situation, how scary would that be??  I thought of the idea to take their clothes and make a rope before it was suggested in the movie.  I agree with another reviewer on why one of the heaviest people attempted to climb the rope.  Even before the rope idea, I would have had one of the guys make a human platform using the pressure of his body up against the boat and then take the lightest girl and have her put one foot on his back and the other foot in my hands as I pushed her up into the air.  Yes, there were a few unrealistic parts but when you are in a crisis situation, things aren't always 20/20.  The movie was realistic enough to me to enjoy and imagine myself in that situation.

A chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting. I wish I could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a ""1 star"" as the lowest.

I can't remember a movie where the audience's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon. Think of the worst movie you've ever seen, the kind where you fidgeted for an hour and a half wondering when it will ever end.  That is now ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" compared to ""Open Water 2"".

The Three Stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie, the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes Ed Wood look like Martin Scorcese.

There were points where I considered just turning it off, but thought perhaps there must be some method to the boredom... that something would eventually happen to explain the painfully slow pace ... I mean, nothing could be THIS bad, right? I waited... and waited... and... nothing. When it was finally over, I actually found myself perplexed at the depth of it's uselessness.

Maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make... because if not, those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste.",1175558400,4,1500,4.662878787878788
2702198,4,B000LC3IE2,"This is a thematic sequel to Open Water.  In this film, a group of friends are out on a yacht when some of them decide to go swimming.  One of the people who stay on the boat is deathly afraid of water due to a childhood trauma.  She puts on a life vest as soon as she exits her car even though the water is more than a hundred yards away.  Also on board are the woman's baby and her ex.  The ex is the cause of much of the later trouble.  Soon, through a twist of fate, all the adults are in the water leaving just the baby on board.  It is then that they realize they have no way of getting back on the boat.

Most options are tried for getting back on board although maybe not in the order the viewer will think of.  The ladder is not down, the anchor is not down, and the sides are too high to reach.  At one point I did have to ask myself why the heaviest person was making the attempt at one point).  All options are tried and they fail in believable ways.  The real trouble comes from the fighting and bickering that springs up.  Why is the captain too stupid to make sure the ladder is down (it's believable)?  Eventually bad things begin to happen due to tiredness and carelessness.  People begin to die.  The story that progresses is tenser and better presented than in the first movie.

Unlike in the first movie, we see how situations work out.  In the first movie there was a scene where a boat was coming at them and they start to wave but then the film jumps time and we don't know what went wrong , only that something must have.  In this movie all threads are followed through.  My only real problem was that when blood was in the water it never drew any predators (and it was in the water in quantity for hours).

Open Water 2 is not exceptional, but it does have its moments.

Open Water 2 tells the story of four high school friends getting together to celebrate one of their birthdays. Along for the ride are also a husband, a baby, and a lusty companion. The latter decides to go swimming, and eventually all follow her in, whether they like it or not. Immediately they realize that nobody dropped the ladder, and they struggle to find a way back to the boat.

The six characters are stereotypes, and we learn nothing more about them during their struggles in the water. As can be expected, some are hysterical, while others are calm. Because the characters are stereotypes, it's difficult to feel sympathy for them. Not that their plights aren't worthy of sympathy - they most certainly are. Especially the baby. The baby wasn't an idiot and didn't deserve to be left alone.

This is supposedly based on a true story. The key word, I believe, is based, because the ending is simply too contrived and I predicted it before they entered the water.

One reviewer has expressed concerns that viewers have missed the point, and that we were expecting missing limbs, headless torsos, etc. I didn't miss the point. I get that the irony is that safety is inches away, but just beyond their reach, and that this irony is the ""thrill"" that the movie provides. My problem was that I didn't believe in the characters, didn't like them (I laughingly joked that before they even went into the water there were two deserving of a good drowning - all in good fun, mind you), and found the situations too fanciful and the writing too pedestrian.

2702201,2,B000LC3IE2,"I enjoyed the ""Open Water"", but this sequel fell flat.  It's really a shame, because the film makers had all the right elements in place to create a really good film.  The title should have been, ""Open Water 2: Wasted Potential"".

The characters were interesting until their IQs were reduced during the film.  The concept of the film was great:  6 people may die in spite of being able to touch their muli-million dollar yacht.  Safety is inches away, yet they cannot reach it.  Wow, that really had my interest.

Some reviewers said it was a good movie if you can just overlook the stupidity of the characters.  That is probably very true.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't do that.  Every time they had a chance, they did something stupid.  Often, all 6 let something stupid happen without even one speaking up.  I watched 100% of the film, just to see what happened, but I was completely disappointed with the film.

It wasn't terrible, just very weak.",1174348800,5,953,4.662650602409639
2702202,4,B000LC3IE2,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews for this movie. Sure its not Hamlet, but its not a turkey either. Using as its premise a similar situation to Open Water, which to me is very plausible. Here you have a group of people on boat drinking, and relaxing who decide to go swimming and forget to lower a ladder in order for them to get back on the boat.

What ensues is gripping and nicely built tension as they try and adopt various means to get back on board. Each one of the six people eventually succombing to hysteria and some to the elements.

A lot of reviewers have concentrated on the 'what ifs and why didn't they' - forget that,and just relax and go with the story. The point is we would all react in different ways when faced with a challenging situation such as this.

For me the enjoyment was watching the pyschological interplay between the characters and being equally frustrated by their failed attempts to get back on board.

Its gripping, depressing, well acted and filmed and I enjoyed it far more than the original Open Water.",1173052800,9,1058,4.523560209424084
2702203,3,B000LC3IE2,"The original OPEN WATER captured our interest due to its frightening premise and the terror of two people lost in the ocean and the ever present threat of sharks.

Supposedly based on actual events, this OPEN WATER doesn't have the sharks, but it is deeply depressing anyway.  Although most of the people aren't that sympathetic, their frustration at being so close to their yacht but their inability to save themselves is disturbing.  Eric Dane (GREY'S ANATOMY) plays the deceptive owner of the yacht and the cast is to be admired for having to give their performances while afloat.  Ultimately, however, the movie sinks and its nebulous ending is frustrating.",1172880000,,661,5.036697247706422
