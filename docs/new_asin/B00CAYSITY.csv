5710185,5,B00CAYSITY,"What a fun and interesting panel.  As always, Frances Conroy was sadly relegated to the sidelines and underused, but even if this basically became the Jessica Lange hour, her charisma warrants it.  I wish that the cinematographer were there to discuss the masterful art direction of the series, but I guess you can't have it all.",1385164800,4,329,4.857142857142857
5710186,4,B00CAYSITY,"I am enjoying it very much, however it is a bit campy...  Would be nice if it were less campy and the women were less victimized, and fighting each other so much.  There are plenty of us women who do NOT bicker and fight with one another.",1383264000,,238,4.042553191489362
5710187,5,B00CAYSITY,"Just finished watching Season 1 of American Horror Story. So it just made sense to watch this interview session, to get some behind the scenes info. It was good to hear some of the thought processes that went into creating this show. I especially liked how down to earth the cast seemed to be. Just a bunch of jokesters.. I bet it was fun being on set with them. Dylan McDermott and Sarah Paulson were hilarious. And you would think with Jessica Lange's resume that she wouldn't be as laid back and funny as she was here. Pleasantly surprised by that. Good interview.",1382745600,8,567,4.514563106796117
5710188,5,B00CAYSITY,"As a big fan of the first season of American Horror Story, this question and answer session with the cast and creators was really interesting.  I especially enjoyed Jessica Lange discussing how she came to be cast as Constance and Ryan Murphy comparing the creative process he uses with AMS versus the creative process for his other show, Glee.  Jessica Lange and Dylan McDermot made me laugh with some of their responses regarding some of the crazy plotlines on the show.",1382054400,5,472,4.814814814814815
5710189,5,B00CAYSITY,American Horror Story has an awesome cast and it shows. I love how each season will have a different cast and a different story line. Who knew that Jessica Lange was so funny?,1381708800,3,175,4.333333333333333
5710190,2,B00CAYSITY,"Stupid!  I thought this movie was dumb: not scary at all and non realistic gore.  Basically, it's for tweens at a sleepover",1381622400,,123,4.545454545454546
5710191,5,B00CAYSITY,"I loved getting some behind the scenes info (and some laughs) in this

5710192,5,B00CAYSITY,Love the cast! Love the show! I love that I am able to view this since I couldn't make it to PaleyFest this year!,1371340800,,113,3.75
5710193,5,B00CAYSITY,i loved it. it was good to know what happened and how everything got created. it was also very funny.,1368921600,3,101,4.1

5710208,5,B00CAYSITY,"Great behind-the-scenes information, even if some of the actors get scant screen time -- and some of them aren't on the panel at all.",1425340800,,133,4.583333333333333
5710209,5,B00CAYSITY,"While I agree with everyone who enjoyed this video that the cast is absolutely hilarious and entertaining, I have to say that a lot has to do with the interviewer, Tim Stack.  If you watch American Horror Story's next Paleyfest interview, the interviewer really sucks on that one (she asks stupid and uninteresting questions) and as much as the cast consists of a lot of the same people, they aren't quite as funny as this one was.  I love this show, and have faithfully watched it every season.  If you like strange horror, you'll like this series...definitely.",1424390400,,562,4.77319587628866
5710210,4,B00CAYSITY,"The cast and creators were great panelists, very informative and funny, and I would have given this 5 stars but for the host, who was HORRIBLE! He spent most of the time saying ""like"", giggling, and asking juvenile questions. Glad they didn't use him again for the Asylum panel.",1423440000,,278,4.6938775510204085
5710211,5,B00CAYSITY,Loved the backstories of the actors and the insights into the making of this (my favorite) show!,1418256000,,96,4.705882352941177
5710212,2,B00CAYSITY,More appropriate for a day-time talk show interview.  Not really much about the show.,1417219200,,85,5.071428571428571

5710238,5,B00CAYSITY,"It has been a long time since I set on the edge of my seat waiting anxiously for the next episode of a TV series!  I was totally enthralled by each of the American Horror Story series.  I did not watch them during normal TV show times so I did not have to endure the network commercials which only heightened my anticipation to watch each episode and often found myself in the wee hours of the morning making myself stop after an episode or two or three.  Bravo!!  Really grew to love all the cast members and was so pleased to see them in each of their roles!  I am and always will be a fan and look forward to seeing them in other roles!  Truly Bravo to the writers, producers and directors of this series!  Excellent!!",1399766400,,721,4.218978102189781
5710239,5,B00CAYSITY,"this show is just beyond amazing and i loved seeing jessica lange and other people.  this is really funny
and cool",1397347200,,114,4.428571428571429
5710240,4,B00CAYSITY,"Cast coo nets are riveting, but the interviewer was awful, and the whole thing moved too slow, but the cast kept it interesting!!",1391904000,,129,4.6521739130434785

5710242,5,B00CAYSITY,"Awesome, funny, and interesting to hear from the cast and crew.  I had to watch the entire first season all over again after watching this.  I just HAD to.",1390953600,,155,4.310344827586207
5710243,5,B00CAYSITY,"I've never been a tv series fan, but this one got me hooked. I thought the first episode was only one...didn't realize I had to tune in the following week. But luckily, there was a season ender!!!",1390953600,,196,4.324324324324325
5710244,5,B00CAYSITY,I love American Horror Story and I really like watching the Paleyfest after the season.  I am thinking about buying the whole season for the extra's on the DVD.,1390867200,,160,4.517241379310345
5710245,3,B00CAYSITY,Some of the actresses didn't get to say hardly anything. That was unfair and a waste of their time. The questions and answers weren't that great. The interview was awkward sometimes. I felt bad for Dylan. The chair was too small for his tall frame. I guess the best part for me was seeing the actors as themselves sharing how they felt about making American Horror Story.,1390176000,2,371,4.552238805970149
5710246,4,B00CAYSITY,This was a fun and informative video about the making of a cool series! I recommend it to any American Horror Story fan.,1389916800,,120,4.260869565217392

Jessica Lang amazing. LOVE IT",1389398400,,105,4.0476190476190474
5710248,3,B00CAYSITY,I tried to watch this via my Prime and it kept stalling and wouldn't play. I watched the one for the next season and it played fine.,1389312000,,132,3.925925925925926
5710249,4,B00CAYSITY,"I usually don't care one way or the other about this kind of stuff, but when I do watch it, I find it rather fascinating. You get to see how the actors really are and you get a sense of their real personalities.  The look of ""shock""/""embarrassment"" on Dylan McDermott's face when Jessica Lange answers a question about being a the mother she was on the show vs. a mother in real life was rather funny.  She was SO un PC and he knew it...I winced when she said it so it was funny to see him do it too.  Dylan seems  arrogant when he comes out and sits down...almost like he didn't want to be there, but when he answers the questions, you just realize, Oh, he just has a dry yet funny sense of humor when he responds...almost like Chandler Bing from friends...you know, quick witted one liners that are full of sarcasm yet so funny how they come out.  I liked it so much I watched the one from the 2nd season too.",1389225600,3,911,4.153409090909091
5710250,4,B00CAYSITY,As a fan of the show I loved finding out more details about how certain scenes came about. I can't believe these are the producers og Glee which I have never watched. What's up with the 4th kid though???,1389052800,,203,4.230769230769231
5710251,3,B00CAYSITY,Love the show and cast but this dvd was kind boring to watch. Don't think the host did a good job.,1386720000,,98,3.7142857142857144
5710252,5,B00CAYSITY,"The cast was funny, the stories enlightening and a surprise appearance in the crowd of RuPaul's Drag Race contestant Detox as a second Constance!",1385683200,3,145,5.083333333333333
8579409,5,B00CAYSITY,"So glad I was given the chance to watch this panel! Big fan of the show and being able to see a good portion of the main cast as well as the directors and producers giving their insight on the development made it splendid. Great job to the presenter for being so laid back and witty. With his funny banter he was able to make the entire cast and audience laugh and have a good time. Was laughing at alot of the answers the cast was giving and with that you can really tell that they work like a charm together. I highly recommend anyone who is a fan of this show, especially the first season to sit back and enjoy this panel. Very insightful as well entertaining.",1481155200,,663,4.1875
