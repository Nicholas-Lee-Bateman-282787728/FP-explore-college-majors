1095540,2,6305958092,"Facing old maid-hood at the ripe age of 22, young and fair Emily (Georgina  Cates) is introduced to the black-suited, Latin-spouting bookworm Cedric  Trilling (Robert Portal), a friend of her brother Edward (Samuel West).  When sparks fail to fly (and Cedric is such a priss you'll wonder if he  would rather be with Edward) the matriarch of the family, Aunt Agnes  (Prunella Scales) packs everyone up for a holiday in Italy. Believing that  a piece of England should always be with them, they also pack up the lawn  and employ local ""scum of the earth"" handyman George (Sean  Pertwee) to lug it, and a multitude of luggage, around.
Stiff Upper  Lips, on the whole, is a funny, but not hysterical, take on English period  piece movies. It is slow paced.",969062400,2,753,4.723076923076923

1095693,5,6305958092,"I recently purchased the DVD Stiff Upper Lips from Amazon, having not been able to find it in shops in New Zealand. We were delighted. We saw this movie in Australia many years ago and we laughed and laughed but after it finished we did not take note of the name. Since then we had been trying to find the name, and when we finally did recently we set about finding it. To our disappointment nobody stocked it in New Zealand. So we turned to Amazon and found it.

We had never used Amazon before but were delighted with how easy it was to order, and delighted with the promptness in which it arrived. We have watched and enjoyed it again and plan winter nights with friends watching it again and again and again.

Thankyou Amazon.",1300320000,,730,4.360294117647059

1095695,1,6305958092,"There are three problems.  This may be why used versions are offered here for such a steep discount. Steep enough to have the purchase price 1/3 of the shipping cost.

1.  You have to sit through advertisements for other releases by this commpany without the option of skipping or fast forwarding through them.

2.  The presentation is slow and dragging caused mostly by repeating the same thing with minor variations.  This could easily have been shortened to one hour or even half an hour.

3.  The characters who are upper crust Brits are played as if they were extremely stupid.  Not stupid in the lovable Wooster of Jeeves and Wooster sense, not in the satire and social comment Monty Python sense, but everyday stupid. One example is thinking that squeezing down a woman's waist will enlarge her breasts.",1273881600,,810,4.811594202898551
1095696,5,6305958092,"British humour...
Do I need to say more??
Brits making fun of Brits...and everyone else with it. So you just can't go wrong there.
This movie is witty and clever with the most appropriate title "" Stiff Upper Lip"". I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good laugh.
It is sort of naughty yet not rude. All ages and groups will enjoy watching it but I would not recommend it for the ""under 15's"" as there are sexy remarks and a few innocently naughty scenes(Kamasutra illustrations style).
But anyone above that will have a great chuckle.
It portraits well and with huge amounts of humour how the big majority of us sees the British aristocracy.
All of the characters are likeable in their own ways (eventhough some of them are not ""out of the closet"" yet)...
I feel this is one of those movies you just gotta watch more than once as there is a lot of clever and surprising plays on words...

1095697,5,6305958092,"This movie has received mixed reviews. My take on it is that if you enjoy Masterpiece Theater AND you are a fan of the Zucker brothers, this movie is your cup of tea.

I had taped this when it originally aired on PBS. Last year my wife accidentally erased part of the tape and has been be-moaning ever since, so I got her the dvd for Christmas. I was expecting the picture quality of the dvd to be much better than the tape but it seems to be about the same, okay but not great.",1231632000,,478,4.031578947368421
1095698,4,6305958092,"""I'm a beautiful, young virgin in Italy. I want my sexual awakening and I want it now!""

So says Emily (Georgina Cates) shortly after arriving in Italy in this parody of veddy British films, particularly those of Merchant and Ivory. Along for the journey is Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales), Emily's near-imbecile brother Edward (Samuel West), Edward's college mate Cedric (Robert Portal), and the hapless servant George (Sean Pertwee). Oh, and if you didn't pick up the Merchant-Ivory connection right away, the writer gave the surname ""Ivory"" to Emily and her family.

Poor Emily. At the scandalous age of 22 she remains unmarried and Aunt Agnes is having none of it. Enter the insufferable Cedric who is fond of citing the poet Homer and is given to criticizing everything and everyone. Naturally Aunt Agnes is willing to overlook Cedric's eccentricities, but Emily is less than thrilled. Enter lower class worker George. George rescues Emily from drowning and is rewarded by being insulted, then forced to go to Italy as a servant.

It is in Italy where Emily's desires begin to blossom in a most alarming manner. Without giving anything away, there is a scene where Emily drinks from a fountain that manages to be vulgar and funny at the same time. Later, after Emily's hilarious attempt to seduce Cedric, she begins to cast her eye upon the luckless George. Believing that Emily is carrying his child, George begins to woo her, but Emily resists his charms.

Finally, in India at the tea plantation of Horace (Peter Ustinov), even Aunt Agnes succumbs to passion. The heat and passion seems to create a certain amount of ""special feelings"" in Edward and George as well. But it is in India where the heavy arm of the aristocracy puts George firmly in his place - how dare he aspire to marry above his station! His kangaroo court trial is very amusing. Naturally all is not resolved so easily and the pieces fall into place when the entourage, including Horace, return to England.

While there are some clever lines and laughs, too often the creators decided to throw in as many jokes, both verbal and visual, as possible in a single scene, hoping perhaps that at least one of them would stick. The film also suffers from less than smooth editing (cutting away from a visual joke too quickly for example) and the script often relies on less than stellar (read: tired) jokes.  It's too bad the writers and director didn't simply mine the rich material of the Merchant-Ivory legacy more thoroughly instead of throwing out verbal and visual jokes that seemed to be recycled from older comedy films.

The cast is almost perfect. Special mention must go to Robert Portal's portrayal of Cedric and Georgina Cates' portrayal of Emily. Samuel West does a great job of playing the buffoon and thank god for Prunella Scale's Aunt Agnes because she keeps the film anchored with her flawless performance. Peter Ustinov's role is rather small, but he hams it up shamelessly whenever he is in front of the camera.

A few points of trivia: Prunella Scales of ""Fawlty Towers"" fame is the real life mother of Samuel West who plays her nephew Edward. And West, in a mild case of biting the hand that feeds, played Leonard Bast in the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of ""Howard's End.""",1203638400,,3259,4.827956989247312
1095699,4,6305958092,"This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time.  It is broad -- very broad -- satire of the British Upper Class in 1908.  It has the barest of plots but that doesn't detract from the movie because it was never intended to be anything other than what it is -- an exaggerated view of the British Aristocracy.  While the dialog is clever much of the humor occurs in the background or in the visuals so the viewer really must pay attention to the details.  For example the pub where the lower classes hang out in England is called ""Scum of the Earth"" but the bar in Italy where the manservant goes is called ""Scuma del Tierra"".  There are many anachronisms -- mostly in the idioms but there is a phonograph and a LP record.  Plus one of the funniest scenes is the water fountain in Italy -- the penis is circumcised which was not characteristic of Romans or even current Europeans.  The director uses a great deal of misdirection and double entendre and one of the best examples is the scene where the boys are fanning themselves and talking about their ""strange feelings"".

The movie gets off to a great start as we watch the boys ignore the conductor who is asking them to pay for their tickets.  This refusal to acknowledge that the working class even exists sets the tone for the entire movie, which is hysterically funny, especially if you have any knowledge of how the British Upper Class acted at the turn of the century.  Peter Ustinov has a small part which he walks through but the entire film is classic British and great satire.

I only gave the film 4 stars because it is such a fluffy piece that will never win any awards, but if you just want some good hard laughs watch this film.  Watch carefully because much of the humor is in the expressions or in the background.",1190764800,,1806,4.374251497005988
1095780,5,6305958092,"This is a wonderful light-hearted satire of Merchant Ivory films.  I love them and I loved it. The sparks between 22 year old Emily, who is being pressured to marry, and George, a representative of ""the scum of the earth"" carry the movie well, as does the romance between aunt agnes and cedric's uncle.  Prunella Scales is so unlike her character in Fawlty Towers you need the credits to prove to yourself that she is the same actress.  The characters are convincing if extreme.",1173744000,2,478,4.666666666666667
1095781,5,6305958092,"We saw this movie for the first time on PBS and thought it was hysterical. It's only one of two movies that he can watch over and over again.  It's also the only movie he can watch and not fall asleep.  It's a little racy, but that's why it's so funny.  The whole stoic, staid British never show emotion; makes the movie great.  The main reason they go to Italy and India isn't to marry off Emily or prevent her association with George, but because they're driving the butler crazy!!",1158278400,5,483,4.333333333333333
1095782,5,6305958092,"Given the mixed reviews I read on the Amazon website about this one, I wasn't sure if it would be any good. Fortunately, though, I was pleasantly, nay, SIDE-SPLITTINGLY surprised! It was brilliant!

Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a parody of Merchant Ivory movies. It also pays extensive homage to Ken Russell's brilliant 'Lady Chatterley' as well, not to mention having a bit of a dig at Jane Eyre/Sense and Sensibility/et al.

You don't have to be a huge Merchant Ivory fan to like this, although it probably helps. Even though the last time I saw a Merchant Ivory movie was many years ago, I still got all the jokes in this. And even my boyfriend, who has never watched anything in the Merchant Ivory genre and probably never will, was falling about laughing. Some jokes are subtle, some are over the top and bawdy, but all are hilarious.

Prunella Scales and Peter Ustinov, two veteran actors at the top of their game, are absolutely wonderful in this, as are the rest of the cast.

Thoroughly recommended!",1106438400,13,1022,4.661111111111111
1095783,3,6305958092,"There are some undeniably funny moments in this spoof of Merchant Ivory's lush literary films such as ""A Room with a View"" and ""A Passage to India."" Indeed, it was a genre that was ripe for a good parody. Peter Ustinov is especially funny as an English imperialist in India, who needs to sit on hunks of British lawn while he has tea. However, I found this movie to be so crammed with sex jokes that it bordered on the peurile. Certainly the sexual repression of the proper English movies was a good target for comedy, but I think this film goes a little overboard with its endless sex jokes until one wonders whether the writers have more than one string to their violin.",1020297600,6,672,4.42741935483871

1095789,3,6305958092,"You've got to hand it to the producers and writers; in living up to the claim that there wasn't a parody of Merchant/Ivory films ""..until now!"" they've picked up the wit, the repressed feelings, overly romanticised locations and the achingly fierce British class war. Now if only they could have done it a little bit better.
The cast does a fairly good job, but that only covers so much ground, and the third act of the film suffers when you realise that they've run out of things to spoof.
The humour ranges between the urbane and the lewd, but then what are you watching it for? My wife and I laughed quite a bit, and it has a healthy amount of quotable phrases, which says a lot more than some other films out there.
All in all, its a cute diversion.",974678400,12,753,4.347517730496454

It is a wonderful send up of ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Howard's End"" - Loved the Pubs for working class peasants called ""Scum of the Earth""  in England, and ""Suma de Terra"" in Italy. The audacity and insular behaviour of the English Upper Class is sent up most amusingly. George (the handsome lowly serf) was a dish but didn't relish his father's cuisine of boiled cabbage and root vegetables.
