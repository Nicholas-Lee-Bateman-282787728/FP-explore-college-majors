It was shot and released right before Shaw Brothers shut down their kung-fu movie studio.  Hardly any of the actors are familiar faces from Shaw Brothers classics, except for Kara Hui who has a small part.  Because audiences were losing interest in Shaw Brothers movies, the studio inserted plenty of pointless nudity.  This movie is like a poorly acted softcore version of an episode from the old TV series, Hercules or Xena the Warrior Princess.  Don't waste your time.",1463788800,,586,4.696078431372549

8282659,1,B001BCUB8W,"One of the last films produced from the Shaw Brothers era. Loads of T&A in early scenes , not much else to talk about after that. Fair to no action in this, and the ending is very disappointing. Buy if you a hardcore SB fan and want to own all the U.S. releases, other than that this film is very skip worthy.",1415577600,,309,4.0
8282660,2,B001BCUB8W,"I saw that Shaw Brother had made this film and thought oh wow a new Shaw Brothers film, well it's not what I have become use to when watching the old SB movies. The film was just lame plain and simple.",1282262400,3,201,3.926829268292683
8282661,5,B001BCUB8W,"Made by Shaw Bros in 1984,in 1.85 Widescreen Ratio,not ShawScope.

 Great story ,unexpected endings

  The story about a princess,they are trying to capture,Its one long chase. Terrific scenery,not studio bound like the early ShawScope films.

 Beautiful Quality,though not 16.9,but still looks beautiful on my 46inch Plasma.

Highly Recommended",1240272000,,345,6.041666666666667
