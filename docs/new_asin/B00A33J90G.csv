5380826,5,B00A33J90G,"The story line was created by Paul Henreid to be written by somebody else, and then he produced it and starred in it. It's lots of fun, once you get used to the idea that Paul Henreid, the suave intellectual and lover, can swashbuckle with the rest of them. The movie moves right along with swordplay, pistol duels, men thrown overboard, and general derring-do by all hands; costumes are elegant, humor is broad, ladies are spirited, and it certainly looks as if everybody enjoyed themselves. This fresh re-issue from Warner Brothers is brightened up and has its opening credits. Now that it's re-issued as it deserves, you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",1370044800,8,653,4.7368421052631575
5380827,5,B00A33J90G,I've always loved this movie and was so pleased to find it here on Amazon. I got to play it for my kids and husband who had not seen it yet. Everyone loved it! If you love Maureen O'Hara or Paul Henreid then you will love this movie. It brings out the best of both of them.,1369785600,2,273,3.807017543859649
5380828,5,B00A33J90G,Maureen O'Hara is young and beautiful and Walter Slezak plays a good job as a bad guy.......but I have to admit I like Paul Henreid in blond curls...or anything else.  Just a little fairy tale fun for a Saturday matinee.,1368835200,,220,4.5
5380829,5,B00A33J90G,"I'm very fond of ""The Spanish Main"".  It often doesn't elicit enthusiastic reviews, but I think it's among the best swashbucklers.  Paul Henreid is better than he's usually given credit for -- an able lead.  Maureen O'Hara is her typical spitfire leading lady.  Yet Walter Slezak steals the picture with his utterly delightful villain, delivering really funny comments whenever he's on screen.

It's nice to finally have a good print released (if on expensive WB Archive Collection DVD-R).  The picture and sound are generally fine, and the story is a rousing, action-filled, humorous, romantic, and gorgeously-costumed adventure.",1365984000,17,630,5.443298969072165
5380830,5,B00A33J90G,"For all fans of Maureen O'Hara, this one is a must for your collection. It was near the beginning of her career and she was at her top and never came down. Great adventure and also a fine performance of 1940s star Paul Heinreid.",1364169600,4,228,4.204545454545454

5380835,5,B00A33J90G,"From 1945 we get such an entertaining and fun old time swashbuckling tale where every swash is well and truly buckled. Paul Henreid is the Captain of a Belgian vessel with people going to the new world to colonize the Carolinas until a storm blows them off course to the Spanish main, those diabolical people put them into slavery and prisons until he escapes and lives the life of a pirate, The Barracuda, in his travels he meets and falls for Maureen O'Hara who is to be the governor's wife and he is the guy who imprisoned him, even sweeter vengeance played by Walter Slezak. Such a wonderful movie and if you don't find yourself smiling through the whole thing, you must have lockjaw. Lots of big ships doing battle, lots of swordplay and lot of other good stuff.",1477008000,,767,4.525179856115108

5380843,3,B00A33J90G,"Standard adventure fare, but Paul Henreid, Binnie Barnes and, particularly, Maureen OHara make this mediocre effort worth watching. Maureen OHaras beauty and dominance of every scene make her the deserved focus of this movie. Recommended.",1465084800,,238,5.828571428571428

5380856,5,B00A33J90G,Very good movie and Maureen O'Hara was wonderful with her humor and looks! They don't make them like that any more as Hollywood's A list of actresses doesn't compare to the glamor and quality of Maureen O'Hara. Paul Henreid did a wonderful job as the leading man and played off of O'Hara so very well. Must see movie for those that appreciate quality.,1435881600,,351,4.587301587301587

This is a great swashbuckler - Paul Henreid was a great Errol Flynn alternative and Maureen O'Hara flawlessly beautiful, but the picture quality was so poor (even playing the DVD on my Blu-Ray player), I have no interest in watching it again.  Wait until TCM shows it and record on your DVR for a much better copy of a great movie.",1433635200,,490,4.411111111111111

I couldn't wait to see it again!  In COLOR!  (Neither of us had color sets then either.)  Well....it wasn't the same.  Gosh, it was only 50+ years ago..but very tame. It is standard fare; the villain very evil, and a fun romp.  Don't expect anything deep or surprising.  Hero defeats the bad guys and gets the girl.  (I wouldn't watch it every day for a week now...

5380862,4,B00A33J90G,"There are very few good swashbucklers. This is one of the best, joining the ranks of Captain Blood, Mark of Zorro, The Sea Hawk, The Black Swan and of course The Adventures of Robin Hood.

Lots of great sword play and engaging plot. Good old fashioned positive view of why someone would turn pirate, and the good vs bad pirates against corrupt Spanish Governor in Caribbean. Well done, fun movie.",1411257600,,372,5.016129032258065

5380869,5,B00A33J90G,This has to be one of the best swash buckling movies ever made. And in technicolor Maureen O'Hara is nothing less than stunning. Her chemistry with Paul Henreid is as red as her hair.,1405468800,,183,4.411764705882353

The quality was OK but there were actually a few parts cut out from the movies.  This version has the complete movie and the picture quality is excellent.  Paul Henreid and Maureen O'Hara are great in the movie but I can't think of anyone who could play the Viceroy any better than Walter Slezak.  This is a true classic.",1402790400,,465,4.2988505747126435

5380875,5,B00A33J90G,"And the only one I found with Anne Bonny mentioned and seen, alone with Maureen O'Hara. This is also another great pirate movie with action, adventure, and most of all the romancing of Ladies.",1390176000,,192,4.676470588235294

The story isn't original: Honest man driven to do bad things by a powerful Governor. However it is happily what I expected, A Swashbuckling Good Time! Paul Henreid and Maureen O'Hara made a good pair. Their acting ability & others helped elevate the plot.

5380883,5,B00A33J90G,"Paul Henreid was getting a bit tired of playing in a bunch of gloomy (though mostly great) films over at Warner's. He went to head of production Jack Warner with the idea for a pirate picture. Jack Warner told him in no uncertain terms; ""Look, when I want a lover, I'll take you. When I want a pirate, I'll get Errol Flynn!"" So Henreid left Warner's and went to RKO who loved the idea, and assigned a scriptwriter. Henreid hated the first draft so much that he threatened to leave so to keep him on RKO hired Herman Mankiewicz to re-write it. The movie made $14 million and kept the studio above water. It's a fun movie, worthy of your attention. Henreid, Maureen O'Hara and Walter Slezak as the bad guy are all excellent. Get this movie if you like classic Technicolor extravaganzas.",1373500800,17,784,4.489510489510489
