5615913,2,B00BG4RM9G,"For me, about 10 minutes into the movie, the audio went from English to Japanese. It was like I changed any of my settings. It did it by itself. I love the movie, but whoever put this all together did a s*** job",1422835200,,211,3.9302325581395348

5615917,4,B00BG4RM9G,I picked this up at walmart and watched all 3 movies. They aren't the best of choices but 2 free movies. The godzilla vs biollante blu ray is out of print so this is your last resort.,1401062400,,183,3.972972972972973
5615918,1,B00BG4RM9G,"You're better off buying the earlier single-movie Blu-Ray of GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE than this 3-movie set here, because Echo Bridge deleted all the extra content off of BIOLLANTE on this 3-movie edition.  All you get in this 3-movie set is the film with an English dub track.  That's it!  The earlier single-movie release had the English dub as well as the two original Japanese DTS audio options, one in 5.1 and the other 2.0. It also had 3 subtitle options, two for the Japanese audio (one exact on-screen text, the other translation), and also English subtitles for the English audio.  There were also two extras: ""Making of Godzilla vs. Biollante"" and ""Behind the Design"".  All of that is GONE from the 3-movie version.  So, you lose all that and instead get two ultra-crappy SyFy Channel movies that they say are ""FREE"", but they aren't because you are paying more for the 3-movie set than the earlier edition cost, and you are getting LESS on the movie you bought it for to begin with.  If you want two SyFy Channel movies, I think you can buy both the ones on this set for a $1, if that.

BIOLLANTE is a terrific mid period Godzilla flick and even if you like the English dub, you should also check out the original Japanese language version with English subtitles - but that's only on the single-movie Blu-Ray, not the 3-movie release here.",1395187200,19,1348,4.6344537815126055
5615919,4,B00BG4RM9G,"This did not disappoint, though I really wish they would let us turn off subtitles. Thankfully, not all of the dialogue features it.",1394668800,,132,4.782608695652174
5615920,4,B00BG4RM9G,"its a bare bones blu-ray the package I own is one disc 3 movies no extras. The single movie has more sound options. I bought this because I wanted  one of the other movies too and this is the only way to get either of the bonus movies on blu -ray and I like multi packs because they take less space in my collection. It would have been nicer if the spine of the cover looked as nice as the single version of this Godzilla movie just list the extras on the front. Mine does not have the dvd just the blu ray. It appears there is 3 different ways they packaged this Godzilla movie.the one pictured here ,the 2 disc that has both dvd and blueray and the 3rd is the Godzilla movie by itself.",1385078400,3,687,4.051470588235294

8567937,5,B00BG4RM9G,The full Biolante movie is one of the better Godzilla movies of this era.  Still haven't watched the other two.  Havn't watched any of the Sharknado's yet either though I hear they are a hoot.,1510963200,,192,4.457142857142857
8567938,5,B00BG4RM9G,perfect and fast shipping!,1509667200,,26,5.75
8567939,4,B00BG4RM9G,Godzilla Vs. Biollante is great. Classic Godzilla doing its thang. I have not watched either of the other two movies though I am sure I will at some point.,1495584000,,155,4.379310344827586

8567942,2,B00BG4RM9G,"I'm pretty sure this is not a proper transfer from the original negative, or even a good scan of a print. It looks like they took the same materials used to make a dvd and just put it on a blu-ray. There is normally an obvious improvement in picture sharpness, and I don't see it here. I got the version with the two additional films - I don't know if the other blu-ray released by Lions Gate looks the same. I would suggest not buying this version and looking for an authentic blu-ray version.",1475712000,,494,4.26595744680851
8567943,2,B00BG4RM9G,"I was disappointed to find that this didn't include a Japanese audio track with subtitles. Otherwise this is one of my favorite Godzilla movies. Biollante is a great design. Also this movie has been out of print until recently, and you were only able to get it on used VHS tapes. So I guess that's better than nothing.",1458000000,,318,4.5
