7824391,5,6302342104,"Being of German decent, I am almost required to see Wagner. But I have not. Will withold my comments till I have seen it all. What bothers me are the comments of the people that probably have NEVER stood on stage or sang in public, but they reserve the right to judge. What is THEIR background in classics ? I do not perform on stage. I am an Architect, specializing in the craft of monument restoration, i.e. creations by people that lived 1000, 2000, 3000 years ago. It makes you extreme humble, standing in front of these creations, like certain buildings like the Colosseum, the Pyramids, the hanging gardens,
the acropolis etc. etc. I think the same goes for stage performances of the classics. See them, enjoy them. Think you could do better ??? You want me to give a star rating. What kind of system is this ? I have NOT seen it, did I NOT tell you ?
I will give it a 5 star rating, just because I think Wagner deserves it, Basta !",1393977600,,938,4.305084745762712

7824393,5,6302342104,"I have to disagree strongly with Khan in his 2000 review.  The performance (which I have seen live in New York four times) is remarkable in every way, and if you really want to hear every note Wagner wrote (read that as I followed the score while watching the video), THIS is the video to have. Regarding Khan's review, this is the Metropolitan Opera, NOT the NY Philharmonic.  Secondly, Wagner is NOT Sturm und Drang.  This designation is given to the Classical period of German lierature, NOT the Late Romantic period in music.  I would find this reviewer more credible if he knew what he was talking about, but clearly he doesn't....",1012003200,2,636,4.651785714285714
7824394,3,6302342104,"This is the fourth and final opera in Wagner's  ""Ring"" series which revolves aroung the golden ring of the Nibelung____supposedly a source of ultimate world power . I found this effort by the NY philharmonic under James Levine rather stilted and leaden . Hildegard Behrens gives a competent performance but has hardly the true ""Nordic"" looks to give that extra oomph to the ambience of the opera____one can only wish that some day Brunnhilde will be played by a true nordic beauty (a Caudia Schiffer lookalike will be perfect!) with a voice to match . Siegfried Jerusalem's Siegfried is ineffectual and anemic. The only actor who excells in his role is Matti Salminen : his Hagen is perfect .The set design is o.k but the final self-immolation scene of Brunnhilde is laughable ___just a series of firecrackers and cheap lightening ! Hardly the stuff of Wagnerian Sturm und drang .",974246400,2,880,4.866666666666666
7824395,4,6302342104,"Just to set the record absolutely straight, the rest of the cast, apart from the three principals whose names are mentioned elsewhere, are as follows:  Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Alberich, Hanna Lisowska as Gutrune,  Christa Ludwig as Waltraute; Gweneth Bean, Joyce Castle and Andrea Gruber  as the First, Second and Third Norns; and Kaaren  Erickson, Diane Kesling  and Meredith Parsons as Woglinde, Wellgunde and Flosshilde.
Opinion is  sharply divided among other reviewers of the merits of the performances of  Hildegard Behrens and Siegfried Jerusalem.  My own personal opinion is that  she acted the role very well but was a little lacking in power.  She  sounded better in the same role at the Bayreuth 1976 Ring under Georg Solti  due in part to the more favourable balancing of the large orchestra.  In my  view only a Heldensoprano with a huge voice - such as Nilsson - can really  be heard to good advantage in an opera house with an open orchestra pit.  In spite of that, I enjoyed her interpretation, I found it had some of the  same ""feminine""/weibliche qualities as did that of Gwyneth Jones  under Boulez, but with more accurate and reliable intonation.  Siegfried  Jerusalem's performance was again well acted but the vocal quality was  debatable; to me he sounded fresher than Manfred Jung as Siegfried under  Boulez, but still was not very lyrical.  The best I have heard in modern  stereo - again a personal choice only - would be Alberto Remedios under  Goodall (sung in English).  It would also be interesting to hear Ben  Heppner or Placido Domingo in that role, I think they both have the  potential to outsing Jerusalem. I wholeheartedly concur with earlier  favourable comments about Matti Salminen as Hagen, one of the greatest  roles Wagner ever created. The rest of the cast is effective, notably  Ludwig.  I enjoyed Levine's reading of the score and he keeps a brisk but  unforced tempo.  The playing is excellent.
Speacial kudos to Gunther  Schneider-Siemssen, the set and projection designer.  This work looked very  convincing in a traditional manner, and the whole Immolation Scene looked  very impressive indeed.  The overall sound quality was excellent. Total  playing time was 4 hours and 41 minutes.",955238400,8,2232,5.024725274725275
7824396,5,6302342104,I was offended by that cheap stab at Siegfried Jerusalem that the other reviewer felt compelled to throw in his otherwise fine comments. Mr. Jerusalemis a fine heldentenor and a wonderful actor. Nowhere in this preformance does he not give it his all; and if he makes mistakes it must be remembered that this is a LIVE PERFORMANCE so not everything is going to go according to plan. It's hard enough to get anyone who can look half-way decent and can sing the role well. So all in all Siegfried Jerusalem is a fine tenor.,938476800,3,521,4.494736842105263
