8062067,5,B0009JN71G,"See my other review on this series as I highly recommend it!

As a black belt instructor in this system, I recommend the student start with the snake then progress to Crane.

It is geared toward a taller, lean / lanky body type.

Grace and balance combined with effective self defense, exercise and a beautifull form can be learned in this tape.
Traditonal kung fu at it's best!",1233360000,2,378,4.529411764705882
