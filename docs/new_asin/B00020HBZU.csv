2052646,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain: does the title alone, by any chance, mean that the wolves are crying for some reason?  To tell you the truth, the show makes me want to cry.  The way to describe Wolf's Rain is ""Stand By Me"" hosing it down with ""Balto"" to the R-rated capacity with a hint of ""Animorphs"".  These descriptions didn't get to me at first, but there were other reasons why I think this anime is so involving.  Sure, ""Last Exile"" may have the stunning technical art design and ""Witch Hunter Robin"" has a complex storyline with a lovable main character, but this is one of those rare animes that, for lack of a practical term, has heart and soul.
The story takes place in a hostile future, where the people in urban-lifestyles believe that wolves were at the existent level as the Dodos for 200 years.  Not exactly.  Kiba, Hige, Tsume, and Toboe are few of the wolves that are still among the living, but in human incognito.  Kiba couldn't stand to be amongst human beings, so later when he joins the other three wolves, respectfully, he followed his nose to the flower scent as the wolves drift into the open cold field to find their eden, their ""Paradise"".  But later, when they found and join the flower girl Cheza to go along on their search, their one-way road trip would experience some pot holes on their way, such as a mysterious syndicate run by Darcia, army corps, and a hunter with his trusty dog whose job is to exterminated these ""devils"", as he calls them.
Characterization is the one thing I like so much about Wolf's Rain.  The wolves each have their own personality: Kiba is the serious, ambitious type; Hige is the laid-back, class clown of the group; Tsume is the type that doesn't care much about anything; and young Toboe is the naive type that see Tsume as his idol, as he sees him like an older brother.  Though what they are makes them distant to each other, as they travel to find Paradise, they learn how important it is to depend on each other to survive, and builds up on an interesting companionship which helps them build self-confidence and trust, which I think is what relates to the movie ""Stand By Me.""  While there were other characters that also play important roles to this series, Cheza is the one character that really got me looking on the greener side of the grass.  She was this angelic, calm force of nature(and literally, she IS part of nature), and she did her best to support and care for these wolves as if she was a mother to them, and I normally don't say this kind of optimism to any female anime character.  Now don't worry, this anime isn't all about one endless conversation after another, episode by episode.  Wolf's Rain has plenty of action to go well with its drama.
Did I mentioned that the people that made ""Cowboy Bebop"" also took part in making Wolf's Rain?  With CB's Character Designer, Producer, and Composer involved in this anime's production, these people alone are enough to convince fans to watch it.  And if it wasn't for them, Wolf's Rain wouldn't have such a wonderful constructive art design with the use of colors that add the mood to the environment and stunning wolf designs, and an eloquent musical score to top of the emotion scale.  I manage to check out the first episode dubbed, and surprisingly, Bandai did right with the casting.  Johnny Yong Bosch as Kiba, Crispin Freeman as Tsume, Joshua Seth as Hige, the English actors were on key to their Japanese counterpart.  I was skeptical when FLCL Haruko's Kari Wahlgren is going to play as the more serious Cher Degre, but after checking her vocal performance, she actually pulled it off.  When Cowboy Bebop had a great dub cast, expect the same thing here.
When people are going to see this, most are going to ask, ""How can these wolves fool humans to think they are human?""  I asked myself the same question after watching half of the entire series in Japanese.  To me, after thinking about it, I don't think the question was meant to be explained, and I don't mind, because Wolf's Rain has such great qualities to consider it to be one of the best animes around.  It's not just a well-produced anime, it's also very engrossing and rewarding, too.  If you're looking for something atmospheric with heart-warming entertainment in the world of anime, you should not pass this one up.",1082851200,27,4302,4.593464052287581
2052647,5,B00020HBZU,"What can I possibly say about this incredible series that could possibly do it justice?  This is an amazing series that keeps you wanting more.
This english dub of this hit Japanese series features an A-list voice cast, utilizing talents from other popular dubbed anime series such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and Witch Hunter Robin.  Not suggested for younger audiences, Wolf's Rain does contain some violent content, but that is to be expected when watching a serious dramatic piece about wolves.
The soundtrack CD included with this DVD is one of the best I've ever heard.  Listeners will find themselves listening to it over and over again.  Scored by anime music legend Yoko Kanno, Wolf's Rain OST is one of her best works yet!
Destined to be one of the classics of anime, Wolf's Rain delivers in a way that very few other series have.  Every soul I've spoken with whom has seen this series has instantly fallen in love with it.
See you in paradise.",1082505600,20,950,4.698795180722891
2052673,5,B00020HBZU,"A 4.9/5... Looky there! Almost a perfect score, but not quite as good as Cowboy Bebop. A bit of an odd way to start a review of, huh? Yeah, I know. Heh heh. Anyway, off to the review. Wolf's Rain is about a pack of Wolves searching for the flower maiden to lead them to Paradise/Rakuen/Heaven, and along their dramatic adventures, they run into a lot of stuff they definitely wish they hadn't. If you've read the Bible, you'll see something in here taken from the Bible, and that is: when the moon turns red, the earth and all of it's life shall soon perish. Now, wait a second... I should tell you all of the Wolves names, shouldn't I? Kiba, who is the leader; Hige, the follower; Tsume, the aggressive, hard-headed, and seemingly cold one (yet, he is a good hearted wolf/person under all of that); Toboe, the pup; Cheza, the flower maiden, who will take them to Paradise; Blue, a hunter's half wolf/half dog. I also assume I should introduce the other lead characters. Well, who is left? Cher & Hubb, the divorced husband and wife; Quent, the middle aged wolf hunter, as well as Blue's owner, who thinks wolves are evil, because his family was killed by a pack of wolves; Darcia, the evil wolf. Those are really all of the main characters of the story. They are a pack of really interesting and excellent characters. This is about all I can really tell you, and you'll have to find out of the rest for yourself by watching it. All 30 Episodes of Action, Adventure, and Drama easily make this one the greatest Animes, or as I've said before, one of the greatest things, period. If you like Witch Hunter Robin's dark and moody settings, and a kind of Cowboy Bebop & Trigun feel, then I suggest you at least give this Series a try. I'd say give it a try, anyway, but, you may not listen to me, thus, the reason why I told you of what it is a feel like. And when I said ""like Witch Hunter Robin's dark and moody settings,"" I don't mean it's like Witch Hunter Robin, just has the same dark and moody styling. Just telling you that because some people out there will be saying: ""EW! I don't like Witch Hunter Robin at all, so I'm not trying this Anime."" I said it's like Bebop and Trigun, and if you don't like them, and don't wish to give anything else like these Animes a try, then I must say, your loss. As for my age rating for the Series, here it is: 17+/NC-17 (Graphic Violence, Gore, Profanity, and Adult Complex Themes). A word of warning: prepare for major sadness near the end, and at the end of the Series. Thanks for reading my review(s). I'll probably be writing some more reviews soon. God bless.",1133049600,3,2606,4.375257731958763
2052674,5,B00020HBZU,"I have seen almost all anime has to offer, but this is the best. Yoko Kano, the music directer, is one of, if not the, best in the world. The plot gets very in depth. You get to know all the charecters such as Kiba, Toboe, Tsume, Hige, Blue, and Cheza, all in a great depth. No matter how many times I see it, it doesn't get old. But after you see the end to the series you will never look at the charecters the same way. The series takes place in an apacaliptic age, all the world is in turmoil. Only wolves can find paradise, Rakuen. Wolves can create an illusion of a human figure to protect their identity, but some people can see through the disguise such as Nobles. Thats where it all starts. The actual animation is the best, from the detail in the background to the folds in cloths, it is well drawn to boot. This anime is for anyone, men, women, teenagers, pets, anyone over thirteen. This is my utmost recamendation for all of Anime. I recomend seeing it in japanese.",1122940800,,977,4.258064516129032
2052675,5,B00020HBZU,This is one of the best animes I've ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew Cowboy Bebop has now drawn Wolf's Rain. I love the music played in the series that's why they made a CD came along with also a stuff amimal wolf. I wish their was a second season cause I began to love the show.,1117843200,5,305,3.78125
2052676,5,B00020HBZU,"This series truly grabbed me.  It's animation was beautiful, music catchy, and plot engrossing.  I fell in love with Gravity (end title song) immediately.  It was the perfect musical composition that captures the mood of this journey.  The plot and characters were mature enough to capture me (woman in my 30's).  One of the biggest difficulties I find in  viewing anime is that its too adolescent or silly (Ranma ).  I am an original Macross fan (Robotech) who is just returning after fifteen years or so to sample some current Anime. (Yes, Its been a while.)  The last anime that grabbed me was Macross Plus.

I love the concept of wolves who can disguise themselves as human.  I really enjoyed the sub plots of Hubb & Cher and Quint and Blue. The characters are so true to life. Tsume's attitude is perfect for an adolescent street hood.  Alcoholic, Quint's obsession is right on.  Toboe's innocence is wonderful.  Cher's dedication and drive for her career... Hubb and Cher's characters are in opposition to traditional roles of male and female.  This is especially refreshing in  Japanese media!  The fifth episode was well executed, I was just as horrified by the resident wolves working as slave labor as our main characters. Each episode keeps you wanting to see the next.  I couldn't wait to view the next episode, I had to watch the whole disk in one setting.  I was hooked from the start!",1115337600,7,1399,4.734439834024896
2052677,1,B00020HBZU,"With great music and a setting that reminds you of ""Vampire Hunter D"" it sucks you into watching the series.  The plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing.  The animation is good, which is a must have for me, but it wasn't enough to redeem the series.",1111881600,4,344,4.359375
2052678,5,B00020HBZU,"Right off the getgo, I became addicted to Wolf's Rain. I am a fan of the serious, action packed anime shows and this show hit the spot.

The animation is truly wonderful, some of the best I've ever seen, and the plot is full of all sorts of mysteries dealing with Paradise. There is a nice combination of characters in the show. There is one wolf full of pride in what he is, one wolf who doesn't have much of a care in the world except food, another wolf who is too nice, and a wolf with a bad attitude towards everybody. If they don't keep you interested, then the intense action scenes will. Plenty of time is given to the plot and to the action in the first few episodes. The show is well balanced.

The only people who might not like this show would be the light-hearted folk, those who hate dogs, and people who must have lots of humor in their anime. This is the only thing that Wolf's Rain is weak on (or maybe its strength). There are a couple of jokes, but overall the show is very very serious.

It is sure to please anyone, even those who don't like anime.",1110931200,6,1068,4.174757281553398
2052679,5,B00020HBZU,"I have watched a rather hefty slew of anime in my time, and I have to admit, Wolf's Rain is one of the most stunningly beautiful, uniquely imaginative, hysterically funny, and charismatically charming titles I have ever seen. Just as I've grown tired of shonen in which the hero is a wimpy loser with whom magical babes in tiny outfits are inexplicably smitten, I've gotten sick of shoujo in which the characters are so vapidly stupid and the plot is so painfully predictable, you just want to send the disc under a steamroller. Drowning in a sea of stereotypes, I discovered Wolf's Rain-a breath of truly refreshing air to the anime veteran who's grown all too tired of the typical. The incredibly innovative plot begins in a desolate world where wolves have supposedly been extinct for the past 200 years. Enter the temperamental, aloof warrior Tsume, prideful, mysterious Kiba, streetwise and perpetually-hungry Hige, and the adorably innocent, youthful Toboe-four wolves living in disguise among the humans (mainly in the forms of attractive bishonen). Their inevitable meeting occurs when Kiba, in his stubborn wolf form, is captured by a strange organization in his search for `Paradise,' where wolves are prophesized to finally find peace. This small organization is run mainly by scientist Cher Degr, an ambitious woman who has become obsessed with her latest project-Cheza, a mysterious young girl somehow created from Moon Flowers, which are supposedly found plentifully in Paradise. Kiba is freed thanks to some encouragement from the crafty Hige, and all four of the masked wolves find each other once the bitter, consistently drunk wolf hunter Quent comes their way. Soon after, Cheza is kidnapped by a mysterious figure, whose intentions are unknown. In this flurry of madness, these reluctant `friends' agree to leave the city in search of Paradise-and along the way experience an amazing adventure sure to dazzle almost any right-minded anime fan. I hesitate to stop there, but will in favor of space. Its rich substance aside, Wolf's Rain has an irresistibly charming slew of characters-chances are not unlikely you'll fall in love with every single one of them. The first DVD contains 5 episodes, and, as another reviewer said, this is more than enough to get you hooked. I hesitate to compare it to Hellsing simply because it lacks the darkly overt gloom of that series, but Wolf's Rain is indefinitely gritty enough to satisfy any drama/action enthusiast's palette (though it is quite a genre-bender in its own way). With a bountiful number of innovative subplots, exquisite artwork, chilling plot turns and a fantastic voice cast, Wolf's Rain is truly grade-A anime, and a view I could not recommend more.",1106784000,4,2726,5.114349775784754
2052680,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain is an instant classic of story telling in a non-typical manner. The story takes place in a far flung future where humanity has driven the earth to near death. There is a legend that when the earth is ready, paradise will be found. Enter Kiba, a white wolf drawn out of the mountains by the sent of lunar flowers and the visions of finding paradise. He brings pride with him as well and bands together a small pack to search for paradise. They are Hige, Tohboe and Tsume.

The driving force behind them is the lunar flower in the form of a geneitcly created girl named Cheza. She has been dormant for years and now reacts to the presence of Kiba. She had be created by people known as Nobles. They are elitest, rich royals that have be ruling the earth for a few centuries. They are the antagonist of the story and deservedly so.

Other characters in this tale are Cher, a scientist that has been caught up in the studying of Cheza. Hobb, her ex-husband and police officer trying to figure out what went wrong. Quint, an old hunter trying to kill any wolf he finds for retribution of his dead family. And Blue, his dog, or is she a dog.

This is one of the few pure dramatic anime's that do not rely on cheeky humor, as so many others do. Though this has many styling cues that are so familiar with japanese story telling, i.e. over dramatic scenes or poses and somewhat sappy dialog. This anime has a quality that surpasses the small amount of anime elements it has. The art work is stark, beautiful and breath-taking. Action sequences will have to be rewound just to see again and again because of the fluidity of the motion and the technial aspects of the anatomy in motion. This is a true wonder and jewel to behold. As as for being someone that has seen the complete series, my sister and I can attest that it will leave you emotionally drained and deeply statisfied when you get to the end. So only by this if you can get the entire series or else you will be doing yourself an utter injustice. Spread the word.",1106697600,,2028,4.35978835978836
2052681,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain (WR) is about four wolves by the names of Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe who are looking for ""Paradise"" . A place of legend that is said to be revealed when the end of the known world is upon us...But only wolves can find it.

WR is a true rarity among the anime world. It has everything. An intriguing and complex story, amazing characters, and a beautiful music score. WR also has superb secondary characters such as Darcia, Blue, Cher, Hubb, Quent, Jagara, and the beautiful Flower Maiden Cheza.

This particular dvd contains the first five episodes of the series...just enough to get you addicted ^^ . The menus of the dvd are wonderfully done as are the special features.

Trust me! Get this anime! Wolf's Rain is absolutely stunning and I think EVERYONE should see it. In fact, I myself have not seen an anime this beautiful since Vision of Escaflowne and I love it just as much!",1105574400,4,895,4.546583850931677
2052682,5,B00020HBZU,"My attention was first drawn to this series due to it's main focus being on Wolves, one of my favorite creatures. However, the series kept my attention and gained another fan with the deep and enthralling storyline, the intelligent dialogue, and the stunning visuals. And let's not forget the soundtrack!

The story focuses on the four main characters, Tsume, Toboe, Kibe, and Higei, four wolves who have had to disguise themselves as humans due to the fear of wolves, and the mass belief that they have been extinct for the past two hundred years. Kiba in his search for paradise is drawn to the city we see in the first episode because he can smell the scent of the Lunar Flower. We learn that what he is smelling is actually Cheza, the Flower Maiden, whom we learn the tiniest bit about in the first episode. Kiba's appearance shakes things up with Tsume who is used to being the leader around the city, and brings Kiba into a friendship with Higei, a very food/female oriented wolf with a strong sense of smell... Toboe, the innocent of the pack, falls in with Tsume after Tsume happens to save his life... This first disc covers their search for Paradise, and as I don't want to give anything away, I'll leave it at that.

Most anime series leave me with a vague feeling of disappointment or of wanting more. This series really delivers, and I would suggest it to anyone with a love of well-executed animation & anime, or wolves. I really can't sing enough praises about it ^_^.",1105056000,2,1483,4.592452830188679
2052683,5,B00020HBZU,"In a dark apocalyptic world where cities are domed or walled, the is little left except the struggle for existence.  If this is difficult for humans, imagine how it would be for the wolves, their hunting grounds gone, they have come to the worn down cities where they have hidden for 200 years, masquerading as humans, shorn of much of their pride and strength.  To one such place comes Kiba, driven on by his dream of Paradise, a place that only wolves can find, and only when the world begins to end.

His arrival seems to upset a delicate balance he scents the presence of Cheza, whom he calls a 'flower.'  She has been unconscious for years, but Kiba, in his struggle with Tsume, the city's dominant wolf, somehow wakens her.  She is whisked away by a noble, and in the ensuing uproar Kiba, Tsume, the selfish Hige, and young Toboe flee.  The search for Paradise goes on, but the first stop is a city almost as dark as the one they fled.  One where wolves pretend to be work dogs scrabbling for scraps of food.

On first sight this is a bishonen (pretty boy story) with Kiba and Tsume the classic antagonists.  But as the other characters gather about them it becomes clear that, while having roots in this genre, the writers intended something more exceptional.  The human forms, of course, are only illusions that cover their wolf bodies, several of the images are non-traditional, and the characteristic 'posing' is lacking from everyone except Tsume.  This suits Tsume well, since he is the most concerned with his image, using it to mask his true nature.

To a degree the anime reminds me of Saiyuki, especially in its habit of genre busting.  But Wolf's Rain has more continuity between its episodes.  The characters are stronger, better developed, and the tone is much darker.  The do share a level of artistic excellence which it hard to come by in anime, where writers often rely too much on stock situations, and artists pay less attention tp atmospheric effect than they should.

I was surprised how good this set of episodes was.  Too often this series is billed as an ecological sermon and I dislike being preached at.  But the disastrously ruined world is only part of the story, most of which manages to by an extremely believable story of the wolves and their legacy.  Very much worth viewing.",1104192000,21,2313,4.652709359605911

If you're looking for a series that will draw you into it and never let you go, this is the best of the best.  This is the greatest.  It combines suspense and drama so perfectly.

Not to mention, the dialogue is superior, and the music is very good!  The theme song is great, and the credits music is relaxing, and the action music kicks @$$!!

Just in case some wondering parents are reading this, it is bloody near the beginning, there are guns, alcohol consumption, although very little of it.  But, no matter how old you are, this is a story you have to see to believe how great it is and achieve the thrilling experience you get from it!

I've seen the first three volumes and it is a very good romp...the scenes are well-painted the characters well developed without excess exposition. Their actions often say a lot more than their words. One of them says he is antisocial, but then goes and saves the life of his companion - a wonderful way to show a contradictory and complex personality.  All of the characters also have different pasts that are hinted at and only somewhat revealed, so there is still a lot of mystery remaining for the rest of the show.

I'm not going to bother going into what its about since its said up the summery.

The english dubing has an amazing staff that if your a anime fan you'll be sure to recoginse a few of the voices ( Kiba's, Darica, etc.)

The soundtrack done by Yoko Kanno is amazing with tunes that you can stop listining to due to them being catchy and some every emotional. Both soundtracts are worth getting.

This anime is orginaly 26 epsodes long. But due to annyoned fan and such, the creaters went and made four more to sum up making it a total 30 epsodes that have been released in america as one semi-long anime.

The animation is clean and its amazing some of the action seens in it. The plot makes you think and wounder as well as wishing for more at the end of each episode. It keeps you on your toes with twists and turns.

The characters you grow to love, each having a differnt and interseting personality as well as creative look to them.

All in all, graphics, music, voices, story, characters, and length are all top notch and I advise anyone who wants to see a good anime to come and pic this one up and meet us in paradise.",1097971200,4,1254,4.288135593220339

2052700,5,B00020HBZU,"I had heard of Wolf's Rain, but found the concept of having wolve's as main characters rather different. But at the same time I found this VERY ORIGINAL, so I gave this DVD box batch a shot.
In the future, much of the Earth has become a hostile environment, and people now live in Dome style cities. Wolves have been thought to have been extinct for two hundred years, but in fact they've disguised themselves as humans. Kiba, a white wolf, begines a journy to search for paradise, taking with him new friends along the way.
This series is really off to a great start! Each of the main cast have their own very different personalities.
Kiba and the others aren't so much were-folk in a sense. They are still wolves, who 'camaflauge' themselves by creating a human appearance around them. They can do human things this way, but those who are very open minded can see through the illusion. Also, even while in human form, they still act like wolf's whether it's through their speech, or even their attitude or actions.
The music is another plus! Very emotional! I love the opening theme, as it has that 80s style rock to it. It's the kind of song that makes you feel good inside. The ending theme is also another plus, as it's very emotional. I almost felt like crying, for me it was very beautiful.
The animation is really great. Very detailed, clean, and evidence that the creators of the anime had money to spend.
This set comes with DVD 1, The DVD box case (For you to place the other DVDs in eventually), the Wolf's Rain soundtrack, and yes even a Plush of Kiba (For those who like cute things, hehe).
This is a great series that has now got me hooked. I can't wait to get the other DVDs as they come out. This series is VERY original! With a great dub cast, decent sub cast, with memorable characters, animation, and a great story. Unless you aren't a fan of Wolf's, this is a title you SHOULD NOT MISS! See this and get it when you can, you shouldn't regret it!",1096416000,4,1966,4.403846153846154
2052701,5,B00020HBZU,"Watching one episode of Wolf's Rain automatically got me hooked when it first aired on Cartoon Network a few months back. And thankfully, the series is coming out on DVD!

The first volume (included with the series box, etc.) contains episodes 1-5 (there will be 6 volumes in all). In these first 5 episodes, you meet our heroes: Kiba, Tsume, Toboe and Hige - teens who are only human in appearance. You're also introduced to other characters who play a key role in the story; Cher, Hubb, Quint and his dog, Blue, and of course, Cheza.

Seeing this anime from the beginning is key, because if you come in even a few episodes in, you're sure to be lost. A definite must-have for anime fans everywhere, or anyone who has an obsession with wolves. ::winks::

Also included is the series box (so you can convinently stash your DVDs in one pretty place), a Kiba plushie (which is adorable), and the first Wolf's Rain soundtrack, put together by the fantastic Yoko Kanno. If you can, I'd recommend looking elsewhere, due to the price. But, I will say it's worth the money if you're a dedicated fan.",1093737600,12,1092,4.589743589743589

I would defendetly recommend this, and especially if you like Cowboy Bebop, both shows are made by the same creator, and so if you haven't seen WR, and you like CB, then I would recommend.

2052703,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain is great. It deffinately in my top 5 fave animes. The art and music are both tremendous. If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop you should recognize the artists. The story is deep, and constantly moving. Never a dull moment. The side characters are all just as intrigueing as the main ones, and almost as important. The soundtrack is great, and wowee that plushie is adorable. Totally Kiba! Anyway now for my biggest compliment yet. I am super picky about dubbing (read my other reviews if you don't believe), but I absolutely love this cast. It is excellent in both English, and Japanese. If you are looking for a heartwrenching story, with more depth then greatest fighter tournaments, this is perfect. Wolf's Rain all the way. Oh and don't forget to pick up your plushie and soundtrack.

2052705,5,B00020HBZU,"I first found out about Wolf's Rain by articles in Newtype. I almost thought Toboe was a girl, but I re-read about three times and found the first article was just about the four main characters: Kiba, Hige, Tsume, and Toboe. In the latest Newtype, the article gave more in-depth coverage, so I splurged and got the DVD.

The character designs and animations are great. The music is great. The characters themselves are lovable and understandable, and somewhere inside the seriousness of the story, you can derive a laugh if need be (I found a few things funny ._.). These four wolves in human skin are searching for Paradise that's said to come at world's end, but they're feared and being hunted by this one man. They leave the city they first meet in and head to another after the Flower Maiden is stolen by a possible Noble. There they meet more ookami (wolves) and are shocked--outraged in Kiba's case (maybe Tsume's also)--by the way things are done.

The DVD -- It came with Extras: trailers of Dragon Drive, Ghost in the Shell, Kami-something, or Kaze-something, can't remember. There were several different snippet films, such as pilot and promo, dealing with Wolf's Rain. Also--which I find shocking--is that the English voice actors are just about as enjoyable as the series, and I am VERY picky when it comes to dubbings.

I really love this DVD and I hope the rest to come live up to it and are just as enjoyable. So, in short, though I've rambled, I think this series has potential to be something good, and once I've put my money in my bank account, I'll pre-order the next... two! Ha-heh!

2052706,5,B00020HBZU,"This first DVD is a sure-fire hit. The animation, music, and quality of the characters is great. I have not liked an anime series this much since Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Great series to invest in. The soundtrack that comes with the DVD in the LE box is excellent also. Great music and a great show recieves 5 stars from me.",1089590400,3,325,4.416666666666667
2052707,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain is without a doubt one of the most beautifully animated series I have seen. It also features a great soundtrack, a given from Yoko Kanno. Be ready to think about this one though, as so far it has a complex storyline to it. You know the simple version by now: a place called Paradise will appear near the end, and only wolves can find this place. Thought to have been extinct over 200 years ago, wolves are actually all around people disguised themselves as humans. 4 wolves, Hige, Tsume, Kiba and Toboe are searching for this Paradise. That is the simple version, but the story is much more complex than that. Having only seen these first 5 episodes, I can't really explain the plot much further than that. But I can say that from these 5 episodes I like what I see so far and I will be buying the rest of the series.
I bought the version with the limited edition artbox. If you have seen the series and like it, I think you will like this version, as you get a sturdy artbox that will hold all of the volumes once they are released. The box is beautifully illustrated as well. Also you get the original soundtrack to the series which is also a great deal to be included with this set. The music only adds to the depth of the series and is as much a part of the series as the series itself. And lastly you get a plush Kiba, which doesn't really matter to me but I guess it is a cool bonus. Wolf's Rain is not something kids will understand, and it may bore others. It is not really fast-paced (at least so far) so it may not be up your alley. But if you are into anime that has a deeper meaning to it give Wolf's Rain a try. I can't say it is my favorite because it's not, but I liked it a lot and I can't wait to get further into the story when Vol. 2 is released in August.",1089244800,6,1787,4.094017094017094
2052718,5,B00020HBZU,"I used to think Cowboy Bebop was the tops in the anime field. Wolf's Rain at least ties with it.
The story, in a nutshell, is that this is a futuristic world where humans are confined to domed cities that protect them from the wastelands outside (if you seen the Final Fantasy movie, that's it). Wolves are also believed to be extinct in this world. But, four young men prove this wrong; Kiba, Toboe, Higei, and Tsumei round out the four primary characters, and do it well. These 4 wolves, who can disguise themselves as people, set out in search of Paradise. That's the outer story, but like any good anime it goes MUCH deeper.
The art of this anime is also the equal of Bebop (one of the characters even looks like Spike; if you've seen Bebop you'll catch on to which one). The backgrounds are fully and completely detailed, and the characters are also well fleshed out, art and personality wise. You can really 'get' the characters within the first few episodes.
Not only is it from the same people who did Bebop, it also still has Yoko Kanno's music (Yes!!).
And on top of all this, also voice actors from two other excellent animes are in here; the same voice actor as Vash the Stampede from TRIGUN and Alucard's voice from HELLSING.
All this together gives an excellent anime, one that belongs in any collection immediately.",1088467200,5,1330,4.569037656903766
2052719,5,B00020HBZU,"I just finished watching a poorly subtitled import of this and it is easily one of my all time favorite anime titles. I enjoyed it so much that I'll purchase this version just to be able to figre out what some of the poor translation forced me to miss.  The visuals are some of the best ever.  The version I watched included the final 4 episodes (eps. 27-30).  My biggest question is will this set contain those or not?  I have not seen the run on Adult Swim and don't know if they aired there or not.  If they release the last 4 episodes with this set then it easily earns the 5/5 rating. If not, 4/5 because I'm a completist and those last few episodes really tie up all the loose ends.",1087776000,,688,4.142857142857143
2052720,5,B00020HBZU,"Wow, it was a stunning anime. Different from many others where the endings are usually happy, it left you sad, but also happy. The characters evolove greatly from the beginning episodes to the end and makes it even more interesting to watch.
The story though kind of strange from all the different stories of how humans originated is itself an interpertation of well how humans orginated and how humans have destroyed everything. A book tells of how humans orginated from wolves, and there are wolves which together go in search of paradise to rejuvenate all that was destroyed by the humans.
It has an enjoyment similar to the endings of Last Exile, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebopp. If you really liked those series, I highly recomend this one.",1087776000,2,739,4.826771653543307

2052723,5,B00020HBZU,"Wolf's Rain takes place in a futuristic, apocalyptic society.  Humans have devastated the Earth, destroying what little remained of nature.  Many species of animal are either extinct or on the brink of extinction. Domed cities are sprinkled over the desolate surface of the Earth.  Humans have been divided into two main groups; an aristocracy called the Nobles, and the rest of the commoners, many of which have become outlaws.  There is a legend of wolves appearing just before the end of the world to lead everyone to Paradise.  No one believes these legends, however, because they believe wolves have become extinct over 200 years ago.
However, wolves do still live and thrive, and only are able to do so by developing a special ability to manipulate people's minds so that they see the wolves as humans. In this way, the wolves can co-exist with humans with the humans being none the wiser.  Many wolves integrated themselves into human society, becoming common workers, gang members, and even lowly street dogs. Many who had once desired to seek paradise had lost interest in doing so, settling instead to live among the humans.
The four wolves, Kiba, Tsume, Hige and Toboe, all have their own individual goals, but all desire true freedom, away from the humans.  They are searching for the mythical Paradise, but in order to do so, must find the Flower Maiden.  However, they have much opposition, in the form of Quent Yaiden, the hunter who wishes to eliminate all wolves from the face of the Earth, and his dog Blue, who helps him locate the wolves.  There are also the detective Hubb Lebowsi, and the various research scientists, including Cher Degre, who wish to prove the existence of these wolves.  Yet another obstacle is the mysterious Darcia, who kidnaps Cheza, the Flower Maiden who can sense the wolves' emotions and pain.
Myth has it that only the wolves will be able to find the way to paradise, but does paradise really exist?",1084406400,36,1947,4.837349397590361

The character's names, translated from Japanese, fit them beautifully:
Toboe-Howling (Toboe is the hopeful one in the group,and the most sensitive; he is first to howl when things happen. When you first meet him, he howls :) )
Kiba-Fang (When you watch and see Kiba, you'll understand ^.^)
Tsume-Claw (Tsume is definently abiding by 'claw first and ask questions later...')

Only cities, and represive governments remain. Legend has it that wolves have been extinct for 200 years.  An old legend still circulates; there is a lost paridise, and only wolves will be able to find it.  Some also say that wolves are not extinct; they have cast a spell on humans, so that humans can not see them.
  One fatefull day, a young white wolf named Kiba wanders from the mountains into the city.  The legend is true; wolves have learned magic, and scattered lone wolves have learned to disguise themselves as humans.  It'sn ow up to Kiba to teach the disguised wolves to regain their pride in being wolves, the ways of the pack, and to seek out the legendary paridise.  But this won't be easy.  There is a dark figure, who's goal is to exterminate the last of the surviving wolves.  Humanity has also geneticslly engineered a female to seek out the lost paridise herself.  The only problem is that the comitose woman only shows signs of reaction when near wolves.
Brought to you by the folks responable for Cowboy Beebop, the writing is excellent, the sound track is great, and the animation supurb.  This is destine to become an instant classic!  Warning; not for kids.  This is a very gritty drama, and contains graphic violence.  Adults, get redy to be blown away!",1082851200,10,1427,4.599206349206349

I thought it was the complete series (based on thinking I saw ""complete series"", that my search was for ""complete series"" and the price) and at that price, it should have been.  The Stuffed ""wolf"" was tiny and certainly shouldn't have upped the cost as much as it apparently did.  You can find the separate volumes for about $15 each and the soundtrack for around 15$...so that leaves ""the box"" and the stuffed wolf costing the other $15...really?  I bought the complete series for myself new for around $40.  This was a gift for my son as he loved the series to and I figured he would damage my dvd's.  I'll just order the series next time.

The episodes included on this disc are: ""City of Howls,"" ""Toboe, Who Doesn't Howl,"" ""Bad Fellow,"" ""Scars in the Wasteland,"" and ""Fallen Wolves.""

This set contains eight extras.  The first extra is a cast interview, which runs for about seven minutes.  This is an interview with the Japanese voice actors for the four main characters (Kiba, Tsume, Toboe, and Hige).  The audio is in Japanese, and English subtitles are provided.  The next two features are a textless opening and a textless closing.

The next feature is labeled as ""Pilot Film.""  This feature runs for two minutes and twenty seconds.  The audio is in Japanese, and it also includes English subtitles.  Next is ""Promo Film 1,"" which runs for one minute and forty-four seconds.  It uses the opening credit music in the background.  This extra is also in Japanese with English subtitles.  This is followed by ""Promo Film 2,"" which runs for one minute and thirty seconds.  This uses the closing credit music in the background; and just like the previous two features, it features Japanese audio with English subtitles.

The next feature is ""15 Second Promos.""  There are four promos in all; you can either choose which one you want to see, or select the option to ""Play All.""  All four of these promos use the exact same visuals, but there is a slight change to the voice over at the end of each one.

The next link is for ""Trailers.""  There are trailers in this menu for: Yakikaze, Ghost in the Shell, and Dragon Drive.  The feature labeled as ""Credits"" takes you to the DVD credits.

The story, animation, and production values are far superior to any anime series or movie to come down the pike in recent years.  Wolf's Rain is deep and meaningful.  Anything else pales in comparison.

You will be gripped from the moment of the opening song, ""Stray.""  The story takes place far in the future, when civilization has been destroyed.  Only a few domed cities and the cold, snowy wasteland remain.  Yet wolves have survived, by taking human appearances so they can walk undetected among people.

The four male wolves we meet in this volume are very different in character and can barely hold it together as they journey to find Rakuen, the legendary paradise.  They are starving, cold, and have no allies in a bitter world.

The series is violent, dark, and gritty, but is full of such raw emotions that it is difficult not to cry as the characters face and overcome different obstacles.",1149465600,3,983,4.729411764705882
