203071,5,1932225285,"David Barton does it again! This DVD, ""Setting the Record Straight: American History in Black & White"" is a ""must have"" for anyone serious about our early American history. You won't learn these factual truths from the revisionist history books at school! We've been lied to, this DVD should be shown in EVERY grade school in America! I've made certain all the children in my life have watched this wonderful DVD. Thanks David for your hard work and shining a bright light on the truth... you're the best!",1315526400,4,505,4.75
203072,5,1932225285,This is a very important book AND VIDEO! I strongly urge all to read it and share it! Why any African American or ANY American would still remain a registered Democrat after learning the truth of this book is beyond my comprehension! David Barton smartly lays out the facts and backs up what he has written with a complete set of footnotes and bibliography that are almost as lengthy as the book itself. The companion DVD is about 2 hours long and follows the book closely. The history it re-enacts is riveting and will stir your soul! I wish I could personally put this book and DVD in the hands of every American especially those still loyal to Democrats and Liberals! It should be required reading in every American school! Republicans from Lincoln's day to the Republicans of today can be proud of their consistent stand against slavery and for being in favor of civil rights for all people! I am so glad that I read this book and watched the DVD! -Craig A. Crawford,1313020800,3,970,4.548571428571429
203073,4,1932225285,"A lot of great information.  Love learning about our history, both the good and the bad.  Only complaint is it's a lot of information to digest and the DVD moves so fast I don't always have time to take it all in.

203075,5,1932225285,"I found this book absolutely fascinating and could not put it down.  I also bought the DVD for my father who has macular degeneration.  The DVD is about 3 hrs long and is much faster than reading the book, but it's nice to have the book as reference.  This book/DVD explains who was helping end slavery (13th Amendment), helping blacks gain the citizenship (14th Amendment), voting rights (15th Amendment).  It was the Republican Party started by Abraham Lincoln; the Democrats fought tooth and nail to resist these changes.",1291939200,7,524,4.920454545454546

203078,4,1932225285,"Using historical documentation, pictures, videos and reenactment vignettes to detail African-American history in the United States, this documentary provides a comprehensive analysis of the political and social battle for black civil rights in America.

From long forgotten or overlooked Revolutionary black patriots, through Civil War and Reconstruction heroes, the negative significance of the Pro-KKK movie ""Birth of a Nation, to today's issues such as school vouchers, light is shed on the political parties and their role in fighting for or against equality in America.

Factual and to the point, this is a documentary that all Americans would greatly benefit from by viewing. Importantly, the last half hour should be required viewing to clarify the overarching philosophy of both political parties and their actions toward equality for all Americans regardless of color.",1281830400,16,877,5.687022900763359

I volunteer with 6th thru 8th grade inner city boys.  I don't think this DVD would hold their interest.

203082,5,1932225285,As an African-American I never identified with the intense racism my peers felt. I have experienced racism but for some reason never allowed it to settle inside of me. This DVD was excellent in the way it proved many African-Americans contributed to American history. Those of us that allow hatred to sit in our souls do so because we fail to educate ourselves. Yes there was bad. But there was also good. We are brainwashed and need to pick up a book and read for ourselves.,1447459200,4,475,4.534883720930233

203092,1,1932225285,"I would give this DVD 1/10 of a star if I could.  Barton lost all credibility when, less than 5 minutes into this documentary, he brings up the Bible and says the first Blacks.  Anytime white folks mention the Bible, the same Bible they once used to justify slavery,  in order to teach Black history I know their true intent is not to teach AUTHENTIC Black history AT ALL.  Next he tells the glaring lie that the first Africans arrived here as slaves in 1619 when, in actuality, we were here before Columbus.  For people of African descent who want to learn more about our AUTHENTIC history, order the DVDs Hidden Colors Volumes I, II and III, available here on Amazon.

203105,2,1932225285,"This book was very misleading.... in buying it, I expected to learn more about forgotten black heroes but found myself reading the history of the Democratic party and the many errors it made. The black heroes are far and few between, it's more political rhetoric than anything.

Indeed, historically it seems that the first African Americans in government were Republicans though there has been a switch today (2014) as seen as by how much of the south is now Republican and much of the Democratic party is now Black. I understand that, but I was not looking for a book on that. I was looking for a book that gave me more of a foundation on Black History....not one about white figures in the Republican party or a scathing long winded review of how the Democratic party has historically ""been on the wrong side of history"".

Additionally, I noticed one or two typos in the beginning.

Overall, it is not a terrible book if this is what you are looking for but very misleading if you are not.",1393027200,5,992,4.561797752808989

It is more about putting down one party and lifting up the other party. I made a mistake in ordering this DVD. I hate it. This is not setting the record straight. It trying to sell the Republican Party as the Party that really care about Black People. We know that is not true. Watch the News, not FOX and you will see that. I will never ever buy any thing that this Man name is on. Be careful don't let the cover fool you. I wished I had watch it early so I could have sent it back.

203110,5,1932225285,"The liberal left loves to try and eviscerate David Barton. He encourages anyone trying to learn about history to go back to the original documents (or as close as you can get) and he owns around 100,000 original documents. When you see the contents of this video or read the book, you have to ask yourself ""Why?"" it is that 95% of people (especially black people) have never heard of most of these distinguished black leaders. So, on one hand you have the progressive, liberal left that is responsible for erasing these historical figures from our education system and on the other hand David Barton with original documents in hand.

Even though it shows how the Democrats have been the primary oppressors of many of the blacks, the narrator makes note that the Republican are not innocent. Result of this DVD is that it is only a taste of what has gone on over the past two hundred plus years.

203116,1,1932225285,"Rather than teaching history, this video is a product of pro-Republican, anti-Democrat propaganda. Rather than educate, it seeks to misinform and twist the truth and very conveniently omit relevant information.

For instance America's armed forces were desegregated by order of a Democratic president. The civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 act were pushed through congress by a Democratic president. Many Republicans (including Barry Goldwater, Ron Paul, Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush) opposed the legislation that ended the Jim Crow laws. Many Republicans thought that laws that prevented black people from voting should remain in place forever. Many Republicans thought that laws that segregated black Americans from white Americans should remain in place forever.

And when Lyndon Baines Johnson succeeded in banishing the Jim Crow laws, many of the Dixicrats (Southern Democrats who believed in the Jim Crow laws) left the Democratic Party and joined the Republican Party.

David Barton very strategically omits these historical facts.

David Barton also very conveniently ""forgets"" to tell you about Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy, which was basically to exploit the fears of White Racists in the South in order to win their votes.

Barton fails to tell you about how Jerry Falwell repeatedly denounced civil rights leaders and in 1967 when he set up his own school, it was racially segregated because Falwell didn't believe that black Americans and white Americans should be forced to associate with each other.

Barton fails to tell you how Ronald Reagan gave a speech in Mississippi in 1980 where he talked about ""states rights"" and how the federal government should stop telling the states what to do and how the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was ""humiliating to the South.""

Also there was Ronald Reagan with his attempts to give Bob Jones University a tax-exempt status despite that university's policy of racial discrimination.

Barton also fails to mention how despite a growing international movement to topple the racist apartheid system in South Africa in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan maintained a close alliance with a South African government that was showing no signs of serious reform. And the Reagan administration demonized opponents of apartheid, most notably the African National Congress, as dangerous and pro-communist. Reagan even vetoed a bill to impose sanctions on South Africa, only to be overruled by Democratic Opposition in Congress.

Barton isn't trying to educate. He's trying to indoctrinate.",1347062400,19,2570,5.389027431421447
203117,5,1932225285,"First I received the DVD in quick time, and when I sat down to watch it the quality was obviously low budget, but the information was so amazingly important, I couldn't stop til it was over.  I knew a good bit of what was discussed, but the reenactments from congressional speeches were priceless explanation of the times.  The violent history of the Democratic party is laid out in stunning detail straight from the congressional record.  From before the Civil War right up until the 60's Democrats made it their business to keep blacks under foot, and under strong DEMOCRAT control.  And that hasn't changed much since then.  Since murder and intimidation fell out of favor in the 60s they turned to classic Democrat techniques or bribery and corruption (not covered in the DVD.) I could go on for ever, but the DVD is far more informative than I could be in this review.",1335139200,2,873,4.6797385620915035
203118,1,1932225285,"Since David Barton doesn't have a degree in history I wasn't expecting much from David Barton's attempt to ""Set the record straight"" on American history, however I didn't think that the David Barton DVD would be THIS bad!

Even though we're told that this DVD is an attempt to recognize ""the forgotten heroes and untold stories from our rich African American political history,"" once you watch it, it becomes painfully obvious that it's a propaganda piece designed to portray the Democratic Party as responsible for every problem that has ever plagued the African American community in America and imply that the Republican Party is the antidote.

Lyndon Baines Johnson risked his political career (and the future of the Democratic Party) to push the civil rights legislation of the 1960s (such as the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965) but Barton ignores this and instead gives all the credit to ""strong support of Republicans"" for this legislation.

The split in the Democratic Party in the 1960s was a very important historical event, but Barton (who wants to be known as a historian) ignores this split and pretends it never happened.

Barton also ignores the historical fact that when millions of Democrats embraced the civil rights movement, many racist and segregationist southern Democrats left the Democratic Party and were welcomed by the national Republican Party as part of its ""Southern Strategy"" to building power. Of course the Republican strategy of gaining votes by appealing to racists in the South to win national elections (made famous by Nixon, but continuing on into the 21st century) is never mentioned by Barton.

The transformation of the Republican and Democratic parties in the 1960s and 1970s were very important historical developments in America, but David Barton totally ignores these developments.
