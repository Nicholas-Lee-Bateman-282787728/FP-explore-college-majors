8068506,5,B0009WKG58,"It is true.  This K-Drama series truly belongs to the top 5 All Time Greatest K-Drama ever produced.  You've read the reviews...a perfect 5 stars.  This story line is gripping, romantic, and teaches the audience about the joys and heartaches of victories and obstacles that accompanies anyone who is on the chartered course of obtaining and achieving an established career.  On this journey however, some learn to forgive while others learn to hate.  The ending was totally unpredictable!  Happy ending or a sad one...remember, life is not always fair as this beautifully directed piece shows us how really painful reality can be...or not.  I gaurantee that you will enjoy it!",1199404800,8,676,5.090909090909091
8068507,2,B0009WKG58,"Korean shows have many talented actors and actresses who really know how to act. not in this series. the lead actor has this blank stair on his face  with no emotion and the lead actress either smiles too much or cries too much. the story line is unreal at time and the music is forgetable. if you want a good series to watch , go for stairway to heaven, sad love story, winter sonata, love letters, phoenix and hotelier. if you want sword fighting Damo is a great series to buy.",1198368000,,479,4.263736263736264
8068508,5,B0009WKG58,"This drama is one of the best K-dramas of all time. The premise is two girls who both want to be anchors for the news. One is plain yet sweet, the other is beautiful yet dark (picture an evil Asian Uma Thurman). The drama depicts the struggles that each girl faces as they try to achieve there dreams. One will risk everything to get what she wants, the other achieves hers through her dedication and strong moral ethics. This drama has everything you could want from a K-drama; love, betrayal, comedy and tears. The acting is outstanding and it moves at a fast enough pace that you won't get bored. Buy it because it is definitely one you will re-watch. Han-Jae-Suk is incredible and plays such a different role than he did in Glass Slipper. The real show stealer though is Jang Dong Gun who could not be sexier if he tried. Fantastic, don't miss it!",1188000000,5,851,4.461538461538462

8068510,4,B0009WKG58,"Where to begin with this review.  I'm going to have to break it up into:
3 stars for the music
4 stars for script / writing
5 stars for acting
After watching, my lovely sam-soon, I felt the music for this ""All about Eve"" really lacked.  It could of been alot better.  Good Girl Sun-mi is crying every 5 minutes in every episode and they could of introduced some western music like Seals ""don't cry"" and it would of helped. Kyung-chul is telling her not to cry, ever again.  Up to about the 12th episode, I was wondering why it was called ""all about eve"" as there is no one named eve in it, then, they create this morning show called, eves morning.  I think it would of been more aptly named, ""Babes of Broadcasting"".  These women are insanely beautiful in this drama.

The script writing has some holes in it, and you are left wondering what is really happening or how it did happen. Example, when evil young-mi goes to the hospital, I wasn't sure if she was getting an abortion or having a miscarriage or what, but its cleared up about 4 episodes after.

Ahhhh, the real story is the beautifully evil young-mi.  Very talented actress with lips like sugar.  Some adjectives that describe her part are, deceitful, liar, manipulative, conniving, treacherous, scary, amazing, ambitious, aggressive, smart and foremost, deadly.  Her part kept me glued to the drama.  She will stop at nothing to anchor the 9 oclock news.

Sun-mi just crys too much in this.  Every 5 minutes, tears are flowing. If I had a girlfriend that cried that much, I would be seeking psychiatrict help for her.  And there is nobody that nice in this world, very unrealistic her part.  Shes this goody goody nice girl type.  Quite a few episodes, she has the worst hair I ever seen on a girl.  Wavy, sticking out, they finally straighten that out about 6 episodes into the drama.

The girl in this drama who gets best mention is Joo-Hee.  Very cute.  Face like an angel.  She wasn't really written into the script as much as I would of liked to have seen.  She carrys herself well in this drama.

kyung-chul, hes quite a talented individual.  He plays piano and sings and has cool looking guitars laying about, but never strums on any of them.  Hes got the dream job and all the babes and bmw's.  Its quite funny, he tells sun-mi hes unemployed, but hes floating around in bmw's.
He does a good job in his part tho.  I really liked it when he plays piano.

These koreans really like their booze.  Every episode features massive booze drinking and good food eating.  Reminds me of my life.  woo-jin turns into a raving alcholic drinking anything he can get his hands on when young-mi won't love him back.  Sake, beer, whiskey, scotch ... you name it, its flowing freely in this drama.  I could definately hang with some koreans!!!!

Worth mentioning, the clothes these women wear in this drama are very nice. I like that cut, conservative, dressy look.  Very elegant, sophisticated dress.  The ladies out there, will pick up on this.

Episode 20, the last one, gave me watery eyes.  When sun-mi tells young-mi that they were ""best friends"" it really grabbed me.  Great writing there guys.

All in all, I recommend this drama.  Its very sad, especially towards the end.  I don't really look at it as a love story as the other reviewer has ascertained to.  Its more like Good vs Evil. With Good prevailing.  The work environment these people are in is very dysfunctional.  Makes for interesting drama.  And as always, I love seeing the sights and sounds of korea.",1170633600,3,3528,4.5712
