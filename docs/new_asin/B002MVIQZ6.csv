8374100,5,B002MVIQZ6,This is a TERRIFIC video for toddlers and young kids. My 3 year-old daughter loves it and so do I. I love the message of each skit/song and the songs are catchy for adults too. My daughter and I both dance around the house to this video. I think the video where they talk to kids about primary colors and how to mix them to create new colors is my daughter's favorite.,1277769600,,368,4.125
