8285146,3,B001BXRRIS,"I recommend this DVD, not because it is great, but because it is the best if the very few programs on General Marshall.  General Marshall, one of the most powerful and influential people in American history, is little known by most Americans.  His unique character and commitment to selfless service kept him out of the limelight and caused him to put his efforts into where he was most needed and not where it would do him the most good.  If you do n ot know about General Marshall, you should watch this.  It will give you a good sketch of him and his life. If you have read just about any biography on him, you can skip the DVD.",1270857600,,631,4.277310924369748
