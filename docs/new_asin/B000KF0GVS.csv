8156266,3,B000KF0GVS,"If you are interesting in exotic dance but are totally new to dance fitness, this dvd may be for you.  It is easy, slow-paced and is a nice introduction to exotic dance.  I enjoy using it when I am tired & not in the mood for an intense workout but still want to get some practice in for the day.

There are a few moves I really like, like the ""Sunrise"".  I also appreciate Felinity's attention to detail, like maintaining a continuous flow of movement and reminding the viewer to ""follow a path"" with the hands.  It is little movements like this that make an otherwise ordinary exercise ""sexy.""

However, if you have dance experience, are in great shape already or certainly if you have experience in any form of exotic dance, skip it.  There are much better DVDs out there on this subject, and this one certainly won't advance your practice.  At best, it's a nice way to relax at the end of a long day.",1291852800,,904,4.37125748502994
8156267,2,B000KF0GVS,"Alyson IS sexy. But so what. This dvd takes any Stretching dvd you own and slows it down 1/4 and adds touching yourself all over while you do it. That's it. It claims it's 'dance-based' -- gross exaggeration. Unless you consider yawning and stretching in your sheets when you wake up in the am 'dance-based' too.

I can imagining having a glass of wine first, and then doing it, would con me into thinking you were dancing. And I'd probably even have a good time. But there is NO dancing in this dvd. Not for one minute.

What it does teach is how to SLOW your mindset down and tap into 'sexy', which she is great at. But sorry, there's no dancing in this dvd unless you thinking rolling on your side and slowly opening your legs and then eventually getting up on your knees and maddingingly-slowly rolling your hips in a circle is 'dancing'.

This dvd DOES capture a sexy mood tho! It's nice slow sexy session with yourself as you stretch and purrr and be feline, but it's not dancing. No more than walking around the house is considered 'exercising'. The dvd cover declares it a ""A Truly HOT new workout!"" - workout, tho, implies sweat and effort, and physical challange. This is not the case for the average exerciser who's not a complete beginner. Nor is it dancing. So if it's not a workout that makes you sweat and it's not dancing? I'm not sure what it is... closest description I can come up with is a sexual-mental-health self-love session where you revel in your feminine sexuality but don't really learn anything useable. You can be wonderfully-feminine and dance, too, in Lady M's ""Exotic Dance: the Irrestible Art"".

If you don't want to dance or learn a routine, but want to stretch out and roll around and pretend your a cat in slow-motion, this dvd works. It IS sexy. It maybe should have been billed as a psycho-sexual confidence builder. I can see this being a great gift for a broken-hearted girlfriend, even more seriously, a person dealing with sexual abuse recovery, as it's very much about self-love discovery and sexuality.

(The second dvd in this series, Get it On! exact same dvd workout almost but at the end you perform in a doorway jam and make love to it in lieu of a man, which is interesting to watch, but again so slow, you can't call it dance or instructional, it's all instincual on her part.)",1227830400,7,2329,4.535714285714286
8156268,5,B000KF0GVS,"This is the first of a 3 DVD series of toning, body awareness/loving your body, being sensual & a striptease routine for your significant other.
It has chapter choices (Awakening, Legs, Abs, Legs II, Feline, Discovering, Traveling, Felinity Dance), teaches in English, Spanish, French & it can be viewed w/ or w/o narration or music.
Bonus material includes: * Commentary w/Alyson & the producer. * Bio of Alyson who is a well trained dancer in many categories but hates looking for validation from large audiences. She noticed better body awareness & mind/body connection when dancing for herself & looking to teach that to other women. * Beautiful, confident dancing by Alyson.
The dancing taught & show is beautiful & sensual, of loving your body & confidence, not sleeze & simulated s*x movements. Set in a large simply & beautifully furnished studio with Alyson Joy & two other women in shape, one who shows modifications. Alyson speaks in a patient voice & gives plenty of details, telling you how it should affect you, what your intentions should be, to love your curves/body & she cues YOUR left/right. The pace is always as slow as possible to be more aware of how your body moves which makes everything harder to do.
All moves are done as sensually & confidently as possible & I could not do the workout/routine justice, so did best I could on major somewhat easier to explain moves:
Awakening - mild stretching, mild/easy sitting undulations, easy core stretching/warming hip circles & torso circles, sitting wide angle bend & side bends, sitting & touching toes/knees to side playfully, etc.
Legs - lying sideways, simple leg movements for hip opening & stretching, like slow/easy pilates
Abs - leaning on elbows, ankle rubbing, leg s*xy swings,  small splits, getting up/down in a sensual way a couple of times which works the abs
Legs II - other side of movements before
Feline - on stomach, curving back for stretch, sensual, on knees easy torso twists, cat/cow stretches, torso/hip rolls on hands/knees, on knees only lifting up & sitting down several times, hip circles on knees & getting up confidently
Discovering - shoulder rolls, chest slides & circles, standing hip circles, torso drop side swings, standing fwd bends w/hair massage, dips to sensual squats several times
Traveling - crawling on knees only mostly & sometimes with arms high or on ground sensually
Felinity Dance - all the exercises before changed into a practiced for a routine in 7 min w/added shirt if want to practice adding that & the routine itself in 3 min

Cons:
Alyson reminds you to be in touch with your body, caress it, feel it, always do each movement as sensually as possible, etc. which is great, but she keeps repeating ""I know this is hard ladies, this is the last one...."" which reminds me it's a workout & takes the fun out of it.
I reviewed her next dvd, ""Get it on"" in the series which so similar that I had to really check to see what the difference is & the 3rd one is learning pole dancing which I don't need but great option for those who do.

TAKE OFF TWO STARS - even I thought the slow beat music, slow movement toning made it a bit dull & drag on a bit. Alyson's friendly demeanor & the intention/content is why I gave it 5 stars, not because of the slow, dull pace.
