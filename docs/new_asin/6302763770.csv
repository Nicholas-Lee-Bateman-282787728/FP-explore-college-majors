My pleasure soon waned as I heard the audio quality. It was AWFUL!! It was muffled, parts were hardly audible at all!! It sounded more like a pirated movie I would expect to sound.

The video was adequate, at least it was watchable.

It only due to the classic status of the movie that I am giving this 2 stars.

513501,5,6302763770,"Watching, recently, the blu ray of the Caine Mutiny put me in mind of this almost perfect war film and a comparison between the two.  Both were adapted from bestselling novels published in 1951 and both were released within a year of one another, the Cruel Sea the earlier of the two by one year in 1953.  Both, of course, dealt with similar subject matter; life on a small naval ship in combat during World War II and the trials and considerable tribulations of the officers and crew.  And both feature very strong central performances from the actors playing the ships' captains; Humphrey Bogart, in the case of the Caine, and Jack Hawkins, in the case of Compass Rose in the Cruel Sea.  Each ship has a lieutenant who is a writer in civilian life; Keefer, (Fred McMurray) in the Caine and Lockhart, the executive officer of the Compass Rose played with quiet assurance by a very young Donald Sinden

However, there the similarities end.  In my opinion, while I am a fan of the Caine Mutiny, it is far the inferior of the two as a film.  The understated eloquence of the Eric Ambler screen play adaptation from Nicholas Montsarrat's novel is brilliantly supported by the almost documentary like feel of the black and white cinematography which itself is aided by intercuts of actual newsreel footage of merchant ships being torpedoed and sinking and survivors being hauled aboard lifeboats to comparative safety.  The worst aspect of the Caine Mutiny is the awful, jarring, discordant triumphalist score by Max Steiner which is in almost exact opposition to the type of mood the score should have been suggesting!  Contrast this with the superbly evocative orchestral score by Alan Rawsthorne for the Cruel Sea and its easy, then, to appreciate what a gaffe Steiner and the Caine's director, Edward Dmytryk made with that garish cacophony!

As I say, I admire the Caine Mutiny, not only for the two brilliant performances from Bogart and McMurray, but also for its subject matter, but if you want gritty realism and a true sense of how cruel the sea really can be, and this is from someone who has seen it up close in similar circumstances, there is only one candidate;  a true masterpiece of film-making.",1384387200,2,2207,4.781578947368421

513503,5,6302763770,"Long considered by many to be the best war movie ever made. It may also be Jack Hawkins' greatest role. Ignore the NF synopsis, which is off the mark. It's a story of a single-minded (although fundamentally kind) Captain of a WWII escort ship, members of his crew, and some of those they love ashore. This is not a propaganda film (like the wartime movie ""In Which We Serve""). There's little overt patriotism here in this relentlessly grey seascape, and little heroism (except the quiet kind).

513561,5,6302763770,"This utterly unflinching, realistic look at the physical and psychological consequences of war is a harrowing experience even seen some 60 years on. Jack Hawkins is superb as the commander who has to plough through survivors of a U boat attack because he can't afford to let the U boat he still suspects is present escape to cause more death. It must have been shocking and unexpected for 1950s audiences to see the burly Hawkins drunk, in tears and tortured by the horrific consequences of his actions. The scene is haunting and lingers in the mind long after the film is over. There are no simple minded heroics here - the emphasis is on gritty reality and the horror experienced by men in conflict. Many of the characters we come to know and love meet unpleasant ends.

Donald Sinden, best known now for his light-hearted performances in such films as Doctor In The House, gives an equally fine portrayal of Hawkins' No 1, initially on a temporary promotion following the departure of the original (Stanley Baker), later rising magnificently to the occasion. In one scene, he has a simple, but effective means of keeping up morale in a lifeboat - ""Sing, you lazy bastards!"" A significant scene towards the end has him comment to Hawkins that the German survivors of their attack on a U boat aren't very different to them, really. That sums it up perfectly.

I don't think The Cruel Sea is an anti-war film in the same way that Oh, What A Lovely War! or M*A*S*H are, but it certainly refuses to glamorise the subject, or portray heroes and villains. Without editorialising, it simply tells the truth. Perhaps that's why it says so much so well and remains so powerful even in the 21st century.

It is the story of a couple of sailors, one a professional seaman who is a captain of a freighter. The other, a newspaper reporter turned naval officer. The war puts them together in a Flower-Class escort vessel, the Compass Rose. Designed to be coastal escort vessels, the lack of real escort vessels forced England to use these undersized ships to escort freighters all the way across the Atlantic, battling not only German submarines, but aircraft as well. And then there is the sea, the cruel sea, the sea that cares not for politics or war, but treats all the same.

This movie made a star of Jack Hawkins, David Sinden (primarily a Shakespearean stage actor) and Denholm Elliott, who later starred in hundreds of movies like the Indiana Jones series.

It doesn't have the great special effects or graphic action scenes of more modern movies, but, somewhat in the vein of Das Boot it does a good job of showing the hardships that the men who served aboard these small ships went through.
The corvette navies of England and Canada were largely built up of volunteers with little or no naval experience (in the movie one of the officers was a used car salesman a month before boarding ship).

Ultimately however, it is about the love between a captain and his second-in-command. That has nothing to do with being `gay'. It has everything to do with the relationships between men in time of war. The counterpoint is reflected upon when `number one', played superbly by Donald Sinden (who in later work, focused on comedy), considers the matter with the woman he is falling in love with. The evidence of love between the men is when he is given the chance to captain his own ship. It is a superb British war movie, understated and with Jack Hawkins conveying the trauma of those decisions; good and bad. This is a finely crafted film.",1302825600,2,761,4.602941176470588

Like the Latter, TCS focuses on the crew of two ships and views the war through the eyes of it's officers. But unlike the ""In Which We Serve"" the war and it's costs on the hearts and minds of men is detailed in grim, stark strokes. Gone are the class affectations of ""In Which We Serve"", there is no ""stiff upper lip"" hogwash here. Just men placed under extraordinay pressue trying to fight an enemy they cannot see or strike but who can see and strike them.  You can chart the wars cost in humanity by watching the Captains face change over the years. You bear witness as he morphs from a cheerful compassionate man to an almost bitter ""Ahab"" like character strapped into his Captains chair and totally obsessed with killing the enemy that sank his first command and killed so many of his crew.

When the movie is over there's no great desire to stand up and cheer or shout ""God Save The King"", you just shrug and sigh as did the Captain and his Number One, grateful that the terrible ordeal is at last over.

I have seen the Movie many times and I always come away from the viewing with an overwhelming sense of meloncholly. Would I as a young man have had the courage of these brave sailers who fought a brutal, murderous enemy that was matched only by the equally and souless brutality of their secondry adversary, the cruel sea that the Germans, if possible, had made more cruel . Monsarrats insight into the life on board ship in the North Atlantic in a storm are as graphic as they are real. The pounding sea, the noise, the cold, the seasickness that Sub Lt Ferrabby experiences for days on end. His description of the sinking of the Compass Rose, the dying thoughts of the brave crew. As the author puts it "" they new how to die, how to bury the dead,"" to help heal the terrible debris of the ghastly war that they were in till the bitter end. As Captain Ericson puts it at the end of the Movies, ""for all the the good they did, (the Germans) they shoudn't have bothered"" I recently inherited a 1953 printing of ""The Cruel Sea"" I have read it three times in the last year. I now know why it was expurgated in 1952, it's the brothel description of Lt Bennett in Liverpool, their home port, happily the book was written in an age where profanity was not de riguer.

The love of Lockhart and Ferrabee for this Collossus who is Ericson, the Captain, and he for them, as they struggle to defeat the evil menace of the ""U"" Boat. Countered somewhat by probably the most tender loves scenes ever in a war movie as he  desribes a wartime love affair between Ft Lt Lockhart and ""glamour pants"" Officer Hallam in OPS. An historic Movie that all should see at least once.

513643,3,6302763770,"I really wanted to like ""The Cruel Sea"", a documentary-style flick about life on an RN warship on convoy duty in WWII.  It's a worthy idea for a story, with great characters and dead-on acting.  Jack (""Land of the Pharaohs"") Hawkins is Captain Ericson, the proper yet amiable skipper of the ""Compass Rose"".  When we first see him, he's correcting two new officers on the protocol for saluting superior officers - no apologies, he tells them kindly, if you're going to salute, just do it right.  And this guy is a warship commander!  He's an interesting character - in voice-overs, Ericson tells how the war pulled him from merchantmen and deposited him at the helm of a corvette tasked with hunting U-boats, with little doubt that he's unsuited for the new job.  The story then goes on to tell of the newer officers - the ship's martinet of a first mate, the sonar officer and other crew, all of whom are only weeks past having been yanked from their civilian lives (the XO sold used-cars).

These are interesting characters, but the story of ""Cruel"" doesn't sufficiently incorporate the stories of its officers, or choose one of them to focus on.  ""Cruel"" begins before the fall of France: U-boats haven't yet gained the range benefit of French ports, so they're a rarity, leaving bad weather as the chief foe.  When that changes, and the Atlantic becomes a U-boat shark-tank, the weather becomes the RN's ironic ally, and the seas become truly cruel.  Because the story extends through the war, it has a lot of ground (sea?) to cover, and the effect seems pretty rushed, becoming little more than a series of unconnected stories linked by common character - the ship goes out, convoys get smacked by ""wolfpacks"", the convoys return, the crews realize the futility of seeking rest after sea duty, and the ship goes out again.  There's one great moment in the story, as Ericson realizes that dozens of survivors from a sunk merchantman are floating over a U-boat contact, and he must decide on whether he's going to drop depth charges on them in a likely futile attempt to kill the submerged hunter.  It's a great scene, but one the story passes it over in search of the next story.  Unfortunately, the story relies for cohesion on wearing its heart on its sleeve - we're instantly sympathetic of the lower officers, contemptuous of the bullying XO, admiring of Ericson and so on - that undermine its otherwise effective appearance of docudrama.  There are some moments that stretch belief (such as Denholm Elliot's glamorous wife dolling herself up for a night on the town, belying the deprivations of British war-time life) or just don't look right (German sailors abandon an apparently undamaged U-boat - couldn't they at least have smoke or fire belching from it, or have it sink on an unevenl keel?), but for the most part, ""The Cruel Sea"" tackles an extremely worthwhile subject but offers something less than the sum of its parts.",1164067200,4,2937,4.778656126482214

513674,5,6302763770,"This is a very realistic, semi-documentary account of British convoys in the Atlantic during WW II. We see the men as frightened, lonely, and, above all, dedicated. Jack Hawkins is the captain of the Compass Rose, a ship that gets blown up by a German sub, and from which he and some of his men just barely survive on a raft. He is given another command and we feel most acutely his torment over risking the lives of his men while getting revenge on another German sub. The movie is intelligent and honest, thanks mainly to Eric Ambler's script and top-notch dialogue. Produced in the Ealing Studios and a gem of a movie. Definitely worth a watch.",1134432000,19,647,4.538461538461538
513675,5,6302763770,"This movie is quite faithful to the novel, which was also spectacular.  A good example of the interaction of men thrown together on a ship, at war, in difficult conditions, fighting a cruel sea in an even crueler war.

This should be considered one bookend of the many movies covering the Second World War at sea, in the Atlantic, with the other being ""Das Boot"", covering the same war scenario, from opposite sides of the conflict.

A must see for an understanding and appreciation of the war at sea in WWII.",1120608000,30,509,4.571428571428571
513676,4,6302763770,"If I were asked to recommend three great movies about any Allied or Axis army, navy and air force in World War II, they would be ""The Desert Fox"", ""The Cruel Sea"" and ""Twelve O'Clock High"". All three were made in black and white soon after the war, and all have the unmistakable realism of true accounts.
  ""The Cruel Sea"", based on the famous Nicholas Monsarrat novel of the same title, lend its story beautifully to the stark contrasts and subtle mid-tones of black and white film (you don't get all those mid-tones of grey in color film). The story is grippingly personal, tragic and redeeming, gradually and painfully building the intense bond of camaraderie that seems to be particularly strong among navy people - probably because the sea can be the loneliest and most unforgiving place on earth (hence the title). Recalling the names Compass Rose and Saltash Castle, you'll taste the freezing brine of the North Atlantic, smell the mix of diesel fuel, blood and cordite, and hear the cries of your mates drowning in your wake. The real deal in black and white.",1092960000,7,1067,4.731182795698925
513677,5,6302763770,"This magnificent film does for the British as what the awesome ""Das Boot"" does for the Germans. Yet in many ways, this movie is as much a ""polar opposite"" to the great German film. ""The Cruel Sea"" is about two ships, her captain, the wardroom of Officers, selected enlisted men and spans the length of the war (39-45), ""Das Boot"" is about a single U-boat, her crew and one patrol in 1941. Yet each complements the other. Jack Hawkins is simply superb as Ericson, the reluctant warrior and the rest of the cast is top notch. Fans of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies will recognize a young Denholm Elliot as a young ensign. For me, one of the most gripping scenes is when the ""Compass Rose"" detects a U-boat lurking beneath some survivors floating. Ericson agonizingly orders the attack. As the depth charges explode beneath (killing the survivors, but manages to drive the enemy submarine off), one of his crew yells, ""Bloody murderer!"" and we can see the toll this takes on Ericson. Later that night Lt. Lockhart, the ships executive officer, tries to console the anguished and drunken Ericson who simply says, ""it was the war that killed them...The bloody war,"" this is simply fantastic drama and I think, one of Hawkins' greatest scenes. The film's writer, Eric Ambler (himself a great novelist) captures Nicholas Monserrat's great novel perfectly and while certain scenes from the novel had to be excised, he maintains the story's drive and superb characterizations.

513678,5,6302763770,"This war time drama reflects the desperate struggle of one man, his crew and their ship. HMS Compass Rose, a corvette carrying out her duty in protecting the vulnerable convoys from hunting packs of U-boats in the North Atlantic.
All the experiences of war at sea are portrayed here, as if etched on the faces of the men. We see the effects on HMS Compass's crew having to live with the arduous conditions at sea and the horrors of war, rescuing poor wretched survivors from the sea, choking and covered in oil while all the time in fear of the unseen threat of a U-boat attack.
However, the most memorable scene, and one of which must surely be equal to any other in the history of this type of war film genre, has to be when Captain Ericson (Jack Hawkins) is forced to decide whether or not to attack a U-boat or save a group of survivors in the water directly above his intended target.
Historically after 1942 this dilemma was turned into a blunt order when the Admiralty instructed anti-submarine vessels to make every attempt to destroy a U-boat regardless of survivors in the water and thus carrying out its priority to protect the ships in the convoy. In the book by Herbert Gordon Male 'In All Respects Ready For Sea,' there is a true story of such an attack and the author gives his own account of how he and other survivors came under depth charge attack from a Royal Naval corvette.
My late father served on a anti-submarrine armed trawler during the war and his experiences were of special interest to the films main star, Jack Hawkins whom my father met and became friends.. My father always felt that this film was an important one in that it told a more factual story. More importantly, such personal experiences of the war at sea were often eclipsed by more heroic tales of the Battle of the Atlantic.
Today it is as honest a film as it was then. It shows the effects of war on the ordinary sailor who fought in the longest conflict during the Second World War, The Battle of The Atlantic.
'Cruel Sea' is one of those few films that really show the personal side of war instead of concentrating on the expected pyrotechnics and thrilling action normally associated with the big screen.",1048982400,11,2202,4.535175879396985
513679,5,6302763770,"I have worn out several copies of this video.  You will see other reviewers who find fault with things the movie did or did not portray, but as a historian I can say it captures the essence of serving on a corvette in the North Atlantic better than anything else available(i.e. Corvette K-225 starring Alan Ladd, etc.)  I have had the honor of speaking with vets of the Battle of the North Atlantic who viewed this video and to a man they love this movie.  I can think of no higher praise than concurrance of the men who were actually there.  Field Marshall Erwin Rommel is supposed to have said that ""what is winning the war for the Allies is the two and a half ton truck.  I would respectfully disagree with the Field Marshall, for the trucks never would have made it to Europe without the convoys and this is what the movie captures.",1031270400,,836,4.367741935483871

7831372,5,6302763770,"""The Cruel Sea"" is not one of those movies you watch to see a lot of hyped up action. What this movie does present is a reasonably accurate account of what the small ship war in the North Atlantic was actually like. It portrays the different personalities that you would come into contact with in the small ship Navy and the difficulties faced by the members of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve while adjusting to naval life at sea. As a former member of the Royal Canadian Navy the similarities of what our service went through at this time are very close and I believe that anyone who served or had family serving in the small ship Navy of WWII will find this movie extremely interesting.
