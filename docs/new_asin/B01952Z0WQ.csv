8743999,5,B01952Z0WQ,These videos are great. I am a 2nd degree black belt and was looking for something to keep at the house that I could pop in the dvd player whenever I was practicing and got stuck on a kata. This is great for that. It also is great for teaching you katas you may not know yet. It goes over them once very slowly so you can follow along and then again at the speed the kata should be done. I would highly recommend his dvd set to anyone studying  the art.,1473724800,2,453,3.9239130434782608
