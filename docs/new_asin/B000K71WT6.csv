2737132,1,B000K71WT6,"Avoid this DVD from Desert Island Films.  It looks like it was duped from a third generation video copy, and the sound is nearly inaudible.  If you really want it, wait until somebody puts out a credible version.  This one is grade Z.

  As for the movie itself, it is a rather routine English-made horror flick with Jack Palance as a gay antiques dealer who murders attractive young women to gain monetary rewards from an African idol-god named ""Chuku.""  About all it really has is a typically intense performance from the glowering and scary Mr. Palance.",1356566400,2,556,4.729166666666667
2737133,3,B000K71WT6,"The editing is a bit uneven and the picture quality is less than pristine but that doesn't spoil this horror treat. A good cast headed by Jack Palance, an off beat story, and crisp direction keep ""Craze"" on track.",1356220800,,213,4.487179487179487
2737134,5,B000K71WT6,"Another jem that never made the dvd tranzition.
Creepy flick I saw WAYYYYYY back in the day.
Palance is the original boogie man.
THNX!!",1284681600,,135,4.666666666666667
2737135,5,B000K71WT6,"Craze was originally released in 1974.  Also released under the titles 'The Demon Master', 'Mystic Killer' and 'The Infernal Idol'.  The back of the box reads:

""The proprietor of a Curio Shoppe (Jack Palance) reveres an African Idol he keeps under lock and key in his basement store room where he leads a witchcraft cult.

His obsession with the life-size, hideous artifact turns him into a murderous psychotic.  He begins a series of human sacrifices to appease the evil spirit of the idol.

His prey . . . wealthy, beautiful women.  With each killing, their riches become his.

An investigator (Trevor Howard) suspects the Curio dealer but lacks enough evidence to arrest him.  However, irony has its way and the demon master seals his own fate.""",1222646400,5,749,4.880952380952381
8170122,2,B000K71WT6,"Neal Mottram (Jack Palance) leads a group of pagan god worshipers in black robes in his basement. He discovers if he kills someone, he gets riches. Of course this gets out of hand, arouses suspicion, as Neal sets up an alibi at a B&B.

The story wasn't that well thought out, fairly simple and inane. What made the film unwatchable was the poor quality of the transfer, especially the sound.

8170123,2,B000K71WT6,Could not really watch the movie as picture and sound quality was catastrophically bad.,1466121600,,87,5.285714285714286
8170124,4,B000K71WT6,"I really liked this movie! for your consideration, i included a screen cap to show some of the picture quality. I noticed switching from a high definition tv to a laptop, greatly improved my viewing. Also, keep your volume remote handy, and maybe put on some subtitles. This movie has not been restored, which is a pity because it was so enjoyable.

Now onto the actual review! Neil is an antiques dealer, who is in a tight spot for cash, he acquires an idol, Chuku, and thinks his luck will improve if he offers sacrifices. His ""partner"" associate Ronnie, puts up with things because their luck seems to be changing, but you can tell he isn't in agreement with it. I don't want to give too much away because it is a fantastic movie, with a good cast and plot. I hope this movie gets a remastered release, where they fix the audio and picture quality!",1458432000,,851,4.455128205128205
8170125,5,B000K71WT6,Grade B at its best.,1432944000,,20,3.2
8170126,3,B000K71WT6,Jack Palance is good at being a killer of women.  He does come across as being relatively emotionless.  He does not ever seem English/British in any of the English movies I have seen him in.  He does have some degree of magnetism however.  This movie is different because he is sacrificing women to an African god.  The god pays Jack Palance's character for every death by putting money into Palance's characters desk.,1418860800,,418,4.75
8170127,1,B000K71WT6,"Let's face it; this is a lousy film.  Those who love it, do, and the rest wonder why it was ever made.  My one star review here is not for the film itself (it's a cult favorite), but for the lousy DVD presentation.  This looks like a bad dupe of an old EP VHS tape. The picture is REALLY bad.  But I suppose if this is the only way to get it......  We're stuck with it.  Unless You love this film, avoid this copy.",1401494400,,414,3.869047619047619
8170128,4,B000K71WT6,"CRAZE opens w/ a bizarre ceremony overseen by Neal Mottram (Jack Palance- WELCOME TO BLOOD CITY, ALONE IN THE DARK) complete w/ blood sacrifice. Neal is an unassuming antiques dealer. As such, he's acquired an African idol called Tuku. After a woman is inadvertently skewered on the idol's trident-like spear, Neal finds a thousand dollars worth of gold in an old desk. Later that night, Neal goes out to a club and picks up a beautiful woman. He takes her home, and, among other things, sacrifices her to Tuku! The next day, Neal makes the biggest sale of his life! Of course, Neal is now convinced that Tuku is his own magic cash machine. All he has to do is keep the sacrifices coming and... Presto! Sooo, in order to supply the funding for his suddenly extravagant lifestyle, Neal becomes a serial killer for Tuku, trolling around for hapless victims. Obviously, this simply can't continue. The police are closing in and Neal thinks he's become invincible. He is proven wrong. CRAZE is a twisted tale of insane greed and karmic retribution. Palance is suitably despicable in his devilish role...",1389571200,2,1099,4.8201058201058204
8170129,1,B000K71WT6,"This is an old movie that's been converted to a digital format from original analog, but unlike others it's not been ""re-mastered"", that is not retouched and edited for decent watching and listening in a digital format. The original analog copy must have soaked in a vat of acid prior to the conversion, as the picture sort of weaves to and fro. The movie is set in dreary London, so the drab gray and brown tones don't really make up for the large pixel picture, and the close-ups of the African god doll the lead actor worships, Chako, are nauseating the way they weave around.

The sound is even worse. All of the dialog is muffled and the bass of the background music sounds like it's playing three basements away. Although I've got a surround sound system, I had to crank the volume way up to try to piece together the words. The original analog audio was never buffered with a SAW filter so the highs and lows sort of squeal. Had the plot been a fast-paced, unique thriller, I'd have let the poor digital conversion slide, but pretty much everything about this movie fails, including the plot, writing, setting, costumes, theme, and everything else I mentioned before.

The one positive review of this movie must have been from one of Amazon's writers who HAS to create a somewhat positive review. For those of you old thriller and horror movie buffs, don't waste your money or time. The only thing this film is, is annoying.",1379376000,,1431,4.607843137254902

8170131,2,B000K71WT6,"This DVD is obviously made from a clean but soft 16mm print. The sound is poor and at times
becomes unlistenable. I was hoping for better quality. Buyer beware!",1357430400,2,160,4.551724137931035
