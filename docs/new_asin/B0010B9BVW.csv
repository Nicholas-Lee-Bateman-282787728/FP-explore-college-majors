3048443,4,B0010B9BVW,A beautiful film depicting a family with deaf and hearing members. Shows the struggle on both sides of the debate of cochlear implants. My only problem with it is that the signs are sometimes cut off (i guess they thought it wasn't that important because there's a voice for the deaf actors) : (,1294876800,2,295,4.481481481481482
3048444,5,B0010B9BVW,"I think the producers of this movie did an excellent job of presenting the personal issues surrounding making a decision to give a deaf child a cochlear implant - from both the Deaf (culturally Deaf) and Hearing perspectives.  Without being dogmatic or corny, the movie really makes you feel for both sides.  Regardless of what perspective you take on cochlear implants, the movie really does present pros and cons from both sides that come across as very real life - not just theories and arguments.  You realize there is more than making such a decision than meets the eye.  Excellent movie.  Love Marlee in this.",1293667200,,615,4.819047619047619

3048446,5,B0010B9BVW,"WOW this movie really hits the nail on the head. First it talks about a subject that is vary controversial in the deaf community about Co-clear Implants. You meet a family with a hearing father, a deaf mother and a now deaf son. But it don.t start you off there where you meet them is in a court room where a father and mother are in the middle a court battle on who was going to get there son the father or the mother. The father wants the son to go and live with him because he thinks he could provide for him better and wants what he thinks will be a better life for him by getting him a Co-Clear Implant. The father thinks that this will give him back his son.

As the story tell you go back to see where it all started at the sons birthday part you can see the spit strait down the family between the grandparents who can sign (Who are even deaf them selves) to the parents who are hearing and don't sign at all. When the son winds up in the hospital and the father is talking with the doctor you could see how the doctor planted the seed that starts to make the father think that his son has an illness that could be cured with a simple operation and as the movie goes on you see how the mother reacts to this.

Enter in the mother (Played by Marlee Matlin) who feels that there son has gone though on major change in his life by just going deaf and wants to let him be himself and except who he is as a deaf person. The mother who is deaf herself feels that there is nothing wrong with her son or herself for being deaf. But she sees and understands her husband but wants him to see another thing there son with though so much as she watched him slowly lose his hearing and how scared he was and that this Implant could do more harm that it could do good.

After she says her peace the court room is dismissed for the weekend and the mother and son spend another night together with out the father and you can see how they find them self's better together then apart. I don't want to spoil the ending for everyone but I will say that it does leave it open ended for you though it makes you think is it right for you or is it right for that person?? But most of all who should decide??",1267142400,9,2191,4.020642201834862
3048447,5,B0010B9BVW,An excellent movie that presents a balanced view of the challenges of the Deaf community.  The story is entertaining and the message is powerful.  It doesn't hold back on depicting the prejudices of the hearing world that thinks it knows best for everyone else.  The movie is equally candid about the arrogance found in Deaf circles that may lead some to exclude genuine desires to help.  This is a movie about the clash of two worlds and the struggle to control rather than accept others.  The lessons are applicable in any social setting.,1240963200,20,540,4.763440860215054
3048448,5,B0010B9BVW,I love how the different perspectives are displayed in the roles played in the movie!  I am very pleased how deaf culture and the controversies that occur and still are being fought on cochlear implants. I want parents to know that the cochlear implant isn't a fix and this is a decision each parent needs to be aware of the consequences for the decision they make either way they do.,1221609600,17,384,4.485714285714286

8237591,5,B0010B9BVW,"This is an incredible movie with a bad technical issue  I'll start with the good.
It's an EXCELLENT movie about deaf culture! It's ASL heavy which is fabulous with voice overs for the hearing people who don't know sign. However, not all of it is in ASL. As in most Marlee Matlin movies, there are shots of the world from her POV, so you can see what she deals with as a deaf person in a hearing world.  It deals with the cochlear Implant debate and shows how such an issue can just rip a normally happy family apart. The writer and director does a great job of presenting both sides; that of the deaf family members who are against CI and the hearing members who are FOR CI. No matter which side of this debate you are on, the movie is so well written that you feel for both sides, even if you don't agree, like so many things in life can be.
 All the characters play their parts so well and you quickly fall in love with them,  then later, out of love with a few of their choices and behaviors. This is a MUST SEE for EVERYONE. Deafies will get it, and the hearing world viewers will have a smidge deeper understanding about what it means to be Deaf (with a capital D). It also does a good job of showing a glimpse of being a deaf woman in a deaf culture but also what is means to be a deaf mother and then a deaf mother of a deaf child, in a deaf culture and also in hearing world. Obviously, it only skims on this topic. {If you want a deeper sight into that, then after you watch this, go watch Sound and Fury and take your kleenex.}
Now the bad part. I saw this years ago and had been watching it again on the Hallmark channel, then I lost my hearing and tried to watch it, but there were no CC's.(closed captions) So I ordered the DVD and I don't know if it's me or my technology or what but I can't watch it now because the dvd menu says no CC's available, which I question, because Marlee Matlin has fought so hard and for so many years for CC's. So maybe I'm technology ignorant and am doing something wrong, but I have tried everything everywhere to get them on to no avail. And it really stinks because this is one of my FAVORITE movies. I highly recommend you do this, because it's and EXCELLENT movie!!! You will love it I'm sure.",1499817600,,2243,4.125858123569794
8237592,4,B0010B9BVW,"I really enjoyed this movie. My only gripe was the deaf actors being dubbed over and the signs being cut off in some of the frames.
 The dub actors for the grandfather and grandmother were good. But (1) I love Marlee's real voice and (2) to be frank the actress who spoke for her fell flat. It felt like she was reading.. not acting... I would have rathered Marlee speak herself or just have subtitles. I'm sure because it was hallmark they probably felt the movie would be too quite to leave ASL parts be, which is a shame. But OTHER THAN THAT it was well written, and wonderfully performed. If I can find it, I will get the DVD.",1499126400,,630,4.25
8237593,5,B0010B9BVW,"Loved this movie about Deaf and Hearing in the family and the love that flowed throughout.  Have watched it several times and have determined this to be one of my classic Hallmark movies, along with the 1985 movie, Love is Never Silent.  The storyline was well thought out and the acting was great.  In addition to the voicing and speaking, I am glad they also included the reality of using American Sign Language in this movie.  I thought the voice overs for the deaf characters in the movie were very smooth with their tonality for age and inflections.  You know a movie is good when it ends nicely and then you start wanting to expand it more.  It was nice to see how the actors who played the maternal grandparents in this movie had gracefully aged from when they were younger in the movie, Love is Never Silent.",1496793600,,816,4.47972972972973
