3533389,5,B001DJLCR2,"People have been complaining about the changes in the show the producers have made, but I say as long as we have Ed and Joy the laughter is enough and they are the main reason people are watching the show. It is funny and Hilarious.",1262390400,,232,4.177777777777778
3533390,3,B001DJLCR2,"I was excited to see Brad Garrett of Raymond fame star in his own show. With Joely Fisher as his wife, Joy, and Step and Jeff Woodcock as his younger neighbors, the show becomes a running comedic commentary on marriage. The episodes contrast the two couples, old vs. young, cynical vs. naive, in a series of bizarre scenarios.

Unfortunately, the show seemed to get a bit too comfortable and routine in the second season. Unlike his character Robert in ""Raymond,"" Garrett's character in ""Til Death"" gets a bit too cynical, and thus boring. Joy just gets on my nerves. The Woodcocks turn out to be the funniest characters, making it all the worse that season 2 was their last. While it's funny and certainly good for a few laughs, I never found myself really falling in love with the show or the characters.",1261958400,7,806,4.636363636363637
3533391,3,B001DJLCR2,"I loved season one... not for the clean humor, but for the realistic humor. I don't agree with how the couples always treat each other, but much can be learned from both couples. However, the second season is lacking the originality of the first. Though, they are still enjoyable, I'm not as eager to sit down and watch them (and have yet to complete the last few episodes).",1259020800,9,374,4.514705882352941

3533432,5,B001DJLCR2,"We loved this series, even though we discovered it a little late. Bought the DVD's which are a hoot! If you are married, you will absolutely ""get it"". Our only criticism is that the show seemed to decline as it went along. The seasons can quite literally be ranked in order 1, 2, 3. We were still getting a charge out of it through the second season. Buy season 1 first. It will hook you.",1396224000,,388,4.1866666666666665
3533433,5,B001DJLCR2,It's a good show which the Fox network screwed over as always It really is a shame - I liked it a lot!!!,1394668800,,104,3.5652173913043477
3533434,5,B001DJLCR2,I like this show...I heard that the first two Seasons are the ONLY ones on DVD...I can't seem to find the remaining seasons )-; If you like comedy this one should be added to the collection ;-),1391212800,,193,4.243243243243243

Waiting on the next 2 seasons to come out on DVD.",1388275200,,128,3.740740740740741
3533436,5,B001DJLCR2,Season 2 was just as good as season 1. It is very disappointing that this show was a victim of the writers strike which left many episodes unaired until season 3.,1384819200,,162,4.258064516129032
3533437,5,B001DJLCR2,Great comedy sitcoms don't have to end so soon still trying to get the 3rd and 4th season please help me someone!,1382227200,,113,4.181818181818182

3533441,1,B001DJLCR2,"Let's see.  What can I say about this show that is somewhat favorable?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever watched.  That Brad guy is a total moron, just like he was on ""Everybody Loves raymond.""  I think I've forced myself to watch it maybe three times during my insomnia spells on some weird channel.  Man, it is bad.  I can't believe some of you actually gave it decent ratings?????",1359417600,,427,4.5394736842105265
3533442,5,B001DJLCR2,"I love Brad Garrett. He is an excellent actor. I was sad to see this show go but I think it would have survived longer had it not been for the writer's strike. If you are expecting Everybody Loves Raymond, think again.  This is a different show but BG is still great, totally different character.  He and Jolie work very well together and they are believable as a couple.  If you are wanting a good comedy I would definitely recommend this to anyone of any age.  This show is about how an older couple (BG and JF) and how they compare to the newlywed couple that moved across the street.  The comedy is funny because it is based on real life scenarios, you can see them playing out in everyday life.  Love it, super funny, need to buy!",1358121600,,735,4.2898550724637685
3533443,4,B001DJLCR2,Newlyweds move next door to a couple of veterns. Shows both sides of view between the two couples and the people themselves. Delightful.,1357862400,,136,4.956521739130435

3533445,5,B001DJLCR2,I could watch this comedy all day long...I can't believe I missed this show when it was on regular tv.,1356652800,,102,4.15
3533446,4,B001DJLCR2,I can't wait to watch season two this is the only show that makes me laugh out loud.seem like its not getting good reviews but I still want to see it for myself it was hard to find,1354924800,,180,3.763157894736842
3533447,5,B001DJLCR2,"Til Death is a real entertaining show I have both seasons, but I want to be able to purchase the other 2 seasons, but their not available . This show should have been on going for alot longer then it did, thats how great it was, but it was only shown on a Friday night. To BAD, Great Comedy !!",1328918400,,293,3.9

3533449,3,B001DJLCR2,Season 1 and Season 2 are good.  It went downhill after that the Woodcocks were fired from the show and the replacements over the next seasons could not carry the show.  Not counting the 3 or 4 actress's who played the daughter. Brad Garrett isn't funny enough to carry the show and the constant cast replacements indicated that the show was dead.  It was later admitted that various budget cuts were made so FOX could make enough episodes for the rerun market.  Without Thomas and Foster this show died quick death.,1288742400,5,516,4.637362637362638
3533450,5,B001DJLCR2,"'Til Death is one of my favorite television comedies of all time. Anyone who has been married for a while can easily relate to many of the situations humorously portrayed in the show. The contrast between the veteran married couple and the newly married couple are thought-provoking, evoke a lot of memories and are a lot of fun. If you and your spouse are looking for something to make you step back, laugh, and appreciate what you have in your own relationship, this is a show you will enjoy.",1268870400,,494,4.561797752808989
3533451,5,B001DJLCR2,"I really enjoy the show. It is down to earth realistic situations that I can relate to.  It takes a lot to make me laugh, and sometimes I have been know to chuckle when watching these.",1265155200,,184,4.111111111111111

8293867,2,B001DJLCR2,Not as good as the first ones.  The show really went downhill.,1515801600,,62,4.166666666666667
8293868,3,B001DJLCR2,"Season 1 of 'Til Death was hilarious and sweet. The interactions between the long-married (Sharks) and the newlyweds (Woodcocks) made for a lot of sweet and darkly funny moments. Season 2 starts out very well with the first 6 episodes continuing where season one left off. However, during the middle of season two this show ""Jumps the Shark"" with the addition of J.B. Smoove as the wise-talking black guy which forces The Woodcocks into the background. 'Til Death became a completely different show and not a funny one.",1494288000,,519,4.909090909090909
