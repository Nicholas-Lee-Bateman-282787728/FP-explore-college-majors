1863058,5,B00008W41B,"I am a german who lives in the USA (Nebraska) for one year as a foreign exchange student.
I watched this movie in germany and showed it to my classmates on dvd here! After watching it, they understood the whole situation so much better!!! And even though its a historical movie it was a LOT of fun to watch!
Getting a dvd player that accepts 2-dvds was very hard though thats why i'm glad it is released in american standard now, too!!
Awesome movie that everybody should watch!!!",1078012800,3,480,4.465909090909091
1863059,5,B00008W41B,"Oh my goodness!  This was such a great movie!  I loved it!  I watched it in my German culture class while I was studying abroad at the University of Regensburg, Germany, and thought it was a great film!  It was a very interesting insight into the lives of the people who lived in East Germany and their customs.  For me personally, it was also an eye opener and dispelled some of the stereotypes I had formed in my mind of the DDR.  On top of that, it was just a funny movie (it is intended, from what I understand, to be a comedy, so I didn't feel bad about laughing).  It's also just a great story about the love one son had for his mother (in what many Americans would consider a very twisted way...maybe many Germans too).  I'm so excited that this movie is coming to the US, and can't wait for it to be released on DVD...I don't have a DVD player that plays region 2, so I'm stuck waiting for it to come out here!  LOL  I have only one simple warning:  this is not what I would call the ""best"" movie for a beginning German student to watch, as the language is very difficult to understand.  I had been studying German for over 6 years when I first saw this movie, and it was still very difficult for me to understand.  However, it's still a great story.  Well, I hope this was helpful, and I hope you all enjoy this movie.;)",1077667200,,1329,4.1607843137254905

1863089,4,B00008W41B,"If you know anything at all about the Soviet period and in particular about the partition of Germany, this is a delightful movie. It's especially good on the nostalgia factor, which is as rich as the plot line itself. Add in some good acting and deft direction and you have a lighthearted examination of the lure of the old communist world for a few of its more idealistic inhabitants.

If you're interested in the period and the location, it's worth watching this movie and then going to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) which is absolutely superb and provides a much darker but equally revealing view into a world that vanished overnight, leaving behind two societies (Ossies and Wessies) who even twenty years later struggle to reconcile and deal with the present.",1488931200,,778,4.8059701492537314

1863116,4,B00008W41B,"A gently ironic movie that pokes fun at capitalism and socialism while focusing on the strengths and foibles of individual people and family, Goodbye Lenin's conceit is that a woman in East Berlin whose husband defected to the West ten years earlier is in a heart attack-induced coma while Berlin goes through its reunification; when she emerges from the coma, her son goes to great lengths to prevent her from be shocked into another heart attack by pretending East Berlin and its socialist state still exist. While celebrated almost universally, the fall of the wall and the events leading up to it and surrounding it, were not without human trauma and cost, which Goodbye Lenin shows poignantly.

This German movie moves more slowly than American movies, and its humor is more subtle. You may think it drags in parts, and you''ll probably chuckle rather than guffaw. Its final two scenes, which I did not anticipate, are perfect, and, when appreciated, elevate the message of the movie greatly.

The movie is in German with subtitles that are very easy to follow and not distracting. Brief male full frontal nudity; comically grotesque female front nudity; and some crude language.",1481068800,,1184,5.00507614213198

1863170,5,B00008W41B,"I watched this film again after reading of a few German citizens being charged with the ""constitutional crime"" of wearing armbands with symbols similar to those worn by the old Eastern Free German Youth.  This vindictiveness - a full generation after unification - remains part and parcel of the entire ""Anschluss"" of 1989.  What a contrast to this film's thoughtful, gently ironic, even wistful treatment of Die Wende years. If the ""East German"" regime was a work of fiction, a consciously self-deceiving political theater, it was one that gave meaning to otherwise empty, drab lives, as portrayed by Kathrin Sass' ""Mutter.""  Keeping the fiction going for her peace of mind might seem like furthering a cruel deception - until her dutiful son Alex discovers the turned tables of her own past.  It's a pity that the spirit and warmth of this film could not have found its way into the state and official society of the German Federal Republic.

Interesting that this film was censored in ways that would have seemed familiar to old East German audiences. Most of the cut scenes had to do with weed smoking, considered too unseemly I suppose for respectable American audiences.  In doing so certain key points in the film's narrative were lost or blurred.  I suppose this is the movie's final twist of fate.  All in all a film that has only ripened with time like a prime wine.",1467590400,,1376,4.8008474576271185

The father escapes to the West and leaves his wife and two children behind. Years later the patriotic mother has a heart attack and goes into a coma. While she's unconscious, Germany reunifies. A doctor advises the now adult son that she can't have any shocks. He spends a lot of energy and creativity trying to convince her that things are just like they were before she went into a coma.

1863232,5,B00008W41B,"Such a wonderfully funny and touching movie about the last days of the East German government, the 1989 opening of the Berlin Wall, and the months leading up to and just beyond the actual unification of the two German states! While we in the USA probably saw nothing admirable in that smothered Communist land, in fact many of its people did -- the general social consciousness of the people, the determination to provide a social safety net, and for all those not in the governing classes a sense of equality and mutual caring.

But now we know that was a sham, a lie, concealing one of the most brutal surveillance states since Stalin's death.  Want proof, get the even more powerful film, ""The Lives of Others,"" which shows how lovers, friends, married couples, colleagues and even children were forced to spy on their closest and dearest friends and relatives.  Watch the presence of the secret policeman in the basement taping the protagonist and his friends and family.  Look carefully and you will see the infamous sealed Mason jars, the ones known as scent jars, in which the Stasi sealed articles of clothing, skin swipes, and more. Should they have to send the bloodhounds on the trail of an ""enemy of the state"", they didn't have to look far to give the dog a sniff of his target!

In both movies the office of Erich Mielke, the head of the Stasi is accurate to the last detail.  I know; I've been to the Normannenstrasse Stasi HQ (now a museum), sat in the monster's chair, and even taken coffee and a pastry in the senior officers' canteen.  If you want to see the face of tyranny, by all means watch both movies. It's a more worthwhile evening binge than any fiction.

For sheer fun mixed with a lot of visual history, watch ""Good Bye Lenin!"" Without fail!  For the required antidote, get ""Lives of Others"" immediately after.

The production values of both films are excellent. The mixing of actual footage with that shot for the films themselves is top notch. And for a more historical viewpoint, ""Bridge of Spies"" should be on your must-watch list. All three will give you spellbound evenings. And you will laugh and cry through ""Good bye Lenin.""

Goodness.  I forgot to give a plot summary of GBL. The mother of a small family is stricken with a heart attack just before the Wall opens. Her surgeons and cardiologists caution her children that she must never again receive a psychological shock. By the time she comes out of her coma, East Germany has been bought byWest Germany, East products, including her favorite pickles are no longer available, EasternTV is gone so the family has to produce daily Ossi TV with stories about new tractors and meeting potato growing quotas, and weather reports which stop at the old border. The need to make East German sausages in fake packages, along with the pickles and the need to round up dozens of Trabants so Mama hears and smells the old traffic.  But finally Mama gets bored being kept in bed, and demands outings, and Therein lies the unraveling of the whole thing.  To tell even more would be to introduce too too many spoilers.

I loved all three movies I've mentioned above. But I'm weird because I've walked most of the streets portrayed, had a micro-hand in ending the Wall, and count Berlin as one of the world's most exciting cities.",1454457600,5,3306,4.666092943201377

Good Bye Lenin is a movie put together by East Germans that lived through this historical event.  It is very realistic and a lot of fun at the same time.

1863292,5,B00008W41B,"I saw this movie when it came out around 2003 but this DVD version is different.  It must be the original German version as it appears to contain more political and sociological information whereas the edited American version focused more on the film's comedy and drama.

The film starts with documentary footage of life in East Germany including the official 40th anniversary celebrations of the regime, just a month before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  It is October 1989 and street demonstrations in East Berlin against the government are increasing.  The main character is a school teacher who is a socialist idealist with a moderate personality.  She accidently runs into one of these demonstrations and sees her adult son being arrested.  This shock causes her to have a heart attack and fall into a coma.  She is in her late forties, slim, and fairly attractive, hardly a candidate for a heart attack.  But having her playing that role works well as she attracts the viewer's attention.

She stays in the coma for eight months.  Meanwhile East Germany has undergone great changes as it has been economically and culturally absorbed by West Germany.  Formal political unification is just a few months away.  When she comes out of the coma doctors decide that the shock of knowing the changes will be too much for her, so her son decides to create a world for her where she thinks she is still in the old East Germany.

She is eventually taken home in an ambulance where she cannot see what is going on in the streets.  The son and daughter had quickly gotten rid of their new western furniture and replaced it with her old drab eastern furniture which was held in storage.  But the biggest problem is supplying her with the food she is used to.  The son solves this problem by finding old East German food containers in dumpsters and old food products in apartments abandoned by East Germans having escaped to the west.  One of his main activities becomes pouring West German food products into these old containers.

Meanwhile the West German government has agreed to exchange West German marks for relatively worthless East German marks but the deadline for doing so is fast approaching.  The son and daughter ask the mother to let them control her money.  She demands to know why and the son suddenly announces that the East German Trabant car she ordered is ready for pickup.  She is overjoyed to learn that the car is ready only three years after ordering it.  She is definitely still in the old East Germany.

Being bedridden she wants to watch television which has now completely changed.  The son secretly attaches a VCR to the television and plays old tapes of East German programs.  Since these programs all predictably praised the advance of socialism in the same way, the mother doesn't notice that they are out of date.  But this cannot go on forever and the son gets his aspiring filmmaker friend to produce fake news programs on video tape.  Nevertheless the mother starts noticing things like a Coke sign visible through her window.  The son comes up with a really ridiculous story to explain it.

When her birthday arrives the son arranges for a visit by her friends, neighbors, former students, and the principal of her school.  They wear their drab East German clothes and pretend nothing has happened.  One new person is the daughter's boyfriend who is West German.  He flubs his rehearsed lines but the mother says nothing as she is a nice person.

But the film is not all comedy.  The main non-comedic drama concerns the father who fled to the west in 1978.  The son travels from the family's drab East Berlin apartment to find his father in an upscale West Berlin suburb.  He has remarried and has new children.

What this film really shows, without making it explicit, is how a whole country could engage in a political fantasy which vanished overnight.  Suddenly there was basically no one left to defend the old system, except for various pensioners who hated all the changes.",1423353600,,4008,4.755072463768116

Perhaps, because the film is about love -- the love of a son for his mother.  The political message is kept low key and free of dogma, but it is there for any who cares to pay attention.

1863364,5,B00008W41B,"I came across the super comedy a number of years ago when I was staying in Germany. I have a number of friends from Rostock Eastern Germany and as a lecturer in International Relations in the USA, have talked endlessly about life in the former Warsaw Pact countries with Czech, Polish and German friends. This film looks at the collapse of the GDR from one family's perspective in a way that mirrors what I was told happened by my friends.

The plot is simple but intriguing. It begins in the closing days of the GDR. The narrative is given by Alexander (Daniel Bruhl), who is an unhappy young man living in a claustrophobic system, which he feels is oppressing him. He lives with his mother, a devout communist since her husband fled to the West and sister in a small communist flat in East Berlin. Alexander is involved in a demonstration and gets arrested in front of his mother. The shock of his arrest brings on a heart attack which leaves her in a comma for a number of months. Whilst the mother is in the comma the GDR collapses, the wall comes down, western goods and eventually money flood into the East, the sister finds a West German boyfriend, the family flat gets a western make over and many peoples lives change. When the mother awakens, the doctors are afraid a shock may kill her, so being a devout communist and fearing finding out there is no GDR any more, Alexander decides to keep what has happened secret from his mother, with hysterical consequences.

Whilst the film is humorous it is also quite a sad and reflective film. It shows that not everything changed for the best and all things western had their personal and societal costs. The tension between East and West Germans, which I felt when I lived in Wurzburg in 1990 and Luneburg in 1992, comes across brilliantly. The characterisations used in the film are all sublime. The cost to East German society is left wide open so all can see in terms of, unemployment, alcoholism and the consequences for the family of an escapee to the West. I actually use this film in my USA International Relations classes, to show students that not everything was bad behind the Iron Curtain and that there was a severe societal cost to the wall coming down and the westernisation process.

I think this film is sublime representation on life in an Eastern Bloc country and how the country changed due to westernisation. It is a comedy but it also shows the negative side to all the changes that happened in 1989 and 1990. I think this is the best German comedy I have seen in many years. My version had great English subtitles.

1863365,5,B00008W41B,"An original creation that places you in the middle of the debate between Communism and Capitalism without rhetorical slant. Daniel Brhl portrays the caring son who believes protecting his mothers' fragile health includes recreating her bedroom as the older East Germany, an island to modern day. His mission is honorable and his insight is charming in a film that cannot be categorized (and isn't that great to be able to say?). The narrative is both comedic and sad and portrayed against history in a neighborhood that can't help but fall prey to the modern world. The deeper story line weaves in and out and that heart of the film is strongly and sweetly felt. This German film is on a par with the French film ""Amelie"" for its ability to make us friends with a young character from childhood to young adult in a personal crisis and aided by the same songwriter/pianist with the perfect touch.

The unusual story and visual backdrops of this story really just grease the slides for something deeper that I feel is the true heart and soul of it; namely, the intertwined questions ""What is Love?"", and ""Should he have told her the truth?"".  The latter question emerges no more than a third of the way through in the form of ""WILL he tell her the truth?"".  That question morphs into ""should he?"" as the mother begins to regain herself and reveals some secrets about the family's past, until at the end we're left hanging on it.  So should he have?  We'll never know.  The first question, though, is clearly what drove the son's own decision about how to handle his mother's predicament.

Personally I was disturbed by the ending, because either of two equally-plausible alternatives could have brought it home better for me.  I almost gave the movie a '3' for that, but, it has too many other things going for it to be just average.  My real rating is 3.5.",1349568000,,1264,4.632286995515695

On her insistence, we watched it and I was very pleasantly surprized - here is a comedy, at turns political and personal, but always with an edge of realism and irony.  If you are interested in the personal side of reunification, this is also very good evocation and provides food for discussion, also very good for learning.

The story is about a broken East German family:  the father went to the West and disappeared, leaving his wife and two children in the East.  The mother had a nervous breakdown, coming out of it gradually to become a leader.  During the upheaval 10 years later, she has a heart attack and falls into a coma, just when E Germany collapses.  When she wakes up, to avoid life-threatening trauma, they don't tell her about the reunification and go to increasingly absurd lengths to hide it from her.  A lot of this is funny, but after a while it becomes a terrible strain.  As life goes on, they work to resolve many issues, all the time struggling in the new society under development. It is interesting and well done on many levels, with great attention to detail, and always funny.  It is a masterpiece of political satire but real enough to be a drama as well.

1863440,4,B00008W41B,"In 2003, director Wolfgang Becker's film ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" (written by Bernd Lichtenberg and Becker) became a major success in the box office making over $79 million worldwide and the film won six European Film Awards and a winner of nine German Film Awards.  The film would feature cinematography by Martin Kukula and music by Yann Tiersen (""Am&eacute;lie"", ""Night Shift"", ""In Your Wake"").

VIDEO:

""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Picture quality varies as there are some parts that utilize old archived footage of East and West Germany ala 1989-1990 and tries to mix them with the more modern cinematography.  Modern cinematography is good but at times, I did see some parts with some haloing issues.  The film does utilize CG for a variety of scenes in order to make current Germany ala 2001 look like German in 1990, so the filmmakers and crew had a lot of work in trying to recreate that time period.

Picture quality is good for DVD but I hope this is one title that Sony Pictures Classics considers for a possible Blu-ray release in the near future.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is presented in German Dolby Digital 5.1.  The dialogue and music is clear and understandable through the center and front channels.  Good use of surround channels for fireworks and other sound effects.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Good Bye, Lenin!"" was no doubt a major hit in Germany, especially for those who are nostalgic by the sight of familiar foods to the various news footage of that time.  Although I'm sure I'm missing out on certain details that Germans would easily pick up, I did find myself quite entertained by the actual ruse and how long can Alex keep it going for his mother.

While described as a comedy film, it's important to note that it is not comedy in the American sense, and if anything, I would call it more of a black comedy with a mixed style of elements as it also is a coming-of-age film, a dramatic film and also a tragic film.

I may not fully understand how it was like living in East Germany, let alone the West but I can feel sympathy to the characters in that life has changed so much for them during the unification.  Used to the GDR way, GDR products and government services, all was gone during the unification and in many ways, it was a new beginning. And I've read that the film's popularity resides within the nostalgia of the benefits from those services back then.

But for me, I just found it so entertaining of how far Alex would go to keep his mother alive, to not scare her and to make her final year of living as comfortable as possible.  This is a son's love for his mother, having to see what had happen to her without their father, to see her suffer a nervous breakdown and I'm sure that sense of guilt has haunted him in the fact that he is responsible for his mother being hospitalized and putting her in a coma.

The faux news broadcasts created by Alex and Denis was very clever and the overall performance by Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Katrin Sa&szlig; was fantastic.  Also, one of my favorite German actors Burghart Klau&szlig;ner (""The White Ribbon"", ""The Edukators""), despite a shorter role, did a tremendous job playing the father who makes his return.  I felt that Wolfgang Becker did a wonderful job in making sure to convey to the 3D artists of capturing that 1989-1990 look especially in 2001 and also giving us that sense that the film had taken place long ago.  Wonderfully edited and the music by Yann Tiersen was also as noticeable.

I know I am reviewing this DVD a little late in 2010 versus 2003 but it's still a wonderful film from Sony Pictures Classics which I hope is released on Blu-ray in the near future.  As for the DVD, print quality is good (not great), audio quality is good (love the use of the surrounds for this film) and there are a good number of lengthy special features and two commentary tracks as well.

""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is not a political film, nor does it try to be.  But there is a political message.  If anything, the film has an entertaining storyline that hooks people due to nostalgia and also serves as a goodbye to a belief one had to the past but also a goodbye as we know the mother, the inspiration of the ruse, does not have much time left in this world.  But also to see Alex reconstructing Germany that his mother can understand and possibly appreciate.

Once again, I'm sure this film probably hits home to a lot of Germans and probably for those who lived in East Germany.  To see how consumerism and the changes in society came upon them quite quickly and it was a perspective of life that I have never really thought about until I watched this film.  So, I actually enjoyed the fresh storyline and enjoyed this film a lot.

Overall, ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is a very good film and Sony Pictures Classics really gave this film an awesome release on DVD back in 2003.  But hopefully the reconsider this film for a Blu-ray release in 2010/2011.  Definitely worth watching!",1285286400,3,6420,4.68722073279714

1863442,3,B00008W41B,"It must help to be German of a certain age to appreciate what this film sets out to do. To write a farce-melodrama that's also about the impact of reunification on life in the former GDR is a bit more than this 2-hour film can bring off well for someone from somewhere else. There are moments of inspired brilliance, especially the home-made TV news broadcasts created to perpetuate the ruse that the GDR is not only still intact but has become the refuge of thousands fleeing the West. And that idea works on more than one level. It's a sitcom contrivance that also resonates with social and political significance, given the use of ""news"" to shape public opinion by portraying anything as something other than what it is, no matter how far-fetched.

Finally there are too many ideas in the movie, which is not always a criticism I'd make, but when they operate on different levels of credibility, it's hard to know how much disbelief to suspend in some scenes. Irony may be the surer ground for working out narrative conflicts like this, but the film loses its footing when it has trouble being serious and comic at the same time. And as another reviewer has pointed out, the excesses of the GDR are an unacknowledged shadow in the background that complicates the more light-hearted intentions of the film. It's no waste of time, as some here have suggested, but don't expect to be swept away by its cleverness or insight either.",1272931200,,1431,4.678571428571429

1863459,5,B00008W41B,"An excellent film that's easy to watch, thought-provoking, very humourous and with many moving moments on both a personal and profound historical level.

The film begins during pre-unification tensions in East Germany.  As the children's father has already defected, the result is that the deserted mother pours her life and soul into the socialist ideal.  With this as a background we are then brought into the reunification of East and West Germany under the guise of keeping a fragile mother, a dedicated party loyalist who's been in a coma for 8 months, under the illusion that the East and West are still separate - when in fact the wall has come down already and society has changed.  The effort to keep up the facade for the sake of her well-being (she has suffered a heart attack already and the doctor warns against any further shock) proves difficult under the new conditions of having merged with the West.  In the children's effort to keep up and even create the illusion of pre-unification East Germany for 'her well-being', the audience is brought into the world that was.

This is the kind of film that educates, enlightens and entertains, as it acknowledges a reality from 'the other side' and certainly one that once lurked deep in the subconscious of the whole world.  It's scope goes beyond East and West Germany.  For anyone that lived through the cold war, this film will stir your soul and cause you to marvel at what has been and how time changes the face of reality.",1245715200,,1490,4.748062015503876

You have the older people who miss some of the stability of their previous life, those who wouldn't necessarily go back but don't like all of the trappings of western society, and the young who adapt to western culture even though it isn't as perfect as it might have seemed.

1863464,3,B00008W41B,"Wolfgang Becker's 2003 film, Good Bye Lenin!, is not a great film, but it is far better than the usual Hollywood tripe, as well as being a cut above most independent films released by filmmakers not named John Sayles. The two hour long film was written by Becker, Bernd Lichtenberg, Hendrik Handloegten, Christoph Silber, and Achim von Borries, and has a unique, if strained premise- that as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 a devout East German Communist flunky, Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sa), who lived in East Berlin fell into a coma after a heart attack and when she woke eight months later, her whole world changed, but her devoted son decides to recreate the fallen state so as to not be such a great shock to his mother's system.
  While the machinations that the son, Alex Kerner (Daniel Brhl- a better looking Ashton Kutcher), his girlfriend Lara (Chulpan Khamatova)- a Russian nurse who was tending to Christiane, sister Ariane (Maria Simon), brother-in-law Rainer (Alexander Beyer), and neighbors go to reveal an occasional chuckle, the film could really have been something special- and great, had it played the drama closer to reality. This is not to say that there are not sweet and funny moments, but they cannot compare with such a great premise and the potential for a real exploration into the human psyche and politics' place within it could have provided. That said, the film, as is, is a very good one, and the acting is stellar. So is how the film deftly avoids falling into being a screed or one dimensional propaganda piece against Communism. We can see the failings of that system when we see how Alex struggles to get a certain type of pickle brand, Spreewald pickles, so his mother will not know the difference. When we see him and his friend Denis (Florian Lukas) ridiculously try to simulate old East German tv newscasts we see how self-defeating a system that denies ingenuity and individuality is. To wave that about as a club is bastardizing the art of the film. If only more artists would learn what Becker's film knows.
What makes Good Bye Lenin! work as a film is not its political implications, nor the political setup, but the human moments, and it is the relative lack of them vis--vis the film's length that make the film both a joy and bit of a disappointment, for it seems to be a mix of the old television movie of the week formula from the 1970s and a European arts film, and does not fully succeed either way. The film's lack of poesy is its greatest flaw. But, taken as it is, Good Bye Lenin! is a most worthwhile film and a good chronicle of a clan in an era now passed, long passed, it seems. If other films failed as well as this one does, well, would not success really be a thing?",1221091200,,2726,4.584016393442623

1863466,5,B00008W41B,"Some things are painful in life. As a life-long anti-Stalinist, pro-socialist militant the demise of the Democratic Republic of Germany and its theory of ""socialism in half a country"" and later, on its heels, the demise of the Soviet Union and its theory of ""socialism in one country"" were nevertheless social disasters of historic proportions for me. One result is that we live in the age of the one superpower world dominated by the United States and its genuine capacity for making trouble, militarily unchecked by any other power. Friends there is nothing good about that. Witness Iraq and many other hot spots in the world.

But enough of that because, despite my obvious different political take on what happened in East Germany in late 1989 and early 1990, this film Good Bye, Lenin is a very interesting view on what happened to one fictionalized family of mixed political and social sensibilities during that period. The film has been advertised as a comedy, and although there are some funny moments like the various attempts by some of the characters, including the main character son Alex, to create alternate social universes, there is more than a hint of satire (and sometimes localized `insider' satire) here. And satire is a very precious commodity in an age where everything is taken literally, whether it should be or not. Thus, a good prescription is -fight hard for your politics but take a minute to see humor in the sometimes absurd ways of this wicked old world.

The device used to create the central plot in this film has a long pedigree, although I believe that it might be the first time that it has been used in an attempt to preserve socialist reality. Quickly outlined, a son (the previously mentioned Alex) attempts, almost manically at times, to create ""socialism in one bedroom"" for his ailing mother who upon awaking in 1990 after eight months from a coma induced by a heart attack after witnessing him being beaten by the Statsi needs to, on doctor's advise, avoid any `excitement' on pains of relapse (and possible death). The dramatic tension revolves around an ever-widening and bizarre conspiracy (including drawing in his skeptical Russian girlfriend, his sister, her boyfriend, the neighbors, former colleagues, etc.) to keep mom in the dark about everything that has gone on during that time.

A subplot, however, reveals that Mom, in need of illusions as she might be, has secrets of her own in relationship to the whereabouts of her husband who left for West Germany in the past without his family, mainly because she balked at going for her own reasons. There are, additionally, many sight gags or things that pass for sight gags in a society that had a very limited exposure to the `virtues' of Western consumer society. But enough said, get this film if you want a very smart look at what happens when cultural changes come fast and furious. Not everyone can, or should, adjust accordingly. But also get it, if I may add, so that you can begin to understand why mother wanted to stick with the old socialist ways, as she understood that concept.

Certainly the premise has all the makings of farce as East German Daniel Bruhle has to go to increasingly desperate lengths to keep the news that communism and the Berlin Wall have both fallen from his Party activist mother when she emerges from a coma for fear the shock will cause a fatal heart attack. Since the pace of change to Western values and fashions has been so rapid that means finding their apartment's long discarded drab furniture, seeking out now discontinued East German brands of pickles and coffee and even faking DDR news reports with his fellow satellite TV installer as he tries to recreate the old East Germany within the borders of his mother's bedroom (not so easy with Coca Cola setting up shop just across the road), in the process gradually creating the more reasonable DDR he wished had existed. The laughs are there but less frequent than you'd expect, and often underlined with the sadness of a country suddenly forced to confront years of deprivation and betrayal: his sister's revelation of the first words their long-absent father spoke to her is initially funny but genuinely tragic on reflection, and the film manages to pull off both reactions without over-milking them. Nor does it sugar-coat the ending, opting for something rather more affecting than a simple Happy Ever After.

1863489,5,B00008W41B,"""Goodbye Lenin"" is an excellent film.  Director Wolfgang Becher keeps the action fluid as one scene sparks the next.  The French Academy of Cinema named it the Best Film from the European Union.

Daniel Bruhl is the star who plays the son Alex.

He has also played in ""Ladies in Lavender"" with Maggie Smith & Judy Dench and ""The Borne Ultimatum.""  The European Film Academy named him Best Actor for ""Goodbye Lenin"".  He does an excellent job as the young man shouldering responsibility long before he's ready.

Katrin Sass plays his mother Christiane.  As an actress, she won the Silver Bear Best Actress award from the Berlin International Film Festival in 1982 for ""Burgschaft ein Jahr"" and won the James People's Choice Award as Best Actress for this film.  Sass turns in an excellent performance in the greatly varied role from political activist to invalid.

The story of the film revolves around the family whose father has apparently left them.  The mother raises her children in East Germany.  She is quite attached to her country and suffers a heart attack as she watches her son at a protest rally.  Falling into a coma, she awakes 8 months later to a reunified Germany where the wall has fallen.  However, since her heart is very fragile, Alex concocts a huge fantasy to keep from his mother the fact that Germany has changed because he fears it would be too great a shock.  This results in all sorts of hilarious antics such as searching for East German pickle jars and telling his mother that thousands of West Germans have been scaling the walls to get into East Germany and escape capitalism.

Chulpan Khametova plays his sister Lara who is busy having babies with her boyfriend Rainer played by Alexander Beyer.  There is a hilarious scene where Beyer bears all as he tries to fix window blinds before bothering to dress.  Meanwhile Alex falls for Ariane played by Maria Simon who appeared in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luther/dp/B0002C9D9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luther</a>.

Florian Lukus as Denis is a stitch, wearing fake moustaches and pretending to be a TV news anchorman.  Lukas won the Best Supporting Actor from the German Film Awards for his role.  There is a reversal at the end of the film where we meet Alex & Lara's father Robert Kerner.  Burghart Klaussner who was also in ""The Edukators"" plays Kerner.

Katarin Sass is a heartily loyal party member in 1980's East Germany. A true believer, she rules a family of premature adults - forced to mature when their father fled to the West, never to be heard from again. There are signs of tension between children and mom, but her loyalty to the state provides a safety valve - they can attack her through devotion to the state and obviate more direct lines of assault. As the 80's draw to a close, the GDR's governing regime is already out of steam, and soons grinds to a halt. Seeing one of her kids assaulted during a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, Mom has a stroke and falls into a coma.

When she awakes, the Wall has fallen, and her Socialist Police State is no more.  However, the demise of the GDR is a secret kept from her by kids desperate to avoid precipitating another stroke. Instead, with the help of friends, her family manufactures a fantasy in which the GDR is not only still around but (to explain all the reunification hype) the victor of the cold war. (The conspirators create phony news reports using footage of people streaming across the wall - apparently *from* the west, rather than desperately lunging towards it as we'd been led to believe; the formula for Coca-Cola was apparently developed in East Germany.) The effects are actually quite funny - especially when one realizes that the kids have to enlist an ever wider circle to maintain their illusion, making the fantasy GDR more of people's revolution than the ""real"" one it replaced. However as the mirage is prolonged - against all odds - the family finds that it must confront the inner demons that GDR deprivation and oppression had bottled up.

""Goodbye Lenin"" isn't apologia for the East any more than a praise for the triumph of the west. The leads react perfectly with that European deadpan set against the great political upheaval of the early 1990's.  It's a bitingly funny and bittersweet exploration of how common people use political dogma to keep from having to construct real lives and, in this case, have to create fake lives when their dogmas prove illusory.",1167868800,5,2232,4.70076726342711

The tale revolves around a boy who has to keep the past alive for the sake of his mother's health and it illustrates both the excitement of those who experienced the west for the first time and the betrayal (in this case felt by his mother) of those who upheld the former regime.

  It is set in East-Germany. A mother, a convinced communist, whose husband has fled to West Germany, has a heart attack and falls into a coma when her son is arrested by the Stasi Eastern police. While she is in the coma, the communist government collapses and the Wall is taken down. As she slowly recovers from the coma, her physician advices her son, that any excitement could kill her. So, her son, together with some friends, decides to fake for her the continuation of the communist government on TV.

The R rating is not really deserved - there is a little nudity but there is nothing shocking in the movie.

It is a nice view into the lives of East Germans during the early chaotic days of integration. I dare say life now in East Germany is more brutal and more cynical.

1863515,5,B00008W41B,"Good Bye, Lenin! is a movie set in East Germany that starts in the late 70s.  We watch a family, in the opening credits, in which the father has escaped to the West, leaving behind his wife, and two kids.  Alex, the son, is the character who tells the story and we watch as the mother, broken and in pain from her husband dumping them, embraces socialism to the point where she is totally loyal to its ideals.

  In 1989 she has a heart attack, falls into a coma, and misses the most important eight months in world history.  The fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of communism, frankly everything she believes in dies a swift, total death.  Then she comes out of the coma and her son is warned by the doctor that ANY shock might bring another heart attack.  Any shock.  So her son has to make her think that NOTHING has changed.

  The film is one of the funniest Non-English flicks I have EVER seen.  The son has to find food she likes (that no longer exists), has to set up the TV with a VCR so she only watches shows from before the collapse and even has to organize her birthday with people who know that they have to pretend that history hasn't passed her by.  Yet it has a serious underlining message about the importance of family that is touching (and sad at the same time) and I think a slight poke at materialism.  Coca-Cola must have paid millions to get its name in so many scenes!

  But Alex is not the only one making up lies.  The mother has woven some lies of her own which end up coming out.  The truth about their father.

She spends eights months in a coma, and during that time her homeland transforms -- the Berlin Wall comes down, and western commerce and attitudes flood into East Germany.

Kathrin re-awakens, but her health is extremely fragile, and Alex is warned by her doctors that she cannot handle excitement of any kind, much less the shock of the current capitalist explosion. Driven by guilt, he transforms her room, meals, family and friends into the past that she remembers, frantically resurrecting the Communist ideal that she reveres. Initially, the ruse is seamless, but as time goes on, Alex must work harder and harder to narrow an ever-widening gap between the past and present.

While the clever premise is irresistable and would seem the perfect vehicle for an ever-escalating farce, Becker takes a far more difficult (but ultimately more satisfying) route into a touching exploration of memory and the lives we create for ourselves and one other.

The cast is uniformly strong, and the romance between Alex and Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse who cares for his mother, is sweet.

The plot and the acting are AMAZING; the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing eastern German people's every day lives and the problems they've been facing since re-unification.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The people who panned the film because it showed East Germany in a good light missed the point. This is a film about illusions: those of the DDR and its leaders and citizens; those of the mother after her husband leaves and she cannot follow; those of the son to protect his mother; those of the film-maker friend and his involvement in the deception; those of the makers of this film in recreating East Berlin several years before and flying Lenin down the street; those of the daughter dropping out of college to sell burgers; those of the first German cosmonaut now driving a taxi for a living; perhaps even those of us in the West and our illusion of consumption-based happiness and fulfillment.

This is a far deeper look at much more that just what was wrong with East Germany, or a mother-son relationship. It has depths that reward multiple viewings. It forces us to ask about whether we are perceiving reality or whether we are part of a different mass-illusion. If you think it lets the DDR off the hook, watch it again. The film basically accuses the DDR of being a huge illusion foisted on a subject people, a total denial of reality. If you think that the film is saying that the DDR was a good thing, wake up and look at the film more closely.

Mostly ""Good Bye, Lenin"" works due to it's casting, dry and visual humour, and original ideas.

The visual of Lenin flying away via helicopter is absolute brilliance, but then none of it would work without a decent cast.  The actress who plays Daniel Bruhl's mother is not only superlative, but very attractive.  A film like this could have easily gone the route of melodrama, but it stays firmly on the line between humour and drama, and thankfully works as both.

1863544,4,B00008W41B,"Who would have thought that not long after Ronald Reagan uttered those confrontational words, that the Berlin Wall would be breeched.  Many thought Mr. Reagan hopelessly naive for even questioning the status quo with regard to Berlin, but down it came, showing us once again how history sometimes is less evolutionary than subject to punctuated equilibrium.  Think of geological plate tectonics---ie., earthquakes & volcanoes.  The Berlin Wall was an anachronism (likewise the division of Germany).  We---in the West, at least---knew it had to eventually come down, but never expected it to do so until it did. ""Goodbye, Lenin"" doesn't address whether east Germans believed similarly or not, but it is grounded in the abruptness with which the Berlin Wall did fall.  And it captures the essence of such most effectively, and does so in such a unique manner.  Most of the film takes place AFTER the Berlin Wall has been breeched, but---at one and the same time---the story ingeniously provides us, ie., the viewers, a  window into the east BEFORE this dramatic development.  Mind you, save for one exception, it doesn't concern itself with the dark side of the German ""Democratic"" Republic, ie., secret police activities, informers within society, and the like.  (If you are interested in such, have a look at Timothy Garton Ash's book, ""The File."" It's about how the Stasi security services kept tabs on this British journalist, as well as on millions of its own citizens.)  ""Goodbye Lenin,"" nonetheless, does give one a taste of East Berlin and that it does so in such a whimsical way makes for an entertaining film (the details of which I assume you have already familiarized yourself with above.) In addition, the acting herein is more than above average, and the direction is most able--in particular, a scene of a moving Lenin statue is accomplished with great effect; and is, to boot, hilarious.  (If you think Reagan was the incarnation of the devil & simply wish to register that view---although it has nothing to do with this film---then go ahead and ignore this well made film; otherwise do have a look at this film & do listen to the director's commentary on this DVD as well.  It will clue you in to a lot---after watching this film---that you didn't even know you missed, but did!)

The issues here are about living in a brave new world with new values and facing up to the loss of the old ones. It is about political upheaval and the emotional ones that accompany them. People from the former Eastern block say they recognise the figures in this movie like the old headmaster, a pillar of authority in the old order but a drunken has-been in the new one, or the celebrated German Democratic Republic cosmonaut who drives a taxi in the new world order. They are all delightfully halarious figures, but beneath the laughter they embody what is a sorry reality in a former Eastern Germany with its +20% unemployment rate. It is also about a past in which a Germany was torn in two and the family upheavals that this lead to, and then having to face up with its consequences. But ultimately it is a story of a son's dogged devotion to his dying mother - a love that knows no bounds.

The cinematography too is highly memorable - the scene with helicopters carrying out the statue of Lenin is very powerful for example. In fact the whole way the story is allow to unfold reveals the hand of a masterly director. As for the cast there is not a single weak link and the whole ensemble of actors comes together for a unanimous outburst of inspiration.

1863558,5,B00008W41B,"As Goodbye Lenin opens, we learn that Christiane Kerner is a mother of two children, Alexander and Ariane, living in East Berlin in 1978.  Following the flight of her husband to the West for another woman, she focuses on raising her children and being a dedicated German socialist.  In other words, she becomes the bride of East Germany, being a teacher and helping dictate letters of complaint.

Eleven years later, on the eve of a demonstration in October 1989, she sees her son Alex being arrested, and collapses from a heart attack.  However, she ends up in a coma due to her not being resuscitated in time.  When she wakes up eight months later, she is in for a surprise...

Or at least that would've been the case.  Under orders from the doctor, to keep her from anything stressful or exciting lest she suffer a second and ultimately fatal heart attack, Alex, with the aid of his new West German friend Denis Domaschke, with whom he works flogging off satellite dishes in the newly liberated East Germany, contrives to make sure that in her eyes, nothing has changed.  This means restoring her bedroom back the way it was, furnishings and all, with no radio and TV.

This becomes a vehicle for Denis, who aspires to be a feature film director, to edit some news footage and himself as news anchor, for the East German news videos for Christiane's eyes only.  When Christiane accidentally catches sight of a Coca Cola banner outside her window, Denis comes up with a propaganda news broadcast that it was actually East Germany that had invented Coca Cola!  This is just a series of well-meaning lies Alex constructs to keep his mother alive, to the consternation of Ariane, who is put out with the inconvenience of having to live back into a Stalinist East Germany by choice after having a taste of real freedom.  He also tries to get a few of his mother's old colleagues to go along with the farce, not to mention paying off some kids to dress up like the Young Pioneers, the communist youth, and sing communist songs to his mother.

Yet while Christiane has been sleeping like Rip Van Winkle, she misses the resignation of General Secretary Erich Honecker, the collapse of the Wall, which led to a ""unique recycling project,"" her son's newly found liberation, such as going to the West, and meeting Lara, a beautiful Russian student nurse.  Ariane, in the meantime, drops out of college to become part of ""economic circulation,"" translation:  ""thank you for choosing Burger King.""  She herself finds a new flame, her co-worker Rainer.  The country itself becomes transformed, its supermarkets into ""gaudy consumer paradises, where the consumer was king,"" and in addition to Germany being the center of world attention, the country's victories in the World Cup adds to the excitement, where West Germany eventually beat Argentina 1-0 in the finals.  So when Alex goes to the supermarket to find Spreewald pickles and Mocca Fix Gold coffee, he's SOL.

Speaking of music, if the piano during the scene when Christiane is being taken to the countryside is familiar, it's because it's by Yann Tiersen, who did the music for Amelie.  In fact it's the same music used in the open title sequence of Amelie!  What was that earlier about recycling?

It's apparent that the old East Germany before the wall is symbolized by the well-meaning Christiane, and the new liberated East Germany, soon to be unified Germany on 3 October 1990, by Alex, Ariane, and Lara, for whom the future is bright.  But along with capitalism comes higher crime, greed, and decadent entertainment the likes of which had never seen the light of day since Weimar Germany.  A wonderful cast is led by Daniel Bruhl (Alex),  and Katrin Sass (Christiane).  Goodbye Lenin is an important film on Germany's history, not to mention a sweet yet sad comedy on rolling with the winds of change, and celebrating one's mother and motherland.",1120089600,3,3900,4.809595202398801
1863559,4,B00008W41B,"Many on both sides of the Berlin Wall were only too ready to embrace change in 1989 whereas one person missed it all because of being in a coma - and when that person is a committed socialist with a total belief in the socialist ideals and dogmas of the state, what does one do? Tell her just like that? Or else pretend that nothing had happened? Such is the unusual dilemma facing young Alex Kerner (Daniel Brhl), whose mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), as seen in (suitably grainy) family footage, immersed herself in anything to do with the Communist Party and its activities, including the Young Pioneers (the socialist equivalent of Scouts and Guides) shortly after her husband had fled to the West at a time when the German ""Democratic"" Republic (GDR) was rapt in the first flight of a citizen, Sigmund Jhn, into space on board the then-extant Soviet space station, Mir.

On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Alex joins many citizens calling out ""Keine Gewalt!"" (""No violence!""), as they demonstrate peacefully for change in their country. Christiane, meanwhile, is on her way to a party meeting, but gets caught up in the demo and witnesses her son being dragged away by the ""Volkspolizei"" (GDR police). Son's and mother's eyes meet momentarily, and she collapses in the street. Alex wants to help her, but he is unceremoniously dragged on board a truck and beaten as he and others are taken to the local jail. Unexpectedly, he is released without charge as the authorities apparently know who his mother is. He dashes off to the hospital, where he finds her with all manner of tubes connected to her body. He also discovers later that a girl he met at the demo just happens to be a nurse called Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) with whom he eventually falls in love.

Events move fast, and the Wall comes down the month after Alex's mother had slipped into her coma. Change is so rapid that Alex, whose love for his mother is as unswerving as hers is for the socialist homeland, fears that she may even die from the shock of realizing that her beloved socialist homeland has been replaced by a capitalist one. With the need for East Germans and West Germans to co-operate, Alex joins a satellite TV company from the western side and becomes part of an East-West team with Denis (Florian Lukas). It turns out that Denis is a wizard at making movies, so he hits upon the idea of fooling his mother with fake TV programmes (connected to hidden video recorders) that convey the idea that his mother's beloved socialist homeland was still very much alive.

They make arrangements to ensure that everything is as normal as possible, including redecorating an entire room to look exactly like her mother's old bedroom and finding old bottles, glass jars and tins with familiar food labels on it - pickles from Holland won't do, so Alex must look in the most unlikely places for them! As she comes ""home"" after eight months in a coma, everything really does seem to be as normal - so long as she never leaves the bedroom. Aspects of ""old"" GDR life are seen as Alex persuades young and old, including disillusioned old Party activist Herr Ganske (Jrgen Holtz), to celebrate his mother's birthday by singing patriotic socialist songs about the homeland, though the game is almost given away by the untimely unfurling over a tall neighbouring apartment block wall ... of a Coca-Cola ad! Alex and Denis quickly dream up a way to provide a plausible explanation for the presence of this capitalist drink - a faked documentary that convinces Christiane that Coca-Cola actually came from the East!

Later on, while Alex sleeps in the apartment, Christiane slips out of bed and into a world which has, indeed, changed, and she stares incredulously at the sight of West German Mercedes and Audi cars parked in the street, a billboard advertising IKEA furniture and at a statue (without legs) of Lenin, right arm outstretched, being carried under a helicopter, presumably to be scrapped, figuratively symbolizing the impending death of Communist rule in the GDR. The statue, in a somewhat bizarre way, appears to beckon to this disbelieving socialist stalwart as the helicopter flies past her. A shocked Alex and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) manage to hustle their wayward mother back to bed, but it is clear that the game has to end at some point.

Just as Alex is about to reveal the deliberate deception during a family outing to the countryside, however, Christiane, in turn, makes a startling confession as to what really happened to her husband Robert (Burghart Klaussner) - and the alternative choice that she could have made for herself and her family, only for her to get cold feet and turn it down. So, now the shoe was proverbially on the other foot, as she begged forgiveness from her family from having lied to them all this time, unaware of the lies that Alex and company had been telling her.

Having suffered yet another timely heart attack, she is taken to hospital again where, thanks to Denis, the deception ends with one last fake TV programme, which, given it does include genuine news archive footage of the momentous events surrounding the fall of the Wall, apparently convinces Christiane that many West Germans had found life on the western side too materialistic and shallow for their liking and seemed ready to embrace the socialist ideal, conveying the idea that there was more to life than just buying things. Christiane seems to be so happy, and she eventually dies just three days after the reunification of West and East Germany. Alex is both sad at his mother's death, but happy that she died happy, still apparently convinced that the socialist dream was intact even now. However, what Alex does not know was that she had, in fact, found out about the deception - through Lara, of all people. In a complete reversal of roles, she, in effect, becomes the deceiver rather than the deceived by deceiving her son into thinking that she had not known anything, yet she realises that he had done what he did to protect her, so she does this to ""protect"" him from his own ""reality"".

Along with Bernd Lichtenberg, who wrote the screenplay, Wolfgang Becker co-wrote and directed this German movie, made by X Filme Creative Pool, the same company that made ""Run Lola Run"" (see my review), but distributed by Warner Bros for a worldwide audience. In total contrast to Winfried Bonengel's ""Fhrer Ex"" (see my review), this movie almost romanticizes what life was like in the socialist GDR, thus perhaps adding to the idea that socialism, for people like Christiane, really was a perfect dream for ordinary people - and, indeed, Alex helped to perpetuate that dream, even if the brutal realities of Communist life in the GDR go no further in this movie than the brief scene of rows of detainees with hands behind their heads in the prison itself before he is released.

A parallel could be drawn between this movie and ""Fhrer Ex"": Tommy and Heiko from ""Fhrer Ex"" embrace neo-Nazism after their brutal treatment in jail whereas, before, they had never harboured such political ideology. Christiane, in this movie, had never embraced the socialist ideal before the Stasi (the GDR secret police) came looking for her absent husband. It seems that she had adopted this ideological stance as a kind of ""mask"", as if trying to hoodwink people (and, ultimately, herself) into thinking that she had fully embraced socialism and that her husband had fled because he had the ""wrong"" attitude. However, it seemed that it had gone so far over a period of over a decade that she really did believe in the ideal, thus indicating that one might eventually believe an ideal if it suits their situation where circumstances warrant.",1119571200,4,7734,4.796699174793698

Alex and his single, divorced mom Christine live in a tiny apartment in East Berlin. Shortly before the Berlin Wall falls and East Germany becomes history, Alex's mother, a dedicated party activist and DDR supporter, has a heart attack and falls into a coma - and misses the triumph of capitalism. Eight months later, her miraculous awakening and recovery present Alex with a dilemma: How to protect his mother's weakened heart from the shock of Coca-Cola, Burger King, Audis and Mercedes. His efforts to protect her arise partly out of guilt. After all, his loyal communist mother collapsed after seeing him participating in an anti - DDR demonstration. But he quickly discovers that his plan to protect mom by creating an artificial ""DDR"" within their small apartment faces huge obstacles. One of them is a huge Coca-Cola banner hanging within sight of their apartment window. Another is where to find all the old East German products that vanished within months of the demise of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik. His efforts to keep all the historical changes from his mother are both funny and poignant. In the process, Alex reinvents history and creates an entirely new version of what happened while his mother was in a coma.

1863561,5,B00008W41B,"This German movie may have elements that Americans miss, but the underlying story is universal -- what a young man who loves his mother will do.  The film is set in East Berlin and begins right before the reunification (the destruction of the Berlin Wall).  The young man (Alex) has a mother who is a faithful Communist Party member who was abandoned by their father, who left for the West.  After she has a heart attack that leaves her in a coma for months before finally regaining consciousness, he wants to take her home to care of her.  The doctors warn him that any shock could kill her, and he thinks that hearing about the collapse of communism in Germany might do it.  So he brings her home and sets about creating an environment for her in which East and West Germany are still separate.  Even though she's bedridden, it's not easy.  He insists that the radio is broken but she wants to watch TV, so he has to create news broadcasts for her to go in with the videotapes they are using to simulate television.  She wants her favorite brand of East German pickles -- no longer available.  He jumps through all kinds of hoops keeping up this charade despite the pleas of his sister and his girlfriend to tell his mother the truth.

Obviously a lot of this movie is about the politics of Germany -- and it raises some questions about what constitutes the good life.  Is it free access to Coca-Cola or is a less stressful life better?

My only criticism would be that the movie is perhaps a bit long.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1115596800,4,1547,4.443262411347518
1863562,4,B00008W41B,"GOODBYE, LENIN! is an enjoyable and original film. It is a blend of both comedy and drama. The plot of the film is simple enough. It is told through the perspective of Alex Kerner (played by Daniel Bruhn) who tells the story of his mother (Kathryn Sass), a loyal member of the Communist party who is abandoned by her husband and has to raise her children alone. The mother has had some difficulties in the past and the children become very protective of her, especially Alex. Like many young people, Alex is involved in protests against the oppressive East German regime and when his mother witnesses his arrest, she has a heart attack and is comatose for eight months. She misses the major historic upheavals, including the fall of the Berlin Wall. When she awakens, her doctor recommends a no stress lifestyle and her children decide that the best way for this to happen is to make it as if the Berlin Wall never fell, and try to create a mini communist nation in the family's apartment. The antics of Alex provide for humorous situations. He quickly becomes westernized but reverts to former ways when he is at home. He and a friend devise ways to rebroadcast old news stories and slowly brace the mother for the changes. While clever humor is found throughout the film, it never becomes silly, a credit to skillful writing. We also see the bonds of love between the Kerner family, particularly mother and son, and get a glimpse of the heart wrenching decisions people had to make during the bleak years of Communist rule in a divided Germany.

Critics can say that the film is implausible at best, yet the combination of the acting and writing, as well as the lighting and atmosphere of the film make it entirely believable. It also gives us an appreciation of just how life changing the fall of the wall was, and hwo different the world has become in a short time.",1114819200,3,1869,4.595808383233533

1863564,5,B00008W41B,"""Godbye Lenin"" was one of the best foreign films released in 2004, which combined a love story and farce against the backdrop of the last days of the German Democratic Republic.  The plot is ingenious: to prevent his frail mother, a mid-level loyal appratchika, from suffering a second and fatal heart attack, her son must create a historical ""bubble"" in her appartment to keep her convinced that the Communist regime is alive and well, and the universe has not changed.

The fantasy world created by her son reflects the actual paper-mache universe that was East Germany.  The Wall must stay up; dumpsters must be scoured for old food cans with the right labels, and mediocre laminate furniture recovered.  His job is made more difficult as the real world and its billboards inevitably intrude, to which he and a friend respond by taping fake talking-head broadcasts which look like the real dull as bricks productions.  I had always suspected that Coca Cola was invented in the GDR and stolen by the West....

Some have unfairly criticised this movie by being too ""soft"" on the East German regime, and in its sympathetic portrayal of the mother as a loyal adherent to the system.  That was not the point of this movie.  Waking up on a November 2000 morning to find that Bush, and not Gore, was declared president was significant enough; the millions who saw the Wall collapse and have their entire society change must have been thousands of times more traumatic.  Many, many people who were not ideologues still had a stake in the old system, such as university professors, teachers, and factory workers.  Their world, like that of the East German astronaut, was turned upside down without any fault of their own.  This film succeeds in describing this trauma in a gentle and thoughtful way.",1109030400,11,1793,4.845901639344262
1863565,2,B00008W41B,"I watched the movie, I laughed at the jokes, I understand the plot but I simply cannot accept this movie as a defence-in-disguise of a regime that was positively criminal in nature. The mother in this movie is a diehard Communist-by-conviction. She is consistently portrayed as a good, idealistic Commie who had been let down by those evil power-hungry Commies - the subtle punchline being that Communist ideals are OK whereas the Cold War implementation in the Eastern Bloc was bad. Having lived on the wrong side of the Iron curtain for some time, I personally think that it was not just the implementation but that the Communist ideals are inherently flawed.

As the title of my review points out, most intelligent people would not accept a similar movie made on the basis of any other inhuman regime of the present or the past. Imagine a plot where a German Frau falls in a coma in March 1945, wakes up a few months later and her kids put up a show pretending the Fuhrer is still in charge. That would not be a great movie, it would be a scandal. And don't even get me started on Good bye, Jefferson Davis.

Look, the movie is entertaining, it is reasonably well done and it may even be educational for those who want to learn about the moods and public opinion in Germany around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall. But I cannot accept as great work of art something that makes the point of (even indirectly) defending oppression, inhumanity and intolerance. Hence 2 stars.",1105574400,22,1482,4.567669172932331
1863566,5,B00008W41B,"""Goodbye, Lenin"" provides not only an entertaining story, but a glimpse into East Germany as it existed prior to unification.  The premise is straightforward: a woman slips into a coma a few days before the Berlin Wall comes down. We find out that she is a committed socialist who'd thrown herself into party work years before, after her husband had escaped to the West. While she is unconscious, everything changes, and changes rapidly.  We see through the eyes of her son, Alex, the new possibilities open to East Germans as they are free to travel and have access to consumer goods.  When Alex's mother wakes up, Alex is told that she must not be exposed to any shock.  Thus, he re-creates in their apartment East Germany as it existed until a few months before -- complete with created ""news"" programs played on a secret VCR, ""Young Pioneers"" serenading her on her birthday, East German interior design, and inferior products no longer available in supermarkets.

Keeping this up, however, takes a lot of work and a lot of ever-more-complicated lies.  (O, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!) As Alex continues this venture, he is drawn further and further into the socialist dream held by his mother.  While the film has been criticized for not showing the darker side of East German life, the bad is not ignored entirely: the Stasi make a brief appearance; the reasons for Alex's father's escape to the West are revealed; the circumstances surrounding mother's job are revealed; the shoddy construction of the apartment is apparent.  The point, though, is that Alex is constructing a fantasy world that is built on a lie.  And indeed, East Germany itself was built on a communist fantasy that was never realized.

The film also provides a taste of the shock that all East Germans must have experienced as they moved abruptly from a socialist state to a free-market economy and, in less than one year, were unified with their former Cold War enemy.  The story is well-told and well-acted.  It is funny, poignant, and thought-provoking.  The ending is moving.  ""Goodbye, Lenin"" is an excellent film worth its five-star rating.",1105401600,4,2158,4.876712328767123
1863567,5,B00008W41B,"If you've ever had a burning desire to see a German-language comedy centering around the collapse of communism in the Eastern Bloc, Good Bye, Lenin just may be the answer to your prayers. This is one of those rare movies that succeed on all levels, as it's hilarious at some points and genuinely effecting at others, all incorporated into some of the most important historical events of our time.  Director Wolfgang Becker pulls off this deceptively difficult trick with an effortless charm that's hard to find on either side of the Atlantic, as he does little more than examine the reactions of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances.  It's hard to think of a movie I've seen lately that's brought together as many disparate elements as seamlessly as this one.

While Good Bye, Lenin is somewhat of a one-joke movie, that joke is far funnier and more original than just about anything else you'll see these days.  When Alex Kerner's mother sees him being taken off by cops during a protest in the final days of East Germany, she promptly has a heart attack and goes into an eight-month coma.  By the time she awakes Germany is one country again and loads of new consumer goods are flooding the East.  Normally one would have a hard time figuring out what the problem is with a flood of cheap new goods (there's even more than one brand of pickles now), but since Alex's mother has been devoted to the socialist state ever since her husband headed west and never came back, Alex fears that the shock of this brave new world could bring on another attack.  Since this next attack could finish her for good, Alex goes to every length imaginable to hide the truth from his bedridden mother, which isn't easy as the former East Germany has suddenly become a much more colorful place.  Not to mention, his sister Ariane, a single mother who's given up her studies for a position at a brand-new Burger King, isn't always on board with the plan.  Alex's devotion is certainly heartwarming, but it's also extremely stubborn and a bit crazy, and the unusual nature of Alex's commitment is the basis for much of the movie's humor.

This ingenious plot device paves the way for what's easily one of the most intelligent and insightful movies to come along in a while.  There are plenty of laughs to be had as Alex's put-on becomes ever more elaborate, but the movie also has a lot to say about the way people deal with change, especially since change effects different people in different ways.  By focusing in on one family's undoubtedly unique experiences during this tumultuous period, Good Bye, Lenin provides insight into the colossal shock of communism's collapse at the same time as it gives the whole event a human dimension.  It's this combination of historical scope (even in dealing with events that happened a mere 15 years ago) and minute detail that makes this such an intriguing movie.  Becker's directon is constantly shifting tone from lighthearted to deadly serious, but it never stops focusing on the heavy emotional stakes involved in trying to maintain an entire vision of the world that no longer exists.  Good Bye, Lenin isn't just a period piece, or a family drama, or a comedy; it's all of the above wrapped into one.  And it doesn't hurt that the Russian nurse who becomes Alex's love interest is just about the hottest woman alive.

Anyway, as capitalism continues making inroads and it becomes increasingly tough for Alex to hide the truth from his mother, he finds himself forced to construct a whole alternate reality, complete with fabricated newscasts explaining why there are so many Coke signs and westerners in ""East Germany"" now.  And the more Alex manipulates reality, the more attached he grows to the idealized notions that socialism represented.  The real East Germany may have been a dull, drab place, but the East Germany Alex creates for his mother is a paragon of community and opportunity, a place where people will eventually come searching for a more meaningful life.  Since communism was always more about idealism than realism anyway, it's not too hard for Alex to deceive his mother about the collapse of her beloved State.  He just shows her what she wants to see.

Although I can't give it away, even the ending to this movie is surprisingly satisfying, even if it is a bit too sympathetic to socialism for this libertarian's taste.  It's not quite what you might be given to expect, but since Good Bye, Lenin is one decidedly unconventional movie maybe that's as it should be.  At any rate, if you're outgrowing Adam Sandler movies but you're not quite pretentious enough for the indie scene, Good Bye, Lenin is more than worth the two hours of your time.  While it doesn't contain the level of action I often like to see in a movie, it's more than impressive enough to get by without it.",1102636800,8,4845,4.759856630824372

 This film is a funny comedy, not a slow one, as someone said in another review.  Didn't seem to me, at least.  Didn't notice the two hours.  It is, of course, a different sort of film, in everything, and that`s what is refreshing about it.  That`s probably because is a german film.  And this very important part of History is told from the point of view of germans.  From the point of view of people who lived it.  And of common people.  The fact that the main theme is the love of this man for his mother, and not romance (that is present also), as in most films, makes it different too, in a good way.
It is a lovely film, with lovely characters.  The main one, especially, anyone will fall in love with him.

1863579,5,B00008W41B,"""Goodbye Lenin"" chronicles the life of an East Berlin family in the days just before and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Socialism had become a dead force in the lives of many, except for those who used it to salve the pain of lost loves and missed opportunities. Mother Katrin Sass suffers a heart attack during a demonstration and goes into a coma for 8 months. During that time, the Wall falls and East Germany begins its transformation from dull, gray socialism to loud, rainbow-hued capitalism. Fearing another and fatal attack, children Alex (Daniel Bruhl) and Ariane (Maria Simon) with the help of a video wiz friend concoct a plan to convince their mother that her beloved socialist republic still lives.

The trailers for this movie focused on its comical aspects, but there was much more here a few laughs. ""Goodbye Lenin"" is about devotion to parents; about facing (or hiding from) the uprooting of one's system of meaning; of healing the wounds of separated families; of the pain of losing one's ""permanent"" social status. But mainly, the film ponders the cost of lies in society -- the political lies that keep populations placid and the lies that preserve a loved one's dignity. And it has many, many sweet, human and funny moments.",1099526400,4,1254,4.805555555555555
1863580,4,B00008W41B,"'Goodbye, Lenin!' is wonderful social satire and refreshingly unique, telling a story of a woman, Christiane (Katrin Sa), who loses her husband to adultery and politics, finds solace in her East German party, but collapses into a coma mid-heart attack after seeing her son attacked by East German troops amidst a demonstration gone wrong. The bulk of the film centers around not the mother, but her son Alex (played compellingly by Daniel Brhl). It is the year 1989, and throughout his mother's coma he has seen her life collapse into West Germany as the Wall falls and capitalism takes over. In an endearingly witty sequence, we also see him transform into a loving, mature man as he takes care of her and falls in love with her nurse. When his mother wakes, the doctors inform him of her weak heart: she must not be distressed or excited, lest she have another heart attack, this time fatal. He fears the changes may dangerously provoke her, so he takes her home, hides her from the world, and goes the extra mile to turn their apartment (and her old friends) back in time to East Germany before the fall of Communism. This is an interesting premise, and thanks to fine writing, acting, and direction, the gimmick does not get old, but only more interesting. And though it loses its focus toward the very end and begins to stretch further than it needs to, the film as a whole is so thoughtfully made that its end does not become less moving as a result, but remains memorable and innovative, much like its first two thirds.",1097971200,6,1526,4.634686346863469
1863581,5,B00008W41B,"Finally, a film that satisfied a lifelong curiosity I've had for people my age who lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain.  Since elementary school, I always wondered what it was like for kids like me who were unfortunate to be born in the Soviet Union or East Germany, two of the harshest communist states.  This curiosity led to my checking out books on the topic and reading about it, and being called a ""commie"" by my fellow Americans, as if curiosity about someone our government tells us is ""our enemy"" makes me one of them!

I was thrilled when I read a movie like this had come out, showing life in the last days of East Germany and the euphoria of a new world opening up for people who pretty much lived in a prison all their lives.  Of course, the initial rush of euphoria in newfound freedom left a harsh wake up call as differences in work ethics, standards of living, and cultural references became more and more apparent after reunification of the two Germanys.  In personal terms, think of what it would be like if separated twins discovered each other late in life...one a Wall Street stockbroker, the other a trailer park living low wage slave.  A clash in more ways than one, right?

The performances of Daniel Bruhl as the idealistic son and of Katrin Sass as the mother who always believed in Marxism, both performances really stand out and are Oscar-worthy.  The lengths the son goes to, to prevent his mother from falling into another coma over the shock of the demise of East Germany provides much of the humor.  My favorite scene is when the mother, tired of being cooped up in the bedroom, decides to go for a walk outside and its like walking through Wonderland for her.  The look of complete bafflement on her face as she watches a statue of Lenin fly through the air, in a salutatory departure, is pure joy to watch.  Just her look alone perfectly conveys the confusion of a world being turned upside down.

This film addresses the issue of ""Ostalgie"" that has gripped some former East Germans in the late 1990s as they have found that the materialism of the West hasn't replaced a sense of community for them.  Under the iron fisted rule of Honecker, they might not have had much, but they suffered together and had a genuine sense of community...although any one of their neighbors could have turned them in to the state for any number of ""violations.""  Watching this film, one can see the draw of culture on a person and the void left behind when the culture is stripped away or proven false.  Does longing for the familiar products of one's youth actually mean a desire to return to the way things were?  I don't think so...but culture is something we'll always carry with us.  It's who we are.

The brilliance of this film for me, is that we get to look at East Germans as people with no control over their form of government.  In America, we were taught that the Russians and Eastern Europeans were our ""enemies"" and a lot of people bought into it.  But in reality, they are people just like us.  People who believe their government over a foreign government they're not familiar with.  Are we any different?  I like that this film shows an idealistic young East German and his yearning for freedom, idolizing a Cosmonaut, and who loves his mother so much that he dares not tell her the truth about what happened to their country since she fell into and out of a coma.  This deception strains his relations with his sister, but provides much humorous situations before reaching a satisfying conclusion.  I have no complaints about this film.  It's flawless and brilliant.  The acting and humor are first rate and Oscar-worthy.  I would rate ""Goodbye Lenin!"" as the best film I've seen so far in 2004.",1097280000,64,3739,4.565217391304348
1863582,4,B00008W41B,"Just as Rip Van Winkle slept through the American Revolution and woke up twenty years later to find himself a citizen of a brand new country, so Kathrin Sass, an East German woman, slips into a coma on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall only to wake up eight months later a member of a capitalist society.  This is the premise of ""Good Bye Lenin,"" a clever and affectionate tale about truth, love and family ties that transcends all national borders and boundaries.

Kathrin, a woman who has dedicated her life to the perpetuation of Communist Party ideology, suffers a major heart attack that plunges her into a comatose state a few months prior to the dissolution of the land she knows as East Germany.  While she is ""asleep,"" governments tumble, barriers crumble and a whole new tide of Western goods and values comes flooding eastwards to a ravenous, eagerly awaiting public.  Then she wakes up.  Fearing that the shock of finding such a radically changed world will lead to a second heart attack, her loving son, Alex, devises an elaborate scheme to shield her from the truth and to make her believe that the world she lives in now is the same world she knew eight months before (the basic premise is not that different from the one in ""Jacob the Liar"").

""Good Bye Lenin!"" is an amusing regional comedy that derives its laughs from two basic sources: the near-slapstick nature of the charade Alex is attempting to perpetrate, and the script's satirical view of a society rushing madly to embrace the joys of unbridled consumerism they have been so long denied.  Given its gimmicky premise, ""Good Bye Lenin!"" could have emerged as a one-joke comedy were it not for the fine sense of irony and absurdity that writer/director Wolfgang Becker (working with co-writer Bernd Lichtenberg) has brought to the project.  In addition, young Daniel Bruhl as Alex and Katrin Sab as Kathrin deliver expert, moving performances that go to the very essence of the mother/child relationship.

I must confess that this film, despite its generally upbeat tone, brings with it a certain rueful sadness that the filmmakers may not exactly have intended.  Could it really have been a mere fifteen years ago that the events depicted in this film actually happened - a mere fifteen years ago that the future of the human race seemed so full of joy, hope and promise?  Now, in a post 9/11 world - where sectarian hatred and international terrorism rule the day - this image of people coming together to cast off the shackles of bondage and embrace freedom seems already like a quaint memory from the long distant past.  In a strange way, the film has become something of a relic in its own time, outstripped by a world that has long since moved on to bigger and more dire concerns.  ""Good Bye Lenin"" reminds of just how long ago and far away the Cold War really was.",1096070400,4,2851,4.678
1863583,4,B00008W41B,"This 2003 German import has an intriguing story line.  It's set in East Berlin in 1990, at the time of the fall of the Berlin wall.  A young man and his sister have been raised by their mother who truly believes in the socialist ideal.  She has a heart attack and is in a coma for 8 months.  When she awakes, the world has changed.  Her beloved East Germany is no more and there is a rapid influx of western influences.  However, since the doctors say that the mother has to remain calm, the brother and sister decide to make believe that these changes didn't happen.  And, along with a friend who makes videotapes, they contrive to keep the mother believing that nothing has changed.

This is an allegory, of course.  And at first it seems very funny.  But the film is a full two hours long, and the joke soon fades.  I found myself looking at the clock and wishing the story would move faster.  Soon it all turns into a soap opera.  Even when the mother tells a long, suppressed truth of her own, the deception never ceases.  The acting was good and I liked the theme though.  And I also liked being picked up and put down in the middle of an historic year in this very special place.  I learned a bit about socialism and the way of life under that regime.  In that sense I did enjoy the film.

There was a good extra on the DVD too, in which the filmmakers very carefully explained all the technical effects.  As the film was recently shot, they had had to use computer animation to make it look like 1990.  And they had to introduce a computer-animated version of a helicopter carrying a statue of Lenin and make it seem real.  I was fascinated, as I never quite understood the challenges of making this happen.

This is not a film for everybody.  But if you have an interest in modern history and don't mind a slow-paced and repetitive film with an interesting viewpoint about the world, you might just enjoy it.",1095465600,2,1917,4.353107344632768

The already contrived comedic situatiion gets bogged down in the second half with the mother slipping in and out of comas and hospitals, her character becomes the picture of tragic consequences and robs the film of it's gentle light-heartedness. There is also a bit of clumsiness in the young man's infatuation with his long gone father and an East German astronaut, who apparently served as a father figure. The two characters look alike and, as shadows from the past, are seen as the same, lending a bit of confusion. Daniel Bruhl as the young man carries this film single-handedly with his undaunted determination to protect his mother but even his dynamic presence becomes a wee tiresome as his mother succumbs to illness. It seems this tragic angle doesn't absorb well into the hopeful texture of the film.",1095465600,7,1044,4.837988826815643
1863585,5,B00008W41B,"Goodbye Lenin takes a sliver of recent history (reunification of Germany) and weaves it into a tender, bittersweet tale of farce and romance. Presenting a world that no longer exists is hard enough, but making it convincing to the viewer with gentle hints of humour requires a stroke of genius.

We may not know of the precise nostalgia felt by East Germans when the products they grew up with were replaced by spiffy modern imports from adjoining nations. But these moments are so beautifully handled, and the son's alternative approaches so cutely frantic, that we cannot avoid relating to similar emotions from our own contexts.

The film goes on for a bit in the middle with goofy antics and knowing jokes, but it is richly textured in its nods towards other directors like Fellini and Kubrick.

Don't let subtitles put you off from seeing this heart-breaking yet oddly comforting film. One of the best movies I've seen in 2004!",1095292800,89,932,4.849056603773585

The mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), who is heavily involved in the political party, witnesses the arrest of her son, which leads to her having a severe heart attack and coma.  When Alex is released from prison and finds out that his mother is in a coma and while she is in this coma the Berlin Wall falls.  Germany unites at the same time as Coca Cola, MacDonalds, and other western multinational companies enter the former DDR.  It is a tough time for the people of the former DDR as they are forced into deflation of currency, unemployment, and poverty.  The world as Alex's mother once knew is suddenly gone when she miraculously awakened from her coma.  An unqualified doctor that has remained within the former DDR informs Alex that his mother could die from sudden shock.

The mothers condition leads the film into a comical, yet serious roller coaster where good intentions, fear, and love drive Alex's decisions.  The decisions that Alex makes brings to the film a nostalgia of the former DDR's good intentions in politics as well as Alex's own vision of utopia.  The utopia that Alex creates is based on equality, fairness, and goodness without Stasi, the former secret police in DDR that functioned by having one informant per 100 citizens.  Alex even fabricates the idea that Coca Cola is an invention by the DDR in order to protect his mother's health.

Good Bye Lenin! is a warm film with the notion of a better world projected in order to save one person.  This idea is noble and it works very well as it brings the audience a sincere idea of utopia.  This utopian vision is based on a large number of lies, which has a symbolic meaning related to human nature.

And Katrin Sa is convincing as an activist/protective mother whose life is turned upside down and she must be the one who is being taken care of.  All in all, it is a truly wonderful film with an original concept, which is something viewers haven't seen in a while (considering the amount of prequels, sequels, and remakes that are being released).  Don't be afraid of subtitles either.  Once you know the basic plot, they are easy to follow.",1094688000,,836,4.577181208053691
1863608,5,B00008W41B,"Goodbye, Lenin gets better every time I think about it.  A comedy, a history lesson, a sweet-hearted story of filial love, the film impresses on every level and from every angle, including cinematic.  For example, the scene that provides the visual image of the title, as the recovering mother looks out the window of her painstakingly recreated room, is at once simple, eloquent, and plainly unforgettable.

But is the mother really what she seems?  That's the question and the final subtlety of the film.  Consider:  the long lie about the reason for her husband's flight to West Germany; the gadfly letters she writes for others to complain of the Communist society's products and practices; the fact that her heart attack occurs as she sees her son beaten by the Stasi; the murmuring scene with her son's girlfriend toward the end of the film; the way she watches her son even as she is watching the final elaborate hoax he has mounted to explain why East Germany no longer exists.  And three days later he scatters her ashes, as clueless to her real nature and feelings about the East German state as, in a completely different context and movie, the son in The Deep End is about his Mom and what she did for him.

1863611,5,B00008W41B,"The obvious reaction of any Westerner is that of most reviewers of this movie: seeing it as a comedy, where the weight and meat of the critique points out at the former socialist system, among many other things. This is what the film shows, isn't it?

Most definitely.

This is what we see in the movie for sure. But at the end of it all, what is the meaning behind all those images and dialogues?

As someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in Romania and was in Germany during those early nineties, the perception is different.

Sure the standards of living in the East and West were as different as night and day. This is no secret, and one doesn't need a new movie, especially the Germans, to remind them of that. Retro-propaganda - ""look how bad, how pathetic it all was""? Come on.

The real question is how much of the message in the movie points out at the inability of the new system, the capitalist one, to at least try to create an ideal world.

Alex's mom shock can't come from the ideological differences between the two systems. Most of the reviewers missed this. The hint is right there in the movie: the principal sacks her specifically because of her idealistic views.

But ideology is not juxtaposable with idealism. In fact, the differences are astronomical.

She wasn't a party ideologue. She was ""just"" an idealist.

Her son knew her vital need for an ideal world, or at least for a world that is striving towards an ideal. The system change would have robbed her of that hope.

The end of the movie has a symbolic meaning, and it applies to all former socialist countries: there was a trade off. And for the most part is for the better. Something irreplaceable though died.

The Germans, at least those in the former East, along with the rest of the Eastern block countries, don't need a Michael Moore style critique to get the message: this IS as good as it gets",1093564800,6,1888,4.491228070175438
1863612,5,B00008W41B,"This German film represents to me the constant question of what European movies by the likes of Fellini, Truffaut, Renoir and Bergman have that American movies don't which make these movies seem so much better than many American movies, while lacking many niceties sported by Hollywood movies which make them shine with a surface quality the European films lack. Why else would we bother to watch these flicks while keeping one eye on the action and another on the subtitles.

Fortunately, I know German, so I could keep both eyes on the action, checking the subtitles occasionally to check the accuracy of the translation. While not perfectly literal, it was a good translation into colloquial English, with even the occasional curse word properly translated, although there was rarely anything stronger than the German `Sheise'. The movie's `R' rating is a total mystery to me. There is some very brief nudity and sex, but hardly any language 13 year olds have not already heard aplenty. My best explanation for it is that the setting of the brief incidents is so believable that it may have a much stronger impact on a young viewer than sex or violence in an implausibly plotted Hollywood product. This is like `Lord of the Rings' receiving a PG-13 for `epic battle sequences and story images'.

There is little suspense in the story as much of it is summarized on the back of the jewel case, so I have no qualms in outlining it here. The story is all about a family of four living in East Berlin. In 1979, the doctor father leaves an East German family, nominally to live with a girlfriend in West Germany after leaving the East to attend a medical convention in Dusseldorf. The shock of the seeming abandonment sends the mother into a catatonia. After treatment at an East German sanitarium, she returns filled with zeal and idealism about East German socialism, vigorously following this path for eight years until 1989, when she has a heart attack upon seeing her son being arrested in a protest march against the Berlin wall. The attack is not treated as quickly as it should have been, so the mother remains in a coma for eight months. In this time, the East German communist party dissolves the Berlin wall is demolished and East and West Berlin and East and West Germany become one country. At this point, the mother awakes from her coma and doctors say she can experience no shocks, as they would probably drive her to a relapse. Since the son believes that hearing of the fall of the GDR (East Germany) would probably be such a shock, he insists on taking his mother home and editing everything she sees and hears with the help of a colleague who is a budding television producer. The chum gets old television newsreels and the two of them create new ones in a makeshift studio. One new newsreel has to be created when the mother sees a giant Coca-Cola banner on the wall of a tall building just outside their window. The cover story is that the poor giant Atlanta company had to have help from a large East German bottler to make their European bottling quotas. A second, more elaborate ruse must be constructed when the mother manages to wander out onto the street filled with western autos and, of all things, IKEA ads for `Billy' bookshelves on kiosks. The story is complicated by the sister's involvement with a West German and the drunken former principal at her school and mercenary former students bribed into singing for the mother in East German Pioneer scarves. The resolution with the family's father is something of a surprise, as is the resolution of the ruse about the East German regime.

There is certainly a lot of intentional humor in this movie, but it is really hard to call it a comedy. One of the most subtly funny moments was the `quote' from Fellini's `La Dolce Vita' where the mother sees the top half of a statue of Lenin being hauled off to some ignominious fate by a low flying helicopter. Writers and Director Wolfgang Becker replaced Fellini's statue of Christ with a statue of Lenin, leaving the viewer to make the connection. There are no gags and there is plenty of emotional pain and pathos, although the ending is logical and satisfying. The acting by the cast totally unknown to American experience is uniformly terrific. The other side of the coin is that it has the typically European lack of Hollywood veneer on its production values. The editing and direction are all good, but there are virtually no subtle touches in set decoration, set design, or cinematography. But, the story is so good, you hardly miss them.

The packaging proudly proclaims that the movie won 15 German and European film awards and was nominated for best foreign film by both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. I must look up the winner of those awards, as a film better than this one would be something to see.

As long as you have some taste for foreign films with subtitles, or know German, this movie will reward your watching it. Unlike a very select few foreign films like `La Femme Nikita' and `Run, Lola, Run', the movie may not have the kind of energy to overcome an aversion to subtitles, but I recommend it anyway. The version I saw in letterbox format had all subtitles below the film in the lower black bar, so there was absolutely no problem reading them, if you need them.

Highly recommended.",1093478400,,5343,4.684771033013845
1863613,5,B00008W41B,"Oft-repeated images of East Germans joyfully surging through breaches in The Wall have obscured who was left behind.  In this charming story, we learn not all the DDR's residents resisted socialism.  Nor was reunification an unmodified blessing for all.  A half-century of Western propaganda's view of the East has blinded us to such people as Christiane Kerner.  Abandoned by her husband, who's fled to the West, she ""marries"" the socialist state, becoming a dedicated worker.  Seeing her son pummeled by Stasi agents during a demonstration, Christiane suffers a heart attack, lapsing into a coma.  Alexander, as devoted to her as she is to socialism, strives to assist her survival.  The surrounding world strives to defeat him.

Honecker's DDR is collapsing around the family leaving Alexander with the task of trying to restore the past.  His mother's survival, when she awakens, depends on his success.  As the ""man of the family"" he struggles to keep his sister, her boyfriend, his own new girlfriend and his mother's colleagues on stage in his bizarre scenario.  Food jars are re-labelled, TV news is contrived and the new world of ""freedom"" is kept away.  However, the pressure of Coca Cola and Burger King is strong - and Alexander must cope with them all.

Ironies abound in this stunning presentation of ""the other side"".  Alexander describes the DDR military as ""the world's last great shooting club"".  A demonstration becomes people ""getting together for a little exercise"".  Christiane's dedication, which has nothing to do with politics or philosophy, is intense, but not absolute.  She hungers for what she already has, but remains unfulfilled.  Socialism isn't perfect - she streams complaint letters to the authorities.  Her ""marriage"" to the ideal is reminiscent of Christian nuns.  Will she die ""in the Faith"" as so many others have done?  Becker uses this and other images masterfully.  The red banners of the DDR merge deftly those of Coca Cola, Germany's most recent invader.

Becker's imagery and dialogue presentation is vivid and subtle at once.  He uses his characters brilliantly - Hitchcock would approve, even if there's no mystery to unveil.  With a contrasting mix of slow and fast action, Becker depicts the upheavals surrounding the collapse of German socialism with stunning clarity.  As the Special Features reveal, this film was cut by a third and the missing scenes are tantalising.  An film worthy of all its awards and attention.  Watch it and see ""the other side"" as it was.

Ok, now that I've instantly cut my audience down to the people who will probably dig this film, I will begin.

Wolfgang Becker has lovingly crafted this portrait of East/West Germany during it's time of political upheaval through the story of one boy's love for his mother. Having never seen a story of Germany through the rose tinted glasses of an idealist socialist, this was a learning experience for me. Through the film, Alex (played by Daniel Bruhl who you will just fall in love with by the end) rewrites East Germany's history for his mother in an effort to steel her from any shocks to her heart after she awakens from an 8 month coma during which the Wall fell, and capitalism invaded the East. As Alex says in the film, he ends up portraying East Germany as how he wishes it was, rather than how it had been. This story shows the effects and consequences of change in Germany through the eyes of her people. Cosmonauts, experimental art, drugs, Spreewald Pickles, and waiting three years for a car... There is a particulalry poignant scene when the family's savings is rendered worthless due to the currency change...

1863616,5,B00008W41B,"GOODBYE, LENIN! is a solid piece of filmmaking that incorporates the best of both storytelling and conscious raising. It is all the more amazing to watch as a piece of history: the action takes place from immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall to its aftermath eight months later. The story is simple: an East German family has lost the head of the household for (apparently!) fleeing to West Germany for the love of another woman. The wife (Katrin Sass) is dumbstruck but survives and continues her activist activities as a Socialist/Communist, teaching children and workers the good points of being an East German Socialist. One evening her son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) takes part in a demonstration against the government's curfews and ends up being beaten by the police. The mother, seeing this happen, falls in the street having suffered a cardiac arrest. She is hospitalized, and is in a coma for eight months during which time her son Alex sits by her bedside, hopeful she will recover. During the coma, of course, the Berlin Wall falls, Germany is united, and socialism of the Cold War is over. When the mother awakens, Alex is told that her condition is delicate and she must be spared any shocks. To this end, Alex and his sister and friends the mother home, change the house to resemble the pre-Berlin Wall fall, effect bogus broadcasts to make the mother feel that the East German philosophy has triumphed and the West Germans are moving into the better socialistic climes of East Germany! How this charade plays out with all of the consequences of the good intentions of Alex ties the movie together. Far from being a preachy political satire or documentary, this tender movie is more about family bonds than anything else. The direction by Wolfgang Becker is superb, as is the acting by all involved. Watching this film will entertain you, inform you of critical historical events, and leave you with a lovely afterglow.

1863639,4,B00008W41B,"Even without the telltale subtitles, you can tell that ""Goodbye Lenin"" is not an American movie.  Why is that, you ask?  Because it can offer all the elements of good filmmaking:  storytelling, character development...of its general complexity without sacrificing values.
  Values, you say?  Oh yeah--those quaint notions that inherently recognize right versus wrong and/or hold some old traditions near & dear.  Again, the inclusion of old-time verities tips one off that TimeWarner is not providing the funding for ""Goodbye Lenin.""  In fact, TimeWarner types would not fit into the ouevre of the film at all.
  To cut to the chase, the story follows the antics of a young son's attempts to cover up the 1989 breakup of the GDR to his ailing mother.  Residents of East Berlin, the son's mother--an ardent communist--emerges from a coma;  doctors warn her children, though, that any shock or upset could bring on a fatal heart attack.
  Knowing too well the cultural havoc that rampant post-1989 Westernism has created over the former GDR, the son goes to great comedic lengths to recreate pre-1989 Berlin in their tiny apartment in Alexanderplatz.
  Which is yet another way ""GL"" cannot be mistaken for mass-produced American sap:  it can manage to be a comedy, a complex political questions and a brave champion of Olde World values.  And all at the same time!
  Its refreshing to see the son's devotion to his mother, respect for familial ties and tradition.  All Americans should be made to watch ""GL:""  to see the ugliness of our popular culture firsthand as it makes its brash way into the GDR.  Coke banners, pornography, rap music, Britney...
  Unlike those American movies that do make the attempt to formulate a message (which are becoming rarer by the day!), this film doesn't hit you over the head to get you to see the deleterious effects of western imperialism and crass consumerism. The movie's producers simply do this through their characters:  a daughter who works at the new Burger King;  Denis, the eager aspiring movie director who provides much of the comic relief in this film.
  Although he may not be crazy about Lenin's theories and living under the communist regime, the son has enough depth of character to acknowledge and appreciate his mother's years of devotion to The Cause.  But this is where the predictability ends in ""GL>""  Now usher in the disturbing and unexplained fact that his father was persecuted by authorities for not joining the Party and hence defected to West Berlin.  Is this why his wife was such a devoted worker in The Party?
  This could have been fleshed out more, just as the ""Wessie-ness"" (western Berlin manners and mores) of his sister's boyfriend, Rainer.  The film has other shortcomings:  the relationship between the son and his mother's nurse is too sappy and predictable (""American-like, you could say).
  Some may view his efforts is recreating a pre-1989 life for his mother too farfetched for reality:  think of the pickle scenes.  The director's use of fast-forwarding for many of the comic scenes are hilarious and accentuate their absurdity.
  Actual footage from the crumbling of the Berlin Wall is interspersed thru the film as well as newsrells of political leaders.  I found it interesting that no images were shown of former President Reagan (or any other American officials for that matter).

Her family, aiming to save her from additional stress that could send her into another coma, creates a small bubble of the former East for her to live in.

Daniel Bruhl stars as Alex Kerner, a young man (19ish) who had lived under the Socialist uprising within Germany, pre-Wall falling. The reason: his mother was a hardcore comrade, and right before Socialism dies, she falls into a coma and wakes up after Democracy has set in. The problem: she can't have any huge emotional trauma or she'll croak. So the stage is set for an often-hilarious little farce that guides the movie through plenty of physical comedy, wild setups, but an unfortunately long third act that could have used some trimming. I doth protest too much - Lenin is a sweet film that is much a silly farce as a look at the lengths a son will go to save his mother and an examination of post-dissolution Germany. The movie seems like it's all mapped out in the beginning, but by the nostalgic finale, it has gone in some unexpected places and developed characters that seem insignificant at first (especially an early subplot of Alex having the hots for a nurse, whom he soon dates - a refreshing twist for once). It's the kind of movie, much like Amelie, that will have you walking out of the theater smiling and forgetting its shortcomings. If a third-act subplot of a long-lost father had been excised from the movie, I'd be going nuts about it. As is, I'm still elated from seeing this enjoyable foreign film.

""Good bye, Lenin!"" is an improbable farce about an East Berlin family at the dawn of reunification.  Hannah is a devoted Marxist whose greatest pleasures are volunteering at Pioneer Camp and writing letters of protest to shoddy East German manufacturers.  Her son Alex covets the more ""bourgeois"" pleasures to be found on the West side of the wall.  But when Mutti has a heart attack and falls into a coma, her doting son will go to extremes to resurrect the defunct regime.  During the eight months that Hannah lay unconscious, the wall has fallen and her ""Socialist Paradise"" has forever changed.

The U.S. trailer depicts a goofy comedy, but this is actually a touching movie about one family in the former East Germany struggling through the changes brought on in 1989 by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the DDR state.  In addition, it's a great little history lesson - there are great intermingled clips of East German leaders Erich Honecker, Egon Krenz and of other leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev and Helmut Kohl.  Footage of ""Ossies"" stampeding into friendly Embassies right before the Wall tumbles are turned inside-out and artfully presented as Westerners clamoring to get into the ""socialist paradise.""

It's 1989, the year which was to witness the end of the notorious walls in Berlin.  Now, Alex is an ordinary boy living in East Germany with his sister and mother.  Just before the big social changes happen, however, Alex's mother collapses because of heart attack and is hospitalized in coma.
Luckily, she wakes up again after eight months, but the dcotor warns that any shock could be fatal to her condition.  The problem is, she was a devoted member of the former regime (which is rapidly going) and the products from the West are rushing into the place where Alex and his mom are living.  In short, a red Coca Cola logo could kill her instantly.
So Alex starts to lie before his mother, pretending that the former commune is still healthily going on, even faking up the news reports on TV (with a help from his friend who wants to be a film director).  But can Alex keep on this pace forever before the huge social changes that would sweep up the whole nation?
The premises are slightly contrived, I admit, but the film works well because of the credible portraits of the mother and the son.  The actors are doing exceptional jobs, especially Daniel Bruhl playing Alex, whose ideas of ""for the sake of mother"" goes beyond the normal territory, but who remains still a likable and charming fellow all through the film.  Katrin Sass who plays his mother is also great, whose fragile portraits of the mother easily convince us of the reason her son should care for her so much.
Another strength is the charming music by acclaimed musician Yann Tiersen, whose name might be remembered as the one behind the lovely score of lovely French film called ""Amelie.""
There are lots of funny scenes in the film, but the sad tone is always felt behind the hilarious moments.

The problem is that Hanna is a devout believer of the socialist government of East Germany and while she was in her coma the Berlin Wall came down and the two Germanys reunited. Confident that the news will cause harm to his mother Alex is determined that his mother remain ignorant of the obvious changes that dominate East Berlin. As a result he develops some brilliant and resourceful schemes to make his mother believe that time hasn't changed such as filming his own news programs and changing the labels on the food jars. GOOD BYE, LENIN! is a funny yet poignant film that is sure to delight and entertain. Although there are many laugh-out-loud moments included there are also underlying issues and concerns that are on a more serious note. As the plot develops each member of the Kerner family realizes that their particular sense of reality is not as they believe. This particular family has been through a lot emotionally and psychologically, and I felt inspired watching their dramas unfold. The acting was superb, the plot was entertaining, and I walked away with a new perspective of this socio-political event and life in general. Bravo!",1080777600,,1581,4.837638376383764

The characters come alive, and the plot makes you care about them as people, not just card board cut-outs signifying some abstraction or another.
If you have not seen a really fine, memorable movie in 'way too long, perhaps you will brave the subtitles and give ol' Lenin a try?  Me, I am tempted to go watch it again in the theater, or maybe try for the DVD from offshore.",1080604800,,625,4.580357142857143

1863650,5,B00008W41B,"I like movies that take me to faraway places, and Wolfgang Becker's ""Good bye, Lenin!"" takes us to a place few Americans can even conceive of: East Germany just before and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For those of us raised in Cold War hysteria, it's instructive to see a portrayal of an average East German family, whose patriotism toward their Communist government was motivated by simple idealism, not by diabolical terrorism. ""Good bye, Lenin!"" focuses on Christiane, a teacher and youth counselor in East Berlin who suffers a massive heart attack. The end of Communism and the tearing down of the Wall occur during her eight-month coma, and when she wakes, her doctor warns her son Alex that any severe shock will kill her. Thereafter, Alex moves heaven and earth to ensure Christiane never finds out that the Socialist experiment she adored is no more. This obviously is easier said than done: how does Alex explain to Mom the Coca-Cola banner outside her bedroom window? Or find the old East German food brands and newscasts Mom expects to see? Or hide the fact that his sister Ariane now works at a Burger King? The film's farcical elements are not ignored, but it's to Becker's credit that the farce isn't all there is to ""Good bye, Lenin!"" He makes some tart observations about the brutality of the Communist system and the vulgarity of the consumer culture that replaced it. Even more, he emphasizes the drama within the family--particularly when Christiane drops a bombshell secret of her own. More poignant than funny overall, ""Good bye, Lenin!"" is at its best when it emphasizes the deep love between mother and son, their common traits and their deep desire to protect each other. Politics may have shaped their lives, but love is all that matters in the end. The German cast--none of whose members was previously familiar to me--is splendid, particularly the actors who play Christiane and Alex: Katrin Sass, an actress of the most refined mature beauty, and Daniel Bruhl, Germany's answer to (and improvement on) Ashton Kutcher. ""Good bye, Lenin!"" portrays a political culture alien to most Americans, but the familial bonds it portrays are universal and heartwarming.",1080432000,2,2196,4.937837837837838
1863651,5,B00008W41B,"I am originally from East Germany. I lived there in 1989. I saw the demonstrations happen in my hometown (not Berlin), I felt the tension, but also the excitement and insecurity of the days following the fall of the wall.
I watched the movie last year in Germany, watched in in December again when it was released on DVD in Germany and am planning to show it to my students in a politics class. That is how much I love this movie. I love it because he shows something very simple ... the things a person wants to go through for the love of his mother. But also because it quite adequately portrays the time of 1989 and 1990. It shows how excited people became if they already got their car after waiting ""only 3 years"" when it was normal to wait 10+ years. It shows also how proud East Germans were about some of their achievements, how attached they were to the system and I know how hard it was and still is for some to deal with the demise of the GDR. It gives a bit of an insight in the problems and ways of thinking from that time.
The movie is fascinating on many levels and entertaining and humorous on so many others. Katrin Sass, an actress from East Germany, and Daniel Bruehl who plays her son, make a great cast for the movie. Katrin Sass, because she can portray the die-heart communist with such credibility, not overdone nor distorted, and Daniel Bruehl because he plays this young man so well. The movie comes with high recommendation from me.",1079654400,42,1459,4.367647058823529
1863652,4,B00008W41B,"I heartily recommend ""Good Bye Lenin"". It has been a ""major"" movie in Germany. It has ushered in an era of ""Ostologie"" or nostalgia for the old days before the wall fell - when life was simpler than in the capitalistic west.
On a superficial level the movie could also be viewed as a yearning for the ""good old days"" of communism. I see a deeper, more important message in the film. It has do do with truth and how communism is an enemy of truth.
Communist rulers always believed that they knew better than the common people. They felt it was their duty to shape the actions of the common people toward more worthwhile goals. They felt so strongly about it that they were willing to distort the truth, and even use threats of and actual physical violence to get their way.
The main character, Alex, was raised under this system. He is a very loving son. But has he unconsciously picked up these same communist beliefs?
Alex's behavior in trying to ""protect"" his mother from the truth is very similar to the actions of communist/totalitarian governments which control the media in order to propagandize the citizens and ""protect"" them from what the ruling elites decide is not good for them.
At the dacha Alex's mother confesses that she has lied to her children for all those years, again to ""protect"" them from the truth. But in her confession she admits that this has been a great dis-service to them. She did it because of her own weakness and FEAR of retribution from the government. Somehow Alex never seems to get this message. Is it because his communist upbringing has blinded him to the importance of truth? Does he think that truth is only relative? Is he acting toward his mother like the communist state acted towards its citizens?
Isn't this movie fundamentally about truth? And the importance of truth?",1079654400,14,1816,4.660436137071651
1863653,5,B00008W41B,"`Good Bye, Lenin!' is a fascinating German film that was for unclear reasons denied a best foreign film nomination in the recent Oscars, but I consider it one of the best films I've seen this year. `Good Bye, Lenin!' is an entertaining and surreal black comedy, that doesn't really stand the test of logic and reality, but beneath the surface it's really a very socially conscious film, that gets across very well the atmosphere and problems of the post-communist East Germany.
The story is of Alex, whose mother, a devoted member of the Communist Party, suffers a heart attack which sends her into a coma - through which she sleeps throughout the months of revolution and the fall of the communist regime. When she awakes, the doctors warn Alex not to cause his mother any anxiety or excitement; therefore, he goes to ludicrously immense lengths to keep her convinced that communism in East Berlin is still alive. Not much of it, once again, stands the test of reason, but it's incredibly witty and entertaining, and manages, throughout, to get across some powerful statements.
`Good Bye, Lenin!' is both fun and important, a film which I recommend to everyone. Don't be afraid of European cinema; even though the film might be difficult to come by, it's very rewarding and well worth your time.",1079136000,11,1296,4.842342342342342
1863654,4,B00008W41B,"It's October 1989, and East Berliner Alex Kerner (Daniel Brhl), the teenage son of Communist Party stalwart Christiane (Katrin Sa), is arrested during a peaceful demonstration in the streets approaching The Wall. On her way to receive an honor for her service to the German Democratic Republic, Mom witnesses her boy's apprehension and has a heart attack that thrusts her into a coma, which lasts until June 1990. By then, The Wall has effectively been breached, Western capitalism has invaded East Berlin with a vengeance, Christiane's teenage daughter Ariane (Maria Simon) has dropped out of the university to get a job at the new Burger King, where she's taken up with a ""Wessie"" (a West Berliner), and Alex has fallen for Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse from the USSR.
After Alex insists that his mother be released for at-home convalescence, the doctor makes clear that any shock to the patient's system will likely kill her. Since Communism is all that Christiane has ever known, Alex contrives an elaborate scheme to shield his bed-ridden mother from all evidence of The Wall's collapse and the West's victory of materialism over her socialist world. What is she to think of that gigantic Coca-Cola advert hanging from the apartment building opposite her window?
The improbable prospects for the con's success aside, GOOD BYE LENIN is a witty, clever, and sometimes poignant look at the wave of change which swept through East Berlin after the surprisingly sudden meltdown of Die Mauer, carrying forward the young and resilient with the flow, but leaving many bitter, old guard stranded in unfamiliar territory .
Bruehl, resembling a young Christopher Reeve, is enormously engaging as the young man trying to do the right thing for his Mom, especially as it was his civil disobedience that catalyzed her physical debilitation in the first place. Christiane elicits much sympathy from the viewer. But she, too, has a secret that she's been keeping from her children for years.
As a child of the Cold War era - born in 1949 - I gazed transfixed at the TV images in the closing weeks of 1989 as Die Mauer was danced upon and assaulted by raucous Berlin crowds from both the East and West. After all, I'd grown up with The Bomb, the Evil Empire, and Nikita's shoe-pounding at the U.N., and had myself navigated Checkpoint Charlie on a couple of occasions. GOOD BYE LENIN is a glimpse of The Wall's demise from the other side, and with a humorous twist. One only need visit the Berlin of today, pass through the once off-limits Brandenburg Gate, and walk down the Unter den Linden to witness the startling transformation enabled by that event.",1078876800,11,2655,4.9153674832962135
1863655,4,B00008W41B,"With films like ""Good Bye, Lenin!"", both the critics' and viewers' darling in Europe (winner of Felix for Best European Film and French Cesar for Best EU Film of 2003), you should put your logic to rest -- this is a black comedy which crumbles under strict common sense; but when you try to understand its point of view, you may relish in the ""American Beauty""-lite distorted story with lots of truth hidden inside.
Alex (Daniel Bruehl) is a 20-something young man, whose mother, on the surface a devoted citizen of communist East Germany, suffers a heart attack, having witnessed a protest in October 1989. After she 'wakes up' eight months afterward, the communist regime is gone and the unification of Germany after 42 years of split is pending. But Alex, afraid of a crushing blow this reality would mean for her, takes great pains to persuade his bed-ridden mom that German Democratic Republic is still a reality -- he gets out-of-use groceries for her, shows her old-times video footage and gets 'enthusiastic' neighbors playing their roles to achieve the goal. Yet we feel that the moment the mother Christiane (Katrin Sass) finally finds out what's going on, is imminent.
Director Wolfgang Becker skilfully and un-pathetically intertwines two layers of a story -- the real fate of this particular family is far from happy and is in a strange, thought-provoking contrast with the comedian bulk of the story. The film's sober bitter-sweetness confirms that almost nothing in this world is only black or only white.
Although the potential of the movie to let outsiders feel what it really meant for ordinary people to live on the wrong side of Berlin Wall is a bit questionable (although favored, ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" was snubbed at Oscar nominations), it's already one of the definitive film (and artistic) statements of Germany's unifying process and may well prove essential for students of German and maybe even Eastern Europe's history in the 20th century.",1078704000,21,1964,4.990853658536586
1863656,5,B00008W41B,"Yeah, so I know that it technically wasn't even one of the five short-list nominees, but that was due more to the problems in the Academy's foreign film selection than to the film's quality.  This movie has won awards at nearly every awards show that it has taken part in, and is one of the biggest European films of the last year.  I saw ""The Barbarian Invasion"" and it was a good movie, but nothing compared to ""Good bye, Lenin!""  I saw this movie last year in Berlin, and have waited with growing anticipation for it finally to be released in the US so that Americans could see what that reunification in Germany was not just about that one night with the wall coming down.  Imagine my horror when I learned that it was just going to be released in NY and LA; compared to the stupid and horrible movies that Hollywood generally releases in the spring, I can't understand why more cities couldn't have made room for a critically acclaimed foreign film.  In any event, if you live in one of the lucky cities, see this movie.  If not, see it once it comes out on DVD...just see it.  Open your mind beyond the swill that Hollywood placates us with...foreign movies are really not THAT scary, and this one is really funny.  Do yourself a favor...don't accept the lie that American movies are the epitome of cinema, if you don't see this then maybe ""Spirited Away"" or ""Amelie"" or ""Osama"" or any of the other beautiful recent foreign films..whatever it takes.

Watch Good-bye Lenin if you want to get a true feeling for what it was really like in the old East Germany. The film swings always in perfect balance between tragedy and comedy. It gives a sideways look at Berlin and some of its characteristics and the irony cuts both ways  we really don't know whether to cheer or mourn the coming down of the Wall. It is a wonderful blend of gentle humour and tugging on the heart strings as Alex (Daniel Brhl) attempts to protect his mother's fragile life by trying to convince her that her beloved DDR is still in existence despite its fall during her time in a coma. It is a great history lesson documented on a very personal level, a story about a family in crisis and about the things we will do for the people we love, regardless of the political situation we happen to be in. Whilst the film is humorous it is also quite sad and reflective. It shows that not everything changed for the best and all things western had their personal and societal costs.
