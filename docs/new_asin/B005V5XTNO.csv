4897178,5,B005V5XTNO,"This movie was very first class, and kept your attention the whole time. What a blessing it was to watch this movie with our church family, may we have even more of a heart for missions.  It will make you want to do your absolute best serving the Lord wherever He has placed you.  We greatly look forward to more from the Garcia's.",1321574400,14,331,4.238095238095238
4897179,5,B005V5XTNO,"If you've ever wondered what life is like on the mission field, this film is for you. Here's a glimpse into the Wells' family life as they minister in Papua New Guinea. This film is inspirational, captivating and high quality. A great tool for introducing kids to missionary work too!",1321401600,2,284,4.7
4897180,5,B005V5XTNO,"The production value was very good. It is amazing how the Garcias did so much with so little. The visuals were beautiful and unhurried.  The interviews were engaging.  And the focus on the purpose of missions was powerfully motivating.  Perhaps this was summed up best by missionary pilot Matt Allen:

""Why do I do what I do? I love people, but more importantly I love my God. From a natural standpoint this doesn't make any sense, but I'm here because God wants me to be here.  There's nowhere else I would find happiness, than right here where God wants me to be.""

I look forward to the next film.

If I may make two suggestions:
Including an interview with both the husband and wife together would be valuable and offer insight.

Also, I hope that they will continue to focus on missions and missionaries. They might consider one on a missionary right here in the states - New York City would be good. One on missions to an Islamic nation would be enlightening as well.",1321401600,2,973,4.52
4897181,5,B005V5XTNO,"Very inspiring, loved it! Anyone who is seeking the purpose of God for his life must see it. Even if your call is not to be a missionary, it will surely touch your heart.",1484179200,,170,4.029411764705882

4897183,4,B005V5XTNO,"I have not been to Pau Pau New Guinea, but I thoroughly empathize with the current day missionaries to that place.  Their trials and challenges are shown with taste, and the story rings true of all that I am sure they have endured.",1438300800,,231,4.372093023255814
4897184,5,B005V5XTNO,"Our family especially enjoys the beautiful scenery and the children singing ""Read your Bible, pray everyday"" at the end.

4897186,5,B005V5XTNO,"I watched it twice. I have to say their story captivated me. I felt as though I was hiking through the jungle, with all of its sights & sounds, walking alongside the family into the grass hut villages of Papua New Guinea. The photography and camera work are nicely done. I would recommend it to anyone curious about mission work in remote jungles. The Wells family are a likeable bunch!",1430352000,,386,4.5285714285714285
4897187,5,B005V5XTNO,"I loved this documentary.
I have been to PNG several times, and found this to be such an honouring yet honest view of this Nation.  I recommend watching this if you are headed into any developing Nation (especially PNG)!",1425168000,,220,4.641025641025641

4897195,5,B005V5XTNO,"Every family, every youth group, every church, every pastor needs to see this!  It helps you see not only the vision and purpose of this great family in the mission field, but speaks to every Christian's purpose to reach the lost without compromising your faith or family.

This would be a wonderful gift to share with nothing in here to be ashamed of in front of kids, wonderful camera work.

Every church should keep this in their church library to inspire new Christians and new generations about their life's purpose and faith in God.",1410566400,,538,4.702127659574468
4897196,5,B005V5XTNO,"When I finished watching this documentary, I realized that irregardless of your denomination affiliation, this is very helpful to know some of the realities of mission life. For those of you considering missions work check out this documentary it's short and not trying to preach at you at all. ""It's just a day in the life of..."" but covers more than a day.",1406246400,,358,4.698412698412699
4897197,5,B005V5XTNO,"This is a documentary of the lives of a missionary family ministering in Papua New Guinea.  Very easy and enjoyable to watch, as the husband and wife are both likable, caring, insightful, expressive and courageous people with a genuine love for the Lord, their family, and the people of Papua New Guinea.  It was also a pleasure and encouragement to see how they are raising their children to love Jesus and to see how they truly desire to serve Him.  The love for the people they minister to is so readily seen as the story of their lives in this foreign land unfolds.  What pleasure to find this film!",1404000000,,603,4.504587155963303
4897198,5,B005V5XTNO,The Wells family are a true gift from the Lord.  Thank you for what you are doing and bringing this documentory to our living room.  We are being called to do many difficult jobs for the Lord and we do them while praising him in the hard times and the good times.  The Wells make this look easy.  The only way that is possible is with our God.  Praise be to our God.  In Jesus's name I pray for your family.  Amen!,1400025600,,414,3.975609756097561

4897200,5,B005V5XTNO,"Held my attention from the beginning, it's a lovely story of a remarkable missionary family. I love their testimony of the goodness of God; their love for the Lord, each other and the people they serve is so evident. It is a story that needs to be told, and it is done with excellence. Bravo. Truly enjoyed watching it from beginning to the end.",1397433600,,345,4.40625
4897201,5,B005V5XTNO,"Excellent, and it makes you think about what's important and your ministry not just for yourself but your family too..  A movie the whole family could watch.",1394841600,,157,4.814814814814815
4897202,5,B005V5XTNO,"This was such a blessing to watch and it made me remember my own missionary work in Samoa and Hawaii in the early 80's. The PNG people are so tenderhearted and seemed wonderful to work as the movie depicted. I know there were many things that were difficulties that were not shown and probably for good reason plus why muck it up with all the hardships when there were so many joys and fulfillment to share. I really enjoyed this film and wish with all my heart that God had made it possible for me to stay in Samoa at that time but......it just wasn't the right time or place. It made me know for sure that I wasn't called into that line of God's work and that it was just someone else's ""good"" idea and that never works out when it comes to mission work in a foreign land. It HAS to be a GOD-CALL or there isn't a call. If for no other reason, this film helped me to see that my time spent on the mission field so many, many years ago wasn't wasted. It was a time my three now-grown children will never forget..... so this film helped me to put it all into perspective. I can now go on and serve God right here, right now. Thanks to ""Two Hats"" for the journey to PNG and back again. Watch it, you will be blessed too!",1386633600,,1219,4.083333333333333
4897203,1,B005V5XTNO,"what I saw of this movie was great.  My biggest issue is that every time I rent from amazon, the movie I am watching stops mid-way through and I am seldom able to finish it.  That is what has happened with Two Hats.  My rental time has almost run out and I have not been able to access the last part of the movie.  My router bars show full strength, so that is not the issue.  I am very reluctant to rent from amazon again because of this persistent problem with the instant video category.",1384387200,,490,4.11578947368421
4897204,5,B005V5XTNO,"Excellent, inspiring.  great film for families to watch with adolescents.  well worth the time.  Amazing how they have been able to accomplish the things they have done.",1376352000,,169,5.185185185185185
4897205,4,B005V5XTNO,The testimonies at the end were great an challenging.  It will surely touch your heart and life if you allow it to.  But nothing will ever come close to it until you make an effort to go and see the mission field on your own,1376006400,,224,3.9555555555555557
4897206,3,B005V5XTNO,this is a really neat family who are being used of the Lord on the mission field in PNG. the film was shot really well and the editing and the music were all very professional.,1373760000,,176,4.057142857142857

4897208,4,B005V5XTNO,Amazing to see how this family and their friends have used their lives. Amazing words at the end of the show. Worth watching.,1367107200,,125,4.478260869565218

4897211,4,B005V5XTNO,Documentary about missionary to Papua New Guinea wearing more than one hat. Raised in PNG and then returned with his family to start a Christian radio station. As a past resident of PNG it warmed my heart to know how God is working among His people there.,1358035200,,255,4.446808510638298
4897212,5,B005V5XTNO,"This is a must see documentary!  Just when we think we've figured it out, we realize that our meaning in life has so much more purpose when surrender to God completely.  This movie clearly paints that picture!",1357948800,,209,4.621621621621622
4897213,5,B005V5XTNO,"If you ever wondered what missionary life was about this is the movie for you!  I felt like I was living with the family, they really got you inside their entire life style and made you feel like you were right their living with them.  The ups and downs and fierce faith of living by and for God is so exciting in this movie., I loved how they shared so many aspects of their personal lives with us.  From preparing the meals to being attacked in a foreign market place , this documentary has it all!  You get a high 5 out of 5 from me, and I'm a tough movie critic :)  Maybe you could do a series of missionaries in different parts of the world and make a mini series out of it :).  IN any case very enjoyable and well worth the price, thank you again !",1356220800,,754,3.993333333333333
4897214,5,B005V5XTNO,"Inspiring and there is enough about the children that kids might like it, and benefit as well.  I recommend it.",1354147200,,111,4.55
4897215,5,B005V5XTNO,"We found the documentary to be intriguing, inspiring,
and convicting. It gave us all a glimpse into the life of
of a missionary. The need has never been greater to
reach the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This
documentary represents missionaries sharing that very
message. We will watch this again and share with others.",1353196800,,328,4.875
4897216,5,B005V5XTNO,This documentary captured the Wells family and their ministry so well. As well as showed the viewer what real missions is like. The cinematography was outstanding. I would highly recommend this to anyone!,1348963200,,204,5.212121212121212
4897217,5,B005V5XTNO,"I rented this movie as a result of reading others reviews. The positive ones were right!  What an uplifting documentary on the lives of these folks.  Since I rented it, I have encouraged others to do the same. If you are in the ministry, don't miss Bob's comments at the end--what a blessing his words are! I'll probably rent it again, sometime soon.",1348444800,,350,4.5396825396825395
4897218,4,B005V5XTNO,A very poignant piece for loving God and His People everywhere and right now (No Excuses) ...Perfect to view with the entire family!,1346889600,,132,4.782608695652174
4897219,5,B005V5XTNO,"We watched this movie for our special family night.  All of us were riveted as we saw a real missionary family dealing with the everyday happenings in their very extraordinary surroundings.  Through Brad and Deborah Wells and their delightful children our family learned what these missionaries eat, how they live, what they do every day, how they interact with the people in PNG, and how they deal with trials.  These folks refreshed our souls.  It doesn't get any better than that.",1334275200,,483,4.925925925925926
4897220,3,B005V5XTNO,"The documentary is well made. This family is sweet and I love the multi-generational commitment to the ministry. Radio outreach is great. I do not doubt their dedication to the Lord and good hearts. However, I was appalled at the Americanized church they run, with the big pulpit on a stage complete with potted plants and pews in rows, a silent non-functioning laity and a pastor in a tie. There is almost nothing about the way Americans do church that has any basis in Scripture, and to export that to these people and guarantee that they will never learn to meet around the Lord Jesus Christ in their own cultural way, with their own music is just heartbreaking. Have these people read anything about missions? I really didn't think the Baptists were so culturally insensitive in this day and age.  I certainly expected a more or less traditional missionary family, but there was not a single thing about that church that appeared different than 1st Baptist of Anywhere, USA, except some of the faces. Brethren, these things ought not be. We might as well import the Catholic Mass, if we think one (American)way of meeting is good enough for every people group in the world. Where is the creativity and diversity of 'every tribe, tongue, and nation?' Show those people how to come together and share the Lord with each other with every member functioning, and get out of there so they can discover their own way to be the Body of Christ together, and display the Lord as they meet. And get the people developing their own radio shows to broadcast. I'm glad to know there are other groups who have done a much better job of church planting there than this bunch.

Also it was heartrending to see that in one small village there were two rival demoninations separating Christ's body that is to be one. At least it appeared he didn't think it appropriate to start a third rival denomination there. The film is focused on the family and a sort of 'week in the life of a missionary,' with almost no actual information on the culture or current status of the Church in New Guinea.",1332979200,9,2077,4.626016260162602
4897221,5,B005V5XTNO,"Not that I had a low expectation, but this film was even better than I thought it would be! No, it wasn't just bunch of boring interviews, nor did it try so hard to make some family ""look nice"". You can feel the sincerity. You can tell it isn't a ""show"". If you fail to see that this family truly wants to preach the gospel for the Lord Jesus Christ, I say check your honesty and make sure you have no bitterness against your brethren. Such an amazing job done for making this film. I love how it goes all the way back to how everything started, and how the Lord has blessed this ministry to this day. I know the fund wasn't probably enough, probably didn't even have all the needed equipments, etc, but the result is beyond great. It moves your heart. The message was more than clear, and by the end of the film, I was all teary, convicted, and challenged. Thank you for making this film. Praise God for the missionaries in PNG and the fruit we see today! I highly recommend this film!!!",1329264000,4,988,4.26063829787234
4897222,5,B005V5XTNO,"This is a must watch for you and your family, to see inside the life of a missionary! Very well done!",1326240000,,101,3.857142857142857
4897223,5,B005V5XTNO,"Excellent movie about a missionary family in Papua New Guinea. A very insightful look into the everyday life of a christian missionary. Very good video quality, felt like a hollywood movie. Would recommend to all!",1324598400,5,213,5.114285714285714
4897224,5,B005V5XTNO,"What impressed me the most about this film was the balance in portraying the life of a missionary.  There was everything from a loopy rascal stopping on the road, to a vicious attempt made on Brad's life in the market.  The film portrayed the frustrating spiritual warfare that is unique to the mission field, and the strength behind a united family unit.  The film delves into the cultural thinking behind the habits, practices, and lifestyles of the people in Papua New Guinea verses here in America; they are 180 degrees different.  The overall theme, which is reflected in the title of the movie, is that as missionaries it is not their job to make the world America, it's their job to win the world to Christ.

Not stopping with all of that though, by the time you're done watching this movie you feel like you know each one of the Brad Well's family members (all nine of them!) very well, and you just can't help but feel compelled to apply some of the principles that make them a wonderful family to your own life.  This film really makes you want to push the perceived limits of your spiritual walk - it's informative, entertaining, and challenging.",1323302400,4,1157,4.619512195121951
4897225,5,B005V5XTNO,"This was an excellent piece of work.  The passion for our Lord and His love was shining throughout this great multi-character study.  I loved the artistic, but unobtrusive camera work.  The beginning of documentary gave us a good feeling for the beauty land and the people and then we are treated to very endearing conversations with the central characters (an outstanding missionary family).  I love the Lord with all of my heart and my mind and my soul.....but, it takes a special gift, a very special gift to do what they do every day...love on people and share the gospel.  When the father and son look out upon the hills, we think of the beauty...but, then we are taken by the words of the father as he muses, ""I guess we're not done.  There are more people out there.""  That is a slight paraphrase, perhaps, but the spirit of the words touched by heart deeply.

  But, back to the film as a piece of work.....as I said, excellent.  We need great Christian film makers and we now have another one in the fold.  Praise the Lord and kudos to Andrew and Kayla Garcia.....and everyone who had a chore in this expression.  All three thumbs up!!  Er, wait...one of those thumbs wasn't mine!",1322006400,2,1189,4.547169811320755
4897226,5,B005V5XTNO,"Excellent documentary... very interesting to see missionaries' lives on the field. I had the privilege of being acquainted with Deborah before she married and moved to PNG. She is ""the real deal.""  ...very committed to God and living by the Bible. I was encouraged, as a pastor's wife, to see the lives of others in ministry, who hold the same biblical values we do. I look forward to my husband's watching it, because I believe it will greatly encourage him too. Sometimes you can begin to feel you're alone, only to find that there are still many who ""have not bowed the knee to Baal""! Such a blessing!",1321660800,6,604,4.592592592592593

4897229,5,B005V5XTNO,We watched this with the kids the night we got it in the mail.  Our children asked to watch it again the next morning!  They pray for our church's missionaries each night.  It was so good for them to see in video what our missionaries go through and what they can accomplish through the Lord.  I think it will help them pray more and develop a greater interest when missionaries come through our church to share their burden.
