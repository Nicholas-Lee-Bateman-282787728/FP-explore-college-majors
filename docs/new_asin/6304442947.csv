7871011,3,6304442947,"These two episodes, were not created in 1969.  On the other hand, the quality of the images is rather poor. Well, actually, overhelmingly poor. The first episode is very interesting. The second episode is mostly interesting because it showed the human side of Bruce Wayne. However, I had found ""Grey Ghost""'s villain extremely irritating.",1054684800,,338,5.2592592592592595
7871012,1,6304442947,"Okay, granted, the series is excellent; great animation, great stories, great dialogue, great film-noir scenery and great vocal acting.  The problem #1 that the opening for the original series was incredibly cool. Batman solo knocking over a couple of bank robbers done in an gorgeous sillouette style. Then they decide that they need to promote Robin's merchandise as well, so they scrap that piece of art for a slipshod clip-fest of Robin in action taken from the show.  They didn't even bother to make up a new intro for Robin, they just strung a bunch of clips together. Problem #2 (and this is the big one) is that the high and mighty WB in all their wisdom have not only decided to release this video tape in the third speed (EP or SLP) mode (thereby saving money on tape by offering the customer an inferior product) but they also deemed it neccessary to release it in a MONO format!!!!  The nerve!
My advice to you would be to tape it from TV.  You'll get a better quality recording.  Or better yet, wait until they decide to release this on DVD.",1019260800,6,1054,4.526315789473684
7871013,2,6304442947,"Of all the versions of Batman that comics have inspired, I enjoy this series the most. Paul Dini, the developer and producer of this series, places Batman in a special world--an odd combination of contemporary science and a noir/deco-era society. Further, Dini has dared to invest these characters with fully developed personalities. If any treatment of Batman can overcome the high-camp concept generated by the '60s-era live-action series, THE ADVENTURES OF BATMAN & ROBIN should do it. I cannot recommend these stories highly enough--exciting for children and entertaining for adults both. These stories make for real family entertainment.
However, I must add just a quick note here (and I'll append it to every review I make of tapes in this series)--while I think the Dini-produced animated Batman has been one of the hallmarks of 90s animation, I do not advise buying the tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound. It is a shame that these excellent programs do not get the packaging they deserve.",994723200,15,1062,5.0397727272727275
