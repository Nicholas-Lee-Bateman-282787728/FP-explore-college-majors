I was able to transfer the reels to a good cassette and thus, was able to view the program.  I really enjoyed it as I am an admirer of Howard Hill and a long-time archery enthusiast.  I was fortunate to be present at an amazing demonstration by him at a sporting exposition in Oakland, California in 1948.",1311033600,,444,4.313253012048193

7879661,5,6304873956,"At least one and possibly two or three of the scenes appear to have been staged reconstructions of events which had already occurred;  that does not detract from the movie.  Hill was probably the greatest archer of our age and possibly of all time.  He was good enough to shoot skeets with a bow and hit ten of twelve of them and he was not shooting yuppie archery equipment;  he was using a 90 lb longbow.

This movie is a sort of an ultimate martial arts flick showing a 40-something white guy doing things most of the Bruce Lees of the world wouldn't begin want any part of, i.e. taking on some of the most dangerous animals in the world with just a primitive weapon in his hand and no backup whatsoever.

Serious hunters spend lots of time in Africa and many of the stories you hear and read about Hill sound a good deal more dangerous than what you see on this particular film and include stories of incredible daring such as going into the bush after a wounded lion and shooting him between the eyes from fifteen paces.  One scene in this film shows Hill taking a shot at a lion running across his field of vision about 70 yards away and missing by a foot or so as the lion changes speeds while the arrow is in flight.",1151798400,2,1224,4.2727272727272725
7879662,5,6304873956,"Ignore Mike Brown's review! The animals were definately NOT tied down!

Ok so this was filmed in the 1930's with that sort of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom Un PC format.  If you get into that mindset and ignore the ""Aw Shucks"" kinda of matinee film making you are in for a real treat.

The archery skill (long bow) of Howard Hill has never been matched. The man is a savant with lots of nerve!  Shooting a charging she lion!  A rouge elephant! and a man eater crocodile.

If you are a fan of Capstick and Ruark and the tales of the safari days of Africa, this a must see.",1135987200,2,572,4.154545454545454
7879663,1,6304873956,"This is the stupidest, fakest film I have ever seen. As a life-long hunter & outdoorsman, it was obvious to me that most of the hunting & shooting sequences in this film were phony. The animals were tied to trees and shot at close range. The supposed grande finale was the phoniest, the elephant Tembo being a baby elephant tied to a tree and shot while it is wailing & thrashing, with bad editing shots of a different grown elephant. These guys were also demonstrating the worse hunter traits & ethics by picking up & taking back to camp baby animals. That is absolutely not done by hunters! The only good part of this film is the hilarious sequence where Hill uses the native boy as bait to lure in & kill the crocodile. Other than that this film is a complete waste of money & time.",1115164800,,785,4.346938775510204
7879664,5,6304873956,"This historical film makes you want to grab the first bow you can get your hands on . I enjoyed the film . Howard Hill shines in this film it shows his love of the outdoors ,his longbow , and the animals he pursues . Just  remember the film was filmed 50 years ago in a hollywood style. I cant wait  to show the film to my wife and kids .So they can see how africa looked  back then .",913507200,18,384,3.775
