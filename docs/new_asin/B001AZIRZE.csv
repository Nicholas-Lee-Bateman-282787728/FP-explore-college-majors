8280675,5,B001AZIRZE,I bought this DVD package for my grandson and he just loves it. He watches it all the time. I would continue to buy him the other seasons.,1294272000,,138,3.9642857142857144
8280676,5,B001AZIRZE,I am so impressed with these series.  It was well worth the money and we can't wait to get the next season and the future seasons.  The best part is watching with no commercials.  The plot can be followed so much better.,1241136000,2,220,4.190476190476191
8280677,5,B001AZIRZE,This collection is a fantastic watch.  It's nice to see a show that delves into the characters as well as keeping the story lines true.  Each season seems to outdo the next and the actors do a fantastic job making it a sometimes edge of your seat show to watch.  The DVD extra's in each season are exceptional.  It's always nice to see the lighter side of the shows in the bloopers (although season 4 doesn't have any) and the breakdown of some episodes.  Would be nice to get a few more extra's on the dvd's with behind the scenes stuff but all in all the collection is definitely worth the buy.,1240790400,2,596,4.285714285714286
8280678,5,B001AZIRZE,"What a wonderful collection!  It has provided many hours of entertainment and the additional features on the DVD's really enhanced the experience.  It was delightful to watch the side-stories as they evolved.  So much more than just another crime drama series, Numb3rs stimulates the intellect and captures your emotions with the beauty and the challenges of human family relationships.",1231200000,7,386,5.508474576271187
