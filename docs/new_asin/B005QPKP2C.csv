4859698,4,B005QPKP2C,"I purchased this DVD as I love Claudette Colbert and I have to say I was not disappointed. Claudette is amazing in this role and she ages 50 years throught the movie. It is definitely a good story about love and loss and if you ever had a crush on a teacher when you were younger, you will definitely hold ""Remember the Day"" in your heart. A good wholesome movie for those who are tired of the trash they put out today.",1365206400,15,419,4.121951219512195
4859699,5,B005QPKP2C,"I can't imagine a film like Remember the Day being produced today. It's very sentimental, which doesn't appeal to today's audiences. However, because of the sentiment, it does appeal to me. Claudette Colbert is very good in this film; John Payne is handsome and proved that he could act when given a good part. In just about every Playbill bio I've ever read about John Payne, he had listed this as one of his favorite films (Miracle on 34th Street being another one on his list). He's wonderful in the scene at the bandstand, when he's about to go off to war. Chokes me up every time.

I've had a bad, taped from TV VHS tape of this film for years because it was never available on VHS or DVD (until now). Part of the Fox Cinema Archives series, it's strictly ""bare bones"" - no chapters, no fancy inserts, no extras of any type - just the movie.",1363996800,20,846,4.3544303797468356
4859700,5,B005QPKP2C,"This movie has entered the rotation on my cable system (Time-Warner) and I've seen this excellent movie from 1941 for the second time (today, 04/09/2012).  Sentimental in nature, it basically deals with Claudette Colbert's character recalling events prior to World War I as a young teacher, the life she led, and the love that she had - and lost due to that terrible conflict.  Also, there is a focus on a particular young student that had a terrible crush on her at that time - who now was a candidate running for President.

Personally, any movie that Ms. Colbert did during the 30's into the early 40's is good enough for me (by default)!

Of course, the best part of the movie was the ending - with the candidate/former student looking up at two of the most important women in his life.  Take heed, you might just feel a little something that takes you back...to YOUR school days!

See the movie for yourself!

I rate ""Remember the Day (1941)""...Five stars!

P.S., At this time (04/09/2012), this movie is unavailable on Amazon (or anywhere that I can tell) - so be patient...",1333929600,26,1080,4.617801047120419
4859701,3,B005QPKP2C,"The movie rates higher then then film itself. It appears that this version was recorded off TV  So be aware.
the film is about a teacher who remembers in a flashback her class, and love with another teacher.",1405036800,,207,4.447368421052632
4859702,5,B005QPKP2C,"We love Claudette Colbert, and we were not disappointed in this movie.  Very sentimental and heartwarming.  We've watched it several times already.",1403481600,,147,5.636363636363637
4859703,4,B005QPKP2C,"I saw this years and years ago, made 7/8's of a copy on VHS.  Has been kind of difficult to find.  So many good actors actors, especially, during the war years.  I consider it one of Ms Colbert's great movies; then again, almost all were great to me!",1393113600,,250,4.166666666666667
4859704,5,B005QPKP2C,Very good story and excellent acting.  An old movie but well worth buying and watching.  I sure am a fan of hers and was not disappointed.,1391558400,,138,4.269230769230769
4859705,5,B005QPKP2C,"I am 83 years old. I saw this movie back in the 1940's, with a little girl that lived across the street, from me. Well, I fell in love, with Miss Colbert. The movie stayed in my mind, thru the years. One night, I was. watching the TCM channel and they were showing ""Remember the night"", with Clark Gable and miss Colbert. I thought, maybe they might have ""Remember the day"". They did, so I purchased it. It was GREAT!  It brought back so many great memories. WOW!!!",1389916800,9,465,4.284090909090909
4859706,3,B005QPKP2C,This cd tells a story about a teachers career living in a small town.  The ups and downs in her life until her retirement.  It also follows the life of one of her students who becomes a aspiring political candidate.  The book arrive promptly.,1389744000,,242,4.454545454545454
4859707,4,B005QPKP2C,Love the film but not the copy I received.  Cinema Archives is now a no-no to me.  Really needs extras,1388102400,,102,4.05
4859708,5,B005QPKP2C,"I had never heard of this film and bought it largely on the recommendation of other Amazon customers. After watching it, I was astounded that it is not better known. But it is such a perfect, seamless little gem and so faultlessly directed and paced, I can understand why movie-goers and critics at the time probably simply took it for granted. It is precisely what a good movie is supposed to be: engaging, amusing and completely satisfying. The cinematic equivalent of a really rich cup of hot chocolate.",1379030400,14,506,4.761363636363637
4859709,5,B005QPKP2C,"I saw this movie in 1941 in Union City, NJ when I was 11 at the local theater called THE STRAND. 70 years later I can tell you you that I know the story so well that it seems that time has stood still. A great movie, great acting, & such a moving story. Having lost two young uncles later in the war I can relate to the loss and the wonderful ending vividly. Don't make them like this anymore, and it's a shame. If this movie doesn't make you feel pain, loss, and joy - all I can say, try it again. AMAZON has the best price of current sellers of this DVD.",1373328000,13,556,3.8859649122807016
4859710,5,B005QPKP2C,"I have enjoyed this movie since I was a child. It use to be on TV all the time, but has not been on for years and years. So glad it is on DVD now I can now enjoy it when ever I want to. It such a heart warming story. Wish live were somewhat like then. It is good to see love, friendship and people who care about each other so meaningful. So go out and purchase a great movie and enjoy times when live seemed not so crazy.",1365724800,7,422,3.7
8483557,2,B005QPKP2C,"The 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives has produced several wonderful films, otherwise unobtainable on home video. This is a great film, very nostalgic and sentimental, but a disappointing transfer from the folks at 20th Century. The picture is very dark, even in the outdoor daytime scenes, which look as though they were filmed as day-for-night. Many scratches and dust specks are visible, as well as a constant graininess. At the 5:34 mark, there is a skip in the film, obliterating the third line of ""(Back Home Again in) Indiana."" The movie is watchable, however, a cut above the many public domain films available on home video, and the audio is clear. Given the production company of this transfer, I had higher expectations; my low rating is for the transfer, not the film itself.",1505520000,,786,4.917293233082707
8483558,5,B005QPKP2C,"I saw this movie on TV one Sunday afternoon when I was a kid and fell in love with it.  That was in the days when local TV stations didn't have me h network support (if any) and would buy movie packages from the studios to fill time on late night TV and on weekend afternoons.  (It's kind of hard to believe things were that way back in the early 1950s!)

Anyway the station showed this movies a few times over a year or so, and then I couldn't if d it again until it showed up again in the 1980s on TV, must in time for me to record it on my new VHS recorder!  And that was the only way I could see it until this DVD came out.  That k goodness for the improved quality

So the point of all this is to highly recommend this fine old gem of a mo tie!  (There was no point in repeating the plot that others have described.)  I hope you get it and enjoy it as much as I have-",1497657600,,872,3.7790055248618786

8483566,5,B005QPKP2C,"When I first saw this movie it was on a TV matinee that showed Classic movies during the day! Claudette Colbert in my young opinion was a right beautiful woman! She was a great actress & her role in this movie was that of a teacher in a small town in turn of the century AMERICA! I saw in her role some of the teachers who unfortunately tought me except with out the results of one of her students running for PRESIDENT! It showed me then anyone go grow up to be president with a good education & a good work ethic!
The movie shows the old teachings by which the AMERICAN people prospered in the so called good old days! For a look back in time at people's prejudice to certain things was interesting indeed! How it was a scandal for two grown ups to have a vacation together & how that it reflected on the morals of the school they both worked for! THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES ITS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!
The morals when I was growing up were almost the same shown in the movie!",1417219200,,992,4.118556701030927
