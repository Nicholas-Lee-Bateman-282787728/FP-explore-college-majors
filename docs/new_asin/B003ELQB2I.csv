8395570,5,B003ELQB2I,"If you want a film in Gaelic (Irish version) this is about it.  Nicely done, nice subtitles.",1438300800,,92,4.411764705882353
8395571,2,B003ELQB2I,The film description should explain that this film is a documentary not a drama.  No acting in this film.  The interviewees tell a story of one incident in WWII.  Interesting but not what I expected.,1371772800,,199,4.628571428571429

8395573,5,B003ELQB2I,Received my copy in the post yesterday and wached it last night. I have to say it provided a great insight into the lives of the ordinary local people of Ireland during WWII. A fantastic look back at how Ireland once was and how well the community responded in times of need. Highly recommend it.,1302566400,,296,4.4
8395574,5,B003ELQB2I,This is a wonderful production and an excellent account of the untold tragedies of World War Two. Beautifully filmed and the soundtrack was a perfect complement.  Should be included in school curriculum.,1296172800,,203,5.34375
