4129160,1,B003J7HO64,"I didn't really find this movie too funny.  Yes there were supposedly hilarious predicaments between the two couples.  The reason I wanted to even see it was because Jane Lynch was in it and I find her to be funny.  Yes, Jane Lynch was good in her role, but I have to say, that I did not really find this movie funny.  I just found it to be stupid.  It was too ridiculous to be amusing to me.",1294963200,,392,3.9743589743589745
4129161,4,B003J7HO64,"I didn't really know what to expect when I began watching this movie.  I'm glad I watched it however...it's absolutely frigging hilarious.  Bryan Callen has some really good comic reactions, and Matt Servitto and Jane Lynch are drop-dead hysterical as the crazy couple.  If you like your comedies completely absurd and over-the-top, you'll probably like this.",1282003200,4,359,5.375
4129162,5,B003J7HO64,"OMG- I went to a screening of this in the director's hometown Baltimore. This is truly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Jane Lynch had me laughing so hard that I was embarrassed for being so loud, but I couldn't help it. Be warned, there is some pretty risqu humor in this movie but that's why it works. In between outrageously funny moments are interspersed scenes so insane that only a crazy man could think it up. Thats meant to be a compliment in that a movie that can make you hurt from laughter and squirm seconds later is a gem in this era of formulaic romantic comedies. This director clearly has issues and let me say- I'm glad he does!! Lastly, I'll say that in spite of the silliness, there is a warmth to the movie that has you leaving feeling satisfied...5 stars!!!",1279843200,7,790,4.380952380952381

4129248,1,B003J7HO64,"After completing pre-cana classes less than a year ago, you'd figure I'd find some comedy in a movie parody of the process. Instead my experience with this movie started out as a mild amusement for an unusual couple leading the sessions. This amusement quickly developed into an annoyance before evolving into full-blown disgust. Think of Meet the Parents with Robert De Niro having an interest in Ben Stiller's sexual fantasies before revealing his fetish for milking anything with nipples. Over the top comedy usually works better when there is an actual light at the end of the tunnel. It also helps when you care enough about the characters to actually see how things play out rather than wishing you didn't witness the freak show in the first place. This is a film that would seem most appreciated by a teenage audience who giggle at any sexual reference imaginable, while the rest of the crowd is left waiting for the punch line that never arrives.",1298678400,2,954,4.823170731707317
