This is one of those ""small"" films that's worth its weight in gold - don't bother renting it, just buy it, because it's a keeper! Totally original, refreshingly unguarded, and just a sweet, funny story. Did I mention I'm very fond of this one? Do something nice for yourself, and discover Management!",1252800000,5,438,4.628205128205129
3903339,4,B002C39T3W,"This film was absolutely beautiful. It has that shy pre-emptiveness we expect from films which deal with tender topics such as love and approaching a girl. We all know that the chances of watching a Jennifer Aniston film and being completely bowled over are slim but this film does do that. I thought she was very good in the film and man, did the film have it's funny moments. Before watching this film, I saw Sunshine Cleaning and I quite liked the film. The one thing that is common between this film and Sunshine is Steve Zahn. Management, however, is the film that I liked more and I thought it had it's heart in the right place. At just 1 hour 20 minutes, this film never promises to conquer the world but it makes you go into guffaws.

This film has no flaws and unlike films like ""You, Me and Dupree"" this film never tries too hard to be cute. It's amazing how such films can be churned out even in 2009. I wish I had waited and seen this at the movies but that was not meant to be. I sneaked an advanced screening copy from some place and I'm sorry for that. There is wonderful chemistry between Zahn and Aniston. Girls, you will love this. Guys, you will not hate your girls for this.

3903379,5,B002C39T3W,"This is one of Jennifer annistons lesser known roles. She and Steve Zahn are a most unlikely romantic couple. This movie is a little gem in the morass of overhyped stuff that hits the markets these days. It's gentle, humorous and has unexpected moments.

3903380,2,B002C39T3W,"This hit or miss tale follows Jennifer Aniston, a serious business woman staying at a motel, and Steven Zahn (who plays the son of the parental owners of said motel). Boy sees girl and falls madly in love with her, especially after they make an awkward connection with sex and the like which prompts boy to follow girl to her place of residence. Girl freaks but finds it somewhat sweet but then complications ensue and boy loses girl to girl's ex boyfriend. Girl says ex boyfriend can help her with her career and we also know that she's there for the money after we see the place.

Throughout the whole tale it's made evident that boy needs to ""grow up"" in order to win the girl but the translation of him ""growing up"" seems to boil down to him acquiring assets. Or, you could read it as girl is only interested in a man with sizable assets. She ends up with her ex boyfriend (played by a punkish looking Woody Harreslon) and then things don't work out and boy eventually ""finds himself"" and goes out to see her with blind devotion becoming a charming stalker in the process (well, he was already like that actually). But girl doesn't seem to really think they have a chance until boy produces the deed to the motel that his parents gave him. Oh and she got to make all these mistakes at boy's expense and is even pregnant yet boy gives her this blind devotion even though it's going to be a ton of baggage that wasn't his fault. Niiiiice.

I would have been more pleased if they just put two lovers together who had a connection on many different levels. Putting two people together and making it evident that the girl would not consider the boy unless he had assets made me feel I was watching something from the Middle Ages. Okay, maybe just the Renaissance. Heh.

What's the point of showing two lovers who are supposed to have this awesome connection and then we conclude she will only consider him for his property? I could throw a rock and hit a bunch of people who fall into that category. How despairingly mundane.

There are some good moments in the film but that overall message pretty much drops the overall quality of the picture.

The budget for this picture is not listed (should I be worried?) but it earned only about 2.6M at the Box Office and a bit over $3.8M in DVD sales.

3903382,5,B002C39T3W,"I can understand why some people didn't like this: it is unusual, not your standard Rom Com. But here is what I loved about it:

- extremely well acted: the main characters have a sweetness and muddledness that evolves during the course of the movie, and does so in a way that is both moving and convincing. And, while at the beginning it was hard to believe that the two characters could grow close, by the end (or really the middle), it was very believable. I loved both Zahn and Aniston. and the supporting actors were funny (woody herrelson) and good (everyone).

- the story is romantic but not in a usual way. it's paced more slowly, which I liked a lot once I got used to it.

- it has a sweetness that derives from the Steve character (played by steve zahn), and actually from the other characters too.

if you like independent movies, with their unusual pacing, then definitely try this one.",1330041600,,900,4.469512195121951

3903385,4,B002C39T3W,Not a bad movie.  I don't know what people expect.  Not everyone wins an Academy Award.  Woody steals the show and it is worth a watch just to see him perform.,1320364800,,159,4.064516129032258
3903386,4,B002C39T3W,"If-you-pay-attention, which hardly anyone seems capable of these days, this movie is self-explanatory and the writing is surprisingly good. It sorta sneaks up on you around the half-hour mark when the dying Mom utters the first intelligent lines in the movie by saying ""She's logical.. in an emotionally annihilated kind of way"" and ""she has a heart of.. leather"". After that it begins to get it's thematic act together. Both Anniston and Zahn play-to-expectations during the first half of the film (when it's just a dumb comedy) but it, and they, really come together (..if you had only paid attention, Mr. Worse-Movie-Ever..) with just the right amount of pathos in an unusually satisfying way in the last couple segments of the film. Since the movies about growing up, moving on, their acting and characters are different people by the film's end (how often does that happen in a believable way in a US movie?) Also, there are a couple of totally wonderful songs I hadn't heard before [OK, I don't get out much - ""Cookie Jar"" by Mark Mulcahy and ""Adventures in Solitude"" by The New Pornographers). So, yeah, I thought it was a gem (but will skip the first 1/2 hour next time I watch it).",1316217600,,1190,4.753623188405797
3903387,1,B002C39T3W,"Any review of this movie that calls it out as being bad, would be dead on.  I'm not sure how anybody can watch this and decide it ranks as 5 stars.  If this doesn't strike you as over the top creepy when a guy working the night shift at a small hotel, then stalks and finds an attractive guest on the other side of the country, I'm not sure what to tell you... I do think you should probably talk to a counselor, or possibly the police.  It felt like Zahn's character should have had human body parts in his refrigerator or carving images of Charley Manson into his skin with a safety pin.  That Aniston's character allowed that creeper into her highly competitive and cold corporate life is COMPLETELY out of character.  I'm just amazed she read this script and decided it was a good call to be a part of this project.  I'm sure there were a lot of zeros behind whatever number was offered to her.  Or it was some sort of hostage negotiation deal worked out we will never know about.

The script if terrible, the acting droll, the story horrendous, and the outcome shameful.  Don't see this movie.  Please don't see this movie.  As for buying it, I'm sure there are plenty of weirdos out there holding hope they can chase a 10 across the country, offer her nothing, and still come away with the girl in the end.  Stalking isn't weird if it works, right?  If you answered ""right"" to that question, then this movie is for you.  So is the affection afforded by your dog thanks to peanut butter, but you already knew that.

3903388,4,B002C39T3W,Loved it.  Jennifer Aniston is exquisite.  She's a very subtle actress. Steve Zahn is totally adorable in this go-to-any-lengths-to-get-the-girl movie.  You won't be disappointed.  I am not sure what negative reviewers were thinking here.  It's a great film; zinged me straight to the heart.,1308528000,,291,5.5227272727272725
3903389,2,B002C39T3W,"I have watched this movie all the way through and I must say that this took some time and several sittings. Why? Because it was boring and contrived.
It wants to be an indie film so badly that it works in these forced, impossible awkward moments which, while played very well by Zahn and Harrelson, the other players just cannot pull it off.
Aniston cannot work in this part. She comes off as a brooding Rachel (yes, I know that this line is cliche, but true). I'm sorry to say that as I think she has potential (""The Good Girl"" showcasing some of this), but as much as I want to like her in this film I cannot. She is a bad fit. Maybe Zooey Deschanel would have been better? Woody Harrelson is great as always, but again how does this work into the point of the film?
This is a mish-mash of potential interest that crashes together and comes up pretty empty. See it if you must for a few funny moments with Harrelson and Zahn as well as a few funny scenes, but really there is so much better you could do with your time. 2.5 stars.",1307491200,,1032,4.190954773869347

3903392,1,B002C39T3W,"this is by far the worst movie I've ever seen.  Steve Zahn, who I generally like, played a goofy stalker.  it was hard to believe that Jennifer Aniston would fall for such a loser.

3903393,4,B002C39T3W,"The film was entertaining and the acting was good.  The dialogue and humor was funny, and realistic.  The movie wasn't the greatest thing ever filmed, but for a romantic comedy, its 10x better than what hollywood usually pumps out.  Its hard to believe people's ultra high expectations these days, especially considering that most films made are generic rehashed stories done with the same 2 or 3 hollywood stars.",1283212800,,413,5.044117647058823
3903404,3,B002C39T3W,"This film falls right into the formulae of Jennifer Aniston's other outings.  That is to say it is light, it is fluffy, it is not memorable.  Her agent has not ""put her out there"" and must go for broader vistas before she is too far into the over 40 territory.  Though she is more beautiful than ever, Hollywood treats over 40 women badly.  As in, ignores them.

It is truly a pity; Ms. Aniston is 1,000 times the looks of Julia Roberts but hasn't reached the Hollywood parts that would get her an Oscar or even a Peoples' Choice Award.  Bad luck, or bad press agent...

To cut to the chase:  if you love Jennifer no matter what, then you will already have decided to buy this film.  If not, keep your money and look elsewhere.",1282867200,,727,4.286764705882353

I don't agree with the other reviewers on here stating that the two leads have no chemisty, I think they do. Woody Harrelson is out of place in the film, I hated his character even though he tries to make the most of a so-so script. There's nothing really wrong with this movie, but it's pretty slow and the beginning is kinda far-fetched. Aniston and Zahn are two of my favorite actors but Management had me wanting to ""check-out"" early. It's a mixed bag for me.",1274313600,,545,4.571428571428571
3903406,1,B002C39T3W,"There is nothing positive I can write about this movie.  I'm a big fan of Jennifer Aniston and bought the DVD solely to see her performance.  I actually found myself feeling sorry for her that she risked her career to appear in this dud of a movie.  The movie is slow, the story-line is totally unbelievable, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the ""stars.""",1274227200,4,366,4.6
3903407,3,B002C39T3W,"Mike (Steve Zahn) is the night manager at a small motel owned by his parents (Margo Martindale and Fred Ward). One night a traveling saleswoman, Sue (Jennifer Aniston), stops by for a night's stay while she attends meetings in Arizona, and Mike is immediately smitten. Originally creeped out by Mike's advances, Sue decides to throw him a bone before she leaves to go back to Maryland. Mike can't get enough of Sue, and proceeds to buy a one way ticket to visit her in Maryland.

In 2009 we saw the wrong way to make a romantic stalker comedy with All About Steve, but before that playwright and screenwriter Stephen Belber offered up Management. Having worked as a writer in residence at Juliard as well as having received commissions from Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, the Hungtington Theater, Arena Stage, and Philadelphia Theater Company he seemed like the perfect choice to write and helm this type of semi-romantic comedy. Add to that the charm of Steve Zahn and Jennifer Aniston and it would seem that you would have a sure-fire hit.

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. Not to say that the movie's bad, but it unfortunately bombed at the box office. To be honest, the quirkiness of this movie isn't for everyone, but the natural charm of Steve Zahn makes his slight bit of creepiness palpable. But Stephen Belber fleshes out his characters making their actions more understandable at times when you'd typically be asking, ""What's going on here?"" And while you might still find yourself saying that at times in the movie, but as you move further through the narrative you find more of the motivation for their actions.

The acting is pretty good, which has a lot to do with the likability of the actors. Steve Zahn hits the right note between creepy and sincere/naivete. Jennifer Aniston is better than I typically think she is as Mike's love interest, a girl with a bit of a complex for always helping people. The movie is stolen by a cameo in the second act by Woody Harrelson as Sue's on again off again boyfriend and ex-punk Jango. As always I'm amazed at how well a hippy can play a badass!

As always though, Management is an indie movie that falls into that trap of most indie movies: quirkiness for the sake of being quirky. While Steve Zahn plays his role very well and makes him believable, the writing doesn't do much for the character making him simply too nave and too much of a simpleton. Also, at first, you can't really read Aniston's character at the beginning of the movie, and her choice to sleep with Mike seems off-putting and can turn off viewers early on.

I did enjoy this movie, but I do really think that it's not really for everyone. It's a decent movie, and I recommend it if you feel the inclination. Not quite good enough to be apart of my collection, but worth a viewing.

3/5",1272758400,3,2825,4.662650602409639
3903408,5,B002C39T3W,"The 3 best things I've ever seen Jennifer Aniston in are Office Space, The Good Girl, and now Management.  The more ""regular girl"" she plays the more attractive and charming I find her.  The more glamourous she tries to be, the more it feels fake.  She should be doing the kind of roles that Sandra Bullock was doing 10 years ago, now that Sandra Bullock has proved that she can play a slickly beautiful woman in The Proposal.

Steve Zahn plays an earnest but obviously immature character with subltly and surprising grace.  The movie is billed as a romantic comedy, and it does follow a lot of the familiar rom-com beats(complete with zany supporting characters), but it's really a story about growing up.  Zahn has to get out of the comfortable lifestyle, and he's rather forced out of it by circumstance, and Aniston's character pulls, or entices, him to move beyond his comfort zone.

There's an undercurrent of dreams and happiness deferred here, that's never really mentioned, but is clear in several of Aniston's loveliest scenes.  In one beautiful scene she sits up at night and contemplates essentially settling for Steve Zahn.  The movie never says it, never even really gets close, but it has a lot of interesting themes of putting aside the grand romance, putting aside the things that you keep chasing after so futilely and taking what's there, taking the happiness that you have.",1272758400,2,1393,4.843881856540085

A generally sweet and unassuming little romantic comedy, ""Management"" pits a socially-backward, good-natured doofus (Steve Zahn ) against a near-psychotic super-stud (Woody Harrelson) for the attention and affections of a seemingly unattainable dream girl, played by Jennifer Aniston.

Mike and Sue meet one night when Sue, a salesperson from Baltimore, stays at the motel Mike's parents own and operate - and where Mike works as handyman and general Mr. Fixit - in the Desert Southwest.  Despite the stark personal and socioeconomic differences between them, Mike becomes so infatuated with Sue that he pursues her, first to Maryland, then to her boyfriend, Jongo's, home in Washington State.

""Management"" is an uneven, though frequently endearing, minor-league romance that skates by on the likeability and charm of its three lead performers.  It doesn't always get the tone right, occasionally going too broad for its laughs, as when Mike, desperate to get back in touch with Sue, jumps out of an airplane and straight into Jongo's swimming pool.  Still, when it's being low-keyed and tender and sticks to the rudiments of offbeat romance, the movie modestly and unassumingly works its way into our hearts - even if it defies credibility a good deal of the time.",1270857600,,1274,5.251231527093596
3903410,1,B002C39T3W,"The last movie I truly enjoyed starring Jennifer Aniston was Office Space.  Since that time, she has descended into movie ""hell"" and starred in some of the worst, mind-numbingly awful movies ever produced.  This film fits that bill precisely.  The plot, in short sum, is this:

A successful sales executive (Aniston) travels to a family owned roadside motel and meets a dim, small-town front desk clerk who falls for her.  Although he is far from smooth, she slowly becomes charmed by his innocence and falls for him.  The movie documents their inability to really be together since they are separated by geography, class, etc.  There are few, IF ANY, comedic moments in the entire film.  It drags slowly through the plot and really just depicts the quirky-ness of two individuals with different lives.

This film tries to be artsy, but isn't.  It tries to original, but flails around so haphazardly in the process that one wishes both characters would fall down rusted steps at the motel and die a tragic death (thereby, ending the film early).

Jennifer Anniston and Woody Harrelson are wasted in this enterprise because their characters are so predictable and badly written.
A complete waste of film stock and talent and not to mention my wasted money and time watching and writing this review.

However, there was something about the way Management was shot that just made me want to look at the wall, my cat cleaning himself across the room, my son's Power Ranger toy strategically placed right at the top of the basements stairs.

3903414,4,B002C39T3W,"I can understand why people might not like this.  Steve Zahn's character really is something like a stalker and it is kind of hard to imagine someone like him not scaring someone like Jennifer Aniston's character to death.  And their entire relationship is absurdly unlikely.  Still, both Zahn and Aniston manage to be unexpectedly likable and in a weird way they end up making a nice couple.  Whether you like or dislike this will depend on how easily you buy into the entire concept.

Also, we live in a period in which romantic comedies -- which is actually my favorite genre -- are suffering from steep decline.  So, while this would not by any stretch of the imagination qualify as a great film, it is, compared to other options at the moment, not at all bad.

Another way in which the film managed to rise above many others of the same time is the photography.  Almost every shot is more interesting than you would expect in a film like this.  There are a host of interesting shots and camera angles and it really does rise higher than the typical film.

Also, got to love any movie that includes several New Pornographers songs.  But if you can cut the film a tiny bit of slack and willingly suspend that disbelief (along with your sense if incredulity) this is a film you could find fun.",1263081600,,1295,4.515021459227468

The actors do well with their thin, dull roles, but the writing is plodding. There's a teaspoonful of plot.  Every single thing the characters think and do is said out loud and often repeatedly. The cinematography is ordinary, locations are ordinary, the visuals are ordinary.

There are no subtleties or layers; as I watched, I kept thinking how wonderful it could have been if this intimate story had been told indirectly, obliquely.

The best part is the New Pornographers ""Adventures in Solitude"" in the soundtrack, but I suggest just listening to the song and making up your own movie in your head.",1262908800,4,662,4.831858407079646

Jennifer Aniston's character was not likeable for me, and I think it could be the worst role of her career.  She was mediocre, and the script didn't allow us to know her character enough to care about her.  When I should have been hoping for Zahn and Aniston's characters to end up together - I found myself hoping that he would meet someone nice and forget about her.

While at a motel she meets the clerk, played by Steve Zahn, who is far from the proverbial lady's man type, but somehow manages to charm Jennifer in his own way.  Though some of this may sound a bit ""been there down that"" in the genre (no love, unexpected guy), what sets this apart is the script and actors.

Both are very strong in general, and more so for this type of movie, which sometimes can be very weak.  The direction is also superb, all of which unexpectdly bought the movie up for me.

It's a hard sell at the best of times, but ""Management"" just about pulls it off - and it does so because of excellent writing and the stunning acting capabilities of its two principal leads.

STEVE ZAHN plays the hapless, but sweetly nave Mike Cranshaw who is living and working with his parents in their small motel ""The Kingman Motor Inn"" in the town of Kingman in Arizona (off Route 66). Mike's Mum Trish is effectively running the solid but uninspiring joint (a beautifully understated performance by MARGO MARTINDALE), while her says-little and does-even-less husband Jerry (FRED WARD at his effective best) seems stuck in a rut he doesn't know how to get out of.

Life at the Motel is routine and boring - especially for the friendless and womanless Mike. But just occasionally - he gets up enough courage to bring a bottle of plonk around to a lady guest in her chalet and try on his `complimentary' wine routine. It never works. But this time - Mike's heart gets more than it bargained for when it encounters the big-city, tight-suited Jennifer Aniston character Susan Claussen, who's in town from Baltimore to flog paintings to corporate clients. Planes to appointments, car rentals to accommodation and a laptop on the bedside, she is the very epitome of a young executive woman going places. Mike is the last person in the world Sue would consider dating, let alone spending a lifetime with...the idea is almost laughable to her. But of course she keeps coming back to his sweetness and he pursues her because he's besotted and simply doesn't understand 'no' - nor get the meaning of boundaries.

Along the way Mike encounters Zen Buddhists, takes piano lessons, sleeps in a basement in a Chinese restaurant and jumps out of a plane. There's one particularly great scene where Sue figures if she lets Mike touch her perfectly formed posterior, he'll give up and she can get on with her presentation notes and get a night's sleep (title above). She leans over and presents the said rear for his delectation. With his hand placed on her right cheek, they talk about weather conditions in Maryland - it's both visually and lyrically - very, very funny.

But what keeps you watching is the growing tenderness between the two. Mike may not be the smartest tool in the kit, but he is heartfelt and sincere - and in many ways despite her obvious intelligence and affluence, Sue isn't. She needs to learn that and he needs to grow up. Woody Harrelson also turns up in a great pantomime role as the ex-punk-rocker Jango who is now rich through dog handling. Later Mike's Mum Trish becomes gravely ill - thereby presenting the two men in her life with changes both may not want but need...and on it goes.

Written and Directed by first-timer STEPHEN BELBER and produced by SIDNEY KEMMEL, the offbeat rom-com ""Management"" hit the US screens in May 2009 receiving excellent reviews. And on the strength of this September 2009 BLU RAY - it's easy to see why.

I first spotted Steve Zahn in a wonderful film called ""Happy, Texas"" where he was paired up with Britain's Jeremy Northam as two escaped convicts trapped in a hick town which tames their thieving ways and changes both of them for the better. Zahn's been bubbling under for years, but in ""Management"" he really shines. A lesser actor might have overdone the inner nerd to go for hammy laughs - and in the real world his character's ludicrous naivety might even have been insufferable, but Zahn makes you ache for Mike's attempts at wooing Susan.

Aniston is more capable now as an actress than she's ever been. Her character's disbelief and dismissive awkwardness at first is so believable - and as the movie progresses - her barriers very subtly start coming down - to a point where you really do believe she would look at Mike as a 'nice guy' - and as 'good for her' - and that's more important than all the material crap in-between. She is superb in the part.

Although it feels like an Indie production, the BLU RAY image is beautiful throughout - really crisp - you are aware almost all of the time that this is high-def and not a soft DVD image.

The extras are great fun too; a feature-length commentary by Stephen Belber and Steve Zahn, Gag Reels and Bloopers (very funny outtakes - mostly of the whole cast giggling and fluffing lines), several Deleted Scenes and a Trailer.

""Management"" is not going to bolster up my gravity-bound man-titties or lessen the amount of hair growing out my nasal passages - but it has enriched my brain. At its core is a truly lovely premise - that love will out - and corny or not - that 'is' what many of us believe.

""Management"" isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but you can't help but think that the world is a nicer place, because this sweet little ode to hope is in it.

A nice little movie...",1259193600,5,5047,4.625698324022347

3903435,3,B002C39T3W,"Management is an odd flavor of romantic comedy mixed with a dash of something else. First you have Jennifer Aniston doing a nice job of quiet emoting - she has an inherent depth to her and a strong ability to appear somewhat lost and alone in a real and sympathetic way. Then you have Steve Zahn, who also has some depths to him, but he has a mixed role that's alternates between sweet love struck fool and someone stuck in a bad comedy, particularly the scenes without Jennifer Aniston around. She really anchors the movie, has funny chemistry with Zahn, and the plot wanders too far into dumb comedy at times when she's not on screen.

Overall it's still a fairly enjoyable movie, but I think it would have been better if it stuck more with its two stars and their awkward/sweet/funny relationship instead of veering too far into the dumb comedy realm with Woody Harrelson and the other guy who played Steve's friend.

Mildly recommended if you have nothing better to watch. It has some good moments, you just have to wade through some lesser comedy filler as well. The first half of the movie is promising, the second half gets a little off track but winds up OK in the end.",1257984000,4,1177,4.52112676056338

Then during the second half the comedy started and although I like comedy it seemed out of place like the movie shifted gears. Don't get me wrong, the comedy was pretty good just unexpected.  I thought the funniest scene was when Woody Harrelson came running out all wild looking with his auto-firing beebee gun and I got a good laugh out of that and would hate that scene taken out. I wish it had turned out to be as good as Mini and Moscowitz, but it was still very good and I am going to buy it for the first half and the ending.

STARRING: Steve Zahn, Jennifer Aniston, Woody Harrelson, Margo Martindale, James Hiroyuki Liao and Fred Ward

WRITTEN BY: Stephen Belber

DIRECTED BY: Stephen Belber

Rated: R
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 15 May 2009

If you've seen the cover for Management, you may have thought to yourself, 'Wow, Steve Zahn looks a bit like a puppy dog.' If you did, you were right. He is a puppy with a real bad case of puppy love for Jennifer Aniston's character, Sue.

Zahn plays Mike who is kind of a slacker slash loaner slash something else. He never really did grow up but we love him nonetheless.

He works as a night-time manager at his parent's hotel called The Kingman Inn, in Kingman Arizona. His life is real blah, to say the least.

Then along comes Sue. She's an uptight art saleswoman from back east. She's in town for two nights selling some hotel paintings and happens to be staying at The Kingman Inn.

Mike is instantly smitten for her and she is almost repulsed by his unique awkwardness. I won't spoil for you how they meet and how funny it is, because if you haven't seen the trailers (like I hadn't) then it will be a nice little treat for you.

I don't know whether to credit the actors or the writer/director (Stephen Belber) for this brilliant scene; they probably all deserve the credit. It was shot so well and has so much to it for the small amount of dialogue that's used.

Eventually, Mike grows on Sue just a tad and she leaves to head back east. Mike thinks there was a way bigger connection than there actually was and acts on it. He takes all his money and buys a one way ticket across the country to go and surprise her at work.

Sue is not pleased but does mildly see this as a sweet gesture and agrees to spend a little time with him. Once she discovers he only had enough cash for a one way ticket, she buys him a ticket back home and tells him it's just not going to work out between the two of them.

He learns that she has quit her job and moved to Washington to help her ex-boyfriend, who is now her new boyfriend again, who would still technically be considered an old boyfriend, right? Anyway, to help him with his yogurt business.

Mike realizes that he may lose her forever and sells everything he has and moves to Washington. Once there, he has no idea how to contact her or find her and is homeless and jobless.

He meets Al, (James Hiroyuki Liao), who next to Mike was the funniest character in the movie. Al works in a Chinese-American restaurant that his parents run and offers Mike a job and a place to stay. Mike agrees and moves into their basement.

Together, they set out on a quest to get Sue back for Mike. Al is the ultimate wing man and is hilarious. I'm sure we can expect to see this young actor in a lot more films.

They eventually track Sue and her boyfriend down and plenty of funny shenanigans are had. Woody Harrelson plays the boyfriend who is often referred to as, 'an ex punk'. Needless to say, as always Woody adds a nice mix into the comedic elements of this film.

But the film isn't just a comedy. It's filled with several dramatic and touching moments that really hit you in the gut. This isn't your typical romantic comedy by any means. There are no clich&eacute;s here and the movie isn't predictable.

In addition to a lot of laughs, there are great performances from every actor on screen. One thing that makes it so great is how much you get out of short scenes. Fred Ward and Margo Martindale aren't in the film for very long at all, but you feel like you really get to know them because their performances as Mike's parents are so believable and enjoyable.

I especially loved the scene between Mike and his father involving a necklace. It's such a simple scene and with other actors would have been a lot less.

Aniston may make a lot of the same kinds of movies but she never is the same character in her films. Here she is uptight but caring and has a soft side that only Mike can seem to bring out in her.

Zahn definitely has a bigger part in the movie. We follow him through the entire film and I think this is probably his best performance. There is a scene towards the end of the film where he really breaks down and we see that he's a lot more than just the funny guy. Steve Zahn can play both sides of the coin, being dramatic and hilarious every bit as good as Robin Williams.

If you want to watch a romantic comedy that most of us can relate to, will surely bring a smile to your face and a tear to your cheek, then Management is that film.

Stephen Bebler did a knock out job for this being his first major film. It was beautifully written, hysterical at times and heart-warming at others. More films of this genre should take a few notes from what he's done here.",1257724800,,4769,4.338582677165355
3903438,5,B002C39T3W,"While her character in Management isn't one of the sweeter and more personable characters she's played, you really just can't go wrong with any Jennifer Aniston movie.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about Steve Zahn's ability to hold his own alongside her, but he turned in a terrific performance.  It's not easy to play a sort of dumb character in a serious, natural, and completely honest manner, but Zahn does it.  There are laughs aplenty to be found here, but this is no dumb comedy - not by a long shot.

Poor Mike (Zahn) is about as smooth with the ladies as I am.  When Sue Claussen (Aniston) checks in at the family-owned hotel where he works as the night manager and janitor, he is immediately smitten and uses the old ""complimentary wine"" ruse to try and get to know her.  A couple of uncomfortable yet very funny scenes ensue, and we learn that this beautiful woman who is way out of Mike's league is something of a lonely soul herself.  That being said, Sue has no thought of ever seeing Mike again - until he shows up at her workplace on the other side of the country a few days later.  In a seemingly foolhardy and somewhat spontaneous move, Mike has spent all of his money and left his family behind just to come and see her.  Sue is less than happy about this unexpected turn of events, but a part of her can't help but be touched by the puppy-dog devotion she has inspired in this strange young man.  After returning home, an undeterred Mike sends her letters and poems before chasing after her once again when she moves to the state of Washington to reunite with her old boyfriend (Woody Harrelson).  Mike proves himself quite willing to do anything, no matter how crazy, to see her again.  Anybody else would come across as a stalker, but Mike is far too genuine and sincere in his unabashed love for this woman to be considered anything of the sort.  And no matter what happens, even when all hope is seemingly lost, he still loves Sue in a most beautiful way.

The story is really all about learning to manage your own life.  Even when she seemingly has all she thinks she wants and needs, it is really Sue who is screwed up the most.  Mike is obviously a dreamer and an eternal optimist, while Sue tries to find happiness in going about her life in a totally pragmatic fashion.  Both ultimately learn that sometimes you have to let go of everything in order to find what you have been trying to attain all along.  I loved this sweet and quirky romantic comedy.  I feel sure that most people will be able to identify themselves with one of the two main characters and maybe even learn something about themselves by enjoying the comedy foibles that make up this most unconventional of romances.",1257638400,,2720,4.480730223123732
3903439,5,B002C39T3W,"This movie really brought tears to my eyes. I thought it was going to be a comedy. Instead, it was a romance with very honest characters and an unusually realistic feel to it. I think this is the best role I've ever seen Jennifer Aniston play. Steve Zahn is someone I've liked but never saw him as a leading man.
  The words 'leading man' hardly describe him in this movie. He is one of the two main characters (Aniston is the other) and he draws the viewer into his world. At first, you wonder if you really want to be in that world. Then, by the end of the movie, you feel like he could be your best friend.
  I can't help but think of another movie, 'Being John Malkovich', that tries to bring the viewer into a world. Sure, that world is topsy-turvy but the point is: that movie doesn't succeed in doing that half as much as this movie does. And that movie was critically acclaimed. This movie has not gathered much notice but I predict it will gain a reputation and stay around for a long time. I've already thrown out my copy of 'Being John Malkovich'.
  It takes 20 or 30 minutes to establish some things and it does this at a very slow pace. Stay with the movie - it picks up quickly and you love the characters, you just can't help it.",1257638400,4,1244,4.205882352941177

All actors are brilliant and it's just so amazing to see them move and mature..and grow.  A bit of therapy perhaps for the self as well.  Great movie for anyone.,1255824000,,289,4.377358490566038
3903444,4,B002C39T3W,"Steve Zahn and Jennifer Aniston are indeed an awkward couple, which is why I think they work so perfectly together in this awkward little romantic comedy.  Zahn plays Mike, the night manager at his parent's Arizona motel and Aniston is Sue, a traveling corporate art seller.  Mike is quirky and odd, he does yoga and brings Sue complimentary bottles of wine and champagne to try to hit on her when she stays in the motel on a business trip.  Sue is uptight and self absorbed; she's adamant about recycling and feeding the homeless. The two are complete opposites but when Sue gives in to Mike just a little, he refuses to give up till he gets the girl.

This is not your typical cutesy romantic comedy.  There are odd silent moments between the two characters which definitely make it uncomfortable for the movie viewer, but it also makes the movie more real. There are so many people in the world who do get wrapped up in their boring lives and refuse to live a little, and this film might have them wishing that someone like Mike would come knocking on their motel room door and want to ""touch their butt"" and force them to bend and break and live a little.

Mike takes chances to go after the girl even when Sue jumps on a plane to go home.  It's obvious when he buys a one way ticket to go see her, not just because he didn't have enough money to get back if things didn't work out. And even though she turns him away, he still refuses to give up no matter how odd or boring she turns out to be. It may seem he just isn't good enough for her, but when Mike returns to Arizona to say good-bye to his dying mom, he realizes he can't give up.  If you really want something, you've got to put down the cards that life deals you and go out there and get it. Even when Sue is ready to settle down and all her dreams come crashing down, Mike is still there for her. It's the classic tale of the boy waiting to get the girl, even after her Prince Charming is gone.

Woody Harrelson and Margo Martindale make up an excellent supporting cast in this sweet little film.  See it for yourself and be the judge.  The humor is very real and doesn't seem forced at all which is why I think I appreciated it so much. You too might find yourself wanting to live a little after this one.  If anything, you'll learn to manage!",1255737600,2,2310,4.248858447488584
3903445,5,B002C39T3W,"Was having a hard day and this movie just made me smile; that kind of smile that warms you up and lasts.  It's not a 'chick flick', it's a movie for everyone; about growing up.  How many times I've looked for something to fill an emptiness... only to find that the 'real good stuff' comes when you let go and take the leap of faith, follow your heart, etc. I can think of many loved ones I would recamend this movie to.

I give it five stars because for the message it's meant to give, for the beauty in which it portrays that message, just the fun of it, it was perfect!  That says a lot!  Watch it!!!",1255651200,,602,4.067796610169491

As far as Jenifer Aniston goes, her movies are usually just average to not that great, so I was pleasantly surprised when she did a good acting job.  It is a quiet film, but I think worthwhile because it is interesting to watch how Steven Zahn's character Mike grows as a person.  There are both silly and touching moments, so if you like that sort of movie, you will like this one. I would recommend giving it a shot!",1254873600,2,552,4.228571428571429

3903451,1,B002C39T3W,"This film is labeled as a romantic comedy, but it isn't very funny and the romance seems forced. I didn't laugh the entire first half of film. I don't mind a serious romance film, but just felt like this movie didn't really hit the spot. Too many times, the plot became utterly unrealistic and farcical. First of all, a corporate saleswoman falls in love with a semi-retarded motel clerk? Would that ever happen in real life? Furthermore, would anybody as good looking as Jennifer Aniston fall for somebody who looks like Steve Zahn? Jennifer Aniston's real job is to run a soup kitchen? It just seems to cute and good to be true. I hate to be cynical, but in order for a love story to work the audience has to believe.

The second half gets a bit better, with Woody Harrelson and James Liao. Liao in particular is hilarious, playing off stereotypes of Asians. Harrelson and Liao bring the humor and spunk missing in the first half. However, it still seems like there's too much missing, as if too many ideas and relationships were packed into 90 minutes - too many loose threads. Steve Zahn becoming a Buddhist monk? It could be funny, but it's never quite as funny as it should be. Even my wife, who normally likes these types of movies, got up and left. Frankly, the entire movie would have been better off with just Woody Harrelson and James Liao.",1254614400,9,1351,4.536885245901639
3903452,5,B002C39T3W,"""Management"" is a perfect comedic drama if you want something geniune and quirky.

Steve Zahn plays Mike, a mellow motel clerk. Behind his docile demeanor he's an earnest guy. He doesn't seem to question ""why"" about things so much as plunge heart-first into them. If that makes you think, ""oh no, one of those people"" -- remember this is Steve Zahn. He is likeable as the type of guy who wears his Buddhist robe with a zip-up hoodie. I don't know what it is that keeps him from being so sweet as to be saccharin...all I know is that he plays Mike perfectly.

Mike meets Sue (Jennifer Aniston) a traveling saleswoman who sells art prints to motels. He brings wine to her(claiming it is a usual motel service) and awkwardly charms himself into her room. Sue is exasperated, but somehow intrigued. I think his vulnerability pulls her in.

Mike has her number too. He notices that Sue takes care of everybody else, but never herself. He knows who she is beneath her cool exterior. Great combination and great chemisty between these two. They bring out the best in each other. (cute sideline into their characters -- when they are driving bumper cars, notice that Mike isn't hitting people hard enough and Sue takes over the wheel)

Solid script, solid co-stars. Management is the kind of film I'll watch again. (it is emotionally satisfying and it has quiet jokes and interactions that play well a second time) The tone of the movie reminded me just a bit of Harold and Maude -- maybe because this relationship is about the personalities -- and some eccentricities -- and how two people can ""get"" one another (there's not an age difference in this movie however)",1254528000,8,1658,4.687285223367698

Jennifer movie and took it to a higher level.
Steve Zahn is tremendous. He hasn't been appreciated in the way he deserves, but there's an Oscar in his future. He is an actor that you don't have to hold YOUR breath, worrying about a line not ringing true. He can carry a nuanced role without the tiniest out of character moment.

Jennifer is a damn good actress, and rises when she has a co-star like Zahn. She took a risk in ""Cake"", and was good.
Some thought Oscar worthy, but I'm waiting for her tour de force, performance, and it will come.
Maybe with Zahn?

Harrelson, Steve's mom, dad, and Steve's friend were great!

8363007,3,B002C39T3W,"Review of Management
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

A couple of movies back, I cautioned Jennifer Aniston against taking strictly girlfriend roles in which, if her character was eliminated from the story, there would be virtually no consequence. She must have heard me. In Management, she plays much more than a flighty, bohemian squeeze for a bigger star. She plays a skirt-suited, professional career woman, who takes a slightly odd love interestand first billing.

The script zigzags between dark comedy and awkward romance, matching the questionable pairing of Aniston and Steve Zahn. And while it masters neither genre, its not at all unpleasant to watch. Some of the romance is cringe-worthy, and some of it is really sweet. Ive seen it twice. Try it once and see if you like it!",1497225600,,785,4.9393939393939394
