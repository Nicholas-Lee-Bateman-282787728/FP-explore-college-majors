8024861,5,B00029YM6C,great info if you are going to do this,1524528000,,38,3.3333333333333335
8024862,5,B00029YM6C,Excellent video. Art gives clear concise instruction on bedding the M1A. Books containing this level of instruction cost twice as much without the added benefit of seeing the steps demonstrated. All though Art uses a drill press to route the stock for bedding these task can be accomplished with a chisels or a Dremel tool as Art states in his video. The video is an excellent resource for anyone wishing to learn to glass bed the M1a. Anyone with basic tools and some mechanical aptitude with practice will become proficient at glass bedding.,1457222400,,543,4.849462365591398
8024863,5,B00029YM6C,Really good procedures. Sub minute groups with a Polyteck after the glass bedding using LC LR (not even my super-anal handloads).,1435190400,2,129,5.190476190476191

8024865,1,B00029YM6C,This was a waste of money and time.  The level of recording was amateurish and the quality of the instruction was poor.  I would not recommend this to anyone.,1416182400,,158,4.413793103448276
8024866,2,B00029YM6C,"This video lacks a clear, methodical approach to glass bedding a your M1A stock.  A book with pictures would be a lot more useful and go much more into depth.",1385424000,,158,4.266666666666667
8024867,2,B00029YM6C,"Too much money for a home made video!
Art ist using professional gunsmithing machines - the amateur uses what?",1311033600,,110,4.842105263157895
