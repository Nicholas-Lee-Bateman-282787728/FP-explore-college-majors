8075801,5,B000A7Q1OC,"This film charts the path of two star-crossed lovers who's desire to be unified in marriage is often thwarted by their clashing families. A sweet but often tense tale of modern life in Iran, where true love can be displaced by pointless hate.",1337558400,,242,4.651162790697675
8075802,4,B000A7Q1OC,"Very much in the spirit of the better Hollywood madcap comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. If you are looking for a lively and entertaining farce, this film is probably worthy of five stars, but it loses one star because of a crucial mistranslation in the subtitles, which made numerous references to a 'drowsy.'  I would have enjoyed the film more if I hadn't been so distracted by trying to figure out what a 'drowsy' was (near the end I finally realized that the intended word probably was 'dowry').  Otherwise, this film is an excellent choice for some very well done silliness.",1323820800,,579,4.666666666666667
8075803,5,B000A7Q1OC,"A gentle film, most Iranian movies are heavy melodramas to show difficult social conditions that American views find difficult to watch or understand. However, this film is about a family that won't allow their children to marry for two decades. It reminds one of Shakespeare's play ""Romeo and Juliet"". Eventually it all works out, but how is the surprise. A light hearted entertaining movie for the entire family. There is subtle humor and raucous slapstick.  A great flick, well worth picking up. This movie can be watched over and over.",1229558400,2,539,4.988888888888889
