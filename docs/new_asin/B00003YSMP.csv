8601934,5,B00003YSMP,"I first viewed this movie with my father, many, many years ago on Christmas Day in our small, but cozy home, while growing up in the small town of Ancaster, Canada.  At that time, my Mother, brother and two sisters, lay ill with the cold flu and never had the chance to see the film.  I remember clearly, in my mind's eye, almost thirty years later, the clarity and magical beauty of the animated characters ... it was spellbinding!  And, unfortunately, as the years have passed, my father and I have almost completely given up in trying to find, and purchase this film, that has remained in our hearts as one of the best animated films ever created.
