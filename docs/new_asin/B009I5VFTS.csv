8541778,5,B009I5VFTS,"I bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband, who is an Avengers (super)fan. He is an avid collector of comic books and superhero memorabilia, and I wanted to get him a special version of one of his favorite movies ever. Well, this did the trick! It's beautifully packaged, and when lit, the box looks amazing. The book that comes with the gift set is a hardcover, full sized book. He was absolutely entranced with the set, so I was totally happy. We watched the 3-D version last week with the family, and I think we enjoyed it more than in the theater...and as I watched him showing off his special box set, I was once again happy that I'd found it. It's a great deal for a great box set!",1376438400,2,696,4.28030303030303
