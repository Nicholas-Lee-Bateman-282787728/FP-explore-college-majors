I like that it has two movies in one, twice the bang for my buck. And the quality was great! A solid buy for any Thomas lover.",1389398400,,265,4.018867924528302
8328628,4,B001O0TMCM,"Our son liked this one. The ""treasure"" is what got his attention. He's very much into pirates and treasures lately. But in all honesty, he doesn't ask to watch it that much.

8328629,3,B001O0TMCM,"I placed an order for this movie from Media Thrill LLC, 109 Ambersweet Way, Davenport, FL 33897-8418.  They shipped the wrong movie after we had waited nearly 3 weeks for it to arrive.  When I contacted them to get the order corrected, they said I could return the unopened movie for a refund.  Have you ever presented a child with a package from the mail?  Did you have any luck telling them they could NOT have the movie after they already opened the package?  Well, MediaThrill then changed their mind and so graciously told me I would be allowed to return it still, although it was ""unfortunate I opened an item that was not what I ordered"".  They then said what I had ordered was ""no longer available to them"" so they could not correct the order.  So it still ""wasn't their fault"".
What a joke.  They obviously can't handle their business, so don't order from them.
As a result, I can't actually review this movie, as I have not seen it, even though I ordered and paid for it.",1256342400,5,981,4.411111111111111
