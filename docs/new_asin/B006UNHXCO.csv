8504629,5,B006UNHXCO,I combined this one and the second DVD and the workouts are fresh and tuff... Thanks Joe Rogan for putting this guy on..,1492041600,3,120,4.260869565217392
8504630,5,B006UNHXCO,The workout is awesome and tough!,1483488000,2,33,4.666666666666667
8504631,1,B006UNHXCO,"Horrible! do NOT buy this. Half of it doesn't even use a kettle bell!
It starts out with turning in a circle 20 times. Dumb!",1469059200,,124,4.0
8504632,5,B006UNHXCO,"I like the basic no frills production quality.  I like that there are options to focus on strength or cardio.
As a former personal trainer, it's my favorite workout routine ever.",1460160000,2,178,4.741935483870968
8504633,2,B006UNHXCO,"One look at this guy and obviously he knows what he is doing when it comes to fitness, so nothing against him.

However, as a video producer, he couldn't be worse. This is literally a home video, shot on the cheapest of video cameras. Complete garbage video, sound and music quality. He literally did not edit this video, just cut together a few clips of him working out.

He accidentally misses sets in just about every workout, for a ""professional"" DVD that you pay for, I'd expect a little better quality, attention to detail and editing.

The workout is amazing, but the flow if terrible, he has to rhythm or cadence so trying to keep time with him is very clunky and jerky.

Sometimes you'll hit play and he'll spend way too long explaining a simple workout. Other times, you hit play and he is literally already doing the workout with zero explanation of the movement, so keep the remote close.

Most frustrating of all, he often stops in the middle of a set to explain the workout. That's fine the first time you watch the DVD, but once you've got the hang of things it completely messes up your workout flow.

I hate to bash Keith, because he clearly knows a lot about fitness and this is a great workout, but the quality of this video is absolute garbage. Save yourself the frustration.",1415577600,11,1295,4.512820512820513
8504634,4,B006UNHXCO,"Extreme is the right word,  I wanted something similar to insanity.  I'll list the bad first.
Cons:
1 video quality and music is pretty crappy, it's pretty much a home video of a dude working out.

2 One awesome workout (that I know of so far) miscounts pretty bad. It's a ladder workout with exercises switching from left to right, 5 reps down to 1. Almost every round he accidentally skips a workout or 2.  (It's like ""hey we skipped presses on the right side again) For a pro video that you pay for, you think they would proof read it before submission.

3 The editing is a little fast. You have to have the remote in your hands next to your KB sometimes. You press play, and it's like ""OK 10 of these""  You should announce each workout with one example first like insanity, plus give the viewer a couple seconds to get equipment ready.

Pros: Definitely intense. This guy is a freakin' animal, you better know your stuff first.  I'm new to kettle bells, I just got a 20 KG bell and I am fried after each workout. The guy says, ""OK ten snatches on the right! Ten overhead squats! Ten of these!"" And he does the reps and transitions crazy fast. I had to stop from time to time to teach myself snatches or get my OH squats down pat.

There are about 10 workouts or so, averaging around 5-7 minutes. One day I might do cardio and squats, then do the core routine a couple times. You can mix and match how you like which is cool. This is not a video where you press play and workout for 40 minutes straight with breaks, they're intense 5 minute videos.

This is my first KB video, so I have nothing to compare it too.  The quality and production is definitely B rated compared to insanity since he doesn't have a mic, but still a great workout. I've had my a** handed to me every time. I do a few of these plus additional exercises of my own afterwards, and I'll be 100% soaked.

Difficulty  Level: I work out 6 days a week, some running, power lifting, rucking, body weight, etc. If you are between this and a Jillian Michaels DVD, you're probably in the wrong section. This is tough with a 44 lbs bell. I guess if you have the luxury of going lighter maybe it will be easier.

Keith Weber is a good workout host. (or whatever that's called) Not as dorky as Tony Little or charismatic like Shaun T. but he's straight to the point and has a good attitude. The routines are pretty well structured.

$30 is a little expensive for a cheap production but I don't regret the purchase, definitely a good tool for the arsenal. I'd imagine you would get ripped pretty fast with this one.

* The only equipment required is 1 kettle bell. And maybe a mat for the core section.",1383436800,10,2665,4.289421157684631
