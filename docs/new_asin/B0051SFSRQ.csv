4525915,3,B0051SFSRQ,"The film itself is about a female Canadian football team (proper football, what the Americans would call `soccer') holding a fundraising bikini car wash. Except, wouldn't you bloody well know it, their bus breaks down on the way. Stranded at an abandoned gas station, they use what facilities they have available to hold a makeshift bikini carwash there. Except, wouldn't you bloody well know it, they're being stalked and stabbed by an unhinged and ungroomed serial killer with an unusual and unexplained ice fetish. Will they survive? Will they be able get away etc. etc.?

So far, so familiar, and ever so slightly worrying. However, I was immediately struck when watching Bikini Girls On Ice by the high quality of the cinematography. For the most part, and considering the context of the type of film it is, it looks really good. I'm presuming it was shot on HD, which would certainly account for some of the film's look. However, it must be said that the film doesn't feature a mass of static shots and wobbly handheld silliness that plagues many of its contemporaries. I was genuinely really impressed with the look of this film.

Also of a surprising quality is the acting. Okay, we're not seeing any award-winning performances here. What we are seeing is a bunch of actors all doing relatively well. There really aren't many weak links, and so the consistency adds up to being another plus in the movie's favour.

The script is a bit of a problem. The story is familiar and slight. The dialogue is clunky and unnatural sounding. The beginning zips along nicely, but the pacing becomes an issue about halfway through (I'll be coming to the problems with the second half in a moment). The script could have done with quite a bit more work and lets down all of the other good things Bikini Girls On Ice has going for it.

Bikini Girls On Ice suffers from two other huge problems. The first is that, although the film starts out soundly, it begins to wobble in the middle before completely collapsing in on itself at the end. It becomes muddled, misguided and a good deal of what happens is illogical. As an example, it's hard to understand how no one noticed that what two of the characters find in their car trunk  at one particular point just doesn't make sense. It's a shame, because based on what they manage in the first half of the film, the makers of Bikini Girls On Ice are clearly capable of better.

The second issue I'm almost embarrassed to mention, but I think it's important that I do. It's called Bikini Girls On Ice. Where the flipping heck is all the gore and nudity? Oh sure, there are plenty of girls in bikinis, but we get one brief topless sex scene, and that's it. As far as gore, pretty much all of the kills are off-camera impact shots where you really don't see anything. I'm not against films that don't include buckets of blood or barrels of breasts, but the title surely indicates a camp, OTT sleaze fest. This film is actually very serious.

So, in an ideal world, this film would have a different title (and a better ending), and it would be well received and the people involved would move on to be successful and happy.

I'm pleased that this film exists. I just wish it co-existed with the film I thought Bikini Girls On Ice was going to be",1315094400,7,3279,4.583617747440273

8453189,2,B0051SFSRQ,"Some movies you just know are going to be bad, and normally I'm able to resist their siren call; but with this one, like a car wreck you have to rubberneck, I just had to watch it.  I think it was the title (I admit it, I'm a movie snob, but I'm still superficial at times).

This is a by-the-numbers slasher flick, with all the usual elements:  Good Girl Protagonist, Morally Corrupt Associates, The Cute Guy She Really Likes, Abandoned Setting, Warning By Kooky Local Which Goes Ignored, People Going Off Alone So They Can Be Easily Killed, Killer With Vanishing Skills That Would Make A Ninja Green With Envy, and the Indestructible Killer (did I miss any?  I tend to avoid slasher movies, so I may have missed a few).

However, there were two important points the makers missed, the Killer's Backstory and the Virgin's Revenge.  Now, with the Killer's Backstory, I'm sure that had there been one it would have made little difference in the overall quality of the film, but it would've been nice to have some reason why he did what he did.

My degree in Armchair Psychology tells me this guy grew up in an abusive home by a single parent (I'm not sure which).  Given his penchant for cutting off his victims' bikini tops, either he watched as his father brought home women and focused on their breasts or his mother liked going around the house topless.  As for his apparent sexual thrusting during his kills, he was probably caught masturbating and beaten within an inch of his life and now has severe performance anxiety.

As for the Virgin's Revenge, missing this one is practically a cardinal sin.  You've seen it once, you've seen it a million times.  The morally pure protagonist, having spent the first 90% of the movie trying to escape the killer, now faces him down all by herself and only by casting aside her puritanical values is she able to defeat him.

But in this, aside from throwing a knife into his neck, the protagonist keeps running around screaming and asking him why he's doing what he's doing.  Only a timely arrival by the Kooky Local (now armed with a shotgun) saves her.  What's more, we don't even see this final battle, instead we are treated to a close up of her eyes.

Usually, when I go into a movie with low expectations, there is always something that keeps it from being a complete waste of my time, but this one actually managed to come in under my expectations.

8453193,1,B0051SFSRQ,"I've seen a lot of lousy slasher films in my day, and Bikini Girls on Ice is one of the dumbest and most dismal of the lot.  You've got a mindless killer with no backstory whatsoever, victims disappearing all day long with no one ever noticing, and a surprising lack of gore.  This killer beats the hell out of his victims, yet there's almost no blood when the director actually allows us to see the bodies.  If Canada can't do any better than this, we may have to start banning all horror movies from north of the border.

So you've got these college girls participating in a bikini car wash to raise money.  Unfortunately, the old school bus they managed to commandeer by flirting with a little guy so mousy he should have had whiskers breaks down along the way, smack dab in the middle of nowhere.  They manage to make it to an old abandoned gas station, so their Mr. Fix-it can get the parts to fix the bus - but it's going to take several hours.  Naturally, the girls decide to go ahead and open up the car wash right there.  While all of this is going on, girls start entering the station one by one and not returning - a fact which none of their brain-dead friends ever seem to notice.  This station, I should note, was apparently built using TARDIS technology, as it's at least five times bigger inside than out, providing lots of little rooms and shelved halls for the girls to wander through saying ""Is anybody there?""  Of course, somebody is there - our stereotypical killer Moe.  All we ever really learn about Moe is that he's apparently never taken a bath, can't or chooses not to speak, and enjoys dry humping nothing but air after committing murder.  Oh, yeah, he sometimes puts the bodies on ice, for no apparent reason.  Who is this guy?  Why does he kill?  Why doesn't the screenwriter ask himself these basic questions?

I'm going to be honest with you here - most of these girls aren't all that attractive, and that's a problem because putting these girls in bikinis is pretty much the only thing this movie has going for it.  Cindel Chartrand is the only one deserving of a mention, but that's partly because I could swear I've seen this girl somewhere before (even though her tiny list of movies says otherwise).  What does bear mentioning is the utter stupidity of this movie - and it starts early on.  Our girl Jenna (Chartrand) is a star soccer player - so good she received scholarship offers from such institutions as the ""University of South Carol"" and the ""University of Lorida.""  I'm serious - we actually see official correspondence with these school names on them.  Then there's the time thing.  As dusk is drawing nigh, the girls still worry that they won't get to their original destination on time - they were supposed to be there at 11 AM, for the love of Pete!  Do I really have to say anymore?",1319241600,11,2832,4.48828125
