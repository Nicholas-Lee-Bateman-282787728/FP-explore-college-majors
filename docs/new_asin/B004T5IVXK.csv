4465278,5,B004T5IVXK,"Funny story, I was staying at a cabin and there was a cd in the stereo. Levon Helm, whom I started to enjoy way later than most folks. Just saw him at the 50th PFF and loved it. Well this cd reminded me of that performance. When I tried to find out the name of the cd, I learned it was a DVD and that explained a lot :) Bought it that day and love it!",1324598400,6,351,3.6315789473684212
4465279,4,B004T5IVXK,"This concert dvd filmed at the famous Nashville's Historic Ryman Auditorium on September 17, 2008, contains some excellent ""Roots Music"", including some blues, a Carter Family Song (No Depression in Heaven), several songs written by Robbie Robertson Of ""The Band"" (in which Levon Helm was a member), plus some more traditional ""rootsy"" songs. The Levon Helm Band in this concert dvd is fairly large, and you get all kinds of musical instruments played, including horns. Levon plays the drums, and mandolin, and also sings lead vocals on most songs. Plus, you get terrific Guest Artists, including: Sam Bush, Sheryl Crow, John Haitt, Buddy Miller, George Receli and Billy Bob Thornton.

All the songs are great, but I really enjoyed their version of ""The Weight"", which has become a classic song, covered by many artists. It was written by Robbie Robertson of ""The Band"".

If you like ""Rootsy"" type music, then you'll really enjoy this one. Thanks!!!!

P.S. The legendary, Levon Helm, passed away after the filming/recording of this DVD. So, that makes this dvd a little more special.",1321574400,10,1083,5.073033707865169
4465280,5,B004T5IVXK,We thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  We may go back & also order the CD to have in addition to the DVD.  It's quite a story & quite a life that was led by Levon & the Band.  Enjoy!,1314144000,6,176,3.5789473684210527
4465281,1,B004T5IVXK,The sound on this dvd is just gruesome. Performance is way below expected. This is one in a long line of music dvd's and bd's which has terrible sound. Why bother to release such items? Does not the producer or the performer LISTEN to the sound before release? I think not. What a waste of money. I am sick of beiing robbed with bad releases like this. Also- the other reviewers here- how can they give top ****** for this? Reviews like that are misleading consumers.,1313884800,5,467,4.441860465116279
4465282,2,B004T5IVXK,"I ordered this dvd after watching The Band which was produced some years before.  I believe Levon Helm is a talented performer, gives his best but understand he had been quite ill before this dvd was made.  It is not a sharp performance by Helm (understandably) but it seems that no one was giving much.  There was a lot of facial expressions trying to indicate they were really ""into"" it, but it came off as just going through the motions to honor Helm.  It was nice to see his daughter perform with him and know that she honors her Dad, but it is at best a historical performance which will preserve his memory in years to come, not his best work by any means.  Trouble is, it is not really great work by anyone, the magic is just gone without the original Band.

So, if you wish to buy it for historical reasons by all means do so but for myself, I will not keep it as part of my collection as I prefer to remember artists when they are at his best, even Sinatra in his later years should not have been filmed when he was forgetting lyrics and singing off key, it just doesn't do justice to the singer he once was.  One feels a bit cheated when they spend money for such poor performances and I actually feel embarrassed for the artists.",1312329600,4,1240,4.251063829787234

4465286,5,B004T5IVXK,"There is a version of this concert which is currently being shown on PBS TV stations- it is highly edited, and intended to be a fund-raiser, joining the ghost of Roy Orbison.  If you want the whole concert, buy this!

The leader of the band is Larry Campbell, who doesn't get nearly enough credit or recognition for his excellent performances on guitar and fiddle.  A heck of a guy!",1306195200,30,382,4.507246376811594

Just watched the whole DVD and it is terrific!  Feels good to be able to watch and listen to all this wonderful talent.  I also saved three dollars off the pre-order price!

4465296,4,B004T5IVXK,"Good concert footage. Not one of the best concerts ever but pretty good.
Levon's voice never really recovered from his cancer surgery. Surely he was one of
Rock's best vocalists before the cancer sticks got him. Damn!
Another career ruined by the use of cigarettes. Take a lesson kids.
Listen UP.  x",1396656000,,299,4.75

4465299,5,B004T5IVXK,"Where does one begin piling accolades on this DVD. For folk rock, this is how a concert that is going to be filmed should be done. This is a masterpiece. To Levon Helm, Larry Campbell, and whoever else is responsible for putting this together and bringing this video to music lovers, I take it off to you, folks. Jeez.

I didn't even know who Levon was way back when I first started hearing The Band, I just knew that the songs he sang lead on were the only ones that ever caught my ear. I was thrilled when I heard that he was singing again, but little did I know at that time what wonderful things he would accomplish after that fact. There are a few parallels to the career of another musical legend from Arkansas, Johnny Cash.

I get such a hoot out of the supporting cast of musicians in this concert, namely the horn section and keyboard player. Sam Bush was on top of his game on mandolin, and I've always loved Buddy Miller's guitar playing. Speaking of guitarists, getting introduced to the work of Larry Campbell was a huge treat. And if the harmonica of Little Sammy Davis caught your ear, check out Levon's `I Ain't In It For My Health.' Which is every bit as great of a documentary as this is a concert.

Doc Watson and Levon are gone now. We're losing all the greats. I don't know who is going to take their places, but I'm just so thankful they've left us with such wonderful ways of remembering them.",1390608000,,1416,4.335849056603774

4465301,5,B004T5IVXK,"Levon Helm leads a musical love in at the holy church of roots music, The Ryman Auditorium. Funky soulful joyous memorable. A reminder of Levon's impact on popular music. Arkansa's gift to Rock and Roll is missed. Here we see why.",1381536000,,230,4.634146341463414
4465302,5,B004T5IVXK,"This is the way music is meant to be not this electronic crap that they try to call music today!  From the first time I ever saw Levon Helm on The Band classic ""The Last Waltz"" I had admired his musical skills both in playing and singing, sadly as life passes all of us by as we grow older, to quote a famous lyric from a song made famous by another legend George Jones ""Lord, I wonder who's gonna fill their shoes"" not only are we losing the great music made famous by these legends even movies today are going down the gurgler, if you love music the way it's meant to be buy this great concert DVD!",1376956800,,600,4.084745762711864

4465309,5,B004T5IVXK,"Blond Mom and Morgan above both nail it in their reviews.  Even though I'm relatively new to Levon's music, I have to say this is a wonderful collection.  Levon was such a talented musician and such an ardent supporter of his fellow musicians that it really is quite moving to see both of those coming out so dramatically in this compilation.  I'm always interested in experiencing the ""real-deal"" behind the music I follow, and I'll tell you, this makes that happen in spades.  Thanks for bringing this out - it's fantastic!",1361750400,3,525,4.736263736263736

4465311,5,B004T5IVXK,"It is hard to believe that at his age and with a history of throat cancer, that he could still sing like that and with so much stamina. Its not a flawless concert nor should it be. Its real American music. If you like the Band or Buddy Miller or Steve Earle you will like this a lot.",1359849600,2,283,3.896551724137931
4465312,5,B004T5IVXK,"This is the most recent (recorded n 2009, released in 2010) of the Americana-themed Grammy-winning Levon Helm recordings after his first recovery from throat cancer and before it reared it's ugly head the second time.  Musically directed and produced by Larry Campbell who plays guitar and fiddle, it incluses incomparable keyboardist Brian Mitchell, and outstanding horn section, stand-up bassis Paul Ossola, percussionists George Recelli and Tony Leone, along with Larry's wife Teresa Williams (guitar and vocals) in harmony along with Amy Helm.  Guest musicians include Cheryl Crow, Sam Bush (master mandolinist), Buddy Miller, and songwriter John Hiatt. if you loved how The Band made music come together as grater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts, you will truly come to adore this DVD!!  And, just to sweeten the pot, 5 of the tracks are old Band songs brought to new life with this cadre of 15 outstanding musicians along with the other traditional and cover americana songs and Levon's real-thing voice.

4465314,5,B004T5IVXK,"I really like this album, maybe it is the variety of music but it is one of my favorites.  Levon Helm has a distinct voice that really stands out and to me sounds more authentic because it is not so polished.",1354752000,,208,4.073170731707317

4465316,5,B004T5IVXK,"In homage to the late Lavon Helm, tonight I watched the DVD ""Ramble at the Ryman."" The concert provided one of my ""best ever"" musical experiences. The horn section is a joy, and every other musician in the project makes a unique contribution. There is good camera work and editing, albeit the sound is a bit sloppy. The creativity, spontaneity, genre diversity, and energy are profound. Best of all, it is obvious that everyone on the stage is loving the sharing of an unforgettable musical production.",1335398400,2,502,4.848837209302325
4465317,5,B004T5IVXK,"Ironically I purchased Levon Helm's Ramble at the Ryman at a moment in time to have it arrive on the day of his passing.  To celebrate Levon, I immediately played the disk April 19th.  Like many of us, I was in awe of Levon's talent while watching the classic Scorsese film The Last Waltz.  It was obvious Levon had a major hand in The Band's success.  Ramble at the Ryman is a bookend to The Last Waltz.  The sound is satisfactory at the rustic Ryman Auditorium built in 1892 in Nashville, Tennessee.  Celebrate Levon's life with his friends at The Ryman.  Thank you Levon...",1334793600,,576,4.480769230769231
8440510,5,B004T5IVXK,If anyone doubts that Levon Helm was the greatest musician of the 20th century -- you should buy this disc and listen.  Impossible to do that and not stop tapping your feet to the rhythm/beat.  Incredible,1473292800,,204,4.638888888888889

8440512,5,B004T5IVXK,"""Last Waltz"" seemed somber, dark in mood...even some of the Band members were in shadows...and it seemed more a vanity project to promote Robertson. THIS is alive with spontaneity, a rebirth of roots music with a dose of New Orleans swing. The musicianship is stunning, the passion overflowing, both within the band and from the crowd. Well produced, excellent sound and camera work puts you right there. Infectious rhythms and enthusiasm...a celebration of the music that moves us.",1441411200,,482,5.1923076923076925

8440515,2,B004T5IVXK,"This is just a dismal concert and I was relieved when it was finally over. I have a great deal of love, respect, and admiration for Levon Helm and for his recordings with the Band, and we were all touched by the battle with cancer that he finally lost, but this is a concert DVD that people have to pay good money to hear, and I am not deaf or blind: Levon Helm was an unhealthy and very tired old guy in 2008, and it is obvious. I am not so infatuated with Helm that I cannot see him and hear that his voice was a mere shadow of its former self by this time. This show is painful to watch. It is a concert with very few bright moments. Its like everyone is humoring this revered man by pretending that his singing is still listenable, when it wasnt, and everyone looks sad and pained to be participating: they must have felt really obligated, because no one looks good doing it. To add to the misery, the only really professional quality singing was by the woman who sang Time out for the Blues and by Buddy Miller. The woman was on pitch and had a lovely Patsy Cline-ish voice. Larry Campbell played some very nice guitar, and Sam Bush got off a couple of nice Mandolin solos (otherwise he was window dressing). The horn players did a nice job and got off several nice solos, and Brian Mitchell played some real fine piano. But even Sheryl Crow was disappointing, turning in a half hearted and off pitch vocal performance. And who the hell is Sammy Davis, who sang two really weak blues songs, accompanied by almost as weak harmonica playing? His participation made the whole affair look and feel like a depressing geriatric token effort, everyone bravely going through the motions, knowing they weren't really sounding good. Though there is always an interesting and well played variety of rhythm grooves going on (thanks in no small part to Levons still capable drumming), Im embarrassed for everyone in the whole show, and I wish someone had written this review and saved me the trouble of finding out how bad this concert was by paying for the DVD. It is a big disappointment.",1428364800,,2082,4.467191601049869
