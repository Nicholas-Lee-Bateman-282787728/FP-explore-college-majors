7890027,5,630545809X,"Cute, silly and fun to watch. It is one of the great productions of Sid & Marty Krofft. It is one of the very few if the only kids shows to ever have the great late Martha Ray starring in it. She alone is worth the purchase of this little VHS. It is just a cute and fun throwback to a lost era when Saturday mornings were worth waking up for. It is full of clean slap stick enjoyment that will not leave kids confused with questions.
There are no cultic over or under tones and it will not give kids over to violence. It is just clean fun for all ages.  Instead of allowing your kids to watch cultic violence or boring animal shows why not slide in this classic tape that will make them laugh.",1420156800,,693,4.0583941605839415

7890029,4,630545809X,I LOVE ALL SID AND MARTY KROFT PRODUCTIONS . I GREW UP WATCHING THEM AND I'M GROWN UP AND STILL WATCHING THEM . ANY HOW THIS IS THE BUGALOOS VOLUME ONE NOT ONE TO FOUR .

7890030,4,630545809X,"In most of my reviews, I do not have kind things to say about the live-action/puppet kid shows of the early 70s (the Muppet Show aside, as that was miles ahead of the pack and REAL family entertainment: Jim Henson, Si!-Sid and Marty Kroft NO!). Most of them, such as Pufnstuf, New Zoo Review, Sigmund, ad nauseum, were too childish and silly to me even when I was a child and look even worse to me now. The Bugaloos was different. This show had good songs and somewhat more clever humor that helps with the whimsical feel (isn't that a young Helen Reddy among them?). In either case, if a hardcore hater of this genre like me could recommend this after seeing it for the first time in 30+years on this set, thaen that says something. Oh yeah, it's also about time for a DVD of this.",1100304000,,782,4.326530612244898
7890031,5,630545809X,"I was an eighties child who watched these series and loved them.  They were in syndication on channel 20 (now UPN) and every day after school, my siblings and I would gather around and watch the Kroft brothers syndicated children's television shows.  They knew how to create shows that both children and adults love.",1089072000,,316,4.833333333333333
7890032,5,630545809X,This is such a great t.v. show. It was on ABC in the 70's as a saturday morning sitcom. The story lies around a rock n roll band called the Bugaloos againist the evil Benita Bezarre.,953164800,2,182,4.083333333333333
7890033,4,630545809X,"This is a great tape.  Here are two classic Bugaloos episodes.  The first features Sparky and Gina, plus an excellent song ""It's New to You""; and the second has Benita at her best, and includes the only  Bugaloos tune released as a single, ""For a Friend""!!  The only  reason I give the tape only 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they'd  release more episodes per tape!!",939859200,8,375,4.36231884057971
