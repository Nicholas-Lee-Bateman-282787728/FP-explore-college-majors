3770423,5,B001QU9RSY,"iCarly is a popular kids show on Nickelodeon and my son who is 10 loves to watch it and I have to admit that I enjoy watching it also. The shows are always funny and family friendly with good story lines and there is usually a simple and valuable life lesson woven into the plot. I think that the chemistry between the actors is great and I like the friendship and interactions between Carly, Sam and Freddie who tape and air a fun web show for kids. Spencer, is Carly's older brother who she lives with and he is another funny guy who is an artist and is always making some type of sculpture out of strange and unusual things. He's a bit strange and unusual himself but, oh so funny! Carly is played by Miranda Cosgrove who was on the show Drake & Josh, which aired on Nickelodeon. As a parent, I like that this is a family friendly show and one that my son can watch for his age. It's the kind of show that the whole family can enjoy watching together.",1250121600,4,954,4.190217391304348
3770424,5,B001QU9RSY,I love iCarly! I am so glad to have the rest of season one. However I do not care for the last episode ihave a love sick teacher. It was really not one of my favorites but i loved the others. I also liked that it came with the pilot of True Jackson VP. That show is cool too. So if you love iCarly then buy this. You will not be sorry.,1249516800,2,335,3.6666666666666665
3770425,5,B001QU9RSY,"Hello I-Carly Fans,
My daughter is six years old and loves this show. My wife and i both like it too. It's always cute and funny and nowhere near as annoying as that other teen queen show (you can insert the one that annoys you:) )
My mom always thinks Sam is too mean but kids will be kids besides at the end of the day,she always does the right thing. Miranda is a better role model than Hannah and i'm so glad my daughter choose this show over that corn fed hokum!",1242864000,2,467,4.032258064516129
3770426,5,B001QU9RSY,"I'm a 19 year old guy and I like ICarly! It's funny and perfect for teenagers! Carly, Sam, and Freddie continue their webshow while dealing with Spencer's depression because an artist doesn't like his work, Sam's gets a boyfriend, Carly is offered a scholarship at a private school, the police force them to go on a stakeout, do their show in detention, and much more!

3770428,5,B001QU9RSY,"This is a nice compilation for children who enjoy the outstanding program that typically delivers a subtle message on doing the right thing when confronting a problem, though past episodes do air on a very regular basis.

Miranda Cosgrove is an outstanding young actress and - make no mistake - the program is built around her, but her co-stars (Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, Jerry Trainor) are outstanding in their roles. A neat nod to Mary Tyler Moore seems to play-out in the show's opener, as Cosgrove tosses her hat in the air while in a celebratory mood.

There are few shows that are truly for kids, but this one gets an A-plus.",1227484800,,637,4.678571428571429
