2869433,5,B000RLULCE,"THANK YOU CARTOON NETWORK!!

TGAoB+M is the best animated show for dark humor and adult wit,with the same amount of silliness for the kid in all of us!

While this set claims to only contain 13 episodes,it in fact offers alot more:

When Billy and Mandy first started out as ""Grim and Evil"",they were usualy
only two episodes of Billy and Mandy and one Hector Con Carne show. With this release,we are given three adventures of Billy and Mandy for every one episode (with the exception of two episodes) giving you a grand total of 37 different Grim adventures!

On top of all that,you are also given bonus Evil Con Carne episodes! It
really is a terrific value for the set!

One of the most notable Grim adventures on this set is ""Little Rock of Horrors"" which contains the famous Brains! song from the group Volitare.

We also get to see Grim singing in a goth rock band in ""Battle of The Bands""

A demon substitute Mandy for Billy to play with in ""Tickle Me Mandy""

Mandy's first encounter with a terrible emotion called ""love"" in ""Crushed""

Irwin becomes a werewolf in ""Tween Wolf""

Nergel marries Billy's ""Aunt Sis"" in ""Love is Evol spelled backwards""

We also get introduced to a few characters named Hoss Delgado,Eris the Goddess of Chaos and Dischord,Sperg,Toadblatt and a short-lived romantic soulmate named Malaria!

There's also haunted fudge,showtune singing dinousaurs,an apocolyptic future run by Mandy,Grim's own talk show and a parody of that cruel reality called pokemon.

Well,if you are a fan of the show,and this review hasn't got you drooling yet to go out and buy a copy,then Mandy would sum it up best:

""Hope is wasted on the hopeless""",1190592000,24,1657,4.748251748251748
2869434,5,B000RLULCE,"I love this show it's funny and spooky! I adore Mandy's dark personality it's humorous considering she's wearing such a cute pink dress! Grim I feel sorry for him. I think mandy is more evil than he is!
This show is so great I love it more than Scooby Doo and Courage the Cowardly Dog put together!
It's the best Show on Cartoon Network I'll buy this series before Cartoon Network stops playing it all together!",1183507200,13,411,4.421052631578948
2869435,5,B000RLULCE,Love  the show,1475107200,,14,3.6666666666666665
2869436,5,B000RLULCE,"Cartoon Network don't make em like this anymore. All of the characters are darn funny. Of course, the ""dumb"" character is the best. With the exception of Stimpson J. Cat, Billy is probably the best dumb cartoon character ever. I may even find him funnier than Stimpy. Although, maybe not a total influence, one cannot deny the influence of Stimpy in Billy. Look at the nose. And this show is pretty crude at times, like R & S. But it is an original in its own right. I wish they'd put this whole series plus the 3 feature length specials out on blu ray. I would happily give them whatever they overcarge to get it. In my opinion, this show was Cartoon Network's peak. They also should just have an Adult Swim Channel and have Billy and Mandy in the mix. Shoot, CN basically is AS all the time anyways. Fred Fredburger is also an all time great dumb character.",1472688000,,859,4.375

2- price is way to high for this
3- grim adventures have a max of 10 or less in seasons
4- not all evil con Carne episodes, once called grim and evil be for they changed it to the grim adventures of billy and mandy
5- still the best show Iv ever watched beside the amazing adventures of flapjack

2869444,4,B000RLULCE,"Billy and Mandy. The LAST great Cartoon before Cartoon Network and Adult Swim entered their twilight of good shows. An Era came to a close as cable grabbed up all the good stuff for DVD profits. Which is ironic because that is exactly why we are here on Amazon in the first place! Billy and Mandy was a darkly funny show, a shade darker than Scoony Doo ever dared be. But that's what made it unique. We CAN laugh at the dark after all...as long as the nightlight flickers on.",1406332800,,475,4.288888888888889
2869445,5,B000RLULCE,"I love it, cause it shows the billy and mandy season 1 full. It is very rare, they don't produce these dvds anymore. I don't know why, I just bought used cause new was 98 dollars and up which is a rip off. Why can't cartoon network just make the compelete series like ppg and samurai jack. They keep making new dvds for adventure time and the 2010s shows which is not great. They disrespect 1996-2007 cartoons from cartoon network. I just hope they release the compelete series of kids next door, grim adventures, camp lazlo, ed edd n eddy, dexters lab, cow and chicken, johnny bravo, fosters home, and sym biontic titans.",1405123200,5,622,4.513274336283186
2869446,5,B000RLULCE,"I've always loved dark and unusual shows as a child, and a show where children befriend the Grim Reaper, that description alone is the best. It's up there in my childhood favorites.

I'm glad that this release had the original episodes from ""Grim & Evil"" along with the some of the episodes from the first real Season of the separate series because I had no idea if Cartoon Network would remember those in the mix. I was also pleased to find some episodes of ""Evil Con Carne"" as bonus features.

I wish Cartoon Network would release Seasons 2-6 as well, but if their record for releasing any show beyond two seasons is anything, it won't happen -- the only ones I can think of where they did is ""Powerpuff Girls"" or that cringeworthy abomination of a show ""Johnny Test"". So if you're in for more; be ready to waste some GBs on your computer and get the iTunes releases...",1396224000,4,871,4.471698113207547
2869447,5,B000RLULCE,"I love this cartoon and wish there were MANY more episodes. I just find the whole concept so weirdly hilarious (seriously, ""winning"" the Grim Reaper!).",1391472000,,151,5.08
2869448,5,B000RLULCE,It came through USPS and came in perfectly. Was a gift for my boyfriend and he watched it right away. There was no scratches on any of the discs. The packaging for the product was beyond spectacular.,1374192000,,199,4.405405405405405
2869449,5,B000RLULCE,"I love this show so much! I know it's a kid's show but I got it for myself, since Cartoon Network took it of the air.",1358899200,,117,3.5384615384615383
2869450,5,B000RLULCE,The only sad thing about this is that this was the only full season you can find. Wish they had all of them available. This show is one of my son's favorites and even I get a chuckle out of some of the adventures.,1358121600,,213,3.8636363636363638
2869451,5,B000RLULCE,After invader zim went off the air i couldn't find a show that filled the void. After a few years Billy and Mandy came about and that void was filled. Its a funny show and although some humor may be adult in nature it is still amazing! If you like invader zim then you will love this show too!,1357171200,,293,3.983050847457627
2869452,5,B000RLULCE,"They need to release more seasons of this show!  Season one has the Harry Potter spoof episode and introduces Irwin, if you became a fan of the show in later seasons this season explains exactly how the kids got their deal with Grim.  It also has one of my favorite episodes where Billy's mom is trying to kill Grim to protect Bill from him.  It has the original Evil Con Carne episodes from when they were shown back to back on Cartoon Network, and has a bonus feature with the creator of Billy & Mandy.",1354579200,5,504,4.28421052631579
2869453,5,B000RLULCE,"So this great Cartoon Network show was on for about 5 or 6 seasons-- why the heck have they only produced the first season on DVD?
The episode ""Home of the Ancients"" was hilarious and an instant toon classic. I can't recall what season it was, but I know it wasn't the first season.
I do own the first season, and I can say that the show only got better as it went along-- was very sorry to see it be discontinued.
Cartoon Network, why are you depriving the rest of the world (because there are quite a few people who would love GABM and never got to experience it) from Fred Fredburger, Dracula, The Prank Call of Cthulu, Irwin's Grandmama, Billy's dad, and all of the other hijinks of horror? For shame...",1338854400,9,707,4.323308270676692
2869454,5,B000RLULCE,"This is such an incredibly great show. I love Mandy and Grim, and Billy brings in the ridiculousness and grossness that appeals to my nephew and niece. I wish it was still airing on Cartoon Network because I would love to watch it every day.

I purchased season one the minute it came out and I am very disappointed that the rest are not available. This is one of those shows that needs to have the complete collection on sale. Come on CN, get the other seasons out there on DVD and I'll be happy to buy them--as long as they're not $70 a piece.",1328227200,6,545,4.190476190476191
2869455,5,B000RLULCE,"A dark cartoon, with hilarious sound effects/music. Still is one of my favorite shows. They need to release the rest of the seasons because those have the best episodes on them. Great episode from this set is the battle of the bands one, where Billy's dad is Mogar, and Sperg sings(screams),""purple...FIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLTH!!!!!""",1321315200,,329,5.470588235294118
2869456,5,B000RLULCE,"If you have never seen this series, you need to youtube it a bit first.  Not a show for 5 year olds, but still hysterical for my teens and me!  Wish season 2 was available too.....",1308096000,,180,3.9722222222222223
2869457,5,B000RLULCE,I got this for my 30 year old boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it!  He has watched the whole thing through twice now! I find it hillarious too!  Great for kids and adults!,1265414400,2,175,4.117647058823529
2869458,5,B000RLULCE,"If you love to laugh hard, this is the DVD for you!  I'm a grown woman, and still find this hillarious!  From the first episode, where the all-powerful Grim Reaper gets tricked in to being 2 kids' best friend FOREVER, to the kids running him ragged with household chores.  Who knew it was possible for Grim to mow the lawn in those robes? Then, there's Billy and Mandy.  One's just a complete idiot, and the other one, a totally merciless being.  Who knew it was possible for Mandy the Terrible to fall in love?  Or, for Billy to keep a werewolf as a pet?  It's all here, everybody!",1258675200,2,582,4.333333333333333

2869462,5,B000RLULCE,"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy is as good as the classic Warner Bros cartoons.  They are less innocent, however; the show is cynical in the comic extreme, but it leaves us no bitter taste any more than Bugs Bunny left us shocked from the violence.

Being season 1, the show hasn't quite hit its stride, but it's still worth five stars in my book.

I find the extras to be largely infantile and pointless, and I'd take away a half-star for that.  Hopefully before the next seasons' DVDs are produced, the makers will watch the Futurama DVDs and understand how things should be done.

Extras notwithstanding, the DVD was worth the price.",1223769600,3,641,4.587719298245614
2869463,5,B000RLULCE,"I've always loved The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.  But ever since the first season came out, I'm elated!  This DVD has the first episode, and even bonuses such as Evil Con Carne.  If you like semi-twisted humor (it's for kids 7 and up...unless your kid has already seen this on Cartoon Network!) Well worth the money and can't wait for the second season's release!",1221696000,,372,4.606060606060606
2869464,5,B000RLULCE,"Tal y como ya pude ver en Cartoon Network las Aventuras de Billy y Mandy son geniales. El DVD se hace realmente corto a pesar de que incluye un mont&oacute;n de cap&iacute;tulos. El audio en espa&ntilde;ol no es con el que se tradujo en Espa&ntilde;a y algunas palabras son las que se utilizan en Sudam&eacute;rica. De todos modos las voces empleadas son muy buenas.
Adem&aacute;s la estructura y los detalles del DVD (men&uacute;s, iconos, extras,...) hacen que este DVD sea todav&iacute;a mejor.
De todos los DVDs que he comprado en el &uacute;ltimo a&ntilde;o este es, sin duda alguna, el mejor. Si te gustan los dibujos animados has de adquirirlo.",1211587200,,651,4.981651376146789

2869466,5,B000RLULCE,"I loved this cartoon from the very first time I watched it, getting this First Season DVD set is great to have and to watch when you want. You can see how this cartoon grew from the early stages with this set, this is a MUST HAVE DVD for any Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy! The Evil Con Carne show is solid stuff and they should add more to the next season release and the Grim & Evil episodes too...",1203552000,,402,3.9753086419753085
2869467,4,B000RLULCE,My son loves the Grim Adventures series.  Now that it is released on Dvd we can watch whenever we want.  He truly does loves this Dvd.  We can't wait for the next one to be released.  It is for very true fan of the series.  Got to love that Billy!!!!,1202428800,,250,3.92
2869468,5,B000RLULCE,"This is one of the best cartoons ever created.  It is dark and cynical for adults to appreciate and cute and funny enough so kids don't fully understand.

The reason for my subject heading is that Cartoon Network has decided to cancel the show after 78 episodes.  I use to really look forward to new episodes and now it's over.  Obviously, Cartoon Network has made a huge mistake.  I only hope that they come to their senses and bring it back.

If you haven't seen this cartoon, do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes.  I will admit that they're not all gems but a good 85% are worth watching and re-watching.",1199750400,3,615,4.389380530973451
2869469,5,B000RLULCE,"This show rates with Invader Zim and Futurama.  It is a high-point of Western Civilization in the 3rd millenium.  If Robot Chicken had to operate within the constraints of a pre-teen viewership, it might be this good.  As good as The Tick animated, really.

So, yeah, buy the first season, that the very slow marketing folks at Cartoon Network may release further seasons on disk as well as plush toys, coffee mugs, and dried squid.  Rave, rave, foam, twitch, repeat.  Then light new candles at the nicho of Julie Hashiguchi.",1198022400,5,525,4.777777777777778

2869471,4,B000RLULCE,"Yep, I'm one of those guys that uses his kids as an excuse to still watch cartoons and buy cool stuff at toy stores and stuff. A 38yo still man still laughing at toilet humor ... that's good right?! Well according to this show it is (along with every other ""adult friendly"" cartoon). I mean come on, Warner Bros isn't able to ask $40 - $50 this time every year to sell the Looney Tunes in unedited form unless what was funny in the 1930's is still funny in the 21st century!!!

I'm proud to say my kids have been introduced into the complexities of modern life with a role models like Billy & Mandy!!! Sure, Mandy doesn't have a nose and Billy is , well ... stupid, but look at what they are able to do both as a team and as individuals.

Mandy has that grim (heh, heh; I said ""grim"") determination in life that you gotta have to survive and that's always the trait of a hero! And Billy doesn't let the cares of the world stack up against him, he just goes with the flow ... right down the toilet!!!!

Love 'em!!! Just love 'em both!!! They are just 2 little angels from Heaven who just happened to have tricked the Grim Reaper into hanging around with them!!!",1194566400,4,1160,4.216216216216216
2869472,5,B000RLULCE,"Yes, they finally realized that they should relese the show on DVD
Probably my favorite cartoon since the very begining of the series.
I think there was like some competition for their next new show on cartoon network, there were a few other shows that survived too...
Like kids next door, sheep in the big city (for a while) and Megas XLR (for a little while), there's probably some shows i'm missing, but ther point is i've stuck with this show from the begining and still watch it to date.
I encourage you all to purchase this DVD...",1192838400,,536,4.479591836734694

2869474,5,B000RLULCE,"If this ain't Gothic Lolita, I don't know what is !

The 1st season of the hit series ""The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"" is now finally on a two-disc DVD set with a whole lotta episodes on there starring the mean-spirited Mandy, the moronic Billy, and of course, The Grim Reaper himself.  Such episodes include:

""Meet the Reaper"" - The original pilot episode that started it all.  As Grim attempts to reap the soul of a hamster named Mr. Snuggles, the two kids strike a deal with him, which he lost to.

""Fiend Is Like Friend Without the 'R'"" - Introducing Nergal, a creepy being from the center of the earth, who kidnaps Billy and Mandy to be his friends.  Soon Grim becomes concerned and reluctantly rescues them.

""Grim Or Gregory"" - A case of mistaken identity on Halloween night has Grim confused with another kid in a reaper costume !

""Beasts and Barbarians"" - A major inspiration to the video game, Grim transports the kids into another dimension where they battle bigger-than-life monsters in order to cure their gaming addictions.

""Hoss Delgado: Spectral Exterminator"" - The first appearance of this tough guy who discovers and attempts on capturing the Grim Reaper.

""To Eris Human"" - Introducing the sexy Goddess of Chaos, Eris, who takes Mandy as her minion leaving Grim feeling rather dumped.

""Toadblatt's School of Sorcery"" - The first ""Harry Potter"" parody episode with its weird magic and other strange creatures.  'Nuff said.

""Brown Evil"" - A two-parter where Billy cooks up some brownies that attracts a humongous horde of zombies !  It's up to Hoss Delgado to stop them.

""Creating Chaos"" - One of the funniest episodes, Eris now recruits Billy to spread her chaos upon the globe.  Unfortunately, Billy himself is a little more chaotic than her magic apple can do.

""Tween Wolf"" - The hapless Irwin transforms into a werewolf which Billy adopts as his new pet.

""Love Is EVOL Spelled Backwards"" - Nergal returns and attempts to marry Billy's Aunt Sis.  Let's just hope Billy doesn't have that freak as his uncle.

This new set has an overload of bonus features like a commentary and an interview with series creator Maxwell Atoms, plus the ""Brains"" music video as seen in the classic episode ""Little Rock of Horrors"".  The weirdest special features in the second disc include an episode in ""Burp-O-Rama"" and a virtual pet Mr. Snuggles.  Perhaps the best bonus feature of all in the set is the 2 ""Evil Con Carne"" bonus episodes with optional ""Skarr-O-Vision"" feature.  (I wish, however, they put in ALL of the ""Evil Con Carne"" episodes in the set.  Then we can have ""Grim and Evil"" again !)

So if you've been waiting for this set to come by, get it while you still can.  One thing's for sure, this is one series that will let you look Death in the eye... and laugh real hard.  I really REALLY hope the rest of the ""Billy and Mandy"" series will be put on DVD real soon.  But in the meantime, look for brand-new ""Grim Adventures"" episodes Friday nights on Cartoon Network's all-new ""Fried Dynamite"" block.",1191456000,18,3033,4.7039848197343455
