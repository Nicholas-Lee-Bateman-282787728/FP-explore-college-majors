How IMDb could rate this so highly with no reviews is astounding! It should have been rated 1 out of 10. The actors are people I have never heard of before, I should have gotten a warning just for that, and the acting is wooden and just awful.

It might be funny just because it is so bad, but unfortunately even that isn't happening!

Take my advice and don't bother.",1469059200,5,592,4.412844036697248

Im giving this movie five stars because it finally gave me the depression kick I needed to completely give up on love as a whole. Not only did every point of this movie make me want to die, but on top of it, like a car crash I could not look away. I sat staring at my tv motionless for over an hour. It was horrifying. Then, when my roommate and I got home from work, I made her watch it through with me. Im going to post the video of her response below. I wish I was kidding. I have seen better acting at a divorcees barbaque dinner, any housewives show, and any elementary schook play. Honestly, I spent hours of time being hypnotized by whatever this is.

7672889,1,B01C7RBFNE,Cute idea but the movie is actually quite awful. The reason I chose to watch this and the reason I finished it is to keep away the boredom on a slow day at work (hotel front desk). Even then it was almost unbearable. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I didn't want to go thru the effort  of finding a better useless movie to kill time.

The sound was the worst part as the mics they used for dubbing were in the next county in places. I read the reviews but I watched anyway because I've actually found some good movies that way.

Don't ever waste your time on this trash.  Bad acting, terrible script, horrible sound quality and a stupid storyline.",1482192000,19,255,4.163265306122449
7673150,1,B01C7RBFNE,Horrible! If i could give it no stars i would. She went on a date with the giy once and didn't see him for three months and than bam he proposed to her. So stupid..dont watch.,1482019200,,175,3.888888888888889

7673153,1,B01C7RBFNE,"This is absolutely terrible! We made it 10-15 minutes in before having to turn it off. The acting, directing, camera work all are so distracting, not to mention the writing...wow. I can sit through fairly bad movies justto say I've seen it, but that will never happen with this movie. All the IMDB ratings have to be fake. Read the reviews. This movie isworse than crap.",1481846400,56,370,4.621212121212121

7673157,1,B01C7RBFNE,Could not get past 5 minutes of movie. Appeared to be filmed by an armature and acting/script painful to watch.,1481414400,,111,4.6

7673159,1,B01C7RBFNE,"This came up as a suggestion after another film I watched.  It's pretty bad.  The dialogue sounds like someone was trying to fill space, the acting is very bad, and the sound is terrible.  I'm assuming this was an amateur production done on a shoestring budget.  I should have paid attention to the fact that even the favorable reviews here couldn't muster much praise for it.  It's pretty dreadful.",1480809600,8,399,4.72463768115942

Spoiler alert:  She ends up with a guy she barely knows asking her to marry him!  What a lame, dumb movie!  I'd give it less than a 1 if I could; more like negative 100.

8752475,3,B01C7RBFNE,"I watched this because of all the bad reviews, and they are right.  It's terrible.  The audio is off, the dialogue is stilted, the plot is unbelievable, and it's all around terrible.  Three friends deciding they have to only date three guys who are friends and they ALL have to like each guy they get...sure, there are hundreds of packs of guys looking to date packs of women, so THAT makes sense...and that creepy luck guy showing up and laughing creepily all the time...ha, ha, ha...who wrote this nonsense?

There is some crudity (mention of ""balls"" and d--ks and such).

I gave it three stars because I found the degree of terribleness entertaining.  I couldn't believe anyone could make a movie so bad.  (I was cleaning house and washing dishes while I watched...definitely do something to keep busy if you want to have an unbelievably bad movie playing in the background for fun.)",1533168000,,886,4.751633986928105
