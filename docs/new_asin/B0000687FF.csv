1722736,5,B0000687FF,"""By Dawns Early Light"" deals very effectively with many of todays results of our deteriorated culture. Bad parenting, failed government schools, obsession with material replacements substituted for real personal relationships and a constant decaying of values that worked effectively for generations are exposed and corrected with warmth and humor. There are nuggets for both genders and all ages to make you smile, laugh and think about changes you might consider for yourself and those close to you. The message is presented in such a fashion, you will want to see this little gem and share it with others for whom you care over and over.",1241395200,9,640,5.104761904761904
1722737,5,B0000687FF,This is the most wonderful movie for all ages.  Very good acting and storyline.  A must see!,1194998400,11,92,4.352941176470588
1722738,5,B0000687FF,"Teen actor, Chris Olivero, and Hollywood legend, Richard Crenna, deliver outstanding and believable performances in this coming of age movie about a bratty, California kid, Mike Lewis (Olivero), who is shipped off to visit his grandfather, Ben Maxwell (Crenna), in Colorado.  While there, the argumentative and often smart-aleck Lewis, stirs up enough trouble for the town and his kindhearted grandfather.  After several confrontations, the disrespectful grandson decides he wants to return to his spoiled lifestyle in Los Angeles.  His grandfather agrees, but decides the two will travel to California by way of horseback.  A disgruntled Lewis, tries his hardest to come up with every excuse to avoid the trek to the Pacific coast, but finds himself on the losing end of the battle.  Shortly after their journey begins, they meet up with a group of Ben Maxwell's longtime friends, who together, take Maxwell's grandson on the journey of a lifetime by exposing him to down-to-earth western values and hard-working morals.  After many trials along the trail, lessons are learned and Lewis and his grandfather discover something about each other they never expected.  The film is laced with thought-provoking topics, incredible chemistry, outstanding performances, and certainly the greater values in life that founded our nation.  Just short of Oscar caliber for Crenna, this film is highly recommended for all!  A great film with good, clean humor, and patriotic family values!",1041120000,41,1477,5.414847161572053

Not just a must see for all teens, a must see for all. Shows patriotic and respect two things you don't see much of these days. It shows with the right guidance someone's attitude can be turned around and become respectful. The movie also makes you think of the bonds between family members that you may be neglecting today. Just to discover things about someone you love and care about could open your heart and mind to a renewed appreciation and respect for them.

1722782,5,B0000687FF,"The last starring role of Richard Crenna's career (although he had a supporting role in 2003 Out Of The Ashes and made several guest appearances on the TV show Judging Amy afterwards), this family film is a perfect spotlight for his talents, as he plays an ageing grandfather trying to re connect with his adult daughter and get to know his only grandson.

Taking the grandson in for the summer seems like a nice way to make good with his daughter but it doesn't take long for the quiet, conservative, horse riding cowboy Grandfather to clash with his troubled, spoiled, teen age grandson. Exhausting his patience, he decides to take the boy and a trip back home - by horseback, hoping the long trip from COL to CA will give them a chance to connect and grow close.  Along the way they meet up with some of grandfather's old friends, and slowly the youngster starts to appreciate his grand dad, especially given the level of respect and esteem everyone seems to hold him in. It doesn't happen over night, but kid does slowly start to come around, admitting some of the problems he has relating to his mom and dad as his grandfather relates why he and the boy's mom spent so long on the outs.

Later in the film the drama kicks up a bit when we realize Crenna's character is dying (something he has known all along but hidden from everyone else), but by then the audience is hooked waiting to see if he can truly get through to his good hearted, but immature grandson before they finish their trip (if he can stay healthy enough to make it).

The supporting cast is strong but Crenna is the most engaging, this is a movie that can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages. There is some humor thrown in periodically to keep the film from getting too dark or down, overall a highly recommended family film and a definite ""Must Have"" for any Richard Crenna fan.",1395532800,,1852,4.454277286135693
1722783,5,B0000687FF,I had viewed this movie before and I had to have it for showing to my teenage son...how rebellion can be turned into responsibility and respect through constructive instruction.,1395014400,,177,5.137931034482759
1722784,4,B0000687FF,"Richard Crenna co-stars with Dave Carradine and Mike Olivio in a story of a
moody, spoiled grandson who goes from his posh home in California to 'rough
it' with his Colorado Cowboy grandad. Along the way, the kid straightens out
 and learns life's lessons from his US Military vet grandad, who's friends with
part-Indian, trail cook, who eats hot peppers like they are candy(!), Carradine
and his half Amer-Indian son, who befriends Olivio. No profanity, no sexual in-
decency or usual Hollyweird crap. Solid acting, Solid script and some plot turns
I won't give away. One of six outstanding movies NOT CALLED KILL BILL that
Carradine had released in his last 10 years of Life: American Reel, Out of the
Wilderness, The Golden Boys, Miracle At Sage Creek, Christmas Miracle At
Sage Creek, and this winner. WATCH ANY OF THESE WITH YOUR family and
relax and learn. **** stars, period. Rich Salzer, Reviewer, Virginia Beach, VA, USA",1395014400,,929,4.917197452229299

It has an actual plot with a shinning moral fiber that the bulk of movies and tv have been lacking for several years. At it's core, this tale is about family and life lessons. It is heart-warming yet serious.

Maxwell and Decker, the two mentoring elders for the spoiled teen are my favorite characters--because they both have steel-coated convictions but gentle hearts. Decker's son was a nice touch because due to being a youngling he found it a bit easier to relate to the 'city kid'.

I loved the culture contrast, the horses, and the emphasis on heart this film exemplifies. Clean fun.",1246060800,7,679,4.745762711864407

The actors -at least the principals- portrayed their roles well, especially the character of Michael, with teen ""attitude!"" However, there's a fair portion that's pretty unbelievable. Can't say more without revealing plot. And, frankly, with Grandpa as it turns out, I'd have to call his attitude/action the epitome of selfishness! Do we have the right to fulfill our own desires if it means dumping a load on unsuspecting others? The movie has some funny spots, some sad ones, and some that just call for an eye rolling (visit a local teenager for a good example of this!).

Once, he had on no shirt and was sitting in his underwear (boxer shorts) on the bed eating his hamburger.
