8736655,2,B00NAJEAMM,"This DVD doesn't have a Russian language option.  The only soundtrack is a poorly acted English dub-over that made the movie hard to watch.  The box says that the movie is in Russian, but there's no place to select the Russian soundtrack, so if it's there, my Sony DVD player isn't seeing it.  I can choose between English and Korean subtitles, however.",1451606400,,353,4.661290322580645
