8348759,3,B00210XTXC,"I read reviewers' comments before purchasing this DVD and gathered that it is geared to the needs of senior citizens. The introduction specifies it is designed for people over 40 years old.  Well, I'm 70 and there's no way I'll burn fat using this program:  I didn't break a sweat.  The instructor is nice, but her tone is slightly (even if unintended) condescending, as though old folks need to be spoken to like bigger children.  So I'd say this exercise routine is definitely for the elderly, exercise beginners or the very out-of-shape. If the DVD were $9.99, not $19.99, I might give it another star (but probably not).",1248652800,3,624,4.75

Susan's dynamic, fun, and enthusiastic approach is a sure winner for anyone who wants the convenience to be able to do a workout even during a busy 9 to 5 work day. It's only 25 minutes, and her expertise gives me the confidence (and so do the results) that I am well on my way to maintaining a lean and fit body. What I like the most is results in less than 30 minutes. Wow!",1245283200,3,672,6.384615384615385

8348762,5,B00210XTXC,"I really like Suzanne's perspective on the DVD. She is not just an ""exercise guru,"" but she is an occupational therapist by training. So she really knows about how to specifically train for functional fitness. The exercises are simple and straightforward, with an optional chair version.

Suzanne is very inspiring with her personal success in transforming her body with fat loss and toning. Her pleasant style makes it easy to watch and follow. Her energy and enthusiasm are incredible! You'll really enjoy it and get results!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Burning/dp/B00210XTXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Burning</a>
