7685032,4,B01CN38VP2,Just letting you know first off there is no Dub. The only dub there has ever been is the Singapore dub trust me not worth it. The show itself is light and comical compared to the other gundam shows of it time. The more you get into it the deeper the story gets. The mech designs are great and it really sets up for the 2nd neo zeon war in Char's Counter Attack.,1462406400,22,361,3.958904109589041

7685034,5,B01CN38VP2,"(Edited 9 May 2016 to correct some writing style issues in my original post.  Apologies.)

I saw this series during its original run on Japanese television in 1986-1987.  This is basically the second half of the story arc which began with Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.  The story begins almost to the day after Zeta Gundam ends.  The final showdown against the Titans has left the AEUG organization all but shattered.  Many of the AEUG leaders have been killed in action, and Char Aznable, who served as one of the leading figures in the AEUG organization in disguise, is missing.  The damaged AEUG flagship limps back to Shangri-La colony to heal her wounds.  Kamiru Bidan remains in a vegetative state after Scirroco's psionic attack during the final battle.

One of the Titans' ace pilots, whose mobile suit was destroyed by Zeta Gundam, has also made his way to Shangri-La colony.  His escape pod is picked up by a group of teenagers who eke out a meager living by collecting space junk,  The Titans pilot recruits the kids to join him in an attack on the AEUG ship to steal Zeta Gundam.  By this time, the AEUG ship has docked inside Shangri-La colony in a pressurized docking bay, allowing direct access to the ship, but when the Titan pilot kills one of the AEUG crew-members (a supporting character from Zeta Gundam), the kids realize that the Titans pilot is an evil individual and turn against him.  One of the kids leaps into the cockpit of the dormant Zeta Gundam and randomly operates the controls.  The Titans pilot commandeers a construction machine and attacks Zeta Gundam. but the inexperienced kid manages to defeat him using Zeta Gundam's built-in grenade launcher.

Over the first part of the series, Captain Bright Noa (from the original Gundam series and Zeta Gundam) tries to recruit the teenagers to join the AEUG cause.  He sees the same potential in them that he found in Amuro and Kamiru.  He enlists their aid to oppose the Neo Neon forces, which have returned to Earth space from the asteroid belt.  Their first targets:  Shangri-La colony, the AEUG flagship, and Zeta Gundam.  Next target:  Earth.

While their Neo Zeon opponents unleash one new mobile suit after another at the beleaguered AEUG remnants, the AEUG has little with which to respond.  The AEUG flagship does receive one upgrade which increases its firepower enormously.  Eventually, some of the AEUG mobile suits from the previous ZG series return to join the AEUG side, but the AEUG mostly fights this war with the weapons of the previous struggle against the Titans.

With two exceptions.  When Zeta Gundam is defeated by one of the new Zeon mobile suits, the AEUG organization delivers a powerful new mobile suit just in time:  Gundam-ZZ (pronounced Gundam Double-Zeta in the Japanese series) possesses incredible speed and firepower, with 3-and-a-half times the power output of Zeta Gundam.  The second addition (seen later) is called the Mega-Rider, basically a hover-bike for mobile suits.  The Mega-Rider is armed with a powerful energy cannon, which gives the AEUG side some much-needed long-range firepower.  Later on, AEUG will receive a new flagship, which is seen later in the Gundam Unicorn OVA series. One of the main characters from the Gundam Unicorn series makes her debut appearance in Gundam-ZZ.  Watching this series will really help the viewer to understand Char's Counterattack and Gundam Unicorn much more clearly.

Shortly afterwards the younger sister of the Gundam-ZZ pilot is taken captive by the Neo Zeon side, which captured her by mistake, believing that she was someone else.  Of course, her brother attempts to rescue her on numerous occasions, and his quest is a major story element throughout the series.

I don't know if this will be included in the DVD release, but the first episode broadcast on Japanese TV was called ""Prologue ZZ,"" which was a recap of the original Gundam series and also of the Zeta Gundam series.  There was also a quiz to see if the viewer could identify various mobile suits.

This series begins with a light and sometimes comedic tone, but later on takes on a much darker and tragic tone.  I know that there was some criticism of this series, but it is a welcome part of my youth, and I am glad to see it finally made available to US audiences.",1461456000,6,4295,4.850274725274725
7685035,5,B01CN38VP2,"The video transfer and audio are top-notch given this classic anime series' age. Forget about the low reviews attacking Right Stuf for failing to include an English dub - that's up to Sunrise, Inc. and an English language dub of Gundam ZZ will probably never happen due to the lack of demand and expense of recording one. The start of this series is a little odd considering the somber and serious attitude of Zeta Gundam but improves as the series progresses.",1471910400,,460,4.691358024691358

Also, I'm tired of people voting one star ovjust because it lacks an English dub. In today's anime industry, dubs are not guaranteed, especially with the release of a very old show like this! There is simply no budget for a dub, because, like it or not, anime is a niche market. Nobody is clamoring to dub a three-decade-old show!

I'm extremely happy that RightStuf is distributing these old Gundam shows. We wouldn't be getting official releases otherwise. The fact that they are blu-rays is further icing on the cake.",1466553600,13,637,4.628318584070796

8753443,1,B01CN38VP2,"I wish I had read the reviews of this. My rating does not reflect the quality of the series; I'd give it three out of five as the sound and video transfer is excellent but it's not the best Gundam series by a substantial margin.

However, somehow in the many months since this was released, no-one has bothered to correct the metadata for the item which indicates that that it is dubbed, when it is not. There's no reason one would doubt that it was dubbed; the vast majority of recent region A Blu-Ray Gundam releases have been dubbed.  Zeta was specifically dubbed for the region A release; they even hired the same voice actor to play Char in several different series/films so there's a remarkable continuity.

I don't mind watching it subbed.  Most things I watch subbed, but given how great the dubs are on all of the other region A Gundam releases and given that the product information specifies that IT IS DUBBED, and I bought it expecting it to be dubbed and it isn't, this is not acceptable and customers should be aware that they will not be getting what is advertised.",1537056000,,1080,4.523076923076923

8753445,3,B01CN38VP2,"It's really hard to get into this show as a sequel to either the 1979 Gundam show or Zeta for that matter. Due to the show's creator Yoshiyuki Tomino suffering a horrible depression and he ended Zeta in a depressing way. Double Zeta takes a turn for the wacky though! Yeah, prepare for the Gundam show that tries at points to be serious but at the others is so absurdly comical that it's hard to take seriously. Judau Ashta takes up the reins of piloting the Gundam after Kamille well, is out of action following the previous shows events. Also Char Aznable is nowhere to be found in this show either, because Tomino needs him and Amuro for their big movie finale.  Judau is a teenage junk dealer who plans at first to steal Zeta Gundam soon is slowly roped into becoming part of Bright Noa's crew which is left in tatters since the ending of Zeta.

Ashta's friends are mostly obnoxious as all get out, two of them are betraying him constantly in the first part and backstabbing him for stupid reasons and almost get him killed. The others are okay but rather grating as far as their character  traits go.

Bright Noa is reduced to being pretty much having to endure these rebellious teenagers and their attitudes without the old classic Bright Noa standby of slapping them silly. Definitely he is a different man from the one of 0079.

On the opposite side the bad guys of this show are imbeciles and again hard to take seriously. Haman Karn seemed like a rather potentially dangerous and opposing foe in the last show is now revealed to staff her Neo-Zeon movement with an assortment of incompetent idiots with possible mental problems. Take your pick here: Mashymre Cello, Chara Soon, Glemmy Toto, that stupid Gottn guy, not going to count brain damaged Elpeo Puru who is a nauseating loli cyber-newtype character.  Haman also has a creepy crush on Judau as well due to his newtype powers.

Judau at first doesn't want to be involved with Argama's conflict with Haman Karn or Neo-Zeon but once his sister gets kidnapped he gets involved. Also for a character who is 14 he sure sounds like his voice actor chain smokes or something.

The show finally tries to get serious at the last part of this first collection but it doesn't help. The only real worth of this show is it shows the aftermath of Zeta and continues Haman Karn's storyline other wise it's rather mediocre and horrible at times. It's also very clear why Bandai didn't have this show English dubbed.

Also don't get me started on the two part moon moon colony plotline.",1521072000,,2535,4.603104212860311
8753446,2,B01CN38VP2,Don't waste you money on the blu-ray version; the transfer isn't very good and looks the same as a DVD quality copy that I also own.,1509667200,3,132,4.115384615384615
8753447,5,B01CN38VP2,"Im giving this 5 stars for 2 reasons: i love gundam and i never thought we'd get a U.S release of ZZ gundam.  I will be fair in this review, so if you're interestead, read on ahead.

Impressions!

My biggest gripe with the 1st part of ZZ Gundam is the writing. Some characters are intentionally written badly for comedic effect or to simply move the plot along. While at times the comedy does land, a lot of the jokes fall flat.

Yeah, it is weird to talk about gundam being a comedy since most other series are more serious, but ZZ gundam has a weird development story. To put it simply the writer didn't take this project seriously... at least for the first half.

Lets talk about the visuals!

The menus have some nice pictures that are full screen but bare bone. Not even a bgm plays  on them, which seems to be the norm with most of the rightstuff releases ive gotten.

Video quality is great for such an old show. It is in the original 4:3  which means you get the black bars on the sides. I don't mind this since it means there's no cropping.

As for playback; id really wish they would include a marathon mode, but they just have the standard ""play all"" and ""episode select"" options.

Sound wave stuff!!
This series was never aired in the U.S by some large network, so that means no official dub was ever recorded. That means its all in the original japanese, and if you don't know japanese, you will need to read subtitles. The voice acting is great though, so its not really distracting.

I like a lot of the bgms that play through out the episodes, especially the battle theme. Fun stuff! The intro is a bit jaring with its initial yell of ""this is no anime,"" but it has grown on me. The outro song is a jam from the very start.

Audio quality over all is pretty good. Its nothing that will utilize surround sound, but it is mixed well and all audio queues are audible.

Should you by this!?!?!?!

Well if you're a fanatic like me, yes! On the other hand if you like your gundam in english with a side of seriousness id recommend waiting on this until youve gotten all other gundam blu ray releases.",1506211200,3,2110,4.319796954314721

8753449,5,B01CN38VP2,"If you watched Zeta and enjoyed it but felt a little depressed by the end, then this sequel is a fun, wild pick-me-up that will do your more cynical side some good. I found the contrast between the militaristic AEUG crew and the carefree colonists of Shangri-La in the first arc of the series to be an excellent method through which to frame the wider scope of the Gundam universe. While all those epic space battles are going on, there are also those just trying to live their lives however they must given the circumstances of war surrounding them. That sounds a little too deep for this first part of the show, where the tone is very light and not as appealing for many Gundam fans that take themselves and the show way too seriously, but I found that it really helped to establish the new characters in an honest way that informs their actions as the series progresses - and as it inevitably does begin its slow, steady crawl into the darker corners of the harsh realities of conflict.

The presentation is gorgeous and I had no issues breezing through these discs while remaining engaged in the story, so I ordered the second set not long after completing this one. While not essential for it, there were some pieces of the story that enhanced later viewings of Gundam Unicorn so I would recommend this if you enjoyed that show since it will give you some additional backstory for a couple of the key characters. If you're ready to have some fun with a UC Gundam series, check this one out.",1497312000,,1495,4.516605166051661
