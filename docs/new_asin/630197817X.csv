It had received pretty mediocre reviews on this site, but I bought it regardless, simply because of the good price and because I am infatuated with Clark Gable. After watching this movie, I did not understand why people were so unimpressed with it. It is one of the prized movies in my collection.

This film is short and sweet, and gets directly to the point. Basically the plot revolves around Greta and Gable's seemingly hopeless romance, which is pretty standard, but for some reason this movie is not standard. It is great.

Clark is impeccable in this early role. He really held his own and Greta did a good job as well, though it is not amongst her best roles, certainly.

The direction is very interesting and well done. Greta was filmed in a loving, caressing light. The camera really loved her, and this movie shows her off at her prime.

I would highly reccomend this movie to all you hopeless romantics out there. The story ends happily and there are countless sizzling romance scenes between the two main stars. In fact, in no other movie will you see Clark Gable making so much love or looking so devastatingly handsome. By the end of the movie, I literally could not breath and I fell to the ground, swooning.

Yes, this movie is melodramatic and slightly stagey, but it sets your heart racing and really sweeps you away with its romance!",1144713600,5,1434,4.56420233463035
7819302,4,630197817X,"I watched this movie the other night mainly because it starred Clark Gable and Greta Garbo.  They're both in there but there weren't many others of note in the cast.  This is actually a pretty standard mediocre movie EXCEPT that the director did an excellent job in putting the film together.  He couldn't do much with the cast but he did a lot with the camera and subtle suggestion.  For example, the film opens with a foundling's birth.  We are given just enough information in a short conversation to tell us that mom had a questionable past and that the child wasn't really wanted by her grandparents.  We then get a series of silhouette shots of a growing girl.  In each scene we get the message that she is overworked and underloved.  There are scenes of men who try to take advantage of her as a woman.  These scenes are impressively done with enough of an image of lust and fear to make a potent message.  We get an understanding of a young woman who was abused every step of her life and we get this understanding with subtleties that seem quite suggestive for the era.  As I watched this movie I became more and more aware of how well the director, Robert Z. Leonard, was able to make his point.  An otherwise unimpressive movie became rather impressive as a result.",1113955200,9,1276,4.476190476190476
7819303,3,630197817X,"Garbo plays the illegitimate daughter of a brutal farmer (Jean Hersholt); he plans to marry her off to a low-class but wealthy farmer played by Alan Hale.  Garbo (as Helga) runs off to escape her fate and hides out in a mountain cabin which belongs to young engineer Rodney Spencer (Gable, natch); they fall in love...The picture wasn't ever considered a box-office or artistic success, but it's a curio for those who would like to witness the unlikely pairing of two legends of the screen when they were young (Garbo was 25 here, Gable was 30).  Garbo makes up for a great deal of the film's weaknesses by a clever study in alternating moods, while Gable gives a fairly strong, straightforward portrayal as her lover.  Even back in 1931, the picture was considered rather scrappy and unpalatable - yet the acting and personalities of the leads still have the ability to mesmorize, even in a hopelessly hokey plot such as this.  Interestingly enough, the book on which the film was based was written in 1917 by Graham Phillips; he was shot in the early twenties by a crank who objected to the treatment of women in the novel. His work subsequently aroused a storm of protest in America.",1026691200,11,1186,4.6875
7819304,1,630197817X,"A few years back, I was on a Clark Gable kick and went through many of his movies, so naturally, ""Susan Lennox"" was rented in due course. This is not a winner. Nope, Garbo was too bad to be endured this time, so I had to stop watching and returned to my dinner. You may differ, so view and decide for yourself.",998870400,4,310,4.016129032258065
