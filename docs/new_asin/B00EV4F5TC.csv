5945934,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I saw this movie on the day it opened in Atlanta, August 16, and have been unable to get it out of my head since then. It has an awful lot going for it. Although it is based loosely on the life of Eugene Allen, a butler for the White House from the presidency of Harry Truman to that of Ronald Reagan (from an article by Wil  Haygood of the ""Washington Post""), Director Lee Daniels (""Precious"") takes many liberties with the facts of Mr. Allen's life, something I have not a problem with as everything in every frame in this not-to-be-missed film actually took place in this country, whether it was the rape of a sharecropper's wife by a white man who then killed the sharecropper (I have a good friend who tells a similar story about his own grandfather in the rural South in the middle years of the 20th century) or the conflict between Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) and his son Louis (David Oyelowo), who is a fictionalized character, or his other son who dies in Vietnam, which also did not happen to Mr. Allen's son.

The acting of the three main characters Whitaker, Oyelowo and Oprah Winfrey as Gloria, Cecil Gaines' wife, is in a word superb (I had forgotten what a talented actress Ms. Winfrey is, not having seen her in a film since ""The Color Purple"" several years ago). Of course Allen/Gaines was a witness to the history of the civil rights movement in this country. (Gaines actually goes to the inauguration of  Mr. Obama, an event that actually happened  I believe as did the Allens being invited by Nancy Reagan to attend a state dinner.) Gaines' buddies, the other butlers in the White House, provide much comic relief in this very serious movie that probably won't be seen by those individuals who need to be reminded most about  how many white people treated  black people in much of the 20th century.

My only complaint about the movie is that few of the actors who played the many presidents the butler worked for were very convincing to me. On the other hand, I found Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan as she gushes about  her beloved ""Ronnie"" totally believable although she had the smallest of roles.

I suspect the film is destined to become a classic. I would certainly see it again,  the highest praise I can give to any movie.",1378425600,6,2248,4.5283950617283955
5945935,5,B00EV4F5TC,"In this day and age when civil rights (equal rights) are still being battled in the courtrooms (even 237 years later after the Bill of Rights and Constitution was signed) with issues like Gay Marriage and Women's Rights (which are still forcing people to fight for their own personal freedoms and choices because of archaic minded judges, courtrooms, bible beaters or just plain ignorant and intolerant people who think they are better then anyone else), this movie, ""The Butler"" shines through a dark page in America's long history to remind all of us that our justice system is very slow to operate, even more slower to learn and - to this day, does not still embrace equal or civil rights of all Americans equally.

Director Lee Daniel's (Precious, The Paperboy) did three amazing things; One, he used writer/actor Danny Strong's (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay  1 & 2) masterful screenplay adaption of an original news article of ""A Butler Well Served by This Election"" written by Wil Haygood.  Two, he assembled the most brilliant, talented, enlightened and heartwarming cast of `Hollywood Gold' he could find. And three, directed the film, cast, crew and story with such subtly of warmth, compassion and bitter reality of what was the highs and lows of the Negro segregation issues were and then became over a 70 year time period from the streets of America to the inside view from the White House itself.

I'm only going to highlight the most stunning performances of this over 30 membered star-studded cast, although there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone in this film. Forest Whitacker (Platoon, The Last King of Scotland) plays the leading role Cecil Gaines, as the butler who served in the White House for over 60 years. His passion and dilemmas with the oppression of the Negro race has seen many supporters and non-supporters both in the nation's streets and in office as our presidents. Some were sympathetic to him like James Marsden (X-Men, Hairspray) playing John F. Kenny and other were not as accepting like Alan Rickman (Harry Potter, Die Hard) playing Ronald Reagan.

Oprah Winfrey (The Color Purple) choses her roles based on the quality of the character and she hit a `gold mine' with Gloria Gaines, Cecil's wife and mother of two very different children heading in two very different directions in a time when a nation did not respect their own citizens based on the color of their skins. Oprah's passion for her two children, Earl Gaines played brilliantly by David Banner (The Ropes, street Kings) and Charlie Gaines played so sympathetically by Elijah Kelly (Hairspray, Dirty Sexy Money) was so compassionate you completely understand this mothers concerns and fears and her eventually downfall with alcohol. Yet, her love overcomes all.

Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Jerry McGuire, As Good As It Gets) plays a new best friend to Forest in the White House and does a heartfelt amazing realization of what Cecil has to deal with at home and in the Oval Office.

The presidents were amazingly portrayed by Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam, Good Will Hunting) as Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Cusak (2012, Being John Malkovich) as Richard M. Nixon, Liev Schrieber as Lyndon B. Johnson and other White House icons like Minka Kelly (500 Days Of Summer, Just Go With It) as Jacqueline Kenny, Nelson Ellis (True Blood, The Inside)as Martin Luther King, Vanessa Redgrave (Howard's end, Mission: Impossile)as slave owner Annabeth Westfall, Mariah Carey (Precious) as family friend Hattie Pearl and Jane Fonda (The China Syndrome, On Golden Pond) as Nancy Reagan. They all looked, acted and even sounded exactly like what you would expect them to. It was amazing.

This film should not only be nominated, but as far as all the films out there so far this year, it should win all the awards in all the categories it could possibly  be nominated for/in; Including Cinematography by Andrew Dunn (Hitch, Crazy Stupid Love), Costume Design by Ruth E. Carter (Serenity, Malcolm X), musical score by Rodrigo Leao (Ecuador) and the entire make-up department for the film for the wonderful transformations of some of our favorite actors into real historical figures of the past.

Take the entire family for a strong, emotionally riveting historical journey through American history of the Negro (Afro American) struggle to attain their supposedly ""God-Given rights"" as citizens of this nation. You will laugh, you will be angered, you will be disgusted, you will be shocked, you will be ashamed and you will cry - both happy tears and sad tears. And remember, there are still races, classes, genders and preferences over 230 years later, still fighting to be treated equal! Thanks to films like this, American might look as civil rights and discrimination still trying to thrive like and unforgiving weed all around us. Bravo Lee Daniel!",1378339200,28,4843,5.004968944099379

5945938,4,B00EV4F5TC,"The full name is ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" but that is only because of a legal dispute over the title. Director Daniels (""Precious"") has once again evoked powerful performances from the entire cast, some of whom have worked with him before.

Inspired by an article written by Wil Haygood about a real White House butler named Eugene Allen, this film creates a fictitious gentleman who, over three decades in the White House, serves as a butler to eight presidents. Had this been better explained, it would have avoided the controversy that followed the movie's release.

This story encompasses a turbulent period in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement, but Danny Strong's Forrest Gumpish screenplay made me feel a bit manipulated as we went to Selma, Birmingham, Oakland, etc., etc., where we witnessed hide-your-eyes events that triggered (but ultimately advanced) the movement.

We see:
  * Forest Whitaker (""The Last Stand"") is mesmerizing as Cecil Gaines who first becomes a butler for Dwight D. Eisenhower and continues his service into the Reagan Administration. Whitaker ages convincingly and is in top form for this year's Oscars.
  * Oprah Winfrey (""Ocean's Thirteen"") is his wife Gloria, who seems to be in chronic rivalry with her husband's prestigious job.
  * David Oyelowo (""Jack Reacher"") is their son Louis, who becomes increasingly radical, much to his parents' dismay.
  * Lenny Kravitz (""Precious"") is one of five other White House butlers who provide social commentary and humor.
  * Liev Schreiber (""Defiance"") steals the presidential show as Lyndon B. Johnson because LBJ's profane bombast is so theatrical.
  * Mariah Carey (""Precious"") is our hero's mother, raped, abused and ultimately mad.
  * Alan Rickman (""Galaxy Quest"" ...smile...) is Ronald Reagan, the fellow who listened to our hero and finally raised the salaries of the black staff to match those of the whites. Ronald and Nancy invite our hero and his wife to be guests at a White House dinner.

There are far, far too many other fine actors to name, space doesn't permit me to identify all the players in this 132 minute outing. Be prepared to laugh at the generation gap as Gaines and his wife encounter changing attitudes, clothes and politics through their son. ""Black Power? What does that mean?"" and ""Shaneequa? What kind of a name is that?""

This is rated PG-13, so expect horrifying examples of racism, but no sweaty bodies, very little gunfire, and no blowie uppie stuff, but the ""N"" word is used repeatedly and the police dogs are scary. When I watch this again on DVD, I will relish the closed captions, although most of the audience clearly did NOT need them.",1378080000,22,2671,5.002262443438914
5945939,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Director Lee Daniels is not one for subtlety in his filmmaking approach. Reminiscent of Douglas Sirk in his prime (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-That-Heaven-Allows/dp/B00005BH23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All That Heaven Allows</a>), he has an old-fashioned Baroque style full of melodramatic flourishes that work surprisingly well for an emotional powerhouse like 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious/dp/B0037QM8YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious</a>. A lot of that now-recognizable style is on display in this fictionalized 2013 historical drama, but it doesn't work quite as well when he is trying to give a history lesson of the civil rights movement through the eyes of a relatively recessive character like Cecil Gaines, a White House butler who survived seven Presidential administrations from Eisenhower to Reagan. Fortunately, Daniels cast Forest Whitaker as Gaines, and the actor responds with an intensely reflective performance that manages to capture the character's innate nobility and conflicting emotions. Gaines is based on a real-life White House butler, the late Eugene Allen, who actually started with Truman, but screenwriter Danny Strong (HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-Change/dp/B00AYB1VSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game Change</a>) appears more intent in juxtaposing Gaines' insulated existence with the encroaching revolution embodied by the travails of his eldest son Louis.

The film's timeline spans some eighty years starting with an eight-year-old Cecil working the Georgia cotton fields in 1926 when one day, he suddenly sees his mother taken to a cabin where she is raped by a disreputable white farmer and in turn, his father shot point-blank in the head for looking at the farmer in a questioning manner. The farmer's grandmother (a throwaway cameo from Vanessa Redgrave) brings Cecil into the house and has him trained as a servant, an experience that allows him to escape to North Carolina and then to Washington D.C. where he lands a job as a waiter at the exclusive Excelsior Hotel. Noticed by White House staffers, Gaines is hired as a butler in 1957 during the Eisenhower Administration. He proves to be ideal in his role as he silently does what is expected from him given ""there is no room for politics in the White House"". Gaines becomes a passive spectator to defining moments in the political and social landscape from the late-'50s until his retirement in the mid-80's when he plays a pivotal role in the black staff finally given equal pay and opportunity for advancement.

Meanwhile, through it all, his saucy wife Gloria stands by him fighting alcoholism and the temptations of an amorous neighbor while struggling to connect with a son estranged by his father's subservient profession. In quick succession, Louis becomes a Freedom Rider, an aide to Martin Luther King, a Black Panther, a failed congressional candidate, an anti-apartheid activist and finally a Congressman. Despite a stalwart performance by David Oyelowo, he becomes something of a convenient plot device to personalize actual historical events such as the Greensboro sit-in at Woolworth's (a devastating montage) and King's assassination in Memphis. It brings a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B0035JRVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>-like tone to the story that sometimes feels trivializing. Oprah Winfrey, on the other hand, infuses Gloria with so much of her larger-than-life persona that it is often difficult to see anyone but Oprah, yet she manages to retain credibility throughout and handles the movie's dramatic high points with aplomb. Daniels takes a similarly starry-eyed approach to his casting of the White House inhabitants, and the results are often distracting.

Robin Williams is uncharacteristically restrained and consequently wasted as Eisenhower. Looking far more like Bobby than Jack, a too- youthful James Marsden trivializes Kennedy to the level of a prep-school student. Liev Schreiber is a blustery caricature as Johnson, while a prosthetically altered John Cusack manages to etch a thumbnail portrait of paranoia as Nixon. Alan Rickman looks strangely anesthetized as Reagan, but Jane Fonda places her authoritative stamp on Nancy in just one brief scene. The same cannot be said of Mariah Carey's brief and muted appearance early on as Gaines' catatonic mother. The framing device of a meeting with Obama (gratefully seen only in archival footage) brings the plot full circle with the elephantine point being made that Gaines was able to live to see the day when a black man could become President. Nonetheless, despite an emotional catharsis that lands with the impact of a sledgehammer and the multitude of stunt casting, the movie works on a basic emotional level because Daniels and Strong are so determined to use Gaines' life as the singular plot thread that brings all the landmark moments in the civil rights movement into dramatic focus.",1377993600,2,5124,5.893674293405114
5945940,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I went with my wife and saw ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" today. I was apathetic at first, but the movie was powerful and well thought out. It is nice to see how the characters portrayed average people with a dilemma - do you try to keep what you have, or do you fight for more, or more importantly, what is right?

I found myself empathizing with both the father and the son, as both did what they thought was right. The script was somewhat predictable, as all turned out well in the end. Forest Whitaker did a superb job. I liked Oprah's character and thought she did well in that role. I don't want to go into the plot, as I don't want to spoil it for you.

One thing I really liked about the movie is that it didn't keep flashing forward and back. I hated ""J. Edgar"" and ""The Iron Lady"" because both movies started in the present and kept flashing back, then forward. This movie starts at the beginning and goes straight through.

My only problem occurred when I got home and did some cursory research. I thought the movie was about the life of the real White House butler, Eugene Allen. Apparently, this movie is a screenplay which bears very little resemblance to the real-life Mr Allen. I was somewhat disappointed.

Still, I liked the movie. I suppose it had some similarity to ""The Help"". Others compare it to Forest Gump. It lasts about 2 hours.",1377993600,10,1350,4.388
5945941,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Complete rubbish. Oprah is a total disappointment, as usual when she is not giving out free things her sponsors provide.

5945942,5,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler, whose real name is Eugene Allen, is one of the strongest men I have ever heard of in the 50+ years I've been living on this earth! I can only imagine the psychological strength it must take to keep one's self-control when you are confronted by so much evil, shallowness and contempt. Forget about politics for a moment, this film is the psychological study of a man who is the ultimate survivor! And if I was ever imprisoned someday in a Concentration camp this is the kind of man I would want to have in the bunk next to mine!

In the very last scene there was a quite an ironic moment when out of all the Presidential tie clasps The Butler had to choose from he decides to wear LBJ's! President Johnson domestic agenda accomplished so much it defies comprehension: The passing of major civil rights bills, huge aid increases in education, the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, urban renewal programs, the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Wilderness Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Public Architectural Barriers Act, the Public Broadcasting Act, beautification programs, development aid for depressed regions throughout the United States, a wide-scale fight against poverty and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote, in addition to the creation of the Head Start program and the Food Stamps program. Let us not forget the passage of the Gun Control Act (and he was from Texas, for God's Sake!) Under Johnson, NASA conducted the Gemini manned space program, developed the Saturn V rocket used by the Apollo and Skylab programs and made the first manned Apollo program flights. KEEP IN MIND JOHNSON PUSHED ALL THIS THOUGH CONGRESS IN LESS THAN 6 YEARS! I don't want to minimize the evil President Johnson did in Vietnam, but no President has done more for every American LIVING TODAY than LBJ and the Democratic Congress under his leadership! Every four years, I literally pray for a domestic policy version of LBJ to win the White House! To date, President Obama comes closest with his expansion of health care insurance and getting us through the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.

For those conservatives who believe Ronald Reagan is ready for sainthood, he did more harm than good. Sure he was a nice guy, but I could care less about how nice he was. Even he admits he was on the wrong side of history! What more do you want? The irony is that by today's crazy Republican party standards Reagan would be considered a flaming liberal!

The Butler is a synopsis of some of the most important moments in United States history witnessed by one incredibly brave man! A film people will be watching 100 years from now!

5945976,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Review of The Butler
Hot Toasty Rag, September 29, 2017

While Oprah Winfrey was busy touting her talents and plugging herself for an Oscar, the lead of The Butler, or fully known as Lee Daniels The Butler, was practically ignored. I hate to break it to you, but the movie is not about Oprahshes barely in it! Its loosely based on a true story, following one mans thirty-year servitude in the White House. Forest Whitaker is the lead, not the actress who plays his wife.

Half of the film shows Forest Whitakers personal life, from his early days on a cotton plantation to his sons participation in the Civil Rights movement, and a few scenes with his wife and friends. No offense to Oprah, David Oyelowo, Elijah Kelley, Mariah Carey, or Terrence Howard, but no one went to the theaters to see those parts of the film. They went to learn backstage dirt on Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Johnson, and Reagan! Just as it is in every miniseries or saga, the modern characters are infinitely less interesting than the historical ones, and The Butler is no different. If you're interested in a backstage view of the White House told from the servants point of view, rent Backstairs at the White House. Its so much better.

Now, to the presidents. Robin Williams plays Eisenhower, James Marsden plays Kennedy, Liev Shreiber plays Johnson, John Cusack plays Nixon, and Alan Rickman plays Reagan. Ill let you absorb those terrible casting choices for a minute. Minka Kelly plays First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and Jane Fonda plays First Lady Nancy Reagan, but they're really as ineffective at convincing the audience they're the historical figures as the actors who play their husbands are. The Butler is one giant debacle. Its a huge disappointment following an enormous amount of hype, and the scenes at the White House feel like they were written by a high school junior. The presidents are stereotyped by well-worn trivia, and when you're not rolling your eyes at the lack of imagination, you're laughing at the actors who never should have been cast.

Oprah promoted her performance so much, I was expecting a reincarnation of Hamlet. She wrote article after article in her magazine about how it felt to return to acting after fifteen years. She smoked herbal cigarettes for weeks, so that her smoking would be convincing in the film. Lee Daniels worked her to the bone to get the best performance out of her, and the experience taught her so much about herself. Her part isn't any larger than one of the passing presidents, and her cigarettes were hardly a prominent feature of her scenes. If she was expecting an Oscar nomination, or God forbid a win, she should have spent less time promoting and more time acting.",1506643200,,2718,4.8137044967880085

5946057,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I saw this movie during Labor Day weekend.  It seemed appropriate to watch a movie about a working man who is by no means extraordinary man and a human being.  Film is based on a true character.  A young man, who was raised in a deep south is taken in by his mistress to become a house butler after tragic event during which his mother was raped and father shot dead execution style by a plantation owner's son.  He ends up serving at the White House.  Movie shows how it is to be a person of color and overhear conversations taking place at the highest office in a world.  What it is like to be serving presidents during the times when Civil rights movement is evolving in US and internationally, Vietnam war is raging and at the same time, this humble man, witness to it all is directly affected in all events on both personal and professional level.  Forest Whitaker gives wonderful performance.  Many famous actors have cameos playing various presidents over decades.  I was a little disappointed that director made no effort to find actor playing Jimmy Carter, while all other presidents are represented - from Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan.

It is an amazing story that shows humanity to its core, from political agendas to negotiating life with friends and family.  Touching and eye opening.",1473292800,,1296,4.6902654867256635

5946075,5,B00EV4F5TC,"An excellent dramatization of a real dilemma blacks faced through much of the twentieth century:  to shuffle or to protest.  The title character chooses the former path, spurred by the murder of his father and the rape of his mother by a southern plantation owner and the recognition that there was absolutely no path to justice.  His son chooses the other alternative, rejecting his father as an ""uncle Tom.""  His father rejects him because the father is convinced that protests put his son's life in danger--which they do--and risk making the lives of blacks much worse--which they also do.  What makes the film so poignant is that both are right--at least in the short term.  The most important lines of the film are put in the mouth of Martin Luther King: the black domestic is a subversive figure because his hard work and reliability undermine racial stereotypes.  The film shows the butler having a positive impact on the Presidents he served.  Until the end, it is toss up whether the father or the son does more to advance civil rights. Both paths took their toll on the individuals and their families.",1468368000,2,1111,4.780104712041885

I knew I didn't like what I was hearing but this movie takes you into the hearts and minds of an African American family and what they actually went through.  It opens your eyes and it's hard to keep from crying, at times.  The two centuries of horrible a use that went on in our own country is brought to light with the experiences of this one family and what they take away from their experiences.  A family of four, each individual with their own different thoughts made this a moving experience for me.  The actors were all fantastic.  MUST SEE",1463356800,,682,4.416

5946107,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Looking at the world through the lens of this film there is only one thing happening in America that matters and that is race. In the world that Forrest Whitaker creates, whitey just doesn't get it. The only hope for the soul of America is the wisdom of black folks and at the finish line of it all is the messiah, a black President. It doesn't matter his policies, his views, whether he has any experience, as long as he is black.  More Hollywood Paint by Numbers Propaganda.

Unfortunately, every turn of events you see coming. It's obvious before someone dies or something major is about to happen. And it's worth mentioning again, the white people are kind of belligerent self-serving bullies - every single of one of them. Switch out the colors and some might call that racist.

Yes, America does have a shameful past when it comes to our race relations. But this movie takes that and amplifies it to the extreme. The clear and and loud, undeniable theme of this movie is, ""Shame on the White Man"".

For those reading this who assume I am some right wing nut, do a little research. During the time that the protagonist is a butler in the White House, did you know that black Americans still made more money than most human beings on planet Earth?  Yes, it was unfair in America but there is such a thing as a lie of omission.  The Civil Rights struggle has made progress not in spite of white folks, but because of white folks and black folks working together. But you would never know it by watching this movie.",1461888000,,1517,4.478260869565218

5946169,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels The Butler is the story of an African American man who becomes the White House butler during the Eisenhower years and serves through the Reagan administration. The story is told in a chronological order, so that the viewer gets to see the world changing, particularly for African Americans through the eyes of this butler. This changing world and the way father and son seek to bring about that change creates something of a generational conflict between the two that takes decades to resolve.

Thats where The Butler reaches into your chest and grabs you as a movie. The Butler is above all else a family story that extends beyond race, color, or creed. I think everyone will be able to relate to the generational shift in tactics and challenges that confront each new generation and create conflict. Beyond this, it is a beautiful work of cinematography and acting that makes the viewer feel as though they are in all these different decades, which is so difficult to accomplish in a movie that spans decades.

The Butler is a movie that lives up to the praise it has gotten.",1451606400,7,1089,4.726315789473684

5946206,5,B00EV4F5TC,"It's hard to believe a story told *this* well has several fabricated moments in the storytelling, but apparently it's true.  Too bad.  However I found the movie surprisingly good and highly enjoyable despite the fabrications, so I highly recommend watching it anyway.  I just can't understand why Hollywood would deliberately mess with history in such a way.  It seems wrong to me.

Now I remember the advertisements for this film were completely misleading in the sense that they didn't actually reveal what this movie was about.  This movie has a LOT more going for it besides a butler who spends a few decades in the White House serving people.  That's one aspect of the story... a tiny aspect at that.  Because the bigger chunk of the writing involves the Civil Rights movement, the Freedom Riders and the Black Panther Party.  Forest Whitaker who's an extraordinary actor as many people know plays the role of the butler.  A continuing theme is that the black butlers aren't being paid equally with the white ones, and no matter how many times Forest addresses the issue to those in the White House including the president at the current time, the issue never gets corrected.  But let's start at the beginning...

Forest (or at least, the fictional Forest Whitaker character we see in the movie) begins in a cotton field down south where he sees his mother raped and his father shot in the forehead.  This is only about 10 minutes of writing in the very beginning, if that.  The story doesn't spend a lot of time with Forest's childhood.  So when he's old enough he runs away from this place and eventually, after breaking into a fancy home and is discovered by an African American, realizes that he has a talented ability to serve while being respectful towards the whites and well-liked by everyone he meets.  He can serve with the best of them.  So he eventually serves so well that he's offered a chance to serve at the White House.  Who could possibly turn this down?

Now let's go into the future (the late 50's/early 60's).  His wife (Oprah Winfrey) stays at home all day sewing.  Meanwhile they have two sons that are both very different- one of them goes off to Vietnam when the late 60's chapter of the story approaches, while the other becomes a Freedom Fighter and eventually becomes part of the Black Panther Party after getting fed up with the beatings towards his fellow African Americans so he felt he had to make a stand (with his girlfriend who's even angrier and more vengeance full than he is).  Honestly this is perhaps the best part of the entire movie- watching his son travel on buses down south through very dangerous territory where not only his life is constantly in danger, but he frequently spends his time in and out of jail cells all as a means to desperately encourage freedom of speech and equal rights for everybody.  Another alarming segment is the group of African Americans who refuse to leave a diner and face humiliation and torment as a result.  It's all extremely sad and moving.  It's hard to believe people could be treated like animals.  So barbaric.

Anyway Forest sticks around through the Eisenhower term (Robin William plays his part and well, it doesn't work to be honest since I associate Robin Williams as a comedian so it's sort of unnecessary for Robin to play this role), the Johnson period, the Kennedy period (where the most African American support came from and seemed to indicate major improvements across America until he was of course shot to death) and eventually the Reagan term.  Through all the hard times around the country showing blacks getting beat, shot, killed, etc. that Forest and Oprah see on the TV news night after night for years, they manage to grow old together.  I won't spoil the ending, but the final 20 minutes is intended for total tear-jerking.  It's an extraordinary way to wrap up these events.  Tragedies occur, but you probably already know that.  Some inspiring moments occur as well such as Barack Obama's scene.

Let's not overlook the extraordinary cast of actors either.  Besides Forest, Oprah and Robin Williams we have Mariah Carey, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jane Fonda, John Cusack, Lenny Kravitz and David Oyelowo.  Terrence Howard is the neighbor I think who tries to hit on Oprah, but she'll have none of that.  If there's any weak point in the writing it's that more involvement between Forest and Terrence could have been written into the story.  Oprah obviously has a drinking problem, but I suppose given the significance of the bigger story concerning the mistreatment of African Americans, it's forgiving to not give into typical trivial relationship stuff.

Basically the emphasis is that Forest Whitaker has to persevere his own numerous hardships while getting the opportunity to work at the White House.  He sees many struggles all around him, life changing struggles that affects his world and the people he loves in a drastic way, and often has to keep his mouth shut even when he desperately wants to say what's on his mind.  He knows when he's not getting a fair deal but he can't say anything.  He tries to raise his sons the best way he can, but unfortunately they eventually split apart and go their separate ways.  The one son in particular who becomes part of the Black Panther Party, Forest basically writes him out of his life for a very long time.  Only when he realizes everything his son has accomplished and gone through in the name of freedom does Forest pay him a surprise apology visit.  Not sure why South Africa was brought up and the entire vetoing segment.  Interesting how they show Forest, Oprah and everyone else growing older and in the case of Forest in particular, it's believable looking- he really DOES look older as the years pass.

While the story has intentional fabrications for the purpose of making a story look bigger, from a movie perspective Lee Daniels' the Butler does everything else right.  There's a TON of emotion concerning the mistreatment of blacks and their daily struggles, there's always something interesting and surprising going on either related to a huge presidential decision or Forest's own family, and it's highly recommend for everybody.  Something major is *always* going on.  There isn't a boring moment anywhere.  Even Oprah proves she can be a decent actress at times.  This movie has everything going for it... except an honest story but I suppose I'll just have to ignore that (though it's tempting to lower my 5-star rating I admit).  You can't have a story of *this* magnitude and *this* much effort to make it look like the most important historical piece of the mid 60's Civil Rights movement just to have it filled with intentional errors.  Just no!",1441411200,,6726,4.793402777777778

5946217,3,B00EV4F5TC,"Movies about individuals who are either a part of history or invariably caught in historical periods are  movies that are very hard to make. Lee Daniels the Butler,is a movie about the entire 20th century history which mostly affected African Americans.
The Butler attempts to encompass many significant historical events, while it is not entirely successful it is still worthy of a watch as a mini documentary. Forest Whitaker is Cecil Gainer, a butler who had served US presidents from 1957-1986. He witnesses history being made from the sidelines.
Lee Daniels directs an impressive cast which acts well but the story sometimes seems to be too thinly spread as it becomes hard to compress so many story lines. As a story about struggle and race, it sort of succeeds.

5946235,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels The Butler
 Director/Producer Lee Daniels in a spasm of remarkable hubris named his movie after himself.  We will simply refer to it as The Butler hereafter.  We expect an interior view of life in the White House from Ike to Reagan.  What we get is 80 years of race relations in America as seen through the eyes of a single family.  This is a valuable, moving and at times terrifying look into our collective past, all the more so because of its unexpectedness.
 This is an Oprah Winfrey project with Oprah giving a layered performance as the all too human wife to Forest Whitaker, who plays The Butler.  Whitaker as usual is flawless in his most intense role since he played the deranged dictator Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland.  That role was awarded an Oscar and this might bring him another.  If Oprah wasn't so busy with her own entertainment empire she could make a good living as a professional actress.
 The cast has many famous names.  This happens when the actors realize that the production will be something very special.  Robin Williams, James Marsden, Liev Schreiber, John Cusack and Alan Richman play-in order-Dwight Eisenhower, JFK, LBJ, Nixon and Ronald Reagan.  Ford and Carter play themselves in very brief historical clips.  There are some perhaps odd seeming match-ups here but all the presidents are nicely done in their human terms.  The political references are a light gloss however and told entirely from the perspective of our 21st century awareness.
 Other famous actors in supporting roles include Cuba Gooding Jr., Lenny Kravitz, David Oyelowo, and Mariah Carey.  Vanessa Redgrave has a small but important role as the White land owner who gives The Butler his first training as a houseman.  In a confusing crisscross of art and life Jane Fonda gives a bright and sympathetic interpretation of Nancy Reagan.
 All hands get high marks for the acting, ditto for the direction which brings us right into the lives of the characters.  Do to the nature of service at the White House level a lot of the acting is done in a very subtle manner, something for which Whitaker is justifiably lauded.
 First time to the big screen writer Danny Strong wrote the script from an original article by Wil Haygood.  Strong also wrote himself a cameo as a reporter.
  The Butler is the most intensely moving film about race relations in America done in this century.  Because of its emotionality it will be successful, indeed is already successful.  The film was made with a very small $30 million budget and has already garnered some $52 million in its first few days.  I am old enough to remember as current events most of what the film deals with, from the opening moments that depict the result of a lynching to the election of our first Black President, an event that The Butler was able to witness.
 This strong four saw blade film is rated PG-13 for historical violence rather than skin or language.  It is two hours and 12 minutes long.  The house was packed when I saw it.  You should see it to.  This is a very important film.",1436832000,,3066,4.694183864915572

5946250,5,B00EV4F5TC,"The film is adapted from 'Will Haywood's' 2008 Washington Post article,
a 'Butler' well served by this election.
Telling the real-life story of former 'White House' butler 'Eugene Allen'
In this film the butler is called 'Cecil Gaines' (Forest Whitaker)
It tells of his start in life working with his parents in the 'Cotton Fields'
At a, still young age he sets off to find his own way in life, finding it to be
as it was in the fields......he remains a second class citizen....he gradually
works his way up in life becoming a 'butler' eventually being offered a
position in the 'White House' as a butler, in all serving seven presidents.
Down the years he has learned to block out the prejudices that follow him
and his family down the years.
He brings up his family in 'Washington' with his wife 'Gloria' (Oprah Winfrey)
'Cecil' serves in the White-House at a time when...
The assassination of JFK a President who had spoke of change, and later the
killing of 'Martin Luther King' (civil-rights spokesman)
We see the violence of organisations such as the 'Klu Klux Klan' his son
joining civil rights movements whilst another son signs up to join the army
serving in 'Vietnam'
The rise of the 'Black Panther' movement in which his son becomes involved
in the late sixties.
The film had mixed reviews when released as it does with reviews on this site,
The story deals with race relations a subject that has never quite gone away
down the years, though progress has been made as the film portrays.
Today we have a 'Black' President in the 'White House' I suspect even the
civil rights activists of the 60's could never have envisaged this (having watched
this film I'm so glad that the Butler who had served so many down the years
lived to see it.
A moving and powerful film, often sad, occasionally heart warming, a well
portrayed drama with an outstanding performance from 'Forest Whitaker'
Because the film is often a little slow my first thoughts were to award 4/5 however
the film is better than that, in fact it is a story that had to be told.",1435536000,,2049,4.631868131868132

The team behind this movie should be recognized only for its role in defamation of character and in-sighting racial instability where none truly exists any longer.  How can you compare the life of slavery to the atrocities of Jewish concentration camps???  This film does in one arbitrary non-flowing scene and, while some slave plantations are in fact a blemish on our nation's history, this prop to the movie's tension is hardly plausible.

5946302,4,B00EV4F5TC,"This movie was excellent but I found it to be kind of sad. It reminded me of my days back in the 60's when Kennedy was killed, and Martin Luther KIng, and Bobby Kennedy.  They were bad times.  The acting was superb, though.  It was interesting to get a peek into the lives and times of the White House.  Behind the scenes was interesting.",1430265600,,338,4.234375
5946303,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Wonderful movie, How quick people forget the struggles that many people had back then. The kids now a days have no respect for the people that came before to pave the way so they can have the freedom that they do today!!!!!",1430006400,,223,4.333333333333333
5946304,5,B00EV4F5TC,"This movie represented the time I grew up as a teenager and I loved relating to all the news events happening during the duration of the film.  The sad truth of the situation is that people of color have a difficult time viewing films of our history.  I look upon it as a learning tool to teach our children.  This and movies like it, i.e., 12 years a Slave and Selma open the door of conversation on how  about how difficult it was and still is to be an African American in America.  They show he strength and all the strides we took as a people to overcome enormous obstacles and rise above them.  Sci-Fi and CGS film are entertaining but films like these are educational because they show how we did what was necessary to strive to build a better life for ourselves and for generations (and the immigration of minorities) to come.  Parents need to take heed and have a discouse about these events and what impact they have on today's events.",1430006400,,944,4.390804597701149

5946324,5,B00EV4F5TC,Now this movie was very interesting and had quiete a few really good actors in it.  For this to be so point on with the events that have happened over the year or even centuries.  I mena it followed a simple cotton worker and then he bacame a butler.  Now when you watch this you will see all the things he had to endure.  But then you will see all the accomplishments that he also achieved.  I was very surprised to see when he was hired at the white house to be a butler.  But through each president that he served he was known.  For every president preferred him to serve them and no other would match up.  Now this also showed the things he had to over come at home as well as what happened with his children.  I love the way they showed the history of things that were happening with each president also.  The man who played the butler was Forrest Whitaker and I love him as a actor.  But I feel there could have been no other that would have done the part justice.  I won't give too muh away on the movie but I would suggest this is a good one to watch.,1428278400,,1059,4.038461538461538

Although it is very well done, it is just another documentary of the civil rights movement told from a different perspective. I thought it would have more to with the seven presidents he served under, but the presidents were just cameos, highlighting the faults of each regarding civil rights.",1427673600,,362,4.854838709677419
5946328,5,B00EV4F5TC,A truly great movie. The story is fictionalized but that brings in a fuller range of the events that were happening. Everyone should watch this movie to learn about the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S.,1427500800,,202,4.638888888888889
5946329,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I enjoyed this.  I found it interesting and enlightening.  I liked that it not only is a true story, but shows what we will do to support our family and how our children, although they may believe wholeheartedly in something, by acting on it can put their parents livelihoods into danger.  It also shows that sometimes those same children see things more clearly than their parents and are much more willing to step out on a limb for their beliefs.  Black, white, yellow, brown we are all the same and have many of the same difficulties.",1427328000,,537,4.5625

5946354,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I found myself pondering this move hours later. Forest Whitaker, and Oprah, are simply amazing, while the supporting actors are excellently placed and give strong performances. This movie, much more than the movie Selma and the event that that movie portrayed, for me,  really put together the feel of the civil rights movement, its long, long struggle, its victories, and its disappointments, and did it all within the span of this amazing man's life. That this movie encompasses so much, yet keeps this wonderfully woven tale together, and riveting right till the end, is a beauty to behold.

Slavery was terrible but in no way comparable to what the Jews endured. This was the point I turned off the film and had my kids watch the ""I have a dream"" speech.

By trying to cover almost the entirety of the main character's life, we raced through some important events in history and the portrayals of the presidents the Butler had served were reduced to cartoons. I guess I was already familliar with much of the struggle on behalf of Civil Rights and this felt more like a simple civics lesson. Some may enjoy - I'd have rather seen a more in-depth look at the characters' interactions with one or two or three of the administrations he worked for.",1421625600,,621,4.553571428571429

For those interested he didn't have a mom that was raped, he didn't have a dad that was murdered, he didn't run away and steal to survive, he didn't even grow up in GA or live in NC. He grew up in VA in a nice house and voluntarily left under normal circumstance to seek better employment. His wife didn't cheat or drink. He had no son that joined the Freedom Riders or was in the Civil Rights movement. He did actually have ONE son but he did not die in Vietnam. I think about the only thing that is true about this movie is that he was a butler in the White House. Everything else is completely fabricated.",1421193600,21,882,4.281437125748503

I probably should give it 5 stars....and it would receive 5 stars based on entertainment value alone,  but I have two main issues with it mainly coming from the argument that it was supposed to be a kind of biography (SPOILERS BELOW!)

 1. It is only a semi-true story.... many of the plot points that make the movie so great aren't true. The situation in the first scene with his mother and father on the cotton farm is completely made up. Later in life, he only had one son, not two, and the son that fought for equal rights in the civil rights movement didn't exist in real life, and his actual son DID serve in Vietnam, but did not die.

2. And this is why I can't give it 5 stars.... as dumb as it sounds... when the credits roll... YOU MUST SHGOW A REAL PICTURE OF THE MAN WHOM YOU JUST MAD A BIOGRAPHY OF!! They didn't. Really bummed me out.",1421020800,2,1014,4.153061224489796

5946472,3,B00EV4F5TC,"What a remarkable film. Great dialogue. Mostly a great cast and a memorable film. For those in the 5O-plus crown, you shouldn't miss this movie if for no other reason than you get to view a thumbnail sketch of many of the historical events that have taken place in your lifetime. Some of the actors portraying presidents did better than others, but those characters are not highly developed and thus do as well as they need to. Forest Whitaker is a powerful actor in The Butler, perhaps his finest role yet. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is a great fence at times. He offers incredible moments of levity when the films gets too heavy and also develops a realistic friendship. Out of five stars, Oprah Winfrey took two of them away. It's difficult for me to respect Lee Daniels when he casts a part because someone bought it. Producers or associate producers should not be allowed hand-pick a role because he/she is footing part of the bill under the guise of ""it's an important film and I must underwrite it and have a part in it."" Oprah publishes a magazine with her face of the cover of every single issue. She likely a fine publisher and is without question a great TV personality who resonates with untold numbers of women. However, a credible actor she is not. It was easy to tell some of her character was slapped into the script to raise the profile of her part. The problem is the film was weakened as a result of it. Her part was just not very interesting and Daniels let it go. Unreal. I was stunned to see Winfrey get equal billing with Whitaker. Nevertheless, just plug your nose thinking of money, Oprah and Daniels, there is more than enough great storytelling despite the trio. It's obvious to me Whitaker and Gooding, Jr. should be landing far larger roles than they have been.",1419638400,,1781,4.5514018691588785

5946484,5,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler is a historical film that was based on the real-life account of Eugene Allen, who worked at the White House during eight presidential terms from Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan. During his employment at the White House,the African-American son of a sharecropper felt privileged to be an eyewitness to history and he became witness to the implementation of most of the landmark pieces of legislation like the dismantling the Jim Crow system of racial segregation.

The story begins in 1926 in a plantation in the Deep South. Cecil Baines,the character based on Allen and portrayed by Whitaker, becomes witness to his father's murder on the cotton field for protesting his mother's rape at the hand of an overseer. Because the perpetrator was never brought to justice, he gets the message at an early age that a white man can get away with a crime and not be punished for it. To avoid the same fate as his father, Cecil skips town as a teenager, settling in Washington, DC where he lands steady work as a bartender in a hotel catering to an upscale clientele. There he also meets Gloria whom he later marries and start a family with. Cecil's sterling reputation as a polite and deferential black man eventually reaches the White House, where he takes a position where he starts as a pantry man and was later promoted to butler, and then eventually to Matre d'htel; and he becomes witness to many events in history particularly the long arc of the civil rights movement.

This is a surprisingly pleasant film as it is always engaging and entertaining. Each of the scenes has its purpose and complimentary energy. Also,the actors all seem unified in a joint cause to tell a great story about the African-American fight for equality. In addition to that,it consists of a lot of great performances starting from Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines. He has a grounded performance that anchors the film and blunts its riskier excesses, hears and sees everything. Aside from that,we are treated to see Oprah Winfrey delivers in her more dramatic scenes that are enjoyable to watch. Also worthy of mention is Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan and John Cusack as President Richard Nixon. Overall,it is one powerful film that is truly satisfying and worth the watch.",1419292800,,2257,4.844559585492228
5946485,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels the Butler
Rated PG-13.
How propitious that this powerful drama, based on an article in the Washington Post (http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-11-07/politics/36906532_1_white-house-black-man-history), was released during the celebration of Martin Luther King, Jrs I Have a Dream speech! The films black butler Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) may be a fictionalized version of the real Eugene Allen, but the events he witnessed, inside and outside the White House, are true, indeed historic, including Pres. Eisenhowers sending in troops to protect the students integrating the Little Rock High School; the Kennedys and the Freedom Riders; the Selma March and Pres. Johnsons We Shall Overcome speech; the Mississippi Summer Feedom Project; the urban riots following the murder of Dr. King; and much, much more. Every person of faith should see this film and discuss it with others. White and African American pastors should seek each other out and see if their congregations are willing to meet together and talk about the issues raised. Some of the conversations the black characters have among themselves will surprise many whites about their assumptions and views, one example being how acclaimed actor Sidney Poittier is perceived. It is so good to see a film in which the story of blacks is told without bringing in on an equal basis a white character to share the star credits. Oh yes, the constellation of famous whites playing the supporting roles has garnered lots of attention, but essentially this is an African American story told by African Americans!",1419120000,,1580,5.426829268292683

Is this a story of one man's life with civil rights as a backdrop? Is it a cultural piece? Is it a political piece? It just jumps around too much and doesn't end up saying much of anything very well. As far as the acting goes, Oprah was the weak link. I know she's not an actress, but she was fabulous in The Color Purple. I couldn't decide if she was supposed to be southern or northern, ignorant or educated. It wasn't just that she was human with shades of grey. She was very poorly played.

It wasn't horrible. There were really powerful bits of it, but it seemed to have an agenda and I really don't like being told what to think. Just tell me a good story.",1415404800,,814,4.217948717948718

5946565,3,B00EV4F5TC,"Rising from servant and runaway/criminal, a young man gets the fortunate opportunity to become a White House butler. He happens to be in the right places at the right times.

Several of the presidents look nothing like their real life counterparts. I think that the film was supposed to focus on the family and the African American experience. So it doesn't pay too much attention to trying to match up the white actors. It kind of defeats the purpose of having this specific screenplay. You could have had the story set anywhere instead of Washington D.C., instead of the White House. I think these were just token reminders.

I also did not like the 'conflict' with the son about how to create change.  He goes from being a freedom rider to black panther and then anti- apartheid activist--while dad is a White House butler. Because the activities actually would have come under the surveilance of then FBI director J Edgar Hoover and likely have cost dad White House clearance (at least for part of the story), it does not make sense. I've also heard that this was thrown in and was a plot inconsistency itself. It did not even happen to the original person who this movie is allegedy based off of!

And they spend so much time on this part of the story while just whizzing through the Ford through Carter years. Since he was working for Reagan, what happened?? Were they not able to find actors remotely close to those presidents??

Yes Obama is the first African American president--but I at least thought that they'd have something about Bill Clinton and  George W. Bush who were themselves both from the south. If this story (or part of it) is actually based on a real-life book, seeing the character's inevitable observations of these 'southerners' who came in after legal-cultural changes---would have been interesting. Both men  were governors the generation after segregation had been struck down.",1413936000,2,1908,4.8343558282208585

5946568,1,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler upholds the myth that servility accomplishes more than active resistance. It also endorses the view that Barack Obama's election victory proves that America has ""changed"", a myth that is wearing rather thin at this particular moment. Acting is not very convincing and neither are the arguments. It appears that Oprah may have had more than a hand in shaping this story and how it is told. Its another Uncle Tom success ashes to riches story. Hollywood needs to start towing a different line and showing things as they really are. I doubt whether mature audiences really need this.",1413849600,,591,4.92

5946599,1,B00EV4F5TC,"After I finished viewing ""The Butler""--oh, excuse me, ""LEE DANIELS' The Butler""--I seriously felt dirty.  This movie missed so hard on so many levels that I can't--

Oh, wait, I can!

1.  THIS IS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VERSION OF ""FORREST GUMP.""  If you saw that movie, you've seen this one.  Seriously.  Not kidding.

2.  This movie is the most blatant Attempted Oscar Grab Ever (tm).  Oprah Winfrey paid for this movie to be made and obviously expected to be rewarded with, at the very least, an Academy Award nomination for herself.  Well, she did get to be the main female character and to rebuff Terrence Howard because THAT'S WHAT STRONG BLACK WOMEN DO.  You know, when they're not being total caricatures.  That this film didn't get a single precious Oscar (or even Golden Globe) nomination?  Speaks volumes.

3.  Every time--and I mean EVERY TIME--a historical event was referenced I was like ""gee, let's see how one of the characters will be involved.""  Which, apparently, was the job of Cecil Grimes (Forest Whitaker)'s sons.  Birmingham, Selma, Memphis, Vietnam--""hey, look where I happened to be!""

This movie hits false move after cliche after predictable situation.  A white plantation owner raping the lead character's mother and shooting his father when he protests?  Check.  Plantation owner's mother teaching the lead character as a child how to be a good ""house n****r""?  Check.  Lead character getting a job at the pastry shop he broke into because he was ""hongry?""  Check.  Etc., etc., etc.  There is absolutely nothing surprising in this movie, including the amount of white guilt that comes blaring from the screen.

I was born in the mid-1960s.  I have been horrified reading history, more horrified to see the violent outcomes of sit-ins and demonstrations.  I was six in 1973 when I came across segregated water fountains in a K-Mart in Florida, ten years after that crap was supposedly done away with by law.  I would be the last person to look into the face of a black American and say ""suck it up, buttercup"" and the first to deliver two huge middle fingers to the idiots who assaulted and murdered people just because their skins were a different color.  ""The Butler,"" however, delivers the YOU DONE US WRONG WHITE AMERICA message with a sledgehammer.  There are no surprises, indeed, nothing that makes this film watchable, which is sad.  Lee Daniels delivered the goods with one of the most gut-punching movies ever, ""Precious.""  With ""The Butler"" he cycles by your house, whistling merrily and giving you the bird at the same time.  ""YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS MOVIE!"" he screams, ringing the bell on his handlebars.

Um, no, Lee, I don't.",1411862400,5,2665,4.894618834080718

5946649,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Certainly the story of the victimization of Afrikan Americans living in a white supremacist society is a story that is told far more frequently than the story of the resistance of Afrikan people to oppression; but Lee Daniels has provided the necessary nuances often missing in the telling of the story of the impact of slavery and Jim Crow on Afrikan Americans.  Slavery and Jim Crow divided Black families by sowing seeds of fear, powerlessness, helplessness, dependency, and inferiority. Lee Daniels brilliantly and poignantly illustrates the differential effects of white supremacy racism on Afrikan Americans. Even the older son's brief excursion into the Black Panthers reveals a much ignored picture of who the Black Panthers really were and what their aspirations and goals really were. While painful to watch, ""The Butler"" is a much needed reminder of how white supremacy racism continues to contribute to conflict, disharmony, and trauma within the Black community and among Afrikan Americans, and to suppress the culture and history of Afrikan people.",1409443200,,1062,5.359281437125748

This is a must have for all Americans who are interested in seeing this country through the eyes of some from the African American community through the ages. It is probably even more meaningful for all young Americans so they can better understand what it took for African Americans to be looked upon as human beings in this country. The acting is fantastic and although I do not agree with all of the movie points, it is a story that needed to be told. Oprah Winfrey does a very good job of showing us what a many African American women went through in the 50's, 60's and 70's to hold their families together.

It helps to be familiar with the details and timeline of the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., as well as the policies of each successive administration.  Books like the Taylor Branch series would be an excellent accompaniment.

5946710,1,B00EV4F5TC,"As one who lived through and participated in the Civil Rights events of the era depicted in this movie, I find the whole vehicle not just unnecessary, but also unnecessarily painful, undignified anachronistic and demeaning to those like myself who actually lived through those events.

I found nothing honest, accurate or redeeming about the juvenile morality play or the mindless and empty depiction of blacks as cardboard cutouts in this movie. The characters were syrupy one-dimensional stereotypes of Lee Daniel's original story: literally cardboard cutouts of a past era with a ""pasted-on"" or ""painted-in"" plastic and false black humanity.

As always, it shows blacks as little more than spineless troglodytes, with a ""second hand, hand-me-down humanity, shuffling around the White House and around white America, mostly at night -- either humming religious hymns through fake piety, or raising hell and ""cutting up?"" Like the slave images only these movie makers limited imaginations can come up with, there are no normal blacks or normal black families: just dysfunctional one that adhere closely to the stereotypical American story line. God forbid that the moviemakers could one day do enough research to get the basic facts of black life correct for just once instead of leaning on old stereotypes?

However, since ""Auntie Oprah"" was involved, (and not a bad piece of acting on her part) how could we have expected anything more? She has made a ""cottage industry"" out of ""milking"" the last ounce of the ""bent over whining, and shuffling humanity"" of the ""Old Black Joe"" and ""mammy"" tropes.

Perhaps it is not altogether unfair or an exaggeration to suggest that she has gained a great deal of her enormous wealth by pandering to and trying to keep alive the Aunt Jemima-Uncle Tom caricatures of black life. It is as if she has an undying wish to bring back to life and again to the forefront of the ever racist American mind: that the ""Aunt Jemima and Uncle Tom Nation"" of old is still alive and well -- even when most racists whites, like blacks, are tired of it too. Her narrative inventions always come over as if the life she is depicting is already ""dead"" and ""lifeless"" because that's just what they are: dead and lifeless.

The only question I had was how such fine actors as Cuba Gooding Jr. and Forest Whitaker could lend their names to such a cinematographic farce? The only sensible answer must be that work in Hollywood for black actors (except for Morgan Freeman, Jamie Foxx and Samuel L Jackson that is) must still be so scarce that it is reserved only for drug addicts, prostitutes, slaves or Aunt Jemima's and Uncle Tom roles -- that is to say, only for roles that depict blacks as one-dimensional subhumans.

5946712,5,B00EV4F5TC,"This is truly an excellent movie...and I think it was very tastefully done!!!! I enjoy movies that are based on a ""True Story"". I was born in 1960 up North, so I didn't experience the racial oppression that so many others lived through during their life in the Southern States.  I am glad to have this movie in my library. It brings things more to life than just what I learned about in History class during my early years of schooling. I just viewed it last night and I was amazed to learn (from one man's perspective) what he experienced, how his family was affected by his life as a Butler, especially during a time of depression and when people of color was discriminated against on so many levels...and yes, he even experienced racism in the White House. Many people of color suffered and paved the way so that we can have the right to equality...and for this sacrifice, I say, ""Thank You"" to all of the pioneers that gave of themselves, their demonstration of courage and the sacrifice of their lives for our civil rights...and to those that fought in ANY War...I extend my heartfelt appreciation...Thank You for Serving! While I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion...after reading the reviews, I almost did not purchase this movie, but I'm so glad that I did.  There is much that happened and was swept under the rug during that era and some of us wouldn't have a clue unless someone told the story, wrote a book...or perhaps, made a movie.

5946740,2,B00EV4F5TC,"Like some viewers, I thought the first hour or so was rather compelling. What a life. What a disappointment to find that this life story was the result of creative writing.

We could have done with more historical background and less dancing, drinking, smoking, flirting, and unintelligible language at the butler's house. The presidents looked like a bunch of puppets with silly fake noses, phony gestures, and terrible accents. The worst part of this predictable film is that it states that it's based on this man's life, a life that evidently was interesting enough without fictionalizing it. Now that I know how much of this movie was invented, I feel swindled. It seems that the only thing left for the screenwriter to fictionalize was to turn the butler into a white man.

My favorite actor was Jane Fonda who captured the essence of the President of the United States, Nancy Reagan, perfectly. While she gave orders, Ronnie was supposedly elsewhere in the White House stuffing envelopes with money. I only wish the word had gotten out that Ronnie sent cash to people who wrote him with hard luck stories.",1405814400,,1111,4.873015873015873

This is a shame because the movie had a chance to be a great inspiration for anyone, no matter the disadvantages, to overcome cruelty and injustice with independence and initiative.

5946785,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I used to think a bit less of this film because of the numerous changes made to the life of Eugene Allen, the real-life butler whom this is all based on.  I just assumed these changes were made under the name of ""artistic license"" to add more drama to the story.  Then I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butler-A-Witness-to-History/dp/1476752990/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butler: A Witness to History</a>, including director Lee Daniels's forward and I now understand the man's reasons for making the changes he made.
  While Daniels wanted to tell the story of a man who selflessly worked as a butler in the White House for thirty-four years, serving under eight U.S. Presidents from Truman to Reagan, he also wanted to tell the story of what was simultaneously going on outside of the White House...mainly the Civil Rights era.  Having read the forward in the book, I now understand this and the fact that, in order to tie it all together, changes had to be made.  I consequently like the movie a lot more than I once did.
  Forest Whitaker was by far my favorite in the film, playing Cecil Gaines, Eugene Allen's film counterpart.  He played the character with a quiet self-confidence that Allen surely possessed in life.  I thought it was a bit clich for him to have personal conversations with many of the Presidents, but Whitaker's subtle ability to draw in an audience in made it work.  I admit I wasn't sure about the casting of Oprah Winfrey as Whitaker's wife, but she did well.  The older of their sons, played by David Oyelowo, was a portal for his family, and the audience, to see the struggles going on throughout the nation, especially in the South, as people fought for Civil Rights.  You could see the conflict between father and son...it all felt genuine and that made the ending between them all the more satisfying.  The second son, played by Elijah Kelley, was there just so there could be a second son.  But he served one purpose, which was to illustrate a second conflict going on at the time.  I knew nothing about either of these actors before they played these boys, but I was quite impressed by both of them.  Another person who really impressed me was Aml Ameen, who played Cecil Gaines at age 15.  The scene of his time at the caf or diner or whatever it was was perhaps my favorite in the film.
  As for the other supporting characters, this film featured a cast of all-stars.  I did find it weird to see Robin Williams never crack a joke anywhere in a movie he was in, but  he played a fine Dwight D. Eisenhower...in fact, I didn't see Robin Williams at all...I only saw Eisenhower.  Same goes for John Qusack, who disappeared into his role as Richard Nixon.  James Marsden once commented on all the Oscars and nominees he played alongside, but he can stand proudly among these folks as he was a fine John F. Kennedy.  In the end, everyone who played a historical figure did a great job.  My favorite among this crowd would have to be Robin Williams as Eisenhower.  As for the fictional supporting characters, Cuba Gooding, Jr., was my favorite, but he didn't get nearly the amount of screen time he deserved.
  The story was great as well.  As I've explained, I've changed my mind and really do like it as opposed to the first time I saw it in theaters.  There was never a dull moment throughout and many cast members, such as Oprah Winfrey and Mariah Carey, really surprised me, doing much better than I would have guessed.
  I fully recommend this film as it delivers a worthwhile plot from beginning to end...and the final line will make you laugh and just smile right afterward because both Forest Whitaker and Cecil Gaines totally deserved to say that line after everything they had been through.  I suppose my final solace with this film is that Eugene Allen's family also liked it.  I do wish that the great man himself could have gotten a chance to see it, but that will never be.  But you should definitely see this film and you should also read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butler-A-Witness-to-History/dp/1476752990/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butler: A Witness to History</a>...everything is put into much greater prospective.

Also the shooting of the butler's father at the beginning of the film was not very believable.

Rising from a boyhood of slavery in the cotton fields of Georgia to enter into domestic service and eventually becoming a butler serving eight presidents at the White House, an African-American man clashes with his son, who is involved in Americas burgeoning civil rights movement.

What did I think?

Historical epic The Butler paints an important, moving picture of the effects of injustice and systemic oppression by showing one uniquely placed mans sacrifice and dedication to providing for his family against a backdrop of a radically changing America. An overlong, occasionally heavy-handed scripts quest to visit every historical signpost pushes its trajectory towards potted history lesson, but the film rightfully brings attention to the stories of the courageous, inspiring individuals who fought for racial equality in the United States.",1403913600,,865,5.537878787878788

5946805,4,B00EV4F5TC,"This movie was enjoyable to watch in theaters, and if you have a passion for drama and American history, I think you will have a good time with The Butler. It reminded me a little of Forrest Gump in the sense that the protagonist is a participant in many iconic points in US history.

 The action is plenty exciting, and there are some mellow parts too if you like some of that. This was the first time I saw Oprah on the big screen, and I felt that her acting was good, but Forest Whitaker was even better. I did connect with both her and her husband as they were parenting their two sons. Some points were pretty sad, but I was glad to see that the overall character of the parents did not degrade too much.

 After I watched the movie, I went online and looked up the real story, and I was slightly disappointed. Yes, the story kept my attention through most of the movie, but it has very little connection to the events that occurred in real life. The real life butler, and his family, did not face as many dramatic challenges. His family wasn't even the same! I can certainly understand that the dramatization was added in order to make the movie more interesting, but its too bad that this story is mostly fiction.",1403654400,,1220,4.337719298245614

5946820,4,B00EV4F5TC,A nice fictional account of a White House usher's rise from sharecropper to staff of the highest office in the country.

5946825,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Directed at a stately pace as befits an excellent butler, this film depicts the main character as he moves from the misery & horror of a childhood in slavery to an enviable position at the White House. It shows us  the turmoil in his family and in the country, but it never really presumes to look inside his head. All the Black characters are well acted and three dimensional. The seven US Presidents who are depicted do not begin to resemble the real characters and barely even sound like them. Jack Kennedy's accent slips from Southern to Bostonian erratically. This is a good, enjoyable, interesting movie, but it does not live up to it's greatest potential.",1402790400,3,662,4.706896551724138

Not me. I learned more about the lunch counter sit-ins at the Woolworth's in Nashville from the movie than I knew as a native Nashvillian. If you are old enough, the movie will bring to mind the powerful events of the movement, the murder of Emmett Tipps, the march on Selma, the murder of the civil rights workers at Philadelphia, Mississippi, and the rest. If you are not old enough, this is a history you should know, and feel, and The Butler will begin to fill that void in your knowledge of our history.",1402704000,,751,4.489051094890511
5946828,5,B00EV4F5TC,"In the last six months three movies have moved me to change and open my heart on race, society, and gender. 'The Butler' is the third, after 'Twelve Years a Slave' and 'Belle'. Perhaps no-one else would/will be affected in the same way. Some may think my reaction shallow. But this story, fictionalized as it is, drew laughter, smiles, tears, outrage, pain - Cecil Gaines is the lens through which we witness the massive societal shifts that reshaped society over the last 60 years.  It's an uncompromising lens. For example, Martin Luther King's over-voice saying 'the black domestic defy racial stereotypes' by being hard working... He slowly tears down racial hatred... in many ways they are subversive' while we see Cecil and the White House staff working in a White House where they are paid less, called ni**er, where the goal is that a room should feel empty when they are in it. Pain? Outrage? Hope? There is no word for the mix of all three, and more, that this movie evokes over and over again.

At times the Gaines' home-life feels like my own childhood in the sixties - then all hell breaks loose at the homecoming dinner table. The tension is society's tension, generational tension, family tension, church tension. Heartbreak, conflict, hope - over and over in scene and dialogue skillfully set against one another, history plays out.  Presidents, Cecil, his family, the news...

This is not a light movie, but it is a must-see. If you lived through this time, it may break open your memories. If you only know this era through history and others, it can open your heart. Where do we go from here? The Gaines' family pain made me wonder about healing the wounds of race, of generations, of the 'isms' that continue to wound and divide. Yes, this is a fictionalized account of the life of Eugene Allen. I've read Michael Reagan's outraged critique of 'The Butler', and find it overdone. It doesn't make the Reagans look weak or vicious in Reagan's pondering and self-doubt on race. The movie included Nancy, played by Jane Fonda, bossing staffers around for 'Ronnie's' sake. Fonda comes off a snarky and arrogant, but this is Jane playing Nancy - I don't think she could  help it. Kristin Chenoweth would have been excellent in the roll. What was included about the Reagans speaks volumns: Cecil (as was Eugene Allan) is invited to be a guest at a state dinner. The movie massages this, and then -spoiler- has Cecil resigning over Reagan's decision to veto the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. Doesn't feel like a slam at Reagan, who was very much shaped by his generational anti-Communist worldview.  It marks a turning point Cecil's attitudes and his growth, from his virulent opposition to his son's Civil Rights activity, rooted in his upbringing, his generational attitudes and experiences - and he movement beyond them. It marks the beginning of Cecil's reconciliation to his son, and of Louis to his father.

The last scenes are poignant -bit of a spoiler, if you haven't seen it-  Cecil, now old and basking in the candidacy of Barack Obama, is fretting that his son hasn't been on time to pick them up for church since he'd been elected to congress. Gloria is fretting over their granddaughter. There is a powerful hope in the homey fretting and affectionate banter about grandchildren and life. Can we move beyond the chains and pains of the past, even live into brutal honesty and repentance and forgiveness into something like healing, as individuals and as a society? Yes, we can. We must.",1402704000,,3516,4.82890365448505

5946832,1,B00EV4F5TC,"This movie presented itself as a wonderful story about how a butler who served in the White House for decades related to his employer, the President.  That was NOT what this was about.  It was a history of the civil rights movement of the 60s and beyond.  It was absolutely awful.  And the last 40 minutes or so are just a commercial for Obama; seriously.  Terrible movie.  I could not have been more disappointed.",1402617600,3,414,4.527027027027027

I was enrapt but almost couldn't sit through the whole thing, wishing I was alone to watch it, instead of in a crowded theatre, as emotions flooded over me. And yet, why was this? It has taken me months to put my finger on it. It turns out that the power of it is not in what was said, but rather by what was not said. The years of endurance under incredible grace and patience, especially by the main figure, brilliantly portrayed by  Forest Whitaker, communicates a weight of time and heroism and wrenching circumstances, that seems to be impossible to be contained in the mere length of a movie. It should have gotten several Oscars, including one to Oprah Winfrey, whose portrayal was equally inspiring. Before, I have not been impressed with her acting ability.

5946837,3,B00EV4F5TC,"This almost felt like the kind of political adds run during an election. The kind where there is an attempt to manipulate your ideas and emotions to herd you in an emotional direction; where you suspend some of your intellect to follow the emotions generated. I got the feeling there was a reason beyond telling a story, or entertainment for this movie; and since it seemed to be a hidden reason, a reason not stated because it might be a reason no one would like to claim.

I had been wanting to see this movie for a while, because: I like the actors, I like the idea of anyone making something of themselves by hard work and excellence, I like the concept of showing children that it is not the job title that says who you are; but the way you do the job and the respect others have for you, that says who you are.

I would have enjoyed and been moved by the film more if it had left off the attempt at manipulating me. I can go with the flow, but when I get shoved, I tend to resist.  Still, the actors do a good job, and the basic story is a good one.",1402444800,,1055,4.086956521739131

5946843,3,B00EV4F5TC,We were really disappointed that this movie was more about civil rights than the butler.  Forest Whitaker a great actor but he mumbled a lot and we couldn't understand him.  Also noticed they portrayed the Democratic presidents to be sympathetic to the Black plight and the two Republican president not so much.  No mention of Jimmy Carter....skipped from Reagan to Obama.  What's with the plug for Obama?  Not historically accurate so basically disappointed.  Also Oprah too old for the part.,1402185600,,493,5.1

It went through the history of the last few presidents in office while he was a butler and we felt it become more of a history lesson than a well documented story.  There was a lot of time spent on the Civil Rights movement as well, which is important but at this point ""the butler"" became secondary to the story.  We then became somewhat bored and were glad when it was over.  I would like to see PBS do a ""historical"" series on ""The Butler"" perhaps starting as far back as the beginning of the White House moving into this century and how the butler evolved into the head usher.",1401667200,2,734,4.244604316546763

5946882,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I am so glad a film such as this made the impact it did in today's world.  We are so used to seeing the bloody debacle of slavery and the civil rights movement  we sometimes forget that there was life between and after those times and it is that which we know so little of.  This film gives us an opportunity to witness life as seen through the eyes of a young boy going forward into manhood and old age from a place that is still almost frozen in time. The startling truth of the residual effects of slavery comes when we realize, that in the opening scenes, we are seeing life as it was in the 1920's!  This is when we see and realize that southern blacks, at the very least, were still very much their master's ""slaves"" and were still horribly oppressed and hard put. It is from this important vantage point do we enter the life of a young boy and follow, with him, through the ensuing years. It is this truth which sets us up for the mindset of a man that will travel through the many tumultuous years of this country as they pertained to the black man's experience in America. It is more than ironic that he became a butler in the White House under 8 distinctly different presidents during the many tumultuous years this film encompasses! The White House is used almost as a metaphor employed as a backdrop for the panoply of historical events through which his life passes and not about the White House itself! That must be understood or one will take a wrong turn and believe that something is missing!  While there are a few instances of interaction with sitting Presidents the overall story is one that does not at all depend on those interactions.  Not at all...this is about a man who happens to become a butler in the most revered place in the land but in reality, his life was no different than that of a well employed man working at any other job.  The thing that should give one pause is that even by employment at the White House, the seat of all American hope and the perpetual guardian of our Constitution, the history of this family was no different than any other and his experiences were really not much different than any other.  His wants or his needs were not met any differently than they would have been had he worked four blocks over and three to the right. His children experienced life as most other Black children did in and through their time.  White America and its feelings toward the Black man are more than evident when one contrasts the differences between White staff and Black.  Who was sitting in the Oval Office mattered very little and the problems are more than obvious. The story is an important one and Forrest Whittaker gives a beautifully controlled performance as the protagonist while Oprah Winfrey, as his wife, shows us the reality of the flip side of this strange little coin.  The two are masterful in depicting two completely different experiences as Black people.  He never forgets where and what he came from and is grateful for his situation, proud as a staff member of the White House while she sees and lives life though a parallel prism of another reality.  It is a film I am glad to have experienced and I think you will be too.",1401148800,7,3188,4.457044673539519

I grew up in the south and saw first hand most of the decimation that was shown.

It was such painful scene to watch a black man and bunch of white men standing at the door of the president's bathroom, listening to ranting of a president who took a bold step in freeing black men.  If all that was shown in the movie is true then no wonder about the anger that is felt in the African American community.

Too bad it was such an elementary film with several historical mistakes.
  I suppose if you know nothing at all about civil rights history during those years, the movie kind of.. rather inaccurately gave you a quick catch up.  I was bored and unimpressed by the content and constant pointless bickering within the ""Butlers Family"".  I really don't see why this movie was made. Good actors given a dull script and seemingly No Direction.

5946976,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I don't believe in coincidences. I also don't believe in Chaos. I believe there are synchronistic occurrences in the universe that have no business being in such coordinated juxtaposition as to appear to be crafted or contrived. I believe that the billions of humans running around with hopes, dreams, fears, and desires - all emanating those emotions into the universe like a siren song to be returned by the laws of attraction - create what can only be described by a disconnected observer as chaos.

But this movie, based on the true story and life of Cecil Gaines, who served as a butler in the White House for eight presidents, will leave you pondering more questions of your own perception of coincidence and chaos. This man's past, and his path that led to the open door of serving in the white house, and his eventual influence on the decisions of presidents, really makes you see that there are greater forces at work than we can comprehend.

Forrest Whitaker - what can I say the man is an acting genious. A legend. There isn't anything I've ever seen him in that I didn't love his acting. Oprah, well I think Oprah is misunderstood and underrated. She is a perfect example of why a person should do one thing and do it excellently, or risk confusing everybody. This woman could be a talk show host and do nothing else and be great. She can be an actress and do nothing else and be great. When I see her in a great acting role, I think ""why does she do a talk show"" and when I see her on her talk show (which I realize doesn't exist anymore) I wonder the opposite.

But enough of my diatribe about these great actors. The movie is really excellent, worth watching, and will, if nothing else, make you realize that people who are always pining for ""the good old days"" should go read a history book. And people who are racially prejudiced should have their heads examined because there is something fundamentally wrong with them.

Acting.. 4 stars.. was 'better than average' but not what I expected.  Forest really held up his part...other notables did not.

I'd like to have seen more of the in between, more of Cecil Gaines' younger years before he became a butler at the White House, how he met his wife, how he applied for the job, etc. From all I've read, this film is merely ""based"" on fact with much fictional embellishment. It's very episodic, paralelling scenes in the White House with what's happening in the Civil Rights movement at the time, one causing or in conjunction with the other and being balanced by what's happening in Gaines' personal life in that same moment. It's also a very long film at 132 minutes (though there have been longer ones) so attention spans may waver after a while.

5947009,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I'll start by saying that the acting in this was very well done. Oprah Winfrey is a very solid actress, which surprised me. Forest Whitaker played an amazing part in this, and was absolutely fantastic. My main gripe is going to be that when they say it's based on real life events. The little things really add up. He only had one son, not two. Why the second one was added made very little sense to me. As a stand alone story, it would have been fantastic just sticking to the true facts of how Forest Whitaker's character had some type of positive influence on decisions made on Civil Rights in this era on Presidents. But the fact remained that His character in real life worked his way up and was promoted to the highest level of service in the White House directly because of his hard work. He was never held back in real life. A lot of the other side stories also are not true. That isn't to say or diminish what happened to countless minorities in this time nor that these things didn't happen at all, it just didn't happen to this particular family. It would have been good to hear the true story, as the events played out from his life - and it would have made for a fantastic story by itself without a lot of things that never happened to him making it's way into the movie to ""Hollywood"" it up.

It's most definitely worth a viewing. But if you are looking for something even close to historically accurate, this isn't the film you will want to watch. 12 Years a Slave was gripping and tragically real.

Great acting, still a good story, just wished they would have stuck to the facts. About the only fact remaining here is that he was a Butler in the White House.",1398211200,8,1675,4.3312101910828025

I realize there are very depressing eras in our history, and I wish not to see movies about these eras since I know them very well. Even the somewhat jovial times had a background depressing feeling. Some of the script was very predictable. I knew when he said he was going to join the military what would happen to the younger son. I knew that the older son would survive.
However, my biggest objections (as an Air Force Viet Nam era veteran--female if that makes a difference--and mainly as an American), is that the creators chose to cast Hanoi Jane, a traitor to our country, as Nancy Reagan. And this despite major objection when her casting was announced. What a slap in the face to Nancy Reagan and one of the most patriotic of our presidents. I did not realize that this was the movie she was cast in as the first lady. Had I known, I never would have watched it. The portrayal of Reagan's policy on civil rights was also inaccurately portrayed.  This website explains it better than I can. [...]  It is, likewise, a contradiction to show Reagan as being very interested in Cecil as a person and yet so staunch against civil rights.

There would have been ample opportunity to come up with intriguing  details.  However, I was disappointed that there was hardly a notice of who was president much less what their policies were.  The film just wasn't what I expected.  The film was more about family relationships with the Butler's family and the unrest at the time concerning race relations.  The Butler's two sons were totally different.  One seemed bent on protest as a way of life and the other wanted to serve his country.

5947083,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I don't like films that proclaim to be a true story and then present a story about fictional happenings. The only part of the film that was true was that the original real life character, Eugene Allen, served in the White House staff under 8 Presidents starting with Harry Truman. The film itself was good and well acted by Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey.

This was actually a good movie that goes out of the way to present the story line in a skewed manner to make the facts as dramatic as possible. While the reality of racism is presented in the film and many of the things that occurred are realistic and true, they had nothing to do with the story of Eugene Allen. The story line differs from the book as the book does not cover the rape of the young man's mother nor the murder of his father in a cotton field. Those facts did not happen. The film also made his wife of 64 years out to be an adulterous woman and an alcoholic.

The movie goes on to slander Ronald Reagan as a racist while nothing in the history books or the testimony of the people that worked with Mr. Reagan ever showed any of the tendencies that the movie brings forth. History is skewed in an effort for Hollywood to dramatize the race relations issues by portraying a fictitious story as a true story. The real butler in the real life only had one son and not two and that son was not a political activist on racial issues as presented in the film while he did serve in Vietnam and he returned alive and well.

While this is a good story and the problems of racism in our country need to be told, they should be told without political spin or Hollywood's rewriting of history. This movie was about a story of a black man that served 8 Presidents and saw a dramatic change in this country's attitude towards racism and the treatment of other people. That in and of itself would have been a great film without all of the added garbage that improperly depicted the life of Eugene Allen and others in the historical record.

I give the film three stars, one for Forest Whitaker, one for Oprah Winfrey and one for Eugene Allen, The Butler.",1396656000,,2115,4.346835443037975

5947097,3,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels' The Butler follows the life of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), who runs away from a cotton plantation as a boy and ends up working for a hotel in Washington DC, and then, the White House. The films story is inspired by the 2008 Washington Post article about a real-life butler Eugene Allen, whose life story is pretty much different from that of Cecil Gaines, as is often the case with Hollywood movies.

Like Forrest Gump, The Butler is not just a drama about the titular persons life; it is also a commentary on contemporary American history, especially the civil rights movement. One of Gaines sons becomes campaigner for civil rights, which results in estrangement from his more conservative father. Thus the film attempts to cover more than one thing at the same time.

The story of director Lee Danielss latest effort is more ambitious in its scope than that of Precious he made five years ago, but the result is a mixed bag, a movie that has something important to say, but doesnt know how to do it effectively. With strong performances from the leads Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, The Butler has many emotional moments, but as a whole the film falls short on dramatic tension, lacking details that would have made the father-son relationship interesting.

Despite some strange casting choice (such has John Cusack as Richard Nixon, or Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan) and uneven pacing, The Butler is a largely engrossing drama thanks to the star Forest Whitaker, though the film needs more time to cover the subject matter sufficiently.",1396396800,,1561,4.8830188679245285

 Directed by Lee Daniel.
 The studio made them change the title of this movie, due to the same title was used in a silent short film, The Butler (1916). Therefore, the director's name was added.

  Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), now an old man, awaits inside The White House to meet President Barack Obama.  He thinks back to the time when he was 8 years old (Michael Rainey Jr). He was in the cotton field with his father, Earl (David Banner). The white owner of the plantation is Thomas Westfall (Alex Pettyfur). Thomas is a ruthless man and makes the black men work hard in the fields. Thomas takes Cecil's mother, Hattie (Mariah Carey) by the hand and into the shed. Cecil senses what is about to happen, but his father gets a hold of him and reminds him this is the white man's world and we are working in it. Cecil hears his mother scream.  Annabeth Westfall (Vanessa Redgrave) hears the screams too. Thomas walks out of the shed and into the field. Cecil asks his father what he is going to do. All the Earl says to Thomas is, ""Hey"", in a gentle voice. Thomas turns around, points a gun at Earl and shoots him dead. From then on, Annabeth makes Cecil work in the house as servant.
  When Cecil becomes a young man, he leaves the Westfall house to make a life for himself. He goes to his mother's home and says goodbye to her.
  In the city, he meets Maynard (Clarence Williams III). He works with Maynard as a butler. This later leads to an invitation for a job interview at The White House. Maynard feels he is old now and he doesn't want that job, so he gave Cecil's name a recognition instead.
  Cecil is given the job at The White House were he ultimately served for 7 Presidents of the United States in nearly 30 years (1957-1986) from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to President Ronald Reagan.

There are times, when as a white woman, I felt shame at the way African Americans were treated in this country.  At the end, you feel pretty darned good about Cecil. It is a fascinating story.

5947171,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I'm shocked this got so much review for the Oscars and I know it can only be because of the star cast and, more importantly, the historico-racial premise. I was so sorely disappointed. At times I felt like I must have been watching Saturday Night Live- the presidents were SO off, and much of the acting and plot development was shockingly poor. For someone who doesn't know or appreciate the history maybe it taught them something, and for that it would be worth it. But as someone who works to break down barriers of racism in our daily work, I strongly feel it was a lost opportunity. The other thing that REALLY peeves me is that it's claimed to be based on the butler's life. But it's not. At all. Well, except for the fact that the real butler was African American and lived through multiple presidencies. Every other detail was fiction. Had I known that in advance maybe I wouldn't have had such high hopes.",1395532800,,914,4.5120481927710845

5947179,5,B00EV4F5TC,"My wife and I saw The Butler in a theater in August and found it thrilling, as well as sentimental and impressive: impressive for the actors' performances, obviously sentimental, and thrilling because it pulled few punches regarding nearly contemporary U.S. history.  We saw all nine movies nominated for the Best Movie Oscar: a couple are remarkable but The Butler remains the major movie experience of 2013 for us.

Given that it also had a lot of Oscar buzz at the time, we were puzzled later when it was shut out of the Oscar nominations.  Casting about for a theory, the best we heard was that the Academy was reluctant to vote for Oprah due to some sense of rivalry.  This is pretty weak, I know, but we can't quite make ourselves believe that The Butler was not nominated because it was released before October.

Reading Amazon reviews (over 1,300 now) has helped me understand the ""Oscar snub"" a bit better.  There seem to be two issues.

The smaller issue is that The Butler is pro-Obama.  I wouldn't want to under-play this angle, as (if I read the news right) 11% of the U.S. public have told pollsters that they believe Obama is the Anti-Christ.  And even if I can't quite wrap my head around that, I know that The Butler's having Jane Fonda play Nancy Reagan is going to be a bit much for quite a few people.  So given everything that The Butler put on the screen, it's clearly going to raise a lot fewer hackles to vote for period pieces like Twelve Years a Slave, safely tucked away six generations ago.

Still, I'm forced to conclude from the reviews that The Butler's real issue is that it bores people.

I can see that it has a low sex-and-violence rating: indeed, I think I remember at one point a man dancing with his own wife.  Beyond that, however, consider the idea of portraying Dwight Eisenhower on the screen.  Now to me it's somewhat daring, since if Eisenhower spoke and acted as President now the way he did then, his Anti-Christ rating would probably make it into the 7 to 9 percent range anyway.  But in a world where cinematic greatness depends on repeat viewings by 14-year-olds, it's more likely a formula for ratings oblivion.

Let's take Gravity, by way of contrast.  Kinetically, it's apparently the greatest IMAX feature ever.  And on top of this, it reinforces grade-school patriotism while reassuring viewers that women really are emotional beings who become hysterical under pressure and need to be rescued (repeatedly) by good-ol' boys, represented in Gravity by a character so authentically American that his presence in a scene (even if only in spirit) makes country-western music resonate spontaneously in the vacuum of outer space.  The votes are in, and The Butler can't compete with that.

So I suppose the studio projects about sundown towns will have gone back on the shelf and The Butler may only retain a niche audience.",1395446400,,2872,4.717434869739479
5947180,4,B00EV4F5TC,"An enjoyable movie.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it distorted the real story,  For instance, the butler only had one son(no child was killed in Vietnam) and his father was not shot to death.",1395446400,3,218,4.2926829268292686

Movie is very good, well acted, and well acclaimed but I'm sorry but I think that Mr Lee Daniels was being very very obvious with showing us the hate and racial era more than building a solid story line. Now, What was done back than was indeed uncalled for and there is no excuse for it but I felt as if it was pushed throughout this movie as his main focus and felt at times if it was a documentary instead. If this movie is holding to the actual facts it made me open my eyes to a few points such as Kennedy being shot the very next day after his speech about freedom for all. I never knew that. Over all the movie is good and has many surprising  cameo's from a lot of actors and performers including Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, Robbin Williams, and Jane Fonda.

5947191,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Regardless of the reviews claiming this movie is not a real portrayal of the REAL BUTLER serving through multiple presidents in the white house, the history of the civil rights movement cannot be poo-poo-ed as inaccurate. This movie showed beautifully the generational fights of father/son. The 'butler' had all the faith that the 'good white men'  showed understanding and true love for the humans struggling to survive while only wanting equal treatment, while on the other hand the son was a bit more radical which caused conflict between father/son and decades of estrangement.

The reviewers who had no personal first-hand experience with segregation, separate water fountains, bathrooms, seating arrangements, integration, riots (on and on and on) probably should stop nit-picking about what is inaccurate about this movie and concentrate more on what actually happened in the early 1960's (and before). Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors (until it is no longer secret information), but there is absolutely no denial of what is/was witnessed.

Having said that, Forest Whitaker has been a favorite since Good Morning Vietnam, but Oprah just really could not pull off the role she attempted to play, probably from way too much overexposure. The rest of the acting was worth watching.",1395273600,,1299,5.296116504854369

5947193,5,B00EV4F5TC,"the movie, for me, was the highlight of the year. you might not believe it, i saw  THE BUTLER  12 times. having come from europe in the mid sixties, it was a geography lesson, a history lesson, the movie was incredibly and honestly presented, showing the racial unrest in the south, depicting the life story of one black family.  forest whitaker gives a performance, together with opra, that is quite astounding. the story of  THE BUTLER who faithfully served  7 presidents, while enduring incredible family loss is just an amazing
performance by whitaker, and the entire supporting cast.

5947272,2,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler at least tries to paint a sympathetic view of its characters various evolutions throughout the civil rights movement but it just tries to do too much to accomplish it effectively.  It ends up coming off as ""the top ten greatest hits of racial politics"" more than it does a personal story because it tries to cover so much historical ground that the characters relationships and their personal evolutions get lost a bit in the shuffle.",1394668800,,445,4.779220779220779

5947275,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Mr. Whitaker's performance in the title role is reason enough to see this movie once. In fact, aside from a few very poor casting choices, the acting was top notch. Still, I can't fathom how anyone thought of casting Mr. Cusack, as President Nixon, and Mr. Rickman, as President Reagan! These are two outstanding men of talent and they were just completely wrong for their parts. The tragedy is there were several other roles in the film where they would have been used to their full potential. I also object to the casting of Mr. Marsden and Ms. Kelly as President and Mrs. Kennedy-Onassis, but they were in it for less than five minutes.

Still, despite my imaginary recasting of those four incredibly small roles, the main strike against this movie is how it's put together.

If you take it as a series of individual vignettes, then they are all quite superlative. The main trouble is tunnel vision. The writers got so locked down into trying to condense a half century into two hours that none of the momentous events they touch on, get proper treatment, and they skip over events that honestly should have been highlighted such as: The Cuban Missile Crises, The Moon Landing, McCarthy trials, Watergate, and most incomprehensibly... the appointment of Justice Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, were never even acknowledged.

I can't help but think that this story would have been better presented as a mini series with each Administration given a two hour episode.

My favorite part of the film is when Mr. Gaines in later life observes... that as a society Americans look out in judgment at the world and it's atrocities while ignoring what they have done to their own people. Such a sentiment isn't very popular, but it's truth certainly touched me. Taken as a whole, this country has a grievous list of sins that as a whole we try to sweep under the rug.

If nothing else, Mr. Gaines' life exemplifies that despite suffering injustice, tragedy, and heartache one can live a life of dignity and value with hard work and self-respect. That message, covers all the flaws of the film.

All in all, I recommend it.",1394582400,3,2123,4.755434782608695

I learned that the movie was cast (in part) by Lee Daniel's younger sister Leah Daniels, and it was as if she casted all of her friends, her friend's friends, etc. Sure, they were names (Robin Williams, Oprah Winfrey, John Cusack, Cuba Gooding), but they collectively did a terrible job with their characters.

Excellent writing, wonderful actingeveryone was superbForrest Whittaker and Oprah Winfrey both spot on and unforgettableand brilliant filmmaking, so why was it ignored? some say it came out too early for Oscar season. Okay, but they're not the awards of the fall of 2013, now are they. More like this: ""We can't nominate *two* movies about our racism! Let's put '12 Years a Slave' up, so we can all agree the bad times were way back then, *those* white people, not us, not now, not still going on ""

But these are universal stories as well. It's the best movie about ""race relations"" I've seen, for one; it's smart, subtle and hardhitting when it comes to white bigotry and white liberalism as well as the variety of ways African Americans as individuals and the civil rights and black-power movements in general survive/d and respond/ed to that oppression. But it's also a human story with universal tones. This is a full-fledged story about 20th century America, an upwardly mobile hardworking man and a bored and isolated housewife woman, a toes-to-the-line father and a rock-the-boat son, a mother who must find the balance between loyalty to husband and love for children; and our history from Jim Crow South to Vietnam to Barack Obama.

The White House scenes are incidental and with few exceptions add nothing to the story. Even from a social commentary perspective, this movie fails to give any insight or impact to the events of the time. Not an enjoyable, educational, or enlightening movie.

5947371,3,B00EV4F5TC,"As I post this review there are already over 1,100 reviews of this film. I would like to point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all formats of a film (theater, DVD, Bluray and Amazon Instant) together when providing reviews. I always recommend that those seeking a review of a DVD or Bluray sort by date  you can choose newest first  - and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. This review is of the DVD version (including the Bonus Features).

I won't spend a lot of time discussing the film itself, except to say that it does provide a capsule history of the civil rights movement in the US between 1957 and (roughly) 1977. (There is a bit of an update to 2008 with the inauguration of President Obama. ). The film uses the device  of centering  the story around  the life of the White House butler  - Cecil Gaines  -who served seven Presidents,.  Gaines childhood life and early butler career are summed up in the first 21 minutes of this 132-minute film. He is soon in the White House serving President Eisenhower (played by Robin Williams, and not looking at all (IMHO) like Ike). We see some other Presidents that Gaines served ( JFK, Reagan, Nixon and Johnson  the latter two are played for laughs).  Jane Fonda gets a shot at portraying Nancy Reagan (an inside joke?). There are big celebrity names all over the cast list and I lost count at the end when the list of Producers and Executive Producers scrolled by. But this is the kind of film that the Weinstein brothers (Bob and Harvey) love to produce, in addition to the much smaller (and, in my opinion, better) films like the recent Oscar-winning 20 Feet From Stardom and Fruitvale Station.  Yes, Oprah is on screen a lot and the problem for me was that she looks and sounds like Oprah, while Forrest Whitaker- as Gaines  actually inhabited the role. I just felt that the screenplay tried to cover too much. After all, the basis for the film was just a magazine article. If you want to know about the Freedom Riders (a major part of the story) you can do better with the recent PBS documentary (which Ive reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.)

The DVD has a bunch of bonuses, though the only one I found worthwhile was the six-minute featurette on The Original Freedom Riders . Theres a 21-minute making of featurette with cast and crew but it spends a lot of time showing scenes from the film. The 20 minutes or so of deleted scenes didn't add much for me either. And the including of a 5-minute gag reel in a film like this on a serious subject seemed like feeler too. Finally there is a 2 minute performance of Gladys Knight and Lenny Kravitz singing a song from the films soundtrack.

I had high hopes for this film and it never reached them for me, however, Oprah is a draw and may bring in younger folks who don't know the history of the Civil Rights movement is the US and even encourage them to dig deeper. As someone who lived through the same presidential terms as Gaines, I knew the story and watched it on TV every night. So there was nothing new here and some of the casting let me down as well.

So it gets three stars from me (in Amazons code that Its OK).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5947375,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Shocking that the liberal Hollywood hypocrites would actually show Lyndon B. Johnson as a closet racist and Ronald Reagan as a generous man who was the first president to raise salaries among the black staff.

But not a bit shocking that they made Reagan out as an anti-apartheid president when his main concern was economic sanctions hurting the people they wanted to save the most and, instead, imposed sanctions on the South American government.  This somehow got lost in the liberal bias.

Or Johnson's ""we shall overcome"" rhetoric at the end of the movie when it was Senator Dirksen, a Republican, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to get the CRA of 1964 passed with a majority of Republican votes.

That, too, perpetrated the ""Big Lie"" which too many in the black community still believe today.  It was Republicans who passed every piece of civil rights legislation since the end of the Civil War.",1393977600,6,909,4.876623376623376

The sensitive moments and time of the main character are well handled.  The contrast and conflicts and relationships between the Forest Whitaker character and the Oprah Winfrey character, and their two sons, with the backdrop of the civil rights movement gives an insightful overview of a quarter century of American history.  But history is made of people and this movie shows a very real and poignant slice of the lives of some of it's participants.

He works as a butler in the White house from Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration until Ronald Reagan's.  He believes in peaceful, political change as he watches each president make decisions, which inch the country towards racial equality.  The butler has two sons, one a militant, black activist and one a soldier who dies fighting for his country in Vietnam.  Forest Whitaker finally quits the White House in protest over Reagan's stand on South Africa, but was able in the end of his life to be brought back to the White House to Barach Obama, the first black president.

The only thing that saves it from being Golden Raspberry worthy is the terrific acting by Whitaker and the cast.  Lenny Kravitz is a revelation and Cuba Gooding Jr. brings in a solid performance.  I saw another review that equates this movie to Forrest Gump and I have to say that's an ideal sentiment.  Basically this was hyped by people who have no sense of history and I think it does a disservice to those who fought the civil rights war.

Forest Whitaker was phenomenal, Oprah was...well, quintessential Oprah, but the story came across as two separate movies smashed into one.  Not knowing anything about the story, the ""butler"" track was what I wanted to see: how he rose to that position, his personal triumphs/struggles, his interactions with all the different presidents...in short, the BUTLER's story.  There was a skimming of his life, one that the lead could have had the opportunity to explore and embody, if given the chance.  However, the distraction was the alternate movie, the ""freedom"" track. I am not diminishing the significance of the civil rights movement.  It was an important time, and a horrible struggle for what never should have been.  It was portrayed well, but somewhat overshadowed the (my) expectations of the movie's purported theme.  Lessons learned from the movie, to be sure, but lesson #1 is, ""don't believe the ads"" about what you'll be seeing in The Butler!",1393372800,,1078,5.0852272727272725

I can vividly remember the exact same scene, which played in the living room of our family home in November 2008, while we watched CNN announce that Barack Obama had just been elected The United States' 44th President. I still can not comprehend why ""The Butler"" was not even nominated for any Oscar Awards. My thoughts are that this Country still has a ways to go, before we live in a post racial society. For those who can open their hearts and minds, to appreciate United States (US) Black History, and the relentless struggles of African Americans in the US for their civil rights, I would highly recommend watching this movie.",1393200000,,911,4.6645962732919255

The Butler takes the path of improvement by way of more prestigious service; namely, The White House. He works within the system. His son just wants to be a regular U.S. citizen with equal rights.

5947517,4,B00EV4F5TC,"There might be a few spoilers here. Just saying.

 I saw ""The Butler"" last night. A good, very ambitious, but flawed film, definitely worth seeing for its emotional overview of the Civil Rights struggle of the '60's and '70's (and continuing into the '80's), and the great performances by Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines and Oprah Winfrey as his wife, who I think shared a great chemistry. The film had some very good, very moving moments--it was based, loosely, on the life of Eugene Allen, who served as a waiter and eventually as the chief butler to the President from 1952 until 1986. I think the film would have been better served had it followed his life a bit more closely. Cecil Gaines' son becomes an almost Forrest Gumpian/Tom Joadian character who manages to coincidentally find himself somehow thrust smack dab into the middle of just about ever major turning point in the Civil Rights movement--he's at the lunch counter in Woolworth's, he's beaten as a Freedom Rider, he just happens to be there when Dr. King is assassinated, he becomes a Black Panther--you name it, ma, and he's there. It's an effective yet unsubtle plot device, I suppose, to give an overview of history, and the events that are portrayed are done so in an effective manner and are a powerful testament to the fundamental courage of those involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the utter hell they went through just to be treated like human beings, but it's too much to be happening to one person when so many individuals were involved. It's just a bit contrived for a serious drama. Also, I found the casting of most of the Presidents to be, well, less than stellar, especially Johnson and Nixon, although the image of LBJ carrying on intense conversations with his staff while sitting on the toilet with the door open was hilarious, because, well, he really did that. I also suppose I have a bit of an issue with the official title of the film: ""Lee Daniel's The Butler"". Really? Could there be a bit of an ego issue here? Even Orson Wells didn't go with ""Orson Wells' Citizen Kane"", and he had an ego that could change the tidal patterns. Everyone knows who directed the film, the work can speak for itself. All in all, though, the film was interesting, well worth watching, and at times a very powerful portrayal of the Civil Rights movement, with a somewhat mixed bag of performances, although Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey were excellent.

butler, who served 8 Presidents, from Eisenhower to Clinton.  Everyone is excellent, but Oprah stands out, and her being ignored
by the Academy leaves me incredulous.  A great cast, and excellent similarities to the real Presidents, add to the realism.  For
teens and young adults, this is an excellent teaching tool, while being an entertaining and engrossing movie.  If you haven't seen

As Oprah attempted both in dialect and decorum, to portray an underprivileged African American wife and mother during an awful time in our history, she came across wealthy actress trying to play a poor person.

In fact, for those of us who lived through the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's during which time racism and apartheid were in full bloom, The Butler is like touching a painful memory and then letting the pain efface in the evolution of human rights which the movie depicts incredibly well. Possibly for someone born decades after which this racial period existed, they might not appreciate the depth to which it inculcated our culture and our lives and possibly even, they will pay more attention to the acting quality or some other irrelevancy, but I can say that this film should be a requirement of all students, all schools, as both a reminder of how we have evolved in the humanities, and how recently this very issue existed and at what cost to the many lives of those brave souls who fought for civil rights. Whitaker deserves an Oscar - his performance was heart wrenching. Oprah was amazing, as were all the others cast as Presidents and significant figures. A must see.",1392940800,,1012,4.659217877094972

The kinds of HORRIBLE things we humans are capable of can be seen clearly in this FICTIONALIZED version of the slave industry. How profoundly sad! Unfortunately, Oprah is seen smoking cigarettes throughout this entire movie. Another FICTION?! At least at the end she was shown wearing an oxygen cannula after having trashed her lungs. Can you imagine Oprah smoking in real life?! But you can easily imagine, as I did, where the influence for this portrayal of a famous person smoking cigarettes came from --- the tobacco industry. And, you can imagine where the tobacco industry has most of their tobacco profits invested. Wasn't tobacco advertising supposed to be illegal? I highly recommend that you watch the movie: ""THANK YOU FOR SMOKING"" in order to get a realistic view as to how tobacco is portrayed in most every movie.
  I tried to reserve ""THE BUTLER"" through my local library, but I discovered that I was ""247"" on the waiting list. I spoke to the library manager about this, and she said that she was going to order some more copies. I then cancelled my reservation and ordered this very popular movie from Amazon.

5947574,5,B00EV4F5TC,"There are many movies that tell us about the history of African-Americans in America. But, not so much of those who are based on someone who lived to tell it. The movie The Butler, was based on the life of Eugene Allen, who had an interesting story to tell. I really loved and appreciated this movie. To me this movie was powerful and meaningful. The director Lee Daniels tells the story of the White House butler, who served eight Presidents over three decades. The movie follows the dramatic changes that occurred in American History. Leading up to Eugene Allen, played by Forest Whitaker, seeing President Obama take office in 2008.
 Forest Whitaker plays Eugene Allen, he reenacts Allens racist trauma that occurs in his childhood, along with a troubled marriage, and a son who is involved with the Black Panthers. Forest Whitakers plays Eugene Allen, renamed Cecil Gaines, and plays him with poise and self-control. Gaines made the Presidents his number one priority. Gaines started working in the fields picking cotton with his father. After, his father was killed, he was taken in as a house butler. Thats when Gaines decides that he had escape if he wanted a better life and he had to leave his mentally ill mother behind. Then after breaking into a pastry shop, he hired by Maynard, the man who caught him eating all the pastries. Maynard taught Gaines all the techniques he need to be a proficient butler. The year Eisenhower was elected, Cecil Gaines was also hired in to the White House. While Gaines is working in the White House, he has a lot of personal things going on in his household. His son became a Black Panther and was fighting in the deep south for equality and rights for black people. Though it all Gaines stayed true to his job. Helping and surviving every President that took office. He sat through many tragedies in life. He never give up on the hope that one day we will have equality. He made it to see a huge change, a black president Barack Obama take office in 2008.
The Butler is a great movie to serve for educational purposes because it shows the struggle in the south but not into too much depth. The director Lee Daniel is best known for two other famous films, Precious and The Paperboy. Unlike those movies The Butler was more restrained and inspired from an article by Wil Haygood in the Washington Post. The directing that took place in this film seemed to be stern. Meaning the actors were advised to become there characters.  It seemed like a lot of background research was down to assist in developing the movie. The actors picked for this movie was a great pick because all their facial expression, tone of voice, and mannerisms matched with emotions of the film. Whenever there was a sad or drama filled scene, the actors tone of voice would change or facial expressions will show their emotions without even saying a word sometimes. Daniels invites the audience into the White House and makes an understanding of the horror and heroism connected with everything else that make America a complicated and interesting place. This movie received several awards including Peoples Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Movie.",1392595200,,3165,4.763205828779599
5947575,2,B00EV4F5TC,"Movie seemed contrived. The movie makes it seem as if every major civil rights advancement of the 2md half of the 20th Century were the result of a conversation between the Butler and The Pres. Also, whoever cast Jane Fonda and Minka Kelly as Frmr. First Ladies Reagan and Kennedy should never be used to cast a movie again.

5947593,2,B00EV4F5TC,"I enjoyed the movie however after I watched the movie I found out a lot of the scenes and characters were not based on a ""true story"". For instance, I would not of ever allowed my mother's role to play a drunk and adulteress if she was not one. Here is the link if you want to know what is true and was is not. [...]
Reason for two stars...was not actually a ""true story"" -- a very puffed up movie and had us believing every bit of it was a true story about this man.",1392595200,,467,3.875
5947594,4,B00EV4F5TC,I thought the acting was very good.  The story was also well written and very powerful.  I was a little disappointed by the end however.,1392595200,,136,4.4
5947595,5,B00EV4F5TC,I was surprised how much this movie moved me.  Having lived through this time it allowed me to view this period from the Black perspective.  Well directed and acted.,1392595200,,165,4.655172413793103
5947596,4,B00EV4F5TC,The movie inspired great respect for Cecil and his son.  It was also a good reminder of how far we've come in terms of civil rights.,1392595200,,132,4.076923076923077
5947597,5,B00EV4F5TC,I like the way the story was told. It shed light on the different ways blacks were treated. In the end everyone was fight for the same thing.,1392595200,,141,4.071428571428571

Watching many scenes was very difficult when watched through the eyes of a parent.  It helps to understand others' perspective. Glad that I saw this.,1392508800,,303,5.02
5947600,4,B00EV4F5TC,I particularly liked this movie because it was balanced - showing the weaknesses on both sides of the races instead of continuing to rate our beautiful black Americans as completely downtrodden.

5947618,5,B00EV4F5TC,"While a depressing subject - not a ""pick me up"" movie - this movie had at least one message which sticks for me.

The movie held the depiction of complex issues due to different points of view from the discriminated on discrimination, civil rights, and the part to be played by the oppressed in an oppressive system: against the grain at all costs or change from the inside by participation.

 Hard to watch given the implications, and wonderfully acted at the same time.",1392422400,,471,4.650602409638554

This is a movie that makes you laugh, makes you cry and lets you ""live"" through decades of change and civil rights legislation in the United States.

5947634,5,B00EV4F5TC,"Although the American Civil War ended in 1865, civil injustice towards African-Americans continued to be an enduring aspect of American life, particularly in the South. Not until the Civil Rights legislation of 1964 was written into law about 100 years after the assassination of President Lincoln could the United States truly boast of being a country where all citizens were truly free or at least regarded as ""equal"" (more or less) by law. The United States for African-Americans was a very different place in 1920 than it became in 1970, a half-century later. This transformation is shown through the eyes and experiences of a butler for the White House, based on the life of Eugene Allen, who was a prominent butler at the US President's residence for 34 years. Allen lived from 1919 to 2008 and was one of the few people who lived long enough to see racial lynchings in the early 20th century and an African-American become president in 2008.

Loosely based on Allen, Cecil Gaines, played by Forest Whitaker in a tour-de-force performance, grew up in the American South where he sees first-hand injustice and racial inequality. He works for a southern plantation and receives an opportunity to work inside the house, as a ""house n-----"". His employment experiences eventually lead to a post at an exclusive club in Washington DC where he is spotted by someone who recruits for the hired help at the White House. He becomes a butler in the residence of the most powerful political figure of the United States. He has a wife, played by Oprah Winfrey, and two sons.

As a parallel story, Gaines' son, Louis, played with equal vitality by David Oyelowo, becomes interested in the Civil Rights movement. While the elder Gaines is forced to steer clear of any kind of political posturing because of his role as a White House employee, his son participates in the demonstrations, sit-ins, the Freedom Riders, and even the Black Panthers. Because of his involvement, the relationship between father and son becomes strained. A large part of the story is not only about Gaines' employment at the White House but about Gaines the elder and Gaines the younger.

On the other front, the elder Gaines learns about the eccentricities, the sensibilities, and even the political mind-sets of several presidents. Although he has been trained to stand in the midst of the president and other heads-of-state as if he is part of the furniture, Gaines cannot help but overhear the political goings-on at the White House. One of the remarkable aspects of Whitaker's performance is his ability to seem strangely detached from his surroundings, and yet through it all, he can't quite escape from having an opinion about his different employers. He is forced because of his employment obligations to resist offering his political opinions, and yet occasionally he is asked for his opinion by some of the presidents he served, which I would guess is probably quite accurate. (As a footnote, the fictional character and the real butler Allen, lived to see the election of Barack Obama in 2008.)

""The Butler"" is one of the best films to date of the 21st century. In addition to Whitaker's masterful performance, many other name actors are in this film, including Robin Williams in a surprisingly on-the-money portrayal of Dwight Eisenhower, John Cusack as Richard Nixon, Liev Schreiber as Lyndon Johnson, Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan, and Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan. Through it all, it's still Whitaker who takes all the way from racial segregation to Barack Obama. This is one best films on the subject of Civil Rights (actually one of the best films period) and not to be missed.",1392422400,,3661,4.938311688311688
5947635,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I thought the actors were outstanding. They played their roles as if they had lived the experience.  It appeared to be an historical fiction.

5947670,5,B00EV4F5TC,How can you not feel the many emotions that pallerell a man of service to the presidents while HS family is fighting their everyday lives and to top it off HS son fighting the freedom bus!,1392163200,,188,4.25
5947671,5,B00EV4F5TC,This was so well done. Loved how he retold his story from childhood until elderly. Gripping. Touches you in ways you would not realize.,1392163200,,135,4.666666666666667

5947673,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I liked it more than I expected to. The acting was great, the characters interesting and multi-dimensional. I didn't totally understand the tension between father and son, I thought it should've been shown more clearly before Louis' involvement in the civil rights movement. Liked the kissing scenes between husband and wife, enjoyed seeing believably imperfect parenting, and their social life - don't see enough of African American family life. It was fun seeing actors/actresses play presidents and their wives, alittle strange and interesting seeing Robin Williams play a president, and I love Vanessa Redgrave. Didn't care for when the Oprah character called her son's love interest a b*tch, in my opinion, filmmakers sling that word around too much. Overall, an ambitious, decent drama. 1/2 star removed for sexist language, 1/2 star removed for N word. My opinion, if the audience doesn't insist on quality entertainment, Hollywood and artists will just keep on serving up racist, sexist and homophobic slurs. As an african american woman I won't pay to see african americans calling one another the N word and as a woman past tired of hearing women call other women b*tch or worse in films; unacceptable.",1392163200,,1212,5.220512820512821

5947675,2,B00EV4F5TC,"For the basic script and acting, I'd give this movie 4 stars.  But I have to lower my rating because of the political agenda woven into the movie.  If you pay close attention, Republican presidents are portrayed as incompetent dunces and the Democrat presidents are glorified.  It's a darn shame that the producer and writers couldn't simply make a more honest movie and leave their political bias out of it.",1392163200,,408,4.8
5947676,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I was excited to watch the movie for the historical aspect of it.  The acting was excellent and the story, for the most part was very good. My only disappointment was the political ""bent"" of the movie - an obvious left tilt, making all Democrats look good and positive toward integration (even LBJ!) while making Republicans look negative - even though history bears the opposite to be true.  The first 2/3 of the movie were excellent - I could have done without the last 1/3!",1392163200,,476,4.588235294117647

5947679,4,B00EV4F5TC,"But I didn't love it, largely because it seemed more interested in making a point than in telling a story. Every last kid in America ought to see it just to know, to remember, not to forget. It's a terrific way to telling a story that needs to be told--no doubt. But I expected more drama and less lecture.

5947681,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I loved it.  Not only did I enjoy the superb acting, I liked the way they included civil rights historical events in a timeline.  There were many stars in the movie.

5947687,3,B00EV4F5TC,"I don't know quite what I expected, but this was not it.  This movie is more hyped than substance.  Forest Whitaker is well cast, but Oprah Winfrey is not.  With another in that part it might have been pulled off.  It's very tame, very laid back and those days were not like that.  The movie has no passion.  Skip it.",1392076800,,317,4.2

Half the movie is Selma, MLK, Berkeley black panthers, and aparteid protests.  I want to see more White House intreague!

People watch this and think Oprah is a great actress, they see that she is charismatic on screen, and are reacting to that.",1392076800,,413,4.602739726027397

I will watch it again because I really enjoyed it the first time but want to watch it over to make sure I caught everything.  Very interesting that this is based on a true story.

5947696,5,B00EV4F5TC,"This film was inspired by true events.  It's about a slave who became the butler in the White House for a bunch of presidential terms.  Let me just start by saying the cast is ridiculous.  Many of the supporting actors are lead actors on other shows, rock stars, or just rule a show like Oprah.  This movie is overflowing with talent, it's crazy.  The film is really about the horrors in American history for the last 80 years as seen through the eyes of Cecil Gaines.  It was an amazing film.  I won't spoil anything but if you are a person that wants to ignore the crimes of crazy white people over the last 80 years this film is not for you.",1391990400,,644,4.229508196721311

Ike:  Commander in Chief of Allied forces or Elmer Fudd?  Nixon:  Auditioning for Cyrano de Bergerac?  Reagan:  A wooden marionette with a British accent?  Speaking of accents, what happened to JFK & LBJ?  And what the heck was Vanessa Redgrave doing?

The generation is full of energy and feel that they have the right to stand for what they believe is right. Even thought the young generation has never been through so much as the older they see the injustice and will not allow themselves to be bullied of pushed around. Most of them are educated people. I love the role the butler played, it shows that no matter how educated you are or not, it shows the integrity of they way you carry yourself. He stood for what he thought was right. He got upset with his son, till the light became bright in his head then he stood with his son and fought for what was really right. I give this movie a 5 because I believe in what it stands for.

It is so predictable that JFK would be the hero and Reagan the villain, but this is from people who cast Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan... really?  The scene where a white southerner murders a man in front of his family, probably could have happened somewhere in the south, but it never happened to a White House butler.  This movie is watchable, but it is NOT a history lesson. The dictionary defines Propaganda as ""information, esp. of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view"".

5947745,4,B00EV4F5TC,"""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" is a highly fictionalized account of the life of Eugene Allen, a black man who served as butler in the White House for 34 years (he was even there to greet the first black president in 2009). It's so highly fictionalized, in fact, that even the character's name has been changed to Cecil Gaines.

Allen - and by proxy, Gaines' - years of service coincided with one of the most volatile periods in the nation's history in terms of civil rights advances. As conceived by screenwriter Danny Strong, Cecil is a near-Zelig (or Forrest Gump, if you prefer)-type character who stands witness to history as a cavalcade of presidents, policy makers, racists, civil rights activists and seminal events go marching by on their way to the future.

Though it has its share of undeniable shortcomings, ""The Butler"" does a couple of things very well. First, it effectively drives home the very real reasons blacks in the pre-civil rights era had for deferring to whites. At a time when even the slightest hint of reproach or of standing up for oneself could result in society-sanctioned death (be it through beating, shooting or lynching), it's understandable that many blacks developed a go-along-to-get-along mentality just to survive.  And that's where the second quality aspect of the movie comes in: the illustration of just how much courage it took for the early ""agitators"" to stand up against the deeply entrenched system of Jim Crow laws that for decades allowed such atrocities to go unpunished. Cecil is caught between the old-school view of not rocking the boat and the new era of radical change in which blacks - along with sympathetic white allies - have begun to assert their right to be treated as equals. This leads to much butting of heads between Cecil and his son, Louis (David Oyelowo), a Freedom Rider who refuses to stand back and wait for change to come incrementally and at the white man's behest, opting instead to take a more proactive role in actualizing his own future - even at the risk of being beaten, imprisoned or even murdered for his efforts. And at what point should non-violent passive resistance yield to violent self-defense and retaliation when the former seems to be yielding few tangible results?

""The Butler"" is at its most compelling when it is dealing with such issues. On the debit side, the movie provides an array of none-too-impressive impersonations of famous people - Robin Williams as Eisenhower,  John Cusack as Nixon, James Marsden as Kennedy, Minka Kelly as Jackie, Liev Schreiber as Johnson, Alan Rickman as Reagan, Jane Fonda as Nancy, Nelsan Ellis as Martin Luther King, Jr. - doubly hampered by less-than-convincing makeup jobs in many of those cases. Moreover, the movie can't entirely avoid that taint of smug self-righteousness that inevitably attaches itself to movies whose main purpose for being is to Do Good. It's particularly egregious in the lugubrious narration delivered by the main character. Yet even that is kept to an acceptable minimum.

Forest Whitaker does well with a role that is too sketchily written at times, for when a character is being called upon to be Everyman, he often emerges as No Man. One often gets the sense that the events that happen to him are less the product of a life being organically lived and more contrivances designed to make him a symbol of the times in which he lived. By its very nature, the schematic nature of the storytelling deprives the man of his much of his individuality, which should definitely not be the case in a movie in which individuality and personhood are at the very core of its message.

Of the supporting performers, it is Oprah Winfrey who makes the deepest mark as Cecil's alcoholic, philandering wife, a woman whose combination of virtues and flaws makes her a convincing, relatable character.  Other well-known faces in the cast include Terrance Howard as her love interest, Vanessa Redgrave as a plantation owner, Maria Carey as Cecil's young mother, Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the White House's chief butler, Clarence Williams III as the man who inspires Cecil to become a butler, and Lenny Kravtiz as a fellow butler at the White House.

For all its flaws, ""The Butler"" ultimately reminds us that it takes both the Cecile Gainses and the Louis Gainses to truly change society. And that's a lesson well worth heeding.",1391817600,,4359,4.8956639566395665

The movie itself should win the Oscar for 2013!  It is an outstanding combination of the life of Cecil Gaines, a black man who comes up from the cotton fields of Georgia and becomes a butler at the White House who becomes well respected by Presidents, staff, and his peers.  It combines an historic background of the Civil Rights Movement in America starting back in the late '50's through the election of Barack Obama.  It is so moving to see (even though I grew up in that era) what the black people continued to go through to become equal citizens of the United States.  It is hard to imagine what you see they had to go through - especially in the South - where most people were merciless in their treatment of the coloreds.  I loved this movie...I saw it and I just bought it because I want to see it again and again!  I just wish more movies of this caliber were being made today.

However, the movie started stuttering and then stopped for several minutes at a time during the ending so it was impossible to watch with any continuity. Very frustrating. I used a ROKU 2 and FIOS fiber optic network so it should not have happened. I'm not sure why it was fine up to the end and we have watched many movie without this problem. They gave us the reset time on $5.95 HD rental so we can watch it later but the weekend was our only movie watching time available on our schedule.

Not really a PG rating-- closer to an R.  Clearly at the time, there was graphic violence, but I wish there was a stronger alert in the beginning.  My feeling is that there was some depth missing.  The butler began to have some means, got married, and had children.  This was not covered in the movie.  It would have given the character more depth, I believe.",1391385600,,530,4.458333333333333

However, this movie bears no resemblance to the butler who, in fact, worked three decades in the White House.  This movie is historical fiction.  It is a Black perspective on the Civil Rights movement, sort of a documentary made more palatable for the movie-going public who are paying to view it.

However, Oprah's performance left me disappointed.  She is a great actress and a personal favorite as a person, but I believe she was poorly directed.  The other problem with this film was the casting of the Presidents and politicians, civil rights leaders, etc...  Other than Robin Williams and Jane Fonder as President Eisenhower and Nancy Reagan, all the others performances were lackluster.  The only reason I gave this film 3 stars was because of Whitakers performance.  Everyone in the media was shocked that this film did not get a single nod from the Oscars.

5947843,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I've tried so often to explain what the concept is that I see in one large flash every time someone mentions their resentment for feeling as if they should be responsible for slavery.  Many whites do not want to address the racial problems today and the attitudes blacks have toward their treatment.  They are just tired, they say, of being required to feel any responsibility for what happened that long ago.  This movie allows you to see the day to day struggles of both blacks and whites, to come to grips with centuries of division.

Every person under 65  or so should see this generational concept of how it comes to be that we have responsibility even if we did nothing to contribute to slavery, to see why blacks feel the weight even today.  Most black Americans had grandparents who went through much of this experience.  Just as my mother felt strongly about the English because of their treatment of her Irish ancestors, these blacks feel much the same.  It is recent in their minds (and continues in many ways) and it is very deeply personal.  Be sure not to miss this one if only for the concept it conveys.",1391212800,,1120,4.56

On the bright side, the power of the human spirit to cope with and overcome difficulty, adversity, and circumstances over which one has no control was uplifting and encouraging.

I am not a bigot and I believe we all should have the same rights and I am well aware that this country is still filled with hate for others but this film didn't help change that nor will it.

You get the feeling that every big name in Hollywood lined up to act in this movie, it's a chance to state their feelings on racism however it fell flat. While Precious stood on it's acting, The Butler was more about who is in the movie then what they were saying.

Robin Williams was gosh awful as Eisenhower and Alan Rickman was no Ronald Reagan. Oprah played a cheating drunk black woman with little effort. Forest Whitaker was sad in the sad parts and happy in the happy parts.

However, I think it should have slowed down a bit instead of trying to cover so much of the historical milestones. For instance, considering how awful the white guy who recommended him treated him once he became a butler, the movie never follows through on the part where he is told that the President will speak to him on the matter of wage discrimination. I for one, wanted to see him fired or at least be forced to comply with doing the right thing.

I love anything connected to history and I knew this movie would hit the major events in the civil rights movement in our nation through the prospective of ""The Butler"".  Maybe it's just me but I felt like Oprah drew away from the story being who she IS... a bigger than life celebrity.  I found myself watching her in the scenes and not believing her in the part... it didn't ring true to me.  That being said, I did think that Forest Whitaker was good in the role but perhaps too old an actor for the time period where he is supposedly in his twenties and early to mid thirties.  He's like 52 isn't he?  It's easier to make a younger actor look older through talented makeup people than to make an older actor look young.  I also, had that issue with Oprah in the scenes where she was supposedly younger as she's nearly sixty now.  I think it would have served the telling of the story better if the leads would have been less known actors.  3 stars out of five still has me thinking that the story had merit and needed to be told.",1391040000,,1123,4.234741784037559

Not because of the color of his skin but because of his values and how they differ from mine. I think many people voted for Obama just because of the color of his skin-this is racist.",1391040000,9,441,4.325301204819277

I never witnessed the kind of treatment seen early in the movie on the farm, but I know it took place.  The acting, pace, photography, and direction are such that the viewer feels as if he is walking through this story right along with the characters.  Forest Whitaker is always a joy to watch, but all the others were wonderful as well, including Oprah.  Is there anything she can't do?

The primary characters acting was very good. We all laughed though at who portrayed the different presidents.  Robin Williams as Eisenhower lol. Still he did it seriously, but him with a comb over made all of us smile. But what was the best part was, for the first time my kids understood and felt empathy for how blacks were treated in the past and why Obama becoming president was such a big deal to the African-American community and the white community who also fought for civil rights and voting rights. And we talked after the movie about how the voting rights of ALL Americans is a war that is still being fought in some states today.",1391040000,,782,4.430555555555555

5947887,2,B00EV4F5TC,"Wooden acting. Poor direction. Oprah looks miscast at age 59-60. Whitaker's performance was okay, but there was little chemistry between him and his wife, played by Oprah.

Lots of hype for this one, but clearly over-rated. Twelves Years a Slave was excellent, in comparison.

No Oscar for The Butler",1391040000,,300,5.1020408163265305
5947888,3,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler tells the story of a White House butler who served eight American presidents over three decades. The film traces the dramatic changes that swept American society during this time, from the civil rights movement to Vietnam and beyond, and how those changes affected this man's life and family. Forest Whitaker stars as the butler with wife, Gloria, Oprah Winfrey, and many more. Academy Award nominated Lee Daniels (Precious) directs and co-wrote the script with Emmy-award winning Danny Strong (Game Change).

The Butler may have virtually very little in common with its real life inspiration, White House butler Gene Allen, except for the fact that the main character of the film and Allen were both black butlers in the White House.

Historical inaccuracies aside, The Butler may have been a more tolerable movie if it could have rang more authentically true. Peculiarities of the film's accuracy are most bizarre in portraying President Ronald Reagan as mailing money in ""secret"" to those who wrote him of their hardships yet he was in opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa. The son's Black Panther girlfriend YaYa DaCosta is always socially appropriate, but at a first meeting with his parents she because classless and rude? And various shots show the 1st thing written on the Black Panther manifesto is about being polite. The father doesn't approve of his son's activism, yet he is depicted as so loyal to the White House code of secrecy that he does not warn his son that the president is talking about completely annihilating everyone in his militant political party. But then the father is offended by him and his wife being treated well at a White House dinner? Kill his son, okay; treat him and his wife to dinner, causes him to rethink his entire 50 years of loyalty.

Its all-star cast is its blessing and its curse. Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower, John Cusack as Richard Nixon, Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan, James Marsden as John F. Kennedy, Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson, and many more. It's cursed in having so many stars that it gets in the way of allowing its story to be told without distraction of a star that apparently was cast merely because they are a star. Mariah Carey worked well as a social worker in ""Precious"" but here, her in the cotton fields was so distracting on so many levels.

When the all-star cast is a blessing, when a star's strong performance overcomes an uneven narrative. As Cecil's wife, Gloria, Oprah Winfrey gives the film's most layered performance. She's nuanced as she battles an alcohol addiction, struggles with guilt over an affair (Terrence Howard), and mediates a fractured family.

Lee Daniels' The Butler is an ambitious attempt at a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of normal black Americans and the civil rights movement. The movie negates itself by so much time showing both sides of the black conscious yelling and fighting each other and not coming together until its viewer may be too fed up to care anymore.",1391040000,,3025,4.923529411764706

5947892,5,B00EV4F5TC,Why was this movie snubbed?.  My husband and I watched this movie last night.  We did not want to pause the movie to go get a drink of water or anything.  We even cried thru it especially at the end.  The acting by all characters especially Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker was outstanding. We both lived thru the civil rights movement and my husband served in Vietnam. We both thought the movie portrayed this era very well. This is one the best movies to portray that era and the views from that administration and the colored community during that time,1391040000,,556,4.53

I was taken aback by the events that happened to the main character as he started life. I was itreaged at how that played out throughout the film and how it effected his relationships.  There were many historical, racial, and generational points highlighted by the events depicted in this film.
All the characters were played well and the actors did a good job of brining them to life.  I would have given this more stars but there were parts of the film that stopped drawing you in and instead somehow made you just a spectator.  I believe this error lies more with post production than the actors themselves.  Overall a good movie and a good movie for families to start conversations about what has happened in the past as well as how we can better work to ensure we don't repeat the past as a nation and a people.",1390953600,,959,4.420454545454546

5947905,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Other than sci-fi and outright fantasy, there are probably few movies that one can't argue were based on someone's true story somewhere.  It's rather misleading to imply that much in this film actually happened, which is my common gripe about films ""based on a true story.""

That being said, as a work of fiction, it's not a bad movie at all.  As another reviewer mentioned, it certainly demands a comparison to Forrest Gump in that either the title character or his family were directly or indirectly involved in virtually every major event that took place since 1960.  But hey, Forest Whitaker can really do no wrong, and if viewed as the fictional movie that it is, it's an interesting look at recent history.",1390953600,,712,4.764227642276423

I think it could have just as well been a documentary. I love Oprah but I couldn't see her in this part & I really didn't care for Forest Whitaker (a great actor) I think because I have read so much that this went from one thing to another too fast. I didn't think the Presidents resembled who they were supposed to be. I know a person who belongs to SAG & he thought it was just great. So it could have just been me. I would not say don't watch it especially younger people who were not alive when all this happened they should see how life was back then. But, for me I have seen & read much better accounts of all this. I do have to say this is based on a true story & one has to give this Butler credit for rising to the position he did when there were so few opportunities for the African American back then, which I am ashamed how racist the South was (not only the South) We have come a long way but there is still racism in this country & that is truly sad.",1390953600,,1109,3.8898678414096914

History will prove whose platforms were in effect successful and those who were not.  A more diligent study of the event however will reveal that to those who put forth the effort.  Over all my appetite was tempered to learn more about the civil rights movement.  Maybe someone will make a movie with an accurate description of Reagan's successful dismantling of the pox of Communism, which most of his decision making while in office was based on.

I enjoyed the performances of both stars and supporting cast and some of the scenes, particularly the family llfe and the conflicts that arise simply due to the family dynamic and not because of the father's now famous job at the White House. The problems in this movie arise out of the a series of odd choices from the casting of the various presidents to the magical civil rights journey of the eldest son. I found myself unprepared for the license the director took with history and the stories of the individuals and was left unsatisfied with the mish mash that resulted.

The brief encounters with the presidents were shallow and predictable. There was nothing lovely about this film: no memorable music, scenery, profound dialog, depth of character, or beauty. Oprah played stereotypical sloppy, alcoholic housewife with no apparent interests of her own.

Instead it focused on more trivial matters with only 4 or 5 brief connections of what was happening in the real world. Racial prejudice should have been more in focus, but instead we were given the racial tension of his father death and mothers rape and mainly his family.  The 5 close-ups of Opra's behind did nothing for  the movie or to honor a great actress.
  The presidents he served added more to the fight for racial equality than the Freedom Bus and Black Panther involvement with those organizations.  I wanted to know why Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker) never put a bug in the presidents ear to help racial discrimination within the White House for promotions, pay increases and help for Cecil Gaines and his family. This BOTHERED ME perhaps only because I am an outsider. Surely Ceicil could have gotten more pay from hundreds of status seeking rich people for the bragging rights to have the Presidents head butler on their staff.

The movie tries to do way too much! I couldn't believe it when the son (who manages to participate in nearly every episode of the civil rights movement, from segregating lunch counters to taking part in the freedom rides) ends up becoming a Black Panther, brings Angela Davis (!) home for dinner, then quits the Panthers when he ""realizes"" they condone violence. I'm surprised he never refused to give up his bus seat for a white person! Or was mysteriously in the background during MLK's assassination! The main character (the butler) is the accidental ""confidant"" of several presidents, which is impossible to believe. It's just, sadly, completely ridiculous. And the casting (John Cusack as Nixon??!!) is often WAY off. Serious waste of money. If you want a decent film about civil rights, better stick to PBS.",1390608000,,981,4.951515151515151
5948020,1,B00EV4F5TC,"'If you want to send a message use Western Union,' is a Hollywood cliche that applies to this misbegotten project. There's enough material here to make a fascinating TV miniseries but it was butchered to fit a 2 hour movie format and, I presume, hit theatres before the 2012 Presidential election.

There are no human beings in this movie, merely stereotypes. Every black character is a victim and every white a racist. Aml Ameen, who plays Cecil Gains as a late teenager, bears little resemblance to Forrest Whitaker, who plays him as a mature man. Suddenly Cecil Gains looks, talks and acts completely differently and we are supposed to accept that he is the same person. I suspect Forrest Whitaker thought it wasn't worth wasting his considerable acting chops on this lousy script because he phones it in.

Oprah Winfrey, on the other hand, is embarrassingly over the top. Especially, when she becomes an old woman and starts talking and acting completely differently than she did, ten minutes earlier, when she was middle aged. It wasn't a character, it was a caricature.

The message of this movie is that America is a racist society, but Lee Daniels manages to dis blacks as well as whites. Every scene at the Gains' home is loud, raucous, and grossly sexual. There is not one admirable character, black or white.  Even the ""freedom riders"" are angry young hotheads or well-meaning airheads who have no idea what they are getting into.

But the grossest caricatures are the various Presidents who bear no resemblance to the historical figures they are based on. Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon - are like muppets. Colourless muppets.

Visually the movie is equally drab. It looks like it was shot on an iphone. Ordinarily when a movie is this bad I give up on in long before the closing credits, but I didn't want to be ""racist"" so I forced myself to witness this entire travesty.

Just as with LEE DANIELS' PRECIOUS, referring to this film as LEE DANIELS' THE BUTLER (when his successful films THE PAPER BOY and SHADOWBOXER did not bear is name on the marquee) makes the viewer question the concept of promoting the film. There likely is an answer to the question of why the name addition to the title, but that is another story.

Likely most everyone has seen this film by now, now that the awards buzz have subsided and the film is available on television on demand so a summary of the film can be short: based on a `true story' in name, the film shares the life of one Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker) from a Southern sharecropper's son who witnessed the racist murder of this father and the mind altering rape of his mother and fled the cotton fields to become a servant - first in hotels and subsequently as a White House butler for some thirty odd years. His family life with alcoholic wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and two sons reflects the black struggles from the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers, the loss of a son in the Vietnam conflict, up to the crowning glory of the inauguration of a black President. The progress is captured in vignettes that while not always clearly defined, are heart wrenching.

For some strange reason, perhaps out of respect for Daniels' courage in presenting American black history, the cast is brimming over with tiny bit parts that use famous actors: Vanessa Redgrave, Mariah Carey, Alex Pettyfer, Terrence Howard, Robin Williams, John Cusack, James Marsden, Live Schreiber, Alan Rickman, Jane Fonda, etc who rarely give the impression of the famous people they are enacting. The remainder of the large cast is good (David Oyelowo, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Lenny Kravitz, et al). But somehow despite the impact of watching the events in this country's finally coming to grips with human rights and racism, the film as a film feels shallow - all parade and no circus. And maybe that is because the racist issue remains incompletely resolved. Grady Harp, January 14",1390608000,,2142,4.786486486486487

5948029,1,B00EV4F5TC,"I love biopics when they are truly biographical, and not mostly fiction in the many ways this movie is. Numerous reviews and articles have pointed out the many inaccuracies. The real Butler was born in Virginia, not Georgia; his parents never experienced the cotton-field scene shown in the movie, his son was no activist but rather worked as an investigator for the State Department. Reagan did invite the real butler to a state dinner, but Obama did not invite him to a private meeting at the White House, and so on.

Even so, one might be able to get past the overly fictionalized story but for two problems - some profoundly bad acting and some ponderously partisan political ""messaging."" Where are the Kennedy and Johnson who united against Eisenhower's civil rights act (the first since Reconstruction days) and had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the civil rights era? Not here. The obvious attempt to vilify Reagan - who by all accounts treated all people the same, be they butler or statesman, and who agitated for more of a role for African-Americans in Hollywood long before it was chic - is way over the top and takes much out of context.

Forest Whitaker and Cuba Gooding, Jr. are always great and their work in this film is no exception. The rest of the cast is hideously bad and/or ill-cast (if one wants to give them the benefit of the doubt.) This movie makes it clear that Winfrey's great acting in The Color Purple was a flash in the pan.

For a much better vision of life at the White House, try ""Backstairs at the White House"". It was much better done, had more meat to the stories and was far better acted.",1390521600,126,1637,4.580204778156997

Kids totally confused due to the shallow treatment of historic events.  The Black Panthers were represented as a social service group like the Rotary.  How would teenagers know why the mother (Oprah) kicked them out of the house.  As for Oprah, no wonder she was not nominated for an Academy Award.  There was no acting whatsoever.  As my girls said; she drank, smoked, and danced. It was as if she was looking at the clock to see how long it would be until she was finished. They wanted to know why the butler was invited to a White House dinner.  Told them it seemed implausible to me; husband stated Reagan was eccentric.  At any rate, I could not imagine Nancy being happy to see him there, even if she was played by Jane.  Vietnam War coverage was a scene where the butler received a death notice for his son.

Forrest Gump worked, because it was a comedy, which is why a serious movie such as ""The Butler"" did not.  At the end of the movie, I left not knowing very much about the real person inside the butler's exterior.  I also have to wonder at Forest Whitaker's stilted, painful performance.  Whitaker is a gifted actor, who has turned in stellar performances, and because of that, I blame the director.  In clear contrast to Whitaker's, Oprah Winfrey's performance was nuanced and compelling, as were Cuba Gooding Jr.'s, Terrance Howard's, and a host of other well-known actors'.

Eugene didn't have two sons either, he had one who was not anything like the sons in this movie. The acting is good in the movie though. It's too bad they made so many of the American Presidents look like morons and they portray the Black Panthers as gentle nice folks, ummm yeah right. I would say this movie is a so-so movie. It's an interesting, although filled with false information, look at the struggle of African-Americans from a very liberal view point that is influenced with hate and resentment towards Caucasian-Americans and the ""haves and have nots"". The movie went a bit over the top in stressing it's point about the struggles African-Americans have gone through, but it still is an interesting film to watch from a political science study standpoint.

Unheralded was the make-up crew who managed to rather convincingly make the actors go from early twenties to their geriatric years, but overall this was a Hollywood travesty purporting to portray an extremely important period of American transition, but doing it so poorly that it is an embarrassment.  Almost totally devoid of appropriate context, the screenplay ignores the Cold-War, lightly brushes any Vietnam overlay or the baby-boomer upheaval and simply portrays a legitimate, albeit extremely unimaginatively done (except for the historical fabrications), civil-rights movement with only a passing glance at the groundwork of Brown v. Board.  The presidents are merely caricatures, and it becomes apparent even the director must have eventually realized they were largely unrecognizable, inserting documentary style sub-scripts so the viewer can help get their bearings.

The script is strongly worded and bigots will probably have a field day with it: loving or hating it depending on which side their bigotry finds them.  A bit of revisionist history in parts and not a total waste of time, but a disconcerting waste of money at retail prices  wait for the bargain rack.

the important thing is the movie lacked transitions. It jumped very fast from childhood, then a childhood server in the master's house, then he ran away as a young man ( age ?? how many years later? ?)  his job as a hotel butler, then to Washington and then fast forward to a wife - Oprah along with teenage kids and a nice house.  She just appeared and I had to assume she was the wife - So like I said lot of leaps on his timeline with no explanation. . This must of been a book because it I was a little confused with the storyline until he made it to the white house. I watched for a little while and then lost interest. I wanted to like it, a lot but got bored. I plan to go back and watch it sometime. I think it would of helped if I already knew the story.",1390348800,,887,4.005649717514125

The scene with the protestors in the Woolworth's store was startlingly true to life, I lived through that as a little girl, was in a Woolworth's when protestors came in, it was frightening how everyone responded. Other than that and a few other isolated instances, the story felt contrived, heavy and sorry Oprah, but it seemed as though a role was pumped up just so she could play it. The characters were not well-drawn and their motivations were left unexplained with the exception of the Butler's eldest son, whose motives were crystal clear. Forest Whitaker did an admirable job with what he had to work with, but for my money the script was weak and saggy.

This review is strickly on the movie by Lee Daniels. I thought the movie was exceptional, I loved the way the movie began and the way it ended. Whitaker and Winfrey were amazing together!

The Butler was born in the fields, he watched his Father gunned down at a early age. After a run in with a well to do butler that trained and motivated him, he was sent to the White House to serve the elite. His positive attitude and his passion to perform his job exceedingly well, made him the most popular butler of 8 consecutive presidents. I found it amazing that he was able to ignore the racism and the foolery that the white men boast about during his presence, yet he kept a smile on his face and did his job.

Very good movie!",1390348800,,751,4.201388888888889
5948110,4,B00EV4F5TC,It was an amazing performance by Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. The story of a butler serving through the stay of several Presidents has been well told and played.,1390348800,,167,4.793103448275862

I am not an Obama fan but I understand the excitement people of color had at his election.

Additionally, Iam not educated on the story, but the plot line of ""The Butler"" son seemed a little too Forest Gump to me. He was really involved in all of that?

On the otherhand, I thought Forest Whittaker was great (as usual) and found the interaction with the various president interesting.

Maybe if they had made it a 3 hour movie and let the characters and situations developed more (and not trying to hire big name actors for all parts!) I would have better enjoyed.",1390348800,,687,4.436507936507937

The movie was all about the civil rights movement and very little about the Butler. The movie was very slanted. Did not show the Republican Presidents fairly, especially Ronald Reagan. Made Reagan look like a racist because he would not support sanctions in South Africa, when in fact Reagan feared sanctions would cause the people of South Africa to suffer and not resolve any issues. The Director or Producers would not allow Reagan to express why he would veto a sanction bill. The movie was just a build up to glorify Obama.",1390348800,5,677,4.512195121951219

5948142,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I liked this movie.  It was well acted and a sobering reminder of how things were, and still are, to some degree, in this country.  There was a little ""Forrest Gump"" vibe to it, with the obvious exception that The Butler is at least based on a real person who was around real people and events.  There really are people who have seen more than their expected share of history up close, but Gump has ruined that story forever.  The Butler works on the viewer's emotions a lot.  Sometimes its pull on the heartstrings is a little too forced.  Overall, this is a good, mostly true story that forces us to confront our nation's history of race relations in the context of its effects on real people.  The juxtaposition of our own civil rights history with our government's (the Reagan administration's) attitude toward apartheid in South Africa is very disturbing.  Hard to believe we treated Nelson Mandela as the bad guy in those days.",1390262400,,933,4.646341463414634

I would recommend this movie, though, for young people who haven't had the opportunity to live through the Civil Rights Movement.  For this purpose, this would be a good teaching tool for history classes.

In short, this movie was worth seeing, but I wish I'd waited until I could get it free elsewhere.  For my own personal entertainment value, I found it lacking.",1390262400,,614,4.710280373831775

But Lee Daniels pulls it off with a deft, if sentimental, handThat man,Cecil Gaines was born on a cotton farm where he witnessed his father shot by a white foreman and his mother's mental deterioration. He is trained by the farms owner played by Vanessa Redgrave to serve in the house. Cecil played so well by Forest Whittaker, goes on to work in a top D.C. Hotel where he is recruited as a butler by the White House. His fun loving hard drinking wife wife is played by Oprah Winfrey so well that I at least forgot she was Oprah and was only her character which must be hard for such a cultural icon. As Cecil's son joins the burgeoning civil rights movement they lock horns, Cecil is from the old school and doesn't believe in rocking the boat. They eventually part ways. Cecil is eventually invited by the horrible Reagan's to a state dinner as a token black and what should be a momentous occasion is a humiliation. He finally sees civil rights through his son's eyes and meets up with him at a protest of one of Reagan's biggest shames the support of South Africa's pro apartheid government. Cecil lives to see the election of Obama, and is honored with a meeting. There are so many wonderful actors making an appearance in this from Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan, to Minka Kelly uncanny as Jackie Kennedy.

Forrest Whitaker does his best with an overwrought script.  There is nothing understated  here... all in your face, all the time.  The plot is disjointed and the direction heavy handed.

5948165,3,B00EV4F5TC,"A wonderful movie for the first 90% - showing the story of a man's development in the context of cultural racism and the blossoming civil rights movement. Robin Williams as Eisenhower is a stretch, but Whitaker and Winfrey do a nice job through a variety of scenes. The movie overreaches by extending the story to the election of Obama - it almost felt forced and manufactured. The rise of Obama as an ultimate manifestation of the civil rights era is obvious, and too recent to fit with the narrative of this film. Would have been better had they stopped during the Reagan era.",1390262400,,578,4.621359223300971

I told the parents of my great nieces and nephews to remind them it is a movie and purchase more historically correct documentary information on the times for them. I had a physical reaction to the story recalling how I felt then. I was determined to see the movie on TV and not in the theater. After watching it I bought the DVD for my video library. I probably won't be able to watch it again for a while.

I feel that the film is thought provoking because the movie covers a period of time when I was alive yet too young to really know what was going on around me.  I am always surprised to think of how short of a time has passed between the Civil Rights struggle of the time period and the present times.  I know the struggle goes on . . .

Many accurate events mixed in with a lot of inaccurate events creates a new vision, but the vision we are witnessing is through the eyes of Mr. Gaines.  Unfortunately, I don't believe that everyone is going to walk away realizing that this is a work of fiction, and in that case the movie creates a very divisive experience.

The glaring ignorance and cruelty of racism is juxtaposed against the service of a White House butler subtly played by Mr. Whitaker in a bravura performance.  Oprah Winfrey delivers a tour de force as his humanly imperfect but loving wife.  Every aspect of this film is in sync from script to music.  The film pulls no punches portraying the heinous and vindictive nature of Southern white dominated society.  The film is painful but utterly compelling from its first frame to closing titles.

5948230,4,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler tells the story of Cecil Gaines who served eight presidents during his tenure as a butler at the White House, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and other major events affect this man's life, family, and American society.

Although this movie is loosely based on the real long term serving butler in the white house, the director mostly uses that story as a backdrop to the real events throughout the history of American events that occurred in his tenure. Whitaker does an outstanding job in the role and for the most part there are some great supporting roles although some curious choices for presidential roles such as John Cusack as Nixon, which I found not as effective as others that have played Nixon. Although the movie is a bit slow at times especially when portraying the Butlers home life, however the woven tale of the son with the Black Panther's movement made that a bit more interesting.

Overall, the historic story, although somewhat fictionalized a bit, does a good job at showing some of the major events in history. Maybe a bit too long but interesting and entertaining with a good backstory and worth watching",1390089600,,1143,4.826530612244898

Movie was emotional at parts, done well in some parts, and done poorly in others.  It came together as more of an amateur attempt at one sided version of history, but that's the point - It's about the Butler's View.  Unfortunately the end showed our current president, ignoring all of the horrible, murderous, invasive and anti-freedom acts he has committed.  Of all the wonderful, good black men in this country, why on earth did Obama have to be the one to get elected and turn tyrant on our nation?  He duped us all.  The irony of this movie is that Obama has been the least transparent, most oppressive president in our lifetimes... yet this movie celebrates him as if he's the crown jewel of black history.

5948237,4,B00EV4F5TC,"A Good Movie Great cast , excellent acting . But but full of Inaccuracies . The film departs from the facts of Allen's life and by the way he had only one son  not two . The central character, ""Cecil Gaines"", is only loosely based on the real  Mr Gene  Allen, . Conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro stated that departures from the facts of Allen's life slant the film's portrayal of history: ""There is no question that the film itself is full of historical inaccuracies. The Butler has virtually nothing in common with its source material, the life of White House butler Gene Allen, except for the fact that the main character of the film and Allen were both black butlers in the White House.""  I fear Oprah had her hand  in certain scenes  influencing  certain political issues and trying to overstate certain things especially praising her idol hero Pres Obama  .  I  also find  it interesting that the portrayal of Ronald Reagan as a racist against South Africa was totaly untrue . Yes Apartheid is wrong  however it was a cold war issue at the time  that was the concern as most countries in the region like Angola and the Congo were backed by Communist Russia and Cuba at the time . So Reagan did not want instability in the region  as for what it was South Africa was a democracy and ally in the region .",1390089600,8,1320,4.491596638655462

When Nancy Reagan invites the butler and his wife to the state party the butler believes its for political reasons and not because she likes him. I wonder if Kennedy invited him instead if he would of had the same feeling. I mean come on really? Martin Luther King was a republican. This was affirmed by Dr. Alveda C. King- Niece of MLK. Anyway this movie would of got 5 stars if the political favoritism was left out. I am so sick of the political bashing. I just want a real story. Hotel Rwanda shows a real hero who saved so many lives. The movie won many awards. Ofcourse even though it was nominated for an academy they didn't win. Probably because of Rwanda's dislike of Clinton. The Butler was not done in good taste as to show the real struggles of the civil rights era. The real tragedies. The real people. I believe the civil rights era had many passionate people. And I hope to one day see a civil rights movie done with passion just like Hotel Rwanda was done. Show me hero's. People who fought.

5948270,3,B00EV4F5TC,"If it were not for the strong performance of Forest Whitaker, I could not have watched this in its entirety. What gave this film some legs was his performance and the moving relationship the fictional Mr. Gaines had with his sons and wife. Mainly, the scenes with his older son who, we are led to believe, not only became a Freedom Rider, but a Black Panther and Mandela advocate in the ensuing decades. All this had some weight and believability--but the lunch counter scenes where a group of random crackers spitting, humiliating, the good, noble protesters was a bit much for me. In such cases, the cops would have been called in immediately. But like Mr. McQueen in his TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE (which is a far better film)--it's almost with a perverse delight to have these scenes of just how sadistic Whitie was to the good, noble, Black man taken to its fullest extreme.

The opening scene, where I really did not know which century I was in, where a ""Plantation"" owner rapes the good, noble, Mullotto mother of the butler character, and then kills his father for no reason was really way over the top. 1930's Georgia? I don't think so. More like 1830's. And if such a thing occurred, the sadistic Whitie would have gone to jail. Sorry, but it was insult to my intelligence.

What became amusing, though, were the ridiculous scenes with all of these presidents. Just as Mr. Gaines enters the Oval Office, take your pick president, is discussing some aspect of civil rights. It really reminded me of the fable, Forest Gump--which I thought was silly beyond imagining, but in that film you knew it was a fable. Here, Mr. Daniels seems quite serious about having us take all this to be the truth and nothing but. And it borders on the ridiculous.  Loved the performances of the actors, mainly, the black characters, and the story of the main character's familial relations kept me engaged and even moved.",1390003200,,1904,4.677611940298507

5948283,2,B00EV4F5TC,"I am not one who considers Lee Daniels a competent filmmaker.  I know that he has an Oscar nomination for his direction of Precious (a film that I personally think was pulled back from greatness thanks in large part to Daniels shoddy direction) but at the end of the day, this is about personal taste, and while he seems to have a way with actors he really doesnt understand film composition very well.  All of his films (that Ive seen) suffer in the very basic way they are constructed, feeling unfocused from start to finish.  He has some ideas that could work, but they would need a skilled filmmaker to give them the heft they need to make a real impact and not feel like a poorly executed gimmick.

Oh, where do I begin?

The Butler, or more exactly, Lee Daniels The Butler (the title is already pretentious) tells the true story of Cecil Gaines, although the REAL Cecil Gaines was not really named Cecil Gaines and so immediately it gets you wondering how much of this is true and not exaggerated in order to make this mans life feel more relevant than it really was.  Cecil grew up on a cotton farm, which was all he knew (as we are told, quite unnecessarily, by Forest Whitaker in voiceover), until his father was shot dead and his mother went crazy and he was brought inside the home to learn how to serve.  Then he grows up and leaves (Why wasn't this explained better?  Was his family slaves?  Were they mere workers?  If they were workers then WHY did they put up with what they did and why did their employers get away with what they did, and if they were slaves then how could he just walk away from it all?).  He gets a job, a wife and eventually a big opportunity; to serve as a butler in the White House.

Hes there for thirty years, and in the process becomes the Forrest Gump of the Washington D.C., observing the goings on of term after term and President after President and subtle affecting things in the process.

Maybe too subtly.

A major problem with Lee Daniels The Butler is that Cecil Gaines is a very boring character to play.  I understand that the man is repressed for a reason, trained and taught to be invisible (they make sure we are aware of this) but those characters are rarely interesting to watch unless the actor in the role knows how to emote tremendously through the eyes.  There are actors who have taken on these roles and sung, but Whitaker doesnt do too well.  It doesnt help him that the makeup department makes his face look like it is literally melting about halfway through, which is a true distraction.  In fact, Cecil is the least interesting aspect of this film, and the fact that he is supposed to carry it on his shoulders is a shame.  I would have much rather had the film solely focus on his son, Louis (a tremendous performance by David Oyelowo, who really deserved a better film), who has a real arc and develops such a well-rounded character throughout this film.

But hes the only one, which is unfortunate.  There are so many characters who seemingly have key roles (all those Presidents) and yet they are given such little screen time in order to develop those roles.  Each President is given MAYBE four minutes of screen time and most of which is degraded in moments of nothing.  We see Eisenhower paint, Nixon yell, Kennedy introduce his family, Johnson poop and Reagan eat dinner.  This great cast of characters (and actors) is given NOTHING to do.  Sure, they aren't the main characters, and so we shouldnt expect them to take over, but the film never develops much on the home front either (outside of some sparsely brushed clichs) and with all the jumping from alcoholic Oprah to some random President to Louiss personal journey then back to Oprah, the film never finds needed footing to develop a complete story.

And don't even get me started on the films ridiculously tacked on Obama fueled finale.

I want to say this; I understand that this film was using Cecils position in the White House to chronicle the Black power movement and the change the country as a whole has undergone with regards to the treatment of African Americans, but that ending just feltforced.  It took the film out of itself and gave it this air of trying way too hard, which is weird because up till that point I was convinced the film wasn't really trying much at all.

The ensemble is huge, but there are only a few actors who have a chance to make an impression, and even fewer who make a good one.  As I mentioned, Oyelowo is clearly the best in show here.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is hilarious, but is only there to make us laugh.  Oprah delivers a fine performance, but she oversells in key moments (that slap) and comes off like a Soap Opera actress.  Yaya Alafia is pretty good, but her final scenes (with the Black Panthers) are ill-played.  And then there is Whitaker, who is just there.

I cant recommend this.  It had promise, and the story told is one that is important, but there is so much going on here that nothing gets the proper treatment and the whole thing just feels like message film without a message.

This would have worked better as a television mini-series.",1389916800,3,5127,4.497840172786177

We learn so much of what was happening in our country at that time plus a little about the personalities of our leaders.  The part with LBJ sitting on the toilet giving orders was the real winner.  The writers of this movie carefully selected their material to present many years events in a short time. I graduated from high school in '66 so watching this movie was one flashback after another.  It is absolutely - absolutely - worth everyone's time to view!  (I thought Oprah did ok in her acting but sometimes it was a little flat).,1389830400,,650,4.521367521367521

I used the movie in my Sociology and Multicultural Issues class at Community College.

It really covered all the major events of that time without being maudlin. Oprah did an excellent job, and hopefully will get the Oscar for best actress, as did Forrest and the other cast members. This work has all the heart and soul of a  ""best picture"" Oscar winner: a great message of human triumph over struggle, realistic family dynamics, a good sense of history, a great screenplay, good acting, directing, and a good ending.

Africa were not correctly portrayed. In short, this movie is designed to make the black populace of America forget the loss of their jobs, the loss of their insurance, and remember why they voted for Obama in the first place.

But the people you grow to know and love, whose relations you deeply care about are those of Mr. Daniel's own family. Oscar worthy performances by Forrest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, with surprisingly spot-on cameos by many well known Hollywood stars including Jane Fonda, Robin Williams, John Cusack, Cuba Gooding,Jr. and a great supporting role by Clarence Williams III. Center stage in what becomes a family's saga is how everyone; individuals from Presidents, mothers, fathers, college students, legislators, and their children dealt with the still unresolved problems of Civil Rights at home and abroad. This film grabs your attention, heart, mind, and soul, from start to finish as you cannot help but be pulled through its open door into the times of Lee Daniels, The Butler.

5948348,3,B00EV4F5TC,"""You hear nothing, you see nothing, you only serve."" Cecil Gaines (Whitaker) was a young sharecropper when he lost his father. He becomes a domestic servant for the family that owns the plantation. His skill at that position leads him to become a butler at the White House, a job he keeps for 30 years. During this time he watches the Civil Rights movement unfold with his son in the middle of it all. I was pretty excited about this movie because not only am I a huge history buff but also love bio-pics and movies based on true stories. While 90% of the movie never really happened that's not the reason why I was disappointed. The thing that really bothered me was Cecil himself. Even though he was a great servant to Presidents he wasn't a good family man and never supported his son at all. That really bothered me and because of that I found it really hard to like the character. When you don't like the main character it's hard to really enjoy the movie. I'm not saying it's bad because it is worth watching but I was disappointed while watching this. Not that it matters to the enjoyment of the movie but about 90% of the movie didn't really happen the way they said it did either.

It is a shame too because I bet the real story would have been even more worth telling.  I hope he is getting royalties because this director used him as a tool to forth an agenda.

It appears every time a change was needed the ""butler"" gave his point of view of the black community.  However is does not discredit the acting in the movie great job by the entire cast.

Also on another note.  This movie also show what the people from the past had to go through to be where we are today.  I'm not say things are the best but they are better.  Slavery is just one of the horrible events America has created and you saw the movie Lincoln when slavery ended he said it would be still used for imprisonment.  So all you criminals when are sentenced to do time 5,10,20,and life you are a slave.  But we are all slaves to something, most of us are slaves to the dollar.  We all would like a better life for us, kids, and future family.  I am one too but there is a point you must not cross that is selling your soul.  But in the era of life we sell anything for dollar.  For those who agree with what Im saying then you should stop selling your soul on social media.  Just like our past families and historians fought for slavery.  There was a fight for the right of privacy, i guess i don't understand why would you want to put little thing you do for the world to see.

5948382,1,B00EV4F5TC,"I approached this movie like ""The Help"" from 2011 hoping for a little white guilt to be preached to me under the guise of comedy with a hint of drama. This is where I could not have been more wrong.

Horrified I became once I saw the angry SHE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED taking up more than half the screen. Thank goodness this movie was not in 3D, but just to play it safe, I promptly left the theater before she came after me. Being an overweight white male with southern land owning ancestry leading back to the pre-Civil War era would easily make me a target for her hatred. Besides, she is no lightweight herself and sharing my popcorn during a movie is not something I'm usually willing to do. I tend to think she is a loud eater and that annoys me.

5948396,2,B00EV4F5TC,"Watching the film evoked thoughts on reviews of the '90s sitcom ""Will and Grace"" that were published the summer before that series premiered; those articles stated that the show should be called ""Jack and Karen"" due to those supporting characters being more interesting than the titular leads. As other posters in this forum have commented, the life of Gaines was not portrayed very well. His elder son's active involvement in the civil rights movement was both much more interesting and informative than Gaines' brief and mostly general one-on-ones with a few of the presidents under whom he served.

Additionally, devoting at least 10 minutes to Obama's election (which included part of Obama's victory speech) more than 20 years after Gaines retired was pure propaganda in this film co-starring Obama savior Oprah. The significance of that event is acknowledged, but giving that more than 5 year-old event at least 10 times the amount of screen time as most of the '70s is grossly disproportional. Also, we already knew the particular significance of that event to the titular butler and other black people who lived through the civil rights movements.

It should further be noted that Obama received as much (if not more) screen time as Kennedy, under whom Gaines served and who played a HUGE role in the movement that led to developments that contributed to Obama being a viable candidate.",1388966400,3,1394,5.056521739130435

5948407,3,B00EV4F5TC,"Before I begin, let me say that the picture quality was superb.  The colors popped and were lifelike, and the detail strong.  The cinematography was excellent and from a movie making point of view, this was a very well done film, save for the presidents!  Now for the social-political reasons this film was made, that get's two thumbs down!

Of course this film, it's subject matter and it's black gay director, always get more hype than normal.  That is because these slave themed films are put together for a new generation of blacks to learn what their place in this country should be.  Just keep in mind that these films are made and sponsored by the traditional heads in Hollywood and the black man's most relentless enemy!  Of course I cannot mention them here or I will be called anti-Jewish or something...

If you noticed, Spike Lee and John Singleton are no longer promoted for their QUALITY, serious subject matter films from a black perspective, instead they are left by the wayside in favor of three homosexual, buffoon type black directors in Steve McQueen, Lee Daniels and Tyler Perry.  Whatever these guys come out with get's all of the hype, Singleton and Lee get no hype.  Of course Hollywood would never allow movies about the Moors ruling Spain, black Europe, ancient Egypt, BLACK Carthage, Black Israel, etc. to be made.  In other words, history as it was is a no-no, but more fiction and 'negro' films can keep coming!

The Butler is one of the latest bunch of such 'negro' slave type films, along with Django, 12 Years a Slave and even the upcoming Roots remake (by you know who), all design to put both blacks and whites in a certain state of mind about blacks and to remind us all about where they prefer blacks to be.  ""The Butler,"" with it's title, imaging and storyline is a prime example of these movies.  Of course, Hollywood is slick enough to get ""negro"" gay directors like Lee Daniels who will do as told, as long as there are promises made to further along the gay cause and to set up a sick film about black gay love - Lee Daniels next film!

Of course, this film was promoted as a biopic but it was 'loosely' based on the man's life, which anyone with a brain should have guessed, but anyone without a brain would get - brainwashed.  The Butler starts off in what appears to be slavery, but way after the fact, then he runs away, then he becomes a thief, then is raised by a master, in the arts of Uncle Tomming/butlery!  Many viewers act as if they failed to see and hear that the main character acknowledges being an Uncle Tom but refuses to be called that because his personal success (like all Toms) is more important than that of the group's (blacks).  It should be known that it was indeed mentioned throughout the film that he was an Uncle Tom.  However, this film's overall message was that blacks being Uncle Toms is a GOOD thing and being a black militant will get you put in jail, beat up or killed.

The Butler is highly fictionalized and carries on the tradition of Hollywood reimgagining black history and whitewashing it with craziness, as if to make mockery of it or to poison the minds of newer generations and to revise American history.  All they have to do is to pay some fool, give him fame and fortune, hype him up as very talented and he will do whatever they ask!  However, when he is no longer of us, then he will find it hard to get a film out.  In this movie, there was no militant son, which they based his story on actual civil rights events, but if the son, Louis, had been real, THAT film should have been made, not this Uncle Tom/slave film.  Of course, heroics in favor of blacks thought was not the order, subservient blacks was the order.

Forrest Whitaker did a great job - almost too great!  He seems to doe very well in these types of films for some reason.  Oprah Winfrey was actually pretty good, as she seems to only play in these 'down and out blacks' films, all while being very far from down and out, without helping any blacks do better while she has enough money and power to make some difference.  Oprah was good in her role and she was looking sexy too!  A woman her age should be looking worse now than what she did in her 20's and 30's, but Oprah can bring it over here and i'd deal with her!  These two, along with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz were the only good actors that I can recall.

Now, they went through a few presidents starting with Truman, whom they portrayed as neutral to the black experience.  They skipped over Ike, but they did mention him.  They of course put emphasis on JFK, with a poor and SHORT actor portraying him - somewhat.  I did like the fact that they showed JFK for what he was - the ONLY president to proactively take on the plight of the black man!  That means that no one told him to do it, he just did what he knew to be right, he also paid the price for it.  I do like that they showed LBJ as the racist and uncouth person that he was, although the actor looked more like Spiro Agnew than LBJ!

Nixon of course was a racist and at least the film showed his hatred of JFK and his resentment of the wealthy getting ENTITLEMENTS, even though he and his political career were sponsored, paid for and hooked up by the very wealthy Bush family - of Connecticut.  You can even make the valid case that the Bush family helped removed JFK in order to install their man Nixon, as well as their own into the White House.  They move on to Regan who the film made talk very slowly, I assume, to show is Parkinson's.  They also shows his racism as well, which was good in case people forgot.  Too bad they did not talk about Carter so we could see their analysis of him towards blacks.

The presidents concludes with the Butler, being proud to see a 'black' man (who came out of a white woman no less!) be INSTALLED (not elected) as president, so he was invited for that.  The final scene of the film ends with a sick message of telling blacks (what Obama has said to blacks, but not to gays or illegals) that they need to ""do for self"" and to find their own way.  All of that after showing that blacks were systematically prevented from doing for self!  After over 30 years of butlering, the butler himself only realizes that he was an Uncle Tom after being served by the very butlers he worked with!  How can a man be proud to Tom only to have an epiphany about what he had do for so long?  Then he decides to join his living son's anti-apartheid protests at the risk of his job - a job that he protected with his life and stopped speaking to his son for what seem like 20 years!

5948423,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels' THE BUTLER tells the story of the American civil rights movement, as viewed from the perspectives of a an African-American, working as a butler in the White House, and his family.  Its a powerful film, filled with many notable scenes and performances, however there are times when the narrative seems to lose its way.

Forest Whitaker stars as Cecil Gaines, who was raised in the 1920s on a Southern cotton plantation where he witnessed the owner rape his mother and murder his father without legal consequences.  After working as a house servant on the plantation, then moving to Washington D.C. where he is employed in a upscale hotel, Gaines is invited to join the White House staff.  He stays there for thirty years, serving from the Eisenhower through the Reagan administrations.

Paralleling his years at the White House is Gaines personal journey, in which he travels from being the compliant butler who is invisible to those he serves, to becoming a man who is not afraid to stand up for his rights in a free society.  Complicating his life is an alcoholic wife (Oprah Winfrey) and an activist son (David Oyelowo) who becomes a Freedom Rider and a member of the Black Panthers.

I don't want to be a spoiler, so Ill just say that I certainly understand why director Lee Daniels and writer Danny Strong wanted to bring their story up into the Obama Administration, however from a strictly dramatic standpoint, I think the film would have been more effective had it ended ten minutes earlier.

That said, the cast in Lee Daniels THE BUTLER is nothing short of magnificent.  It includes Robin Williams (as Eisenhower),  John Cusack (Nixon), Cuba Gooding, Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Terrence Howard,  James Marsden (Kennedy), Liev Schreiber (Johnson), Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda (the Reagans) and Vanessa Redgrave.

The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including a Behind the Scenes documentary, several deleted scenes, a gag reel and more.

5948424,5,B00EV4F5TC,"The Butler is a fictional movie about a White House butler named Cecil Gaines.  Gaines served in the White House from the Dwight Eisenhower administration to the Ronald Reagan presidency.  The story is loosely based on the true story of Eugene Allen, the real life Cecil Gaines.

The movie's main focus is about the plight and struggle of African Americans during that time.  It also deals with other key points in American history, such as the assassination of President John Kennedy to name one.  The story is told in a very simplistic manner.  It goes from one presidency to the next and, basically, highlights the key events Gaines witnessed during each one.

The film stars Forest Whitaker as Gaines.  He is supported by Oprah, Cuba Gooding Jr. and other stars as well.  The film also includes Robin Williams in a small role playing Eisenhower.  There was good chemistry between the cast.  At 2 hours and 10 minutes long, the film seemed to move fairly quickly.  It was interesting to see how each President dealt with certain African American issues.

The film definitely deserves five stars.  I just wish it was not a fictionalized account.  For instance, Allen only had one son.  In the film, he has two.  There are certain scenes that could not have happened because of this.

It would have been nice to know the true story of Eugene Allen.  What great tales and insight could that man give us by telling his stories.  It deserves to be, at least, a book.  Unfortunately, that will never happen.  Allen died in 2010.",1387843200,2,1525,4.718631178707224

5948426,4,B00EV4F5TC,"""Lee Daniels' The Butler, while taking liberties from the original source, is a commendable effort with Forest Whitaker's performance as a subtle, understated White House butler in a more grounded light than we would normally see with recent race-oriented films like Django Unchained or a film from Spike Lee (which many of his films talk about something tough but boil down to a heavy and potentially one-sided argument).

The film reflects much of the butler's years working since childhood to an elderly age and it reflects his life in motion with his alcoholic, disenchanted wife played by billionaire Oprah Winfrey, his rebellious son who joins the Black Panthers and demonstrates at sit-ins, and his naive youngest son who goes to Vietnam. It was a very interesting experience to watch this fictionalised persona Cecil Gaines (Whitaker), based on the real-life Eugene Allen, play it so good-to-the-bone that there is an inner sadness and melancholy in his character that amid the rebellion (son), negligence (wife), he still remains strong-minded and has a goodwill, something that is relatively important for audiences to watch and discover.

The film also gets even better with some comic relief provided by Cuba Gooding, Jr. played a White House server too as well as Terrence Howard playing a smarmy, perverted neighbour. In addition, the cameos shown in the film maybe stereotypical but are relatively humanising and interesting to watch especially Liev Schreiber playing a catankerous old Lyndon B. Johnson (who led the Vietnam war) and Alan Rickman playing Ronald Reagan (whilst bizarre and accented unusually, still works in a funny way).

Much of the set designs, cinematography, and editing (especially at the cut-away scenes) are well-done within the constraints of its budget much relating back to what the team done on Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, the film suffers a bit with a slightly simplistic narrative (which isn't bad given Whitaker's character and the tone of the film), a missing scene from the trailer involving Black Panthers shooting at the police, restraint from showing the horrors and carnage of both whites and blacks amid segregation, and a vague ending.

While a political piece, it could've been better. As a film, it was beyond satisfactory enough and it didn't falter in the cracks like Oliver Stone's W. (2008) or Dr. Strangelove and many young people will be able-minded to understand its themes and ideas without being bored by the history of it all, especially with the rebellious son and his struggle to develop his identity.

Without remorse, the film is tough material but it is important on several levels. Unfortunately, the state of affairs as of today are a result of much of this chaos (whether it be identity, race, economic status, housing, culture, and labour). But for many people-of-minority who watch the film, a lot of questions will be asked about and a doubt and inner ambition to find liberty and non-pressure elsewhere is still an uncertain one.""",1385337600,15,3009,5.157786885245901
5948427,5,B00EV4F5TC,"THE BUTLER is a film which, for all its sentimental tone, nonetheless addresses the fundamental issue of civil rights, and whether the reforms of the Sixties have actually had the desired effect.  It centers on the life of Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker), who grew up on a plantation but spent most of his career in service at the White House.  To his son Louis (David Oyelowo), Cecil is nothing more than a representative of ""Uncle Tom"" culture, spending his life in willing thrall to the white man.  On the other hand Cecil manages to provide for his family and carve out a career; it is only late on in his life, when President Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) offers him an opportunity to savor something that he has never previously experience, that he understands how little his masters have changed, ideologically speaking, since the days of racial segregation.  This is the film's ""aha-moment"" - from then on Gaines devotes himself to the cause of equal rights.  THE BUTLER brings out the ambiguities of the African American experience; how Gaines' life might be regarded as a form of ""liberation,"" despite working for a succession of white Presidents; and how the Civil Rights cause (as symbolized by the Black Panther movement of the Sixties and Seventies) might not have necessarily aided the African American experience.  The film contains a clutch of memorable performances: Oprah Winfrey is quite admirable as Gaines' wife Gloria, supported by Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr., in supporting roles.  Whitaker is quite simply brilliant in the title role; he ages gracefully while always sustaining his self-respect.  If he does not get Oscar-nominated for his performance, I'd be extremely surprised.  A memorable cinematic experience.",1384905600,187,1748,5.126760563380282
5948428,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Upon viewing this film I was expecting to see a fairly accurate portrayal of history, but what I ended up with was a sensationalized and mostly false portrayal of the life of Eugene Allen, a butler who served in the White House under multiple presidential administrations. Instead of just telling the actual story of Eugene Allen, which by itself is fascinating, the director and producers behind this work decided to develop the film into a hateful, anti-white polemic which inaccurately portrays the civil rights movement and falsely portrays events in Eugene Allen's life that never actually happened, for instance the vicious rape of his mother and murder of his father, an event that was dreamt up in the sick minds of Hollywood producers who were aiming for sensationalism while also trying to promote the tired old ""whites are evil"" rhetoric.

When I pay to see a film, I want to be entertained or informed. I DO NOT want to be a participant to propaganda, especially vicious propaganda that is designed to slander a particular race, namely white folk. The ancestors of the vast majority of white folks who live in America today had absolutely nothing to do with slavery. My ancestors immigrated to America after slavery had already been abolished and the same is true for the majority of white Americans.

5948429,4,B00EV4F5TC,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Ed Uyeshima's review of ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" (hereafter ""The Butler"") pretty much encompasses and captures my feelings toward this ambitiously sweeping movie. What more can I add? In this review I will focus upon the need to sustain Civil Rights/Equality history's relevance and the need to represent something greater than you.

Through the passive but observant eyes of partly-fictionalized eyes of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), the viewer is barraged with practically every notable American Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, and Equality event from the late thirties to the near present. Some events are sketchy and ephemeral, others more shockingly substantial. Some events are uplifting and optimistic, others are shameful and appalling. Like Cecil to some extent, we sympathize and empathize with the players in these historical dramas, but also wish to be distanced from it because it threatens our family, our livelihood, and even our lives. Cecil, at least as a small boy, wants to fight the injustices African-American endure, but his life's training as a servant has suppressed all that. To survive and even prosper, Cecil has internalized the old adage ""Keep your head down, and you'll work forever"". As a result, he has a ""prestigious"" job as a White House butler and a comfortable home in a predominantly black (and therefore safe) D.C. suburb.

However, comfort zones (especially in the movies) don't last long. Cecil's older son Louis (David Oyelowo) is diametrically opposed to being like father. Improbably but admirably, Louis becomes involved in practically every revolutionary Civil Rights event, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 march on Washington and the formation of the Black Panthers. To his father's fearful dismay, Louis's militant activities take precedence over his Fisk University studies and even his career. At a family dinner, when Louis condemns Sidney Poitier's ""Uncle Tom"" vanilla appeasement of whites, that ignites a confrontation with his father. However, ""The Butler"" makes blindingly clear that it isn't Louis who has alter his thinking. Cecil has to find it within himself to radically alter years of subservient conditioning and take a stand, not only for Civil Rights/Equality, but also for his own self-respect. He begins by arguing with the White House serving head for equal pay for equal work, and works up to dinner as a guest of the Reagans. As he approaches old age, Cecil is fortunate enough to see Obama's election to the presidency and get a formal White House invitation from him. ""The Butler"", I think, also states that taking a stand for bettering the human condition does not have to begin on a dramatic, monumental scale. Quietly but determinedly working for incremental change is also courageous and vital.

""The Butler"" frequently presents a whirlwind synopsis of American Civil rights history with the subtlety of a charging rhinoceros. Some viewers may balk at that and, especially in light of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's ""I Have a Dream"" oration, uncomfortably dismiss it as restive propaganda. Yet, we have to remember to remember history, otherwise... well, you know. We need to be reminded of American Civil Rights' tortured, violent, but progressive history and the ignorant hatred of intolerant people. We need to be reminded that we have come a long way, but that we have a long way to go, and perhaps always will. Nevertheless, when you fight for justice, the very fight is a triumph. The only way to lose is when you stop fighting.",1382918400,8,3570,5.2034782608695656

5948433,3,B00EV4F5TC,"Lee Daniels' The Butler is something of a mixed bag. Had it been made twenty years ago, it might have stood on more original ground, but in 2013 it has a highly derivative feel to it, like what you'd get if you crossed Backstairs at the White House (a TV-miniseries from the 1980's that related the real-life experiences of a mother and daughter who worked as maids at the White House over a period of fifty years, starting with the Taft administration and ending with the arrival of JFK) and Forrest Gump where the life of a fictional character seems to cross paths with all the notable figures of his day.

It is important to emphasize that in spite of the impression the promotions for The Butler give, this film is in fact fiction. It is supposedly based on the life of a real-life White House butler named Eugene Allen, but other than the fact that Forrest Whitaker's character - a butler named Cecil Gaines - works at the White House for over three decades - almost nothing that happens in the film had anything to do with Allen's actual life.

Besides Whitaker's stand-out performance, the supporting cast are quite good as well, from Oprah Winfrey as Gaines' much put-upon boozed-up wife to Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Lenny Kravitz as Cecil's fellow staffers and Terrence Howard as a somewhat too familiar neighbor. David Oyelowo does a creditable job as Cecil's elder son, Louis, who takes the audience through almost every aspect of the black civil rights' experience, from joining the Freedom Riders and participating in sit-in protests at segregated diners to the later Black Panther movement and later still into the rising of black candidates for political office. The script, however, does not leave him a lot of room to be more than a symbolic character for the ear, but Oyelowo does manage to breathe some genuine individuality into the character which helps us to identify with the events he experiences.

A major drawback to the film however is the truly bizarre casting of most of the various Presidents of the era. Robin Williams' Eisenhower comes across more as a benign Elmer Fudd than the man who once commanded Allied forces during WWII. James Marsden does a creditable JFK, particularly in a scene where we see him laid out on the floor by the chronic back pain he had to endure through most of his adult life. But Liev Schreiber's LBJ, though he does have a great comic scene as he gives orders to his staff while sitting on the toilet, is badly miscast, employing arguably the worst attempt at a Texas accent ever recorded on film. John Cusack's Nixon is - one presumes - unintentionally hilarious as he slouches about with a fake nose. The film skips over Ford entirely, leading directly into Alan Rickman's Reagan, where you have to wonder ""What _were_ they thinking?"" as Rickman's sole attempt at conveying Reagan was having his hair slicked up. Reagan was British?  Who knew?

Recommended for Forrest Whitaker's outstanding performance and for the scenes that deal with the early civil rights struggle, but otherwise should be regarded as a watchable fictionalization of an important period of history rather than the story of a real individual's life.",1381708800,130,3179,4.815018315018315
5948434,1,B00EV4F5TC,"Hollywood seems to create fictional accounts of history they know absolutely nothing about and far too many viewers accept lies and misrepresentations as the truth.

This movie producer seeks to demonize a great American who helped make this country as great as it is today. Watching this movie serves no meaningful purpose other than serving only to undermine the viewers' faith in America.

Facts demonstrate that the real story of the White House butler is not about racism at all. Eugene Allen, the White House butler served eight presidents from 1952 to 1986. Mr. Eugene Allen lead a quiet life, was married to the same woman for 65 years and had one son who served honorably in Vietnam. Mr. Allen never quit his job in protest. He worked in the White House thirty-four years and rose to the highest level available in White House service.

Sadly, this movie is a representation of nothing more than Hollywood's wish to believe something about President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan and the White House that was never there.

Ronald Wilson Reagan, while serving both as governor and later as president, did substantially more for minority communities than any president before or since and he helped to move both California and this nation into a far more balanced position.

Unlike the Jane Fonda version of Nancy Reagan in this distortion of the truth, it was Mrs. Reagan who invited ""the butler"" to dinner as a guest and it was Mr. Reagan promoted Mr. Allen to matre d'htel, the highest service position.

5948436,4,B00EV4F5TC,"First things first: although ""The Butler"" aka ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" (the longer name forced on the film by a Warner Brothers' copyright threat over their own nearly 100-year-old film ""The Butler"") is based to some extent on the true story of Eugene Allen, who did in fact serve under seven presidents and lived to see Barack Obama become the first African-American President, a great many of the details in the film are fictionalized for dramatic effect.  If this is a major issue for you (it is for many folks), be forewarned then; a significant example occurs early on, as our title character (named Cecil Gaines in the film) leaves the plantation he's working on in the south largely because of an incident of violence that did not in fact happen to the real Eugene Allen.  There are other important details in the film that are fictionalized or altered; this one is worth mentioning because it makes for a greater contrast between the life he left and the life he gained than there actually was.  Given the harsh realities of black life before, during, and even after the Civil Rights era, I'm not sure it was necessary to begin the film with such violence.

But this is not, for me, a huge problem, and I think the film's general thrust - that a black man's service to the men who occupied the highest office in the land did not exempt him from indignities small and large, and that there was still blatant racism even in the White House, even years after MLK, Malcolm X, and the Civil Rights Act - rings true and is generally well and potently told.  Forest Whitaker, one of the finest American actors of his generation in this reviewer's opinion, gives a typically excellent and well-rounded performance, playing a character who is essentially passive for much of the film but managing to give him plenty of pathos, dignity, and occasional moments of emotional power.  I don't think it's anything close to Whitaker's best performance - that would be his monumental portrayal of Charlie Parker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bird/dp/B000053V7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bird</a>&nbsp;- but the difficulties in playing a static character who must hide his emotions over much of his life shouldn't be underestimated.  David Oyelowo as Gaines' eldest son Louis - Freedom Rider, close associate of Dr. King, Black Panther, and ultimately Congressman - is just as impressive, and the rocky relationship between the father who is willing (generally) to wait for black lives to get better, and the angry son who will do anything to help create equality NOW, is at the heart of the story.

Louis, though, does cast a light on one of the problems with the film - the need to hit every historical event possible, to put the Gaines family in the center of as much of black experience as can possibly be shown from the 60s through the present.  Louis' achievements aren't impossible and are mirrored in some real-life people, but added to all of the close associations that his father seems to have with every President - being alone with Jackie as she weeps over JFK, hearing Reagan defend his South Africa policies but then later listening to him wonder aloud if he was right, handing LBJ his toilet paper, etc - does make it all seem a little ""Forrest Gump"" at times.  And the famous names who play the Presidents, including Robin Williams as Ike, John Cusack as Nixon, and Alan Rickman as Reagan, distract as much as they add any dramatic urgency to the story. I'm also not entirely sure that Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong needed to soft-pedal the actions and attitudes of the Presidents themselves; the film leaves you with the feeling that the men who served in the office were all (eventually) pretty decent-minded when it came to their attitudes about race (though admitting that LBJ, Nixon and Reagan had quite imperfect records) and one feels that the blame is placed almost entirely on southern racists.  It feels a little gutless at times, in refusing to really take these men or their administrations to task.  As the film draws to an end, it all adds up to a frankly predictable, play-your-heartstrings finale that honestly didn't need to be pitched at the emotional heights that it hit. The real story - or something closer to it - would have felt a bit more satisfying to me.  But if you're a big fan of the traditional Hollywood ending, you may not mind; and I will say that there was a tear or two on my face, despite the ""oh, of course this is the way he'll end it"" feeling.

And a big part of that lump-in-the-throat effect, I'm pleased to say, was due to Oprah Winfrey's outstanding portrayal of Gloria, Cecil's brash, sexually charged, hard-drinking, but world-weary and always caring wife Gloria.  I'll say right off that I've never been a huge fan of Oprah's TV show, or her public persona.  Maybe it's because she often seems to be putting on an act even when I'm fairly sure she's not; and I think that's because she really is a born performer.  I HAVE been a big fan of her as an actress, and her Gloria is almost as memorable as her Sethe in Jonathan Demme's criminally underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beloved/dp/B00C4Q0238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beloved</a>.  There's a wonderful toughness and brittleness and intelligence in Gloria, but also a crazy side, and one of the major achievements of ""The Butler"" is as a convincing portrait of a tumultuous marriage in which each partner really does seem to realistically complement the other.

So to sum up, this certainly isn't a film that feels real as history - a little too much is stuffed in - and it's a little too Hollywood and sentimental at the end for my tastes.  But it does feel emotionally true to the periods, and it is well worth seeing for the excellent performances, especially that of Oprah Winfrey.  I don't think the great film about the American Civil Rights era has been made yet, but ""The Butler"" does get more right than it gets wrong, and it's eminently watchable.",1379808000,13,6079,4.893968871595331

5948438,4,B00EV4F5TC,"I love Oprah as much as reason allows, and that, favorable pre-movie buzz, and Oscar talk propelled me to see this movie. In fact I looked forward to it with some anticipation.

The beginning stated that the movie was inspired by a true story.  If there was one thing I would change about the movie it would be that statement, as some of the more significant story elements used in this movie are in fact not true.  That is not to diminish the story in any way as entertainment, but to depict something as a true story, and then foist a not true narrative on the spectator does not bode well for the movies Oscar aspirations, though it has not hurt it at the box office.

With the well deserved success of the superior movie  'The Help,' from last year, the writers of this movie were obviously hoping to get similar acclaim for this movie.

The movie opens in a deep south plantation cotton field in 1926, and a young black boy watches as the plantation owners son grabs the boys mother (played by Mariah Carey) and pulls her into the barn, where we can deduce what happens.  When the owner emerges what happens next is fiction.  The landowners mother or aunt, played by Vanessa Redgrave perhaps moved by pity, or guilt, then trains the boy to be a house slave, I mean servant.  When the boy grows up, he leaves the plantation, and filled with determination to make a better life for himself than his parents somehow becomes the White house butler.

Except in reality the inciting event did not happen.

What I did like about the movie is that it was well made, and has a stellar cast.  Several performances are worth talking about, particularly Forest Whitaker as The Butler, who may win an Oscar nomination, and I particularly liked James Marsden's take on John F Kennedy.  John Cusack gave an interesting though unlikely performance as Nixon.  Lenny Kravitz is also a pleasant surprise.

In fact, as entertainment, it is quite good.  A few tv commentators have talked up Oprah's performance. Oprah has her moments in this movie, though I thought she was better in both Beloved, and The color Purple. Here she plays the Butler's alcoholic wife, who may not or may not be having an affair with the character played by Terence Brady.  A scene where she danced along to the telly was subtle and amusing, and a scene where she  puts on lipstick in front of the mirror while arguing with her husband and about to go to bed I found to be messed up but arresting.  Who puts on lipstick to go to bed?  What about the laundry bills?

As a scene where a character criticized Sidney Poitier unfolded I found myself wondering what would Oprah do.  This was a great scene.

One of the more surprising elements of the story, apparently true, was that despite all the Civil Rights laws passed in the 1960s, black Butlers still had less pay and opportunity for advancement than their white counterparts, although we do not see any white butlers in the movie. It's really curious that the Kennedys would not do anything about it, or Nixon though in the movie he makes a campaign promise to the butlers to that effect.  It's not until Reagan becomes President that that is resolved, although Reagan's son takes issue with how his father is depicted in the movie on other matters.

So the movie has attracted some controversy, yet has done very well at box office.  As I write it has grossed over $102 million in 5 weeks of release having spent three weekends at number one.  So it's success is assured.  The movie is based on an interview given by Eugene Allen in 2008 to the Washington Post.  He had a son who fought in the Vietnam War and survived.

I think most people will enjoy the movie.  As true stories go, it's true that it's a story.  As entertainment goes, it's true that it's entertaining.

I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1379635200,8,3851,4.526772793053546
5948439,5,B00EV4F5TC,"I saw this film just three days ago now. It is a movie that is still with me right now. I can't say enough great things about it. I highly recommend the movie and while it does have a few apocryphal scenes that may never have taken place in real life, the dramatic license that Daniels takes is quite understanding.

Forest Whitaker again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The first scene of the movie is quite shocking so I do not recommend it for women or children; it is that shocking and terrifying. To me real life violence is more terrifying than something I see in an action movie like Rambo or Die-Hard. When you see it and what subsequently happened to people at the sit-ins and Freedom Rides, you will be shocked and angered all at the same time.

When this comes out on DVD I will be one of the first to buy it.

This Is My 200th Amazon Review. Too, I'm the 21st To Have Reviewed The Movie & The Eighth Five-Star Reviewer.",1379376000,8,961,4.351955307262569
5948440,4,B00EV4F5TC,"(based upon theatre viewing)

Above-mentioned ""flaws"" include too many close-ups of Oprah who none the less is outstanding, throughout. I have no idea of any background interest by the megastar but I kept imagining in the theatre, that the Director and Editor was perhaps scared to make her ""supportive"" of Forest Whitaker. He is excellent, as well. (Was he the star?).

A secondary criticism is in the ""aging"" of the stars. Forest looks exactly the same in 1974 as he did in 1954. Oprah ages about 30 years in one 5 year period.

We also get a small, and very unnecessary and depressing soap opera involving the neglected Oprah and the next door neighbor dude. Super acting, yes, but what a mistake.

That plus too many administration recollections...the Eisenhower years are very well done (although Robin Williams is pretty awful as Ike). Then we get the Camelot years, but Jack looks about 27 years old. Another good (albeit disturbing) set of scenes involves the reluctant war monger but socially beneficient LBJ. Then we find the older and wiser Nixon, surprisingly well represented - when it was all said and done, the ""crook"" came up with enterprise zones for minorities.

The Carter and Reagan years could have been cut. This Reviewer feels that Reagan, although a man of vision (Welfare Reform and ""47% pay no Fed. taxes"", etc.), was past his prime. Still, the very cold portrayal here, is quite unnerving. Here's a Leader who took a bullet for his Country.

So, sadly, we get another coulda-shoulda from ""Hollywood"". Another movie twenty minutes too long.

Positives are too numerous to mention: it's a great review of the Civil Rights movement through the eyes of a family, a Father, who must look away from political machinations six feet away from him and serve cookies to segregationists; a Son, equally concerned about his country, but willing to demonstrate (and take his Life in his hands).",1379030400,3,1908,4.906832298136646
5948441,4,B00EV4F5TC,"Director Daniels' film is about the real life butler, Eugene Allen who served 7 presidents beginning with Eisenhower in 1957.  For whatever reason, his name was changed in this film to Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker).  The film opens in Macon, Georgia where Cecil (Isaac White) and his parents are sharecroppers on a cotton farm.

In the south, things hadn't changed all that much from the Civil War.  Cecil's mother (Mariah Carey) is raped on a regular basis by one of the land owners (Alex Pettyfer).  When his father (David Banner) says something, he is gunned down in front of the boy.  The young boy is taken in to the ""big"" house and is trained to be a server to the family.  Once he has grown, he strikes out on his own and heads north.  He catches a job at a large Washington, D. C. hotel and gets a call from a White House staffer to come in for an interview.  He is hired and so it begins.

Cecil's days at the White House, while at times interesting, are but a backdrop for what the film is really about.  The relationship between Cecil and his oldest son, Louis (David Oyelowo).  The heart of the film takes place during the civil rights struggles of 1960's and `70's.  As Louis gets older and heads off to college, he becomes more and more active in the civil rights movement, eventually becoming a ""freedom rider"" and then a member of the Black Panther Party.

As Cecil struggles with his son's activism, his marriage to Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) is on the wane thanks to his long hours and her struggles with alcohol.  These are 3 terrific performances and they certainly carry the film, although I was admittedly curious to see how the various presidents and their wives would be portrayed by the line of celebrity actors who quickly step on and off the screen.  Most were just short of awful.

I will also give a mention to Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson, one of Cecil's co-workers.  He manages to add a bit of levity and humanity to many of the scenes.  Note also that there are some brutal portrayals, some staged for this film and some historical newsreels that provide viewers with a reminder of the struggles of the era.  This is a very strong film, more about family relationships and historical injustice as it is about Eugene Allen's distinguished career.",1378857600,4,2279,4.566502463054187
5948442,2,B00EV4F5TC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 The dictionary tells us that the word 'contrived' is defined as ""obviously planned or forced; artificial; strained,"" as in a ""a contrived story."" And isn't that exactly what 'The Butler' is? Contrived! Director Lee Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong knew that they had to create an additional, secondary story, to make the true story of Eugene Allen, the Butler who served 34 years in the White House, more dramatic. This is called 'dramatic license' and all films more or less must fudge the truth a little bit to enhance the narrative.

Actually, two stories were created out of whole cloth, when Daniels and Strong created the fictional character of Cecil Gaines. There was the acceptable but contrived story of inventing two sons for Gaines (in reality Allen had only one). To make things more dramatic, Gaines' son Louis, ends up becoming radicalized and butting heads with his father throughout the film. In reality, Allen modestly differed with his son about politics but he never left the Washington, D.C. area. Daniels and Strong prefer to put Louis in the middle of the every significant event in the history of the civil rights movement, like a Woody Allen 'Zelig' or a Tom Hanks 'Forrest Gump.' All well and good, but I felt uncomfortable when Louis turns up at the Lorraine Motel, and is part of Martin Luther King's entourage, hours before King's assassination. More believable, is the scene where Louis is part of a college protest against a segregated lunch counter. When Louis becomes a Black Panther and later rejects the movement and goes into politics, it just feels like a lot of this stuff has been done before and in some cases better (take a look at a much more subtle, non-Hollywood indie, 'Night Catches Us', about the legacy of the Black Panther movement).

Whether you agree creating the fictional character of 'Louis' worked, it does fit under the purview of dramatic license. The opening of this film, does not. I'm referring of course to the scene of Gaines' childhood, where a white racist rapes his mother and murders his father in broad daylight, down in a cotton field in Georgia. The whole problem with this scenario is that it never happened. The real-life Allen grew up in Virginia, not in Georgia, and never underwent such an unspeakable tragedy. It's an odious scene designed to manipulate the audience into believing that 'The Butler' overcame a tremendous psychological/emotional burden, throughout his life (the other manipulative scene is the death of Gaines' second son in Vietnam--which of course also never happened in real life!).

If Allen (Gaines) had witnessed such a horrific event, do you really believe he would have turned out to be the compliant and also nice guy, he ended up as? Sure, it's entirely plausible that a person with that kind of history, would have to suck it up, and appear completely cooperative, while on the job. But in his home life, I hardly can imagine a person not being scarred by such a terrible event. But here, Gaines is a mild-mannered family man, who has no bitterness. Why in real life did Allen (Gaines) have no bitterness? Because, the rape and the murder never happened. There's another reason why that scene should never have been falsely attributed to a real person's biography. If you are going to remind people of the injustices of the past, especially young people, do it in a truthful way. This is not a fictional character we're dealing with--it's a real life person, who endured racism throughout his life (but not in the incendiary way it's presented here).

The other problem with 'The Butler' is that it mostly fails to make us feel that we're watching scenes of verisimilitude, involving Gaines' interactions with the various Presidents in the White House. Why was the decision made to cast well-known actors in the roles? Obviously, the big names will draw the bigger crowd. But what if casting known names, turn your scenes into veritable Saturday Night Live skits? Almost every well-known actor fails to hit the mark. Despite the prosthetics, Robin Williams simply looks like Robin Williams attempting to play Dwight Eisenhower. James Marsden does a decent enough job as JFK, but is too young for the part. John Cusack makes Nixon into a caricature and Liev Schrieber doesn't even come close to reminding us of LBJ. While they did a passable job of making Alan Rickman, look like Ronald Reagan, he acts wooden and cannot convey Reagan's affability. What's more, Lee Daniels bias against Reagan shines through, when he fails to have Reagan explain why he opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa (whether you agree with Reagan or not, at least have the character provide some explanations, as to why he acted as he did). Only Jane Fonda hits the mark as Nancy Reagan. She not only looks like her, but sounds like her too (perhaps the best cameo in the entire film).

Finally there's Oprah. While she can act, she's too recognizable to play this part. She's also saddled with playing a character that's inclined toward soap opera machinations (do we really care about Mrs. Gaines' alcoholism and flirtations with the neighbor?)

'The Butler' is a pure Hollywood spectacle. It features a restrained, professional job by Forrest Whitaker as 'The Butler' and has a number of notable scenes that remind us of the turbulent days of the civil rights movement. By trying to cover too much, much of 'The Butler' feels like a mere documentary. The father-son conflict works well but it's a bit perfunctory; and I felt I wanted more interesting tidbits from Allen's (Gaines') life, working in the White House. The cameos by well-known actors, were a disaster and the opening scene, is appallingly manipulative. 'The Butler' is nothing more than a mediocre effort, except for an occasional dramatic moment or two, which will stick in your memory.",1378771200,17,5890,4.91851106639839
5948443,1,B00EV4F5TC,"As always, the left (looking at you Forest and Oprah) does their level best to make dems look good and repubs look bad.  The most obvious revision was when some dem came to Reagan wanting Reagan to slap sanctions on South Africa.  The film portrayed Reagan as callous to the plight of blacks in South Africa.

Nothing could be further from the truth.  Reagan was extremely sensitive to their plight, while democrats remained callous to anything other than their political power.  As with all economic ignorants, this dem failed to think about the economic repercussions to the poor, particularly the poor blacks, in South Africa.  In real life, Reagan didn't sign this sanction because he knew it would hurt these poor blacks.  And in real life, as is typical, dems were more than willing to make poor people's, especially black people's, lives worse off to score some political point.",1378771200,26,885,4.899328859060403

The Butler (aka Lee Daniel's The Butler) is an emotional, powerful film based on the story of a real life butler who worked at The White House; the film deals primarily with the civil rights movement as it influences the life of an African-American youth who grows up to be a butler employed at The White House. The relationship between the subservient African-American butler who must never speak his mind nor react to whatever is being said by very powerful white people highlights the deplorably low status in society that African-Americans endured especially during the time the butler, named Cecil Gaines in this film, was employed at The White House. In addition, the effects of both Vietnam and American politics in general are well explored as experienced by Cecil and his family. However, while that is all well done, and the performances in this film are tremendously good and poignant, the storyline itself is a bit choppy--for example, the earlier years of the butler's (Cecil's) working at The White House are explored in greater detail and length than the later years--President Ford's administration is dealt with for barely more than 15 seconds as we see a clip of him talking on the television as President and President Carter doesn't get too much time in this film, either. There's still more to the plot but I'll leave some out so you can watch and appreciate this film as much as I did.

I also give the filmmakers and the others who worked on this film a tremendous amount of credit for making this all come alive--for example, the makeup was so convincing I could completely believe that people like Cecil are aging as the movie progresses! The sets are very well done and the choreography and cinematography both shine. The musical score, while not too extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film as well making it all the more powerful and memorable.

Again, however, it is the story of an African-American man and his quest for at least a half-way decent life (or at least survival) for himself and his family in a world in which the white man dominated the black man that truly captivated me. The plot is full of poignant moments that brought tears of sadness to my eyes: we see the butler (Cecil Gaines played with panache by Forest Whitaker) so broken and scarred by the horrific violence he witnessed in his youth that when his son Louis (David Oyelowo) wants to join the Freedom Riders he promptly and angrily dismisses the movement as futile; Cecil also forbids Louis to even just attend a civil rights rally held in the late 1950s when the family is already living in Washington, D.C. and supposedly (but of course not really) treated noticeably better than African-Americans were treated in the South. Oprah Winfrey's portrayal of Cecil's wife Gloria with her strengths and inner demons also stunned me with its raw power; Oprah's ability to make Gloria come to real life on that screen is remarkable. Adriane Lenox as Gina and Pernell Walker as Lorraine astounded me with their exceptionally convincing performances that I won't forget anytime soon.

There are, as many others have noted, quite a few big name stars who lend their presence to the film and make it even more powerful. Look for Mariah Carey as Hattie Pearl, Cecil's mother; Vanessa Redgrave as Annabeth Westfall; Robin Williams as Dwight D. Eisenhower; John Cusack as Richard Nixon; James Marsden as John F. Kennedy; Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson; Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda as Ronald and Nancy Reagan; Clarence Williams III as Maynard; Jim Gleason as R.D. Warner; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson; Lenny Kravitz as James Holloway and Minka Kelly as Jacqueline Kennedy.

Overall, The Butler will remain one of the better films of 2013 and I highly recommend it for people interested in racial issues and the history of our country's long and rocky struggle to become a society in which everyone is truly equal. In addition, people who appreciate dramas, especially dramas based on real life stories, will not be disappointed.",1378771200,8,4066,4.861471861471862
5948445,5,B00EV4F5TC,"When I heard about ""The Butler,"" I rolled my eyes. Another film about African Americans serving...who needs that? More who wants that? No one. Luckily, the filmmakers behind the project agreed. Sure, it's about a White House butler, but it's about so much more than that. It's about American history through the lens of not only a White House Butler, but also a black family. It's insightful, gives you a look into what the domestic life of American Presidents and most of all it's heartfelt.

We can spend all day arguing about how facts of the ""The Butler"" and it is in my opinion that most of this film is true, but exaggeration. I am sure that Danny Strong (Yup that Danny Strong from Buffy) did a lot of research and got as much of the events as close to possible, but this is not a documentary. More, the exact facts are not always cinematic. So, please I do not want to hear about how this was wrong and that was not quite right. It's a movie and it's fiction. Intelligent people should know not to believe every word of it. Movies are for entertainment and movie makers are in the business of making money, not telling facts.

That being said...this film is the MOST realistic and honest retelling of the Civil Rights movement I have ever seen. I cried. I cried a lot. What makes ""The Butler"" so good is that this film is not a civil rights film. It's a film about family, change and America. It's a look at our history during some of the most trying times. And honestly, what is more trying than the civil rights movement. A time when our country was divided by racism and hate. We get to really see what it meant to be a freedom rider...well as close as we can from sitting in a movie theater. We see what those kids went through. Being attacked and cursed, while politely and nonviolently sitting in a restaurant, because yes you have every right to be there.

There were moments during the sit in that I just felt myself collapse. Felt such pride in the Americans who came before me, because yes, I am really pleased to say that there were white people on the right side of equality during that time. It's amazing and heartbreaking and scary. Lee Daniels, did an amazing job of bringing it to life. It's not that we did not understand the sacrifice these young people made. I definitely did, but seeing it in living color, even if it was just acted out, was devastating.",1378684800,9,2382,4.433789954337899
5948446,3,B00EV4F5TC,"This movie certainly captures the spirit of a country going from open oppression of blacks to having a black President in a single generation. And it reminds us that our current politics of 2013 are by no means the most divisive in recent history.

This is meant to be a family movie, and while some of the vivid civil rights scenes are shocking, the brutality of the Civil Rights era was far worse. For example, no pictures of little kids being spat on, no teens blown up in churches. (Someday, someone will have the guts to do a real movie about the freedom riders and what it took to break the back of segregation, but it will be too violent and disturbing to get the ratings this movie has.)

For the many boomers old enough to remember all these events first hand, it will be a fast-forward run through recent history, like reading a scrapbook. One vignette of this, a snapshot of that. It will make them feel great. For kids who didn't live through this, though, I wonder if this format will work. Will they even know who LBJ was, or why he'd be portrayed on a toilet? [A needless scene IMO].

I gave this movie only three stars despite solid performances because it's too pat, too sanitized, everything is too much at arms length.  It's a good attempt at describing what happened in that time period, but it doesn't really explain why or how it happened. That requires great art.
