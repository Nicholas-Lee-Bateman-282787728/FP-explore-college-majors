359161,5,6301788508,"Marie Osmond shot this film just after completing the film ""Goin' Coconuts"" with brother Donny. This film is based on the short story ""Gift of the Magi"" by O. Henry. Marie plays ""Beth"" in  the film, a rich orphan who is assigned to marriage in turn of the century  New York. Beautiful period costumes and superb acting make this movie a  Christmas classic! Shot entirely at Osmond Studios in Orem Utah in  September-October 1978 for airing in December 1978.",919296000,15,457,4.746835443037975

359389,5,6301788508,"Very absorbing narrative and performances. Glad James Woods figured out that he and Marie Osmond would be the worst train wreck. Before I retired from teaching, I showed this video every Christmas to minority students in the ghetto and privileged students in the suburbs - tough crowds who usually don't like anything but action movies with explosions. But ALL these high school students liked the film. One male student who was way too cool and gangsta for everything even asked who Marie Osmond was, said she was pretty, and speculated that she was probably French!",1482710400,3,567,4.978947368421053

It's amusing to see Maria Osmond, James Woods and June Lockhart from the 1970's but don't expect great acting skills from any of them in this film. I did actually watch the entire film but don't feel like you have to make the same sacrifice. I imagine this is one of the worst adaptations of O'Henry's ""The Gift of the Magi"" available.

I love Marie Osmond as singer, and Timothy Bottoms was pretty good as an actor, but this story line and dialogue were ridiculous. The hackneyed ""romance novel"" premise -- i.e. boy meets girl/girl hates boy, boy charms girl/girl hates boy, followed by the inevitable ""come-to-realize"" moment when girl likes boy/boy tests girl -- is so trite and unimaginative, it's embarrassing to watch.

The story is a remake of the Givt of the Magi by O. Henry.  It has a pretty good charm because I keep coming back to it over the years as a feel good movie.  I remember even tape recording the audio when I was young watching it to play back, so even though that was a weird thing to do, I have fond memories of this film.",1427846400,,464,3.893617021276596

When our VHS tape began to finally fall apart, we were soooo thankful to find a DVD copy here on Amazon.  The Gift of Love is funny, heart-breaking, heart-warming, exciting, and all-in-all a beautiful love story. The acting is awesome for all of the actors except for Beth (Marie Osmond), which is unfortunate since she's the main character.  She isn't terribly or anything, but I do think the rest of the cast are better actors/actresses than her, especially Mary (Sondra West).  Anytime Mary and Beth are in the same scene, Beth out-shines her.  I wish I could find other movies/shows that Sondra West acted in, but it's like she fell off the planet after this show.  :-(  Anyway, aside from the quality of Marie Osmond's acting, this movie is fantastic and a great addition to anyone's movie collection.",1426636800,,976,4.808383233532934

I was actually amazed at how bad it was on every single point. It could have won an award just for that!  Even when the lead actress had her hair come undone (twice, no joke) from her ""potential"" romantic interest, it was dry and bushy instead of the scene being romantically enhanced by her ""cascading locks"" spilling down or whatever!

The acting is...well, it felt as if I was watching a high school drama performance or a very poor quality Hallmark movie...very scripted and mechanical.

My prayer is that every young Man and woman see this movie before they become engaged to be married or even better before they move in together.  And then follow their heart.

I am a period-film freak, especially the Victorian and Edwardian ages so therefore have always loved watching this movie which is also a sweet version of the Gift of the Magi. The costumes have always intrigued me the most and that, coupled with the fact that I am the same age as Marie Osmond, and was once a big fan of the Brothers' music (that's where the nostalgia comes in), has kept me watching this at least once a year. I like that others have mentioned it as a Christmas tradition and would like to start that in my own family too because they just don't make them like this anymore. I think Marie was pretty good as the young lady, if not great. It's very melodramatic in parts but that's the genre and style, enjoy it and try not to judge it when immersed in today's societal harshness. It's a tale of sacrifice and love, not often told.",1336348800,2,922,4.335260115606936

It stars Marie Osmond and was probably meant as a star-making vehicle for her but she is supported by two really good actors in it - Timothy Bottoms and James Woods.  It's a sweet love story, set in turn of the century NY at Christmastime! I thought this was out of print and was really pleased to see it offered on DVD.",1324080000,,525,4.282828282828283

The story is based on a short story written by O. Henry, a writer of the late 19th century, called The Gift of the Magi.  This movie is a story set in the early 1900s, so the wardrobes and sets bring you back to a more romantic time.  It's about a young couple who fall in love against the wishes of family and out of line with proper associations between the classes.

Marie Osmond is beautiful as the young Beth promised in marriage to a wealthy man she does not love.  She sings a beautiful song ""The Gift of Love"" upon which they drew the name of the movie.  Timothy Bottoms is Rudy, an immigrant from Switzerland (also destined to marry a girl he does not love).  In keeping with the original story, they both sacrifice the most valuable things they own to give a gift to the other.

This is a love story made back in the day when a love story wasn't about sex, money, or a reality show.  You can watch this one with your whole family and feel good about the message your children will go away with.",1322092800,2,1276,4.171428571428572

The movie is clean, no swearing, no nudity, no inappropriate jokes or innuendos. Just a good old fashioned Christmas Story about being selfless and cherishing the ones you love.  Marie and Timothy are fantastic as well as the rest of the cast.  I especially enjoyed watching a young James Woods, who plays the nerdy fiance to Marie.

It will leave you warm and tingly for days.  I truly don't think the story could be any sweeter, or acted any more lovingly.  Now, it is easy to assume that such a sweet love story would be cheesy.  It's not, not at all.  However, it is the definition of innocence, which can be mistaken as cheesy.  The acting, as stated before, is perfect for the story, the one song she sings is haunting and will stay with you, the filming technique (while dated and not high quality) actually adds a warmth and dimension to the film.
