8649163,1,B00J9XISDA,"Wow, another really bad horror flick that tricked me with its slick cover.  Bad acting, bad script, bad directing, bad cinematography, dumb demons (people crawling around in brown monkish-type cloaks).  Calling it ""amateurish"" would be an insult to home videographers.  Horror movie, no, horrible movie, yes!  Save your money and some precious minutes of your life.  Don't be duped like me.",1447200000,,390,5.327868852459017

8649167,5,B00J9XISDA,"Finally, a worthy horror movie made after 1988!!!  I really, really enjoyed this indie effort and would recommend this over any Hollywood mega-budget so-called horror garbage any day.  Original story, good acting, nice shooting location, great ending, and cool practical gore effects (I wish CGI had never been invented and very much appreciate any time filmmakers do it the old-fashioned way).  While fans of millennial horror may not find this their cup of tea, if you're a fan of solid, low-budget horror films, do yourself a favor and check Night Things out.  And to the makers of Night Things - thank you for NOT shooting this in high definition or even digitally (at least that's the look they gave it... not sure if it was shot that way or manipulated in post-production, but either way, it looks great and really fits the story and location well).  One last thank you to the filmmakers -- it was a JOY to not see any cell phones in the film and I really appreciate the fact that they never disclosed what year, or even decade, this was taking place. I've seen dozens of million dollar horror films that WISH they were this entertaining.  I'm a jaded horror fan who grew up during the ""golden age"" or horror (the slasher boom of the early-mid 80s) and usually dislike every horror film I watch that was made after 1988, with a few exceptions.  This is definitely one of those exceptions.  Highly recommended !!!!",1433548800,,1419,4.693548387096774
8649168,3,B00J9XISDA,"I'm giving this movie three stars because it does have a very interesting story but the acting, effects, makeup and directing style remind me of the film projects high school kids and college kids do.  (I went to an art high school and the movies shot by some kids in the Visuals department would be shown on a large screen in the auditorium for people to see.)  All and all, it is a good movie.",1422748800,2,395,4.253333333333333
8649169,5,B00J9XISDA,"Monsters, crazies, mysterious machines, and a woman with a big gun. This movie is low budget but its fun, scary, funny, and suspenseful. The lead actresses are great. Really creative story. Thoroughly enjoyable. See what happens when the night things are creeping toward the cabin and the gasoline generator runs out of gas.  The ending is completely unexpected and ingenious.",1403222400,,376,5.266666666666667
8649170,5,B00J9XISDA,Intriguing story that really gets moving about 1/3 through and creates some real tension. Creative film-making on a budget at its finest.,1401148800,3,137,5.2727272727272725
8649171,5,B00J9XISDA,"This is the kind of low budget movie where you can tell the filmmakers really, really wanted to make a great movie despite not having the Hollywood millions.

The story is one part unimaginable Lovecraftian monsters, one part trapped in the woods, and one part ancient technology.  With the leads doing an impressive job delivering carefully crafted dialogue.  By the look of the film I get the impression it was shot on old film stock.  Grainy and visually somewhat like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  With the latest high-def cameras it can be hard to tell what it was shot on, but with this you know you are watching film.

Perhaps best of all was the music, something I can only describe as sounding like outer space if it was placed underwater.  Atmospheric and at times terrifying, half the time I couldn't tell if the composer was using a real instrument or playing piano strings with a femur he stole from a medical school.

Don't get me wrong, there are places the low budget shows through.  Some of the special effects don't quite make it, and there is the occasional audio issue or rushed scene.  But overall this is a must-have diamond in the rough for any serious horror fans library.",1396656000,12,1205,4.668246445497631
