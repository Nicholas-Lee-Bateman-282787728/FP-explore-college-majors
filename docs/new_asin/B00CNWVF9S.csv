5731310,5,B00CNWVF9S,"I love this dvd!  After feeling overwhelmed by the millions of pilates dvds out there I ended up choosing this one because it was recommended by a friend and because I looked up the instructor and she's legit.  She's certified in power pilates (requires over 600 hours of training) and contributes regularly to Pilates Style Magazine. Anyways, good buy, I'm very happy with the product.  Not too hard, not too easy (when you're at home you can kinda go your own pace anyways I guess).  I've been using this instead of paying for a gym membership and so far I'd say that it has totally paid for itself!",1373846400,14,601,4.537037037037037
5731311,5,B00CNWVF9S,I loved how easy she is to follow. Her directions are precise and the explanations of why things should be done the way she directs makes sense. Great workout!,1371340800,7,159,4.517241379310345
5731312,5,B00CNWVF9S,"I am a client of Andrea's in Los Angeles and picked up her DVD for when I travel out of town. It is a great workout and for those that live outside of Los Angeles, this DVD is like having a private class with Andrea. I am now using this in between classes and have found the exercises to be challenging and great for getting/keeping in shape.

5731313,5,B00CNWVF9S,"Andrea Speir is super easy to watch because she just comes across so nice with her sweet California Girl smile! She's no bootcamp-instructor nor new-agey yoga teacher; she'll teach you exactly what to do in a straight-forward, unintimidating way. She's like that friend you have who happens to be an elite Pilates teacher, and just decided to give you a free session today.

That said, I wasn't planning on being as sore as I was the next day after I first tried this workout! I was really surprised at how deep I felt my whole core! The workout itself was fun and, though I knew some of the moves were challenging, I didn't ever feel like I wanted to give up.

Kudos, Andrea, for making a tough workout that made me sore EV-ERY-WHERE without making me feel like it was too much while I was in it. Looking forward to the next one already!",1370908800,10,838,4.435064935064935
5731314,5,B00CNWVF9S,"Perfect to do in your own home.  Instructor is incredibly clear and specific-- pilates requires an excellent instructor for maximum effect, and Andrea Speir is great.  Motivating, positive... and she has a ridiculously amazing body.  If that's what you get for practicing Pilates, I'm in.

Good for all levels.  I like to take it when I travel for a workout.  Sections are viewable as desired, so whatever part you want to do is easy to access.",1370822400,3,444,4.776315789473684

I have only done pilates a handful of times and I was happy to discover that not only does Andrea Speir provide workouts that are clear and easy to follow, but they are also very challenging! I am already noticing my body slimming down and I am feeling stronger. Additionally, the wide variety of workouts keeps me interested and motivated! I seriously cannot recommend this DVD enough!",1370822400,3,532,4.33
5731316,5,B00CNWVF9S,"These workouts are really solid.  The instruction is clear and specific -  the instructor really seems to know her stuff.

5731318,4,B00CNWVF9S,I don't like that the setting for this video which is on top of a building with a city background.  The setting is not appealing and the noises are distracting.  The exercises are good but not a video I use often due to the setting.,1451692800,,232,4.133333333333334

5731326,5,B00CNWVF9S,"PERFECT PILATES DVD!

I couldn't have dreamed of a better one! I wanted a classic, simple, to the point smartly organized Pilates DVD. What I absolutely LOVE about this one and is often/always missing from other Pilates DVDs is the following:

- No unnecessary music: who wants or needs lame/bad/not in your taste music while they are listening to instructions and focusing? I don't want to be forced to listen to lame background music while I work out, if I want music I can play my own while the instructor is talking.

- Clear to the point directives: The instructor does not babble about mystic spiritual stuff that I didn't ask for. She starts right away with the workout. I don't have to fast forward because she's talking about her life/bio/the universe for 10 minutes as I have experienced in other stupid DVDs. Yes, I wrote it: stupid: lots of stupid DVDs out there. One even has a dude play on a drum and the camera zooms on him during workouts WTF?

- Smartly broken down into 10 minute segments: So amazing!!! I can mix and match segments, workout for 10 to 60 minutes if I want to and it's easy to do.

- Classic Pilates: No weird fusion cardio bulls*** here. Just Pilates. I don't want to sweat like I'm in a tropical forest, I want to tone my muscles and stretch and this is exactly what these exercises are about.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! The instructor is awesome, the setting is on a rooftop (not a cheesy clich by the sea/nature thing where we are forced to listen to the sea) it's visually not annoying, the camera doesn't move a million times. I've never followed a routine as easily as this EVER. Usually I struggle to get it the first time without being glued to the screen. I stopped using the 3 Pilates DVDs I tried in the past after giving them a second chance and stopped because they annoyed the bananas out of me!

FINALLY I do my Pilates every morning because this DVD IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR.
Thank you Andrea Speir and your team for GETTING IT.",1419811200,14,2001,4.40650406504065
5731327,5,B00CNWVF9S,Very tough! Not for beginners. This video is a workout not your classic Pilates stretching. It's a great goal to work towards.,1416355200,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5731328,5,B00CNWVF9S,Love Andrea.  The short segments make it easy to pick and choose what area of the body to concentrate on.  I usually do 3 a day at different times of the day when I have a spare 10 minutes.  Perfect!!,1409356800,2,200,3.95
5731329,1,B00CNWVF9S,"Wish someone had posted this sooner - the instructor of this video says (during the ab workout section) that the workout is straining on the neck.  Also, it is clear that little to no thought was given to the dvd production of these (originally app-availible workouts); a lot of constant background noise is heard throughout the recordings and there is not a ""play all"" or customizable feature on the dvd.  All in all, I strongly believe this dvd is not worth owning.  I had to return it.",1404691200,8,488,4.586206896551724
5731330,4,B00CNWVF9S,"Easy-to-follow, for beginner to intermediate.",1403827200,,45,8.2
5731331,5,B00CNWVF9S,I've been doing Pilates 3 times a week either New York or Los Angeles for about 8 years. This is some of the best teaching I've had- really clear cues and refreshingly classical. I've shown some of my teachers and they said Andrea is top notch. I love that she doesn't teach a million reps with bad form just for a cheap workout since that isn't what Pilates is. I feel like this DVD has refined my form. A must have for a true Pilates lover.,1403049600,3,442,4.151162790697675
5731332,4,B00CNWVF9S,"I liked the workout, but it was hard to understand. The video quality was poor, because of the wind. Ok, though.",1402272000,2,112,4.380952380952381
5731333,3,B00CNWVF9S,"I recently started doing pilates at a local gym and wanted a DVD for home - the reviews sold me on ""Perfect Pilates Body.""  I confess that I was disappointed.  Andrea is very likable, wonderful at letting you know proper form, and I liked the fact that the menu had separate chapters for every body part.  However, I found every chapter to be very easy and not in the least bit challenging.  I am used to doing high repetitions of most exercises so seeing that I only needed to do five or ten for the moves here... well, I didn't feel as though I got a workout.  I did this in my sauna of a living room (90 degrees today) and didn't even break a sweat.

I would recommend this DVD for pilates beginners, though.  Andrea takes you through the ""pilates 100"" and ""pilates five"" so it's a great introduction to pilates in general.  Andrea is very pleasant and does make sure that every exercise is performed correctly in order to avoid injury.  If she comes out with a more advanced video I wouldn't hesitate to buy it!  My only other gripe is the lack of music but I think that after a few viewings you can add your own as you'll know the moves down pat.  I'll keep using this DVD but only on days when I'm too tired to give it my all or just want some something low key.  I suppose I'm too used to Jessica Smith's more difficult DVDs (""Better Body Blast,"" I'm talking to you!) that this was a snap in comparison, which is by no means a slight against Andrea.  I don't regret the purchase, I just wish it pushed me a little more.",1399766400,3,1526,4.220689655172414
5731334,5,B00CNWVF9S,"I haven't gone through all the routines yet, but like it so far.  This is my second pilates DVD, so I would say I am reaching the intermediate stage.  I am 67 yrs. old and have not had any difficulty except for a couple of the moves, which I modify until I become more accustomed.  I like the presentation, and the short workouts.  It is much easier for me to be disciplined with exercise if the program is short and the repetitions few.  I only do 1 - 10 min.  session every other day. Instructor is pleasant and easy to follow.",1398124800,2,529,4.188118811881188
5731335,5,B00CNWVF9S,This video is great for individuals who has limited time to exercises and would like the option to do 10 minute sessions or complete all the sessions for a 60 minutes workout.  The instructor is gives helpful directions and cues throughout the video.  Well worth the money!.,1395619200,4,274,4.808510638297872
5731336,5,B00CNWVF9S,"Clear instruction. Attractive instructor. I love the relatively fast going and fun routine. Though each section is only 10 minutes, I feel well (not over) exerciesed. I usually only feel very mild soreness the next day. I am 35 and generally health. I do not like exerices but feel addicted to this one. Very nice choice for beginners.",1393891200,7,335,4.793103448275862
8583826,4,B00CNWVF9S,"I have been doing Pilates on and off for years.  Now that I am a yoga instructor, I find it hard to keep Pilates in my schedule.  A friend gave me this DVD, and I hoped that the short segments would help keep me motivated to do Pilates on a more regular basis.

This DVD offers a total of eight segments, each about 10 minutes or a little less.  It is taught by Pilates instructor Andrea Speir.  Speir teaches live, and there is not a lot of detail to her instruction--she seems to assume basic familiarity with Pilates moves, making this workout most appropriate for experienced beginners to intermediate.  There is no ""Play All"" option on the DVD, but if you select a segment off the Main Menu, the next one will begin to play after automatically.  I have provided breakdowns (including times in parentheses) for each segment below.

WARM-UP (10:02)
In this segment, Speir provides coaching on engaging the abs.  She includes simple move such as a neck stretch and pelvic lifts and modified versions of Pilates classic exercises, including the hundred, leg circles, half roll-backs, spine stretch forward, and saw.  She concludes with a lunge to stretch the hamstrings.

CORE BLAST (10:02)
Speir states that this is an abs-focused segment.  She begins with several different versions of a leg push and then moves into circles and a variation on roll-ups.  She then performs the full series of five (single leg stretch - double leg stretch - straight leg stretch - leg lowers - criss-cross) and finishes with side-lying oblique work.

THE SKINNY JEANS (9:30)
This routine focuses on the hips and thighs.  Speir starts side-lying for moves from the leg kick series, including exercises for both the outer and inner thighs.  After a brief Figure 4 stretch on the back, she comes to knees for kneeling leg kicks.  She performs a mermaid stretch and then one final move, a standing plie on the toes.

TIGHT TUSH (8:38)
This glutes-focused segment uses a single light hand weight.  Speir begins lying on the back for bridge lifts, performing several variations, including 1-leg pulse.  Coming to a prone position, she moves through ballet lifts and swimming.  Next, Speir transitions to hands and knees, placing the weight behind one knee for donkey kicks.  She concludes with leg lifts from plank and a narrow downward dog stance.

CHISELED ARMS (9:07)
This segments uses two light weights, 2-5 lbs.  Speir starts seated, performing several traditional Pilates arms moves (e.g., circles and shaving) from this position.  Setting the weights aside, she comes to the floor for swan prep and triceps dips.  Speir finishes standing, again using both weights for a series of exercises.  She concludes with three sets of Pilates push-ups.

FULL BODY FLOW (8:49)
Speir calls this a ""fast-paced"" segment to use as a full-body workout when you are short on time.  She starts with the hundred and then moves quickly into a full roll-up and full roll-over.  This is followed by a more advanced version of the single stretch leg stretch.  Next is rolling like a ball and open-leg rocker prep.  Speir also includes a spider plank and roll-up to standing.

STRETCHING FOR FLEXIBILITY (7:30)
This section included yoga-like stretches, although Speir moved through them fairly quickly, without holding the stretches.  She starts lying on her back with a reclined leg stretch/twist, moving into climbing the tree.  She also includes lunge work, hamstring stretch, and lateral stretches standing.

BONUS: MAGIC CIRCLE MELTDOWN (9:15)
A Pilates Magic Circle is required for this segment.  Speir starts by using the circle for a prone hamstring stretch.  Next, the circle is used for a inner thigh squeeze followed by the double leg stretch with the circle.  Speir then incorporates the circle into the Pilates side kick series.  After a stretch on the back, she comes to standing for arm squeezes using the circle first held to the front, then to the back to work the triceps.

The routines are filmed on the top of a city building, which is attractive enough, but the sound editing is poor--i.e., there is a lot of wind noise that can be quite distracting.  As noted above, Speir's instruction tends to be minimalistic, and she rarely mentions modifications for those less flexible than she is.  Therefore, I would mainly recommend this DVD to those who are already familiar with Pilates and who want short, effective workouts at a mostly low intermediate level.",1487548800,,4441,4.944594594594594
8583827,4,B00CNWVF9S,Fantastic workout.  I love Andrea and the 10 min workouts mean you can choose which areas of the body to work.,1469491200,,110,4.238095238095238
8583828,2,B00CNWVF9S,Love the video. Hate that it isn't set up in 10 minutes episodes so that I can hand pick each exercise. If I want to watch a specific one I have to fast forward and guess where the next one starts. It's pretty annoying.,1464566400,,219,4.0
8583829,5,B00CNWVF9S,"This is a great workout and Andrea Speir does an excellent job explaining the exercises. My only wish for improvement would be to make each 10 minute segment its own chapter so we could choose which workouts we wanted to do from a menu, rather than by fast-forwarding.",1463961600,,268,4.604166666666667
8583830,3,B00CNWVF9S,"I'm a HUGE fan of pilates, but struggle to find a DVD that keeps me challenged with high reps while providing modifications for my injuries. Most of the DVDs or youtube videos I have come across are either not challenging enough, don't provide adequate instruction, or don't provide modifications on (which I'm a big stickler for since I have lower back pain). This video, unfortunately, falls into the not challenging enough category. There are some exercises that are really good, but I'm not digging the 10-minute segments overall. I wish it was one fluid 50-60 minute video. I did experience some streaming issues in each 10-minute segment, but it only skipped a few seconds so I was able to keep going without losing my place or form. I'm glad that I rented this before buying it. I would recommend the same if your intermediate to advanced in pilates.",1461801600,,857,4.797297297297297
8583831,3,B00CNWVF9S,"I really wanted to love this. Andrea is beautiful, inspiring and in great shape. I hope she makes more videos in the future. The biggest negative for me was the sound quality. It was filmed on a roof top and on top of all the street noise, the wind hitting the mic made it hard to hear the instruction at times (the sound of wind is one thing, the sound of wind hitting a mic is annoying). I also had some technical issues (but that maybe unique to my computer and server). The video stopped every few minutes. Another disappointing technical issue was that this is advertised to have 10minute sections. However, the only way I could find to get to each segment was to repeatedly hit the 15second fast forward button. No chapter headings to skip to. All in all is was disappointing, but more from technical issues than the actual workout.",1458000000,,838,4.483660130718954

8583834,5,B00CNWVF9S,"Amazing workout. When I can't make it to a live class, this is my absolute go-to. She is inspiring and just fun to watch. Highly recommended.",1457222400,,141,4.461538461538462
8583835,1,B00CNWVF9S,"All those rave reviews must have been written by Andreas friends because there's nothing special about this DVD. This is the same old stuff I learned years ago from Mari Winsor. And most of the workouts are around eight minutes, NOT ten as it says. Definitely not worth the extremely high price!!! If you want a good workout get a Jessica Smith dvd.",1456790400,,349,4.555555555555555
