1359590,3,B00004W19N,"I have to say that I loved the first Nunsense.  This one kinda left me wanting though.  The humor and the chemistry from the first one wasn't here.  It was funny, but just wasn't up to par with the first one.  While I enjoyed the idea, it was just okay.",1217289600,,253,4.0
1359591,5,B00004W19N,Thhis is as fun as the original play/musical. All the original characters return to provide joy and fun for the audience. A definite keeper in any video collection.,1198195200,,164,4.892857142857143
1359592,5,B00004W19N,I love Sister Amnesia she just the best actress I have seen in comedy yet! I purchased this CD as used but to me it looked as if it was brand new. I was surprised it only took four days to be delivered. I was expecting to take at least two weeks to get here. I just like how they make fun of Cathlics without upsetting anyone. If you can't make fun of you'r own relgion you have problems.,1190592000,,388,3.9240506329113924
