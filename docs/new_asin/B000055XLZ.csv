1394314,1,B000055XLZ,"I've seen a whole lot of 'bad' horror movies but this one is pretty bad.  The original box description made it sound like it might be worth watching but save your money/time and try something else.  There is virtually no action until about 50 minutes into the movie.  Even then, it is fairly mild and there is really not much in the way of F/X to speak of.

The 'story' is weak and quite frankly I just wanted to turn it off more than anything else but kept hoping that it would get better.  Well, it did not, ( hence the 1 star ).",1090454400,3,531,4.0673076923076925
1394315,2,B000055XLZ,"The movie is somewhat entertaining at times. The killings in the film were gorey enough, but a little dissapointing. The first killing was pretty unexpected ""the church step killing"" But the way it was shot was really choppy and I think that took away from the scene a bit. A good thing about it was it was pretty original: a sharp toy through the eye followed by a  stabbing (I think the people were stabbed?) There are a couple of more deaths in the film but none as original as the first except for the Christmas tree star throat cutting that is. The music in the film was creepy at times but mostly annoying. The particulary annoying sounds were the ones that seemed to be heard at innapropriate times. For instance the scene were ""Santa"" is hidding from the townspeople. There was some sort of cymbil sound there and my question is why. I was like it belonged in a different scene. I think the lead role was performed well by the lead actor but the writing of the film was lacking. Although the beggining of the film was somewhat shocking and original alot of the film is not and the ending definatly leaves something to be desired. I will say this. This is the best horror film about a killer santa and only because its the only one I have seen.",1085011200,,1251,4.392241379310345
1394316,4,B000055XLZ,"CHRISTMAS EVIL is a surprisingly chilling, effective and well-made horror film that rubs off as more of a character study than a true slasher film. As a boy, Harry saw his mother making love with Santa Claus, and in his adulthood, he owns a toy store called 'Jolly Dream'. Little do the townspeople and the employees know that Harry is now a crazed killer - Santa's number one fan - and he'll do anything to keep the tradition going by keeping track of who has been naughty and who has been nice. Brandon Maggart is exceptional as the psycho Santa in this atmospheric and frightening tale that mixes in some humour as well. The music and sound is equally great, combining the superb effects of orchestral pieces to synth to make the ultimate in terror soundtrack. This horror movie, though a little slow-moving at times, is a little gem that has finally been rewarded with a DVD release, and rightfully so. This could obviously be the (ahem) second best Christmas horror film, falling right under the place of BLACK CHRISTMAS.
CHRISTMAS EVIL was released under two alternate titles - TERROR IN TOYLAND, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.",1082419200,,1124,4.739795918367347
1394317,3,B000055XLZ,"Originally titled YOU BETTER WATCH OUT (and a.k.a. TERROR IN TOYLAND), 1980's CHRISTMAS EVIL amounts to little more than a crass attempt to hitch onto the holiday-horror gravy train initiated by John Carpenter's universally better HALLOWEEN in 1978.  It's only notable for the fact that it was the first of the HALLOWEEN rip-offs to feature a Killer Kris Kringle (fortunately, it wasn't the last!).

Character actor Brandon Maggart--who, by the way, was a member of the original cast of TV's SESAME STREET and is the father of pop singer Fiona Apple--portrays Harry Stadling, a sexually repressed middle-manager at the Jolly Dream Toy Factory who is haunted by a childhood incident in which he saw Ol' Saint Nick joyfully boffing mommy amidst the presents under the tree on Christmas Eve.  One nasty Nol, the blatant commercialistic attitudes exuded by his family and coworkers burns at his psyche until his subconscious finally boils over, and Harry then blithely dons the red and white and hunts down both the naughty and the nice to mete out their just deserts.  To the innocents and the kiddies, he delivers dreamy delights; to the cruel and calloused, he doles out death!

Now, a story with a serial-killer Santa is a delightfully twisted concept that offers lots of opportunity for dark humor and satirical subtext.  Alas, CHRISTMAS EVIL simply falls flat.  The ineptly handled schizophrenic shifting between chills and chuckles makes for confusing viewing, leaving one tempted to conclude that the screenwriter is just as loony as Harry Standling himself.  And to top it all off, the film's feel-good surprise-ending is glaringly out of sync with the overall tone of the rest of the film.

To be fair, it must be said that CHRISTMAS EVIL does contain a few items of merit.  In spite of the mediocre material he has to work with, Brandon Maggart does a great job as psychotic Harry Stadling.  Maggart is an offbeat but interesting actor who adds a little consistency to an otherwise arrhythmic flick. And one of the few really good scenes in CHRISTMAS EVIL is a delightful homage to James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN (1931) in which Harry--in full Santa regalia--is chased through the streets by angry citizens carrying fiery torches.  For genre fans with a good sense of humor, this scene is a real knee-slapper that just begs to have a better movie built around it.

And the DVD from Troma?  Well, the digital transfer isn't of the greatest quality, sometimes displaying the type of jittery edges and ghost-like artifacts that leaves one wondering if the much-lauded re-mastering of CHRISTMAS EVIL was done on VHS video tape.  However, the extras on the disc are actually better than the movie itself.  There is an optional feature commentary with star Brandon Maggart and director Lewis Jackson, as well as individual video interviews with each.  A nifty storyboard-to-film utility allows you to first view the director's hand-drawn concept for each scene, then it lets you jump over to view the scene as filmed.  Another cool feature allows you to ""flip"" through the comment cards that members of the audience filled out after a test-screening of the flick.  And best of all, each time you select an option at the main menu, a close-up of Santa's face fills the screen as he wickedly utters ""Ho-Ho-Ho"" before engaging your selection.  Fun stuff!

CHRISTMAS EVIL review in short: Frankly, the film itself deserves only two stars, while the fun-packed Troma DVD is a four-star product.  The average score, then, is three stars.",1077667200,6,3528,4.994871794871795

In short, its about a guy who works at a toy factory and is obsessed with Christmas.  His apartment is decorated for the holiday all year long!  Slowly, over the course of the film, he starts to flip out over the crass commercialization of the holiday.  It seems the toy factory is more concerned with making money than manufacturing qulity toys.  Throughout the film, our protagonist gets revenge in  variety of ways that ultimately become murder.

1394320,4,B000055XLZ,"Christmas Evil holds a unique spot in the genre of Christmas slasher films.  While a few individuals are murdered, there so little blood that I would not classify this as a slasher film at all.  This is more of a psychological treatment that transcends horror of a primal nature.  In its own special twisted way, Christmas Evil is really sort of touching, and I would argue that it actually does possess a measure of real Christmas spirit.  Harry isn't a bad guy; his heart is in the right place - it's just a few of his toys of death that end up in wrong places such as someone else's neck.  As a young child, Harry sees disturbing evidence before his very eyes that Santa Claus is not real, and this experience scars him for life.  He does not let the Christmas spirit die in him, however; the spirit actually grows to the point that, as a forty-something year old man, he tries to become Santa Claus and spread joy to good little children.  He spies on the neighborhood kids, writing down notes in his books of naught boys and girls.  As a newly-promoted manager at a toy factory, he is dismayed to see inferior-quality toys rolling off the assembly line, his co-workers speak badly of the holidays, and a new hotshot executive puts forth a promotional campaign to send toys to a children's hospital without knowing or caring if there will be enough for the kids.  Eventually, poor Harry snaps, dons a Santa suit, and goes out to spread Christmas spirit all around.  Of course, a few adults have been very bad in his eyes, and a few of them end up dead.
Brandon Maggart is really quite good in the role of Harry.  Some of his laughing fits early on are rather annoying, but his face really shows a lot of emotion and complexity, especially on those occasions when he is doing something that will make children happy and when he finally comes to grip with the idea that his plan to give everyone a real Santa has failed.  Take away Harry's obvious mental unbalance and you are left with a weird sort of inspirational story, one that actually fits in to some degree with classic Christmas tales such as A Christmas Carol.  I'm not saying this is a movie every family needs to watch every Christmas Eve - that is clearly not the case.  However, Harry, in his own tragically disastrous way, does have the Christmas spirit and tries to keep it in his heart every single day, and that is what I will remember about him the most.",1051920000,31,2425,4.469387755102041

1394322,5,B000055XLZ,"CHRISTMAS EVIL is one of those little classics that has gained a cult following and has managed to keep a low profile through the years.  Sometimes confused with other movies like BLACK CHRISTMAS or SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT (and for the record all 3 movies are very different) CHRISTMAS EVIL is not so much a horror movie as it is a dark comedy about a man's journey into insanity.  I don't want you to get the wrong impression since CHRSITMAS EVIL isn't a comedy, but it is light hearted in the way it shows and depicts the main character believing he is Santa Clause.  Which brings us to the story.  A man, who was traumatized as a boy by seeing his mother getting laid by old st. Nick, grows up into believing he is the real, better Santa Clause and can bring good to the world.  Its almost hard to describe exactly what makes this movie so good or what makes this movie so scary.  You really have to see it to believe it.  It takes you on a journey into the mind of a mentally disturbed individual while showing us violence and comedy all in the happy holiday setting.  And as for the ending which many people say is confusing.....it's not confusing if you think it over and have a little faith.

1394323,5,B000055XLZ,"Greetings from Tromaville!
Aside from being John Waters's favorite Christmas movie, this film is known as the best of the Holiday Horror genre. Originally titled ""You better watch out....."", and also known as ""Terror in Toyland"", the film was re-released with the title ""Christmas Evil"" to cash in on the success of ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"".
But ""Christmas Evil"" is a much different film. Contrary to the cover art, ""Christmas Evil"" is a psychological horror film that digs deep into the mind of a person who loves Santa, and hates the greedy.
He always brings presents to the ""nice"", such as numerous toys for the children's hospital. What makes it a horror film is that he treats those who have been ""Naughty"" with death.
There are two things commonly misinterpreted about the film. First of all, it is not anti-Christmas. If anything, it's against the commercialization of Christmas.
Second, it's not completely a psychological horror film. It's mostly a dark-comedy in the  vein of ""Jack Frost"" (not the conglomerate crappy Keaton one, but the horror/comedy distributed by A-Pix Entertainment.) that will leave you mesmorised.
It also contains running commontary with the director, and the star, Brandon Maggart, who is the father of pop princess Fiona Apple, as well as a special holiday introduction with Troma President Lloyd Kaufman.
In conclusion, see ""Christmas Evil"". It will do for Christmas what Charles Kaufman's ""Mother's Day"" did for Mother's Day",995328000,23,1466,5.185654008438819
1394324,5,B000055XLZ,"This is my favorite Christmas horror flick! I was super stoked when it was released on blu ray. Looks great, couldn't be happier!",1482105600,,129,4.6521739130434785
1394325,5,B000055XLZ,"This is certainly one of the great psychological horror films you most likely have never heard of.
Luckily, I was able to find out about this film while reading John Waters book Crackpot. Like anything John Waters, it too is worth your time and money.

Christmas Evil revolves around Harry, a man who loves Christmas with all of his heart and has a mental breakdown so severe that he now believes he is Santa Claus.

This film receives a lot of flak because it has been incorrectly labeled as a slasher film, which I can only imagine was because it was a horror film that came out in the 1980s and people happen to die in it. If you're looking for a high body count, this movie will not give you what you want. If you're looking for an interesting character study about a mans descent into madness, youll receive exactly what you're looking for.

It is mesmerizing to watch the detail the makers of this film put into the obsession Harry has for the holiday season. His apartment is filled with Santa Claus memorabilia and instead of using cheap notebooks, they use these wonderful looking hardcover books for his Naughty and Nice list of neighborhood children that look exactly like the books any other movie Santa Claus would use. The attention to detail alone should make it obvious that this is not another slasher film.

And of course there is the ending you will never forget that will either make you angry or maybe bring a smile to your face.
If you're interested in seeing a film that might answer the question What if someone as crazy Norman Bates or Buffalo Bill had an unhealthy obsession with Christmas? or if you consider yourself a diehard fan of the horror genre., this is very much worth a watch.",1480896000,,1713,4.5519480519480515
1394326,4,B000055XLZ,"Picked the Blu Ray combo up to replace my old DVD (which replaced my old VHS copy) and to hear John Waters' commentary. The image looks great (both discs) on my big screen and the extras are worth watching. I enjoy the movie on it's own and Waters' commentary is worthy watching the movie again with his audio track.

Harry sees Santa trying to get busy with his mom in '47 and it affects him deeply. Fast forward to today (then 1980) and Harry works at the Jolly toy factory (they seem to make some of the lamest toys ever that are now made in China & sold in dollar stores. Petition Trump to bring Jolly jobs back.)  Harry keeps Christmas going all year 'round in his apartment and creepily spies on the neighborhood kids and records their activities in either his nice or naughty books.

Harry looses it when his company screws over donating toys and a co-worker uses him. He goes on a killing & creeping spree to right the wrongs.

More of a psychological horror movie with a ton of creepy imagery thrown in (some of the the toys and creepy Xmas decorations are enough to make you denounce the holiday.) Patricia Richardson (in her first role) is more famous as the wife in ""Home Improvement"" is seen briefly slapping her kid around and Harry's brother is played by Jeffrey DeMunn. J.D. would later play ""Dale"" from seasons 1 & 2 of ""The Walking Dead.""

Easily earns it's cult status and a welcome addition to your horror / Christmas collection.",1480291200,,1449,4.494296577946768

1394333,4,B000055XLZ,"Plot and Character description: It focuses on two brothers Harry and Phil Stadling(but mainly Harry).  As a child, while Phil sleeps Harry walks down the steps to get a view of Santa.  None-the-less Harry gets more than he bargained for when he sees his father dressed as Santa sexually pleasing his mother.  Harry(Brandon Maggert), having no concept that it was his father dressed as Santa is traumatized over the incident.  33 years pass and Harry grows up a Santa Claus and Christmas obsessed fanatic.  His home is laden with loads of Christmas decs and for whatever reason, lots of dolls, doll houses, and puppets too.  Harry works at a greedy, corporate, toy factory named ""Jolly Dream"".  At Jolly Dream they make cheap, crappy toys that break easily.  Unfortunately, at work no one understands poor Harry nor takes him seriously.  To make matters worse his brother Phil is abusive to Harry and totally doesn't get him.  Harry lives alone in New Jersey, is unmarried and has no children, but has pretty good chemistry with the neighbor kids.  All except for one kid, ""Moss Garcia"".  Moss Garcia is top on Harry's naughty list.  Harry watches the children around the neighborhood and keeps two books; one listing the naughty kids and the other listing the nice kids.  After Harry is disheartened by his uncaring co-workers as well as learning how greedy and corporate Jolly Dream truly is at the company Christmas party that as Christmas draws near, Harry gets so exceedingly obsessed with Christmas and Santa Claus that he sinks deeply into madness with the idea of becoming the old fashioned(and non-commercial) Santa that he feels the world needs.  His plan is to reward the nice with gifts and punish the naughty with death.

One thing to keep in kind is that this is in no way a slasher movie.  This is a psychological thriller and still yet a Christmas horror movie, but not a slasher at all.  While there is some killing , the body count is 4.  A disappointing number sure, but, the movie wasn't looking to go in that sort of direction.  There's no actual stalking nor is there a stalker perspective.  Also unfortunately, there are no scenes of nudity.  That's one complaint that I do have about this movie.  Some say that it's a dark comedy.  Director Lewis Jackson claims that as well.  I personally don't see how it's intentionally funny.  Corny at times to where it will warrant a chuckle here and there sure, but actually comedic, no.

It's interesting the symbolism that this movie uses.  Let's take the angry torch-bearing mob of parents fearing for their children's lives.  On the surface that's what they are, but if you go deeper I find that they symbolize the corporate side of Christmas that doesn't wish for anything to change.  Whereas Harry symbolizes the old-fashioned side of Christmas of which he believes Santa to be the embodiment of.  So when he tells his mean brother Phil that people don't want Santa Claus anymore, he's referring to that idea.

The movie's musical score is beautifully done.  It carries the emotion and tone of the scenes perfectly.  It's mellow when the scene is mellow, menacing and creepy when something either goes wrong or Harry is going mad, and it's cheerful according to that tone of the scene wherever it applies.

And in regards to the sibling tensions, between Phil and Harry, I can totally relate to that part.  There is no question that Phil is a total f***ing a**hole.  He's verbally abusive towards Harry, He doesn't even try to relate to much less understand Harry, and he's always indicating that not only does he consider himself to be superior to him, but he acts like Harry is as bothersome as a cancerous tumor.  Being the youngest of two brothers, I can totally relate to this aspect of this movie.

The 4K remastering on the Blu-ray proves to be the best I've ever seen it.  The colors are much brighter, most of the scratches have been removed, the shadows are less intrusive, and the night scenes are easier to see.  The sound quality is nice and clear also.

Unfortunately, this movie has some flaws to it.  Within those flaws are these unanswered questions: in the 33 years, that have passed, since Harry's childhood trauma, that leaves the viewer with too many years with not much knowledge as to how Harry and Phil have been getting on all that time.  Among the information that you're not let in on, is as follows; how did Phil meet his wife?  When did they have their two boys?  What does Phil do for a living?  Has Harry ever dated?  Why doesn't Harry have a significant other?  Is it possible that women find Harry to be too weird?  What exactly is Harry's relationship with Phil's wife and their two sons like?  Why is it now that after 33 years Harry snaps and starts thinking himself to be Santa?  Why don't these people get family therapy if there are such tensions between them?  What exactly does Harry do the rest of the year?  Why was Harry peeking at Phil and his wife having sex? Why was that scene even necessary? And finally, how does Harry know the children of his neighborhood personally?  Some other flaws with the movie are the gimmicky and annoying sound effects(within the score) that are used from time to time.  Also the torch-bearing mob bit was really stupid.  While all of these flaws do indeed hurt the movie in part, they're still not enough to destroy the movie or its intentions.

Overall, while this movie is not perfect, nor is it even nearly as good as say Silent Night, Deadly Night for instance,  if you give it a chance, it manages to stand perfectly well on its own merits.  However, both movies have something in common, and that's the fact that both feature a main character who both face traumatic incidents during Christmas time bringing them to both go psycho and dress as Santa Claus.  That being said, this movie took the Christmas horror idea a bit further than Black Christmas before did it.  Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of Black Christmas also, but only the original from 1974.  This movie set a fresh new standard and direction 4 years prior to Silent Night, Deadly Night.  This movie took a bold new direction that was at that time unique.  I personally believe that it paved the way for such killer Santa movies such as Silent Night, Deadly Night, Santa Claws, and  Satan Claus, to name a few. The same year this movie came out  another great killer Santa movie came out and that movie was, ""To all a Goodnight"". Both this movie and that one are indeed are great examples of the Christmas Horror sub genre's incredible evolution over the years  in closing, after 35 years, I feel that this movie still has undebatable significance in both Christmas horror and 80's horror as well as being quite influential towards both.",1449360000,2,6757,4.67911714770798

Movie Review: As everyone else pointed out, it's not a slasher movie. It's a demented Christmas movie, pretty much. There are moments when Santa kills but it's one home invasion and mass slaughter. That's it. Anything else is Santa having a period about the fact no one gives a s*** about Christmas or whatever. I didn't hate this movie. I don't regret ever watching this but it's not my thing. It's innovative and different but for some reason I did not give one f*** about it. I found the movie boring. So up yours.

1394355,4,B000055XLZ,"The film opens on the night of Christmas Eve in 1947. Young Harry Stadling who believes in Santa Claus, catches his mother being sexually groped by Santa who an actuality is his father who's donning a Santa outfit. Having idolized Santa his entire life and taken aback by what he has just witnessed, Harry rushes to the attic, shatters a snow globe and cuts his hand with a shard of the glass from the globe.

Decades later, it's now 1980 and Harry is now an adult who works a lowly position at the Jolly Dreams toy factory with crooked co-workers. As Christmas draws closer, Harry falls into a slight depression, feeling that his most of his co-workers are deceitful and that most people generally take him for granted and are out to get him. Then one night, Harry has a breakdown and suddenly comes under the impression that he's Santa Claus.

Harry no longer in his right mind, dresses as Santa on Christmas Eve and goes out on the town and looks to reward the good with presents while he makes all who have wronged him pay...in their own blood.

Overall: Not exactly sure what to say about Christmas Evil. This doesn't seem like much of a horror but maybe a thriller. It also seems to be one of those movies where everything that happens is up to the viewer's interpretation. This can definitely be said about the rather unexpected ending this movie has as well. Our main character, Harry is our would-be villain; but is he really the bad guy if he's slaying those who've done wrong to him? The film does a good job at making you sympathize for the would-be villain but I can't tell if it's intentional or unintentional. Overall, Christmas Evil is a decent ""horror"" film but I personally don't think it's all that a lot of people are making it out to be. The plot and acting is acceptable but it's just the ending that leaves you scratching your head and wondering how, where, and why it fits in with the overall story.",1419379200,4,1923,4.504297994269341

1394387,5,B000055XLZ,"The Special Edition of this stunning film will not disappoint those who appreciate cinema and strive to understand the process of producing a masterpiece. Under the guidance of gifted director Lewis Jackson, Brandon Maggart gives nothing less than the performance of a lifetime and brings depth and subtlety to a character who could easily have become unintentially humorous if essayed by a less brilliant actor.  It is indeed a performance never to be forgotten.  With this special edition, not only do we have the director himself offering  us rare glimpses into the creative process and his unique genius, but fellow director John Waters is on hand to give his profound insights into what makes this virtually the most important motion picture of the 1980's.  After more than thiry years, we who study film finally have meaningful interpretations from the original source participant that will open invaluable vistas into what the film meant upon initial release and its enduring significance to fresh generations of audiences.  More than simply a commentary on the meaning of Christmas and the artificiality of the holiday season, a new viewer will discover a film that virtually defines the season as no other work ever has.  It is a disturbing, dark film, one that Jackson's imagery and the magnificent acting of Maggart have insured will remain more than just their own cineamatic triumph.  Through this special edition, the acclaim and recognition which eluded it due to the lack of sophistication of audiences of the time may at last grace it. It will haunt all who see it with what it has to say about holidays and the existential experience of the individual who must struggle alone over the course of a superficial and ultimately empty period of each year.

1394391,5,B000055XLZ,"EDIT: Amazingly, a little internet research wondering if the main actor in the film, Brandon Maggert, was still alive, brought this little piece of interesting news. He is Fiona Apple's FATHER. Yes, that's right. BIZARRE! Also he is still alive, and lives in Venice, CA.
I bought this film in one of those cheapo collections of horror films one finds in the bargain bin- you know, the ones with 20 or more films in them, half of them forgettable, a portion of them too dedicated to the slasher ethos, and one or two that made it worth the 9.99. This one, however, was even better than that. I daresay i would have paid 9.99 for this film alone, had I known how good it was.

As another reviewer wrote, this is not a slasher film at all, really. Its more of a psychological mindfreak with sinister Christmas overtones. The main character is a Santa obsessive who takes some traditions literally- and comes across as almost a fairy-tale boogyman in the process. He keeps a book for ""good children"" and another for ""bad children"". He spies on the bad ones and fetishizes the good ones (overtones of pedophilia). While being obviously a nutcase, the character is actually quite complex and one does feel something of pity for him at times- we definitely aren't dealing with a monochromatic psychopath in a hockey mask here. Which makes it all the more creepy when he DOES go full bore- there is one scene where he is staring at himself in the mirror that is particularly chilling and I even wondered about the actor's own sanity, he pulled it off so well.

I am happy to find that John Waters touts this film as being a holiday favorite- it definitely has something of a demented fairy-tale feel, and more thought seemed to have been put into this than your ordinary b-flick. I recommend it highly, and it is the perfect antidote to all the normal holiday treacle.",1298073600,,1860,4.599397590361446

1394407,4,B000055XLZ,"Troma goes slashing through the snow!

Here we have a festive horror movie that is quite a pleasant surprise for the holiday season. Many times Troma films will resort to juvenile, crude films with all the dignity and class of diarrhea. They might offer some good sick fun, but might leave some viewers with poop stains on the brain.

Christmas Evil balances the naughty and the nice in superb, even subtle form. Yes, subtlety from a Troma production, who would have thought? No nudity, vomiting, or attempts at gross-out humor here whatsoever. This is a character-driven story with solid acting and gentle doses of dark humor to coincide with the bloody mayhem.

The story revolves around Harry. As a kid he accidentally witnessed Santa messing around with his mother, which did some deep psychological damage to the boy. The classic slasher movie Silent Night, Deadly Night might have derived some sinister ideas from this plot aspect.

As Harry gets older, he becomes obsessed with Christmas and playing the role of Santa. Well, we soon learn that Santa giveth and Santa taketh away. Harry's violent urges eventually take control as he goes on a psychotic holiday rampage.

Things I really enjoyed from Christmas Evil:
--the story builds, no kills until an hour in
--decent budget (estimated $750,000)
--we get to see a toy manufacturer assembly line
--Harry spying on kids and writing notes in Good/Bad book
--the ending was totally unexpected and awesome!

John Waters calls this the ""greatest Christmas movie ever made"". I don't know about all that but it is a very good holiday film. Highly recommended!

1394408,5,B000055XLZ,"You Better Watch Out is set in a world that no longer exists. American-made toys may be extinct, but here they are assembled in the shadows of New York City. Televisions are black and white and the viewers don't use remotes. Geraldo Rivera's doppleganger appears from time to time on these tubes to report serious news stories. Areas adjacent to Montclair, New Jersey, are working class neighborhoods rather than homes of the McMansion. So this movie could have just as easily been directed by Fritz Lang than made a mere 30 years ago.

Harry, though, is all too common as a contemporary anti-hero. Coarse environs and rampant cynicism inspire alienation and anger. By the final reel, these impulses lead to murder and madness. Harry isn't Jason or Freddie. He is a pathetic figure pushed a little too hard by a world much too mean for Santa.

The greatness of this movie often is ascribed to Brandon Maggart's stellar performance as Harry, and that is undeniable. But there is an ensemble of talent not found in most major productions let alone low budget films. Small roles, some that feature wide-eyed children, are marvelously acted. The Christmas Eve atmosphere is gritty and dark. The cinematography is so voyeuristic that it almost induces shame; Maggart may gaze into the mirror at every opportunity to watch his Red Dragon-like transformation into Santa Claus, but the camera never takes its lens off of him. That took world class direction (this is how reality television would be if the subjects actually were ignorant they were recorded, and it would be most disturbing). Finally, there is not enough praise possible for the art director. Classical depictions of Santa as a harsh and malevolent judge are interspersed with the jolly cliches of the last century or so. This duality is an apt and brilliant representation of Harry.

So this is a B-movie that also is cinema. You Better Watch Out never lets you forget it is low budget, but it also causes you to think about yourself and your place in a cruel world. That makes it art, of course. For this reason, You Better Watch Out always reminds me of the better Corman classics, and of Bucket of Blood in particular. While made on the cheap, its depth and vision are a joy.

Finally, You Better Watch Out often is described as a holiday slasher, and that is inaccurate. While closer, it really isn't the psychological study frequently claimed, either. It is a tragedy that in the end inspires more sadness than exhiliration. There are no Billy Caldwells, and neither is Jimmy Stewart anywhere in the vicinity. But Harry can be found, just as he can be in all likelihood outside your door if not inside your home this holiday season.",1292198400,4,2696,4.803879310344827

1394410,4,B000055XLZ,"Harry Stradling has a problem. He was traumatized as a young child when he caught Santa Claus making cookies with mommy on Christmas Eve. Now, as an aged adult, he is completely obsessed with Christmas, working for a toy company where he tormented by his co-workers, living in an apartment that is decorated for Christmas year-round, all while watching the little girls and boys and taking notes on who has been naughty and nice. This is a special year, however; the year when Harry will take to the streets in his new Santa costume to spread his twisted Christmas cheer be handing out presents to the good boys and girls while punishing the naughty ones.

CHRISTMAS EVIL is a melodramatic character study that shares much more in common with Abel Ferrara's THE DRILLER KILLER than the holiday classic SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT. It is commonly mistaken for a Slasher film thanks to a misplaced marketing campaign, which often leads to disappointment with many genre fans. Brandon Maggart offers a sad and pitiful performance as the tortured and distraught Harry. He is frighteningly convincing in the role, selling his insanity through his manic behavior paired with a series of blank and lifeless expressions that reveal his distancing from reality. Maggart is easily the strongest element in the film, since the majority of Harry's character is revealed through his portrayal on screen, and not in the writing. There are several complex layers that director Lewis Jackson has accomplished through the film, playing with the concept of man versus myth, commenting on the commercialism of the holiday, and contrasting fantasy and reality. As the film progresses, the environments and score both become reflective of the darkening mental void that Harry is entering. By the end of the film, it is difficult to tell how much of the events on screen are still intact in reality, and how much of it is part of Harry's delusional fantasy. In truth, this is not a fun film, and it has not been tailored to the average gorehound that will be expecting buckets of blood and gore. Instead, it is a smartly crafted and well-played portrait of the darker side that the holiday can play on the psyche. If you can enter the film without the expectation of it being a Slasher film, I think there is a lot to like here.

This DVD actually shows his original assembly print titled YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT, and not only is it the same film it's a brand new (well, 2006) restored widescreen print shown in the original 1:78:1 theatrical ratio which Jackson personally supervised. Then there are the bonus materials: Audio commentaries with Lewis Jackson and John Waters, the original storyboard designs for the sequences (this was a VERY well planned out film, right down to the shot compositions which must be seen in widescreen for the full effect) audition reels of the cast talents and some VERY interesting ""deleted scenes"" that were removed during the editing process ... One of which shows the extent to which Harry was really being screwed by his co-workers & boss, which finally pushes him over the brink. Interesting!

The bargain bin DVDs all show recycled fullscreen home video prints transferred from analog tapes made back in the 80s. They may have a bonus trailer but according to Mr. Jackson they are all bootlegs, and that includes the now discontinued DVD by Troma. They all do the film a dis-service, and even though they only cost a dollar or two should be avoided. Or rather if you've ended up with one and have found the movie intriguing, time for an upgrade!

1394413,5,B000055XLZ,"This year when the holidays rolled around, we, Sid the Elf, tossed around the idea of reviewing a Christmas B. There was only one question: Which one of the many Christmas B horror flicks would we select? The obvious choice here is probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Night-Deadly-Night/dp/B000WC38A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Night, Deadly Night</a>.

Going in, we had almost no expectations of this film. Were we disappointed, thrilled, confused, or wildly ammused? Yes, yes, yes, and absolutely.

The first event in this film is a positively creepy Jackie Gleason-esque sequence in which Harry (our main character) witnesses his mother being given the business by Santa Claus(Harry's dad in costume). This tramatauzing experiance gives us the premise for the movie. We flash-forward to 33 years later. Harry now has a crap job at the fledgling Jolly Dreams toy factory. He has decided to become something of a real-life Santa Claus, sleeping in a Santa suit and decorating his apartment with an obscene ammount of Christmas paraphernalia. As if this wasn't strange enough, Harry also spies on neighborhood kids and jots their names down in his ""Good"" and ""Bad"" kids books. One of the many many bright spots of the film happens here when Harry catches one of the kids thumbing through a Penthouse Fairytales From the Darkside-style. The following day, Harry calls his brother to cancel Christmas Eve dinner because he has ""plans.""

Aparently, Harry's plans were to steal toys from his company and bring them to a Children's Hospital. Then, he went to the house of the kid with the Penthouse and dropped off a bag of dirt as a Christmas present. Did this teach the kid a lesson? Probably not. If he wanted to deter the kid from porn he should have dipped into the real Santa's stash and given the kid any one of a number of disturbing selections. Obeese Grandmas with stretchmarks vol. 4 perhaps. Anyway, next Harry is heckled by some people outside of a local church so he offs them. He also gets into the house of a naughty co-worker who skipped out on work to get loaded and iced him. Sid wouldn't last a week working with Harry.  After a bizare sequence, Harry ends up getting chased by an old-school mob. These guys had torches and everything, and they all looked like relatives of Mike Pipper but Harry manages to escape them and makes his way to his brother's house. Harry's brother now realizes that Harry is the Santa-clad killer, chokes him out and stuffs him in the front seat of Harry's van. Harry then comes to and clocks his brother and starts to drive away. During Harry's getaway, the mob catches up with him and forces his van off a bridge. But, harry goes into a delusional state at the exact moment his van is flying off the bridge. To him, the van turns into a van/Santa's sleigh and is heading for the sky eventhough it is actually still a van and plunging Harry to his death. If you don't think this whole section wasn't hilarious, well Sid doesn't know what to tell you.

We couldn't have been more pleased with this film. We spent a solid 30 minutes of the film debating who Harry looked like which is always entertaining. The rest of our viewing was split between eating, basking in the glorious B of this flick(making fun of how bad it was), and pointing out how this movie was a definite stoner flick. To the others that have seen this movie: Think about it. The part when Harry was on the street with the lights, all his delusions, and the quick camera cuts and extreme close-ups are all signs pointing in that direction. We also fell in love with this movie when we noticed that they used a white blanket in lieu of fake snow. You can't put a price on that kind of B. So if you're in the mood for a nice Christmas flick and don't feel like going the route of George Bailey or Jacob Marley, try out Harry Stadling, played by Fiona Apple's dad--seriously.",1230595200,,4235,4.96056338028169

Brandon Maggert is excellent in the lead--as are all the actors in this terrific X-Mas horror tale. Note to the horror crowd: film does contain some humor--but do not fear, it is not in your face and is played the way it should be: with a poker face. Someone might want to explain that to Tobe Hooper & why the TCM sequel that he did just plain sucked--because the comedy was too in your face--and you cannot do that in a HORROR FILM.

Spare us the excuses, Hooper. Truth is, you haven't been able to do anything that even comes close to being as good as the original TCM. Know why? you got lucky the first time out. That's why.

This director here, Lewis Jackson, is better than Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez combined! Jackson has real talent--and is on a par with someone like Roman Polanski.

Anyway, forget Hooper, and most of the others (all those so-called ""Masters of Horror."" Yeah, right. Masters of nothing.)
Lewis Jackson, the director/writer of this fine film has them all beat.

Where have you been all this time, Mr. Jackson? And why haven't you done more films?

Although not a John Waters production, I thought that having been endorsed by him, this would be a good black comedy, with at least some of the campy dark kitsch that is John's trademark.  What I found was just unbelievably and embarrasingly awful, and lacked just about everything that would have been necessary to deliver what was suggested.  Imagine the worst B-movie ever, but produced by an eight-year-old, then extract anything approaching humour, and you have Christmas Evil.

1394429,4,B000055XLZ,"I've probably seen quite a few movies involving a loner with psychological issues that seeks to punish those who don't adhere to his idealized world view. Taxi Driver is easily my favorite of this type of film, maybe because the Travis Bickle character resonates with me in some deep, dark way. There are others that I find irritating, such as One Hour Photo, because they lack any real complexity or willingness to really go for the gusto. In One Hour Photo, for example, Robin Williams' character is obsessed with developing pictures because they represent happy memories that he can never have. He is no Travis Bickle, that's for sure. Travis doesn't have a cut and dry source of meaning to focus on, he's just vaguely disgusted. Maybe he'll assassinate a politician, or maybe he'll rescue a young girl from prostitution. And then catch a matinee at the porno theatre. All I know is, Taxi Driver isn't one-dimensional and safe like One Hour Photo. Taxi Driver is how all psychological suspense descent into madness character study movies should be, in my opinion.

Christmas Evil probably leans more toward One Hour Photo in that the main character is obsessed with Christmas because the holiday represents the happy memories that he can never have. His house is filled with toys, he sleeps in Santa Claus pajamas and he spies on children to see if they're misbehaving (keeping records in his good and bad children books). He even works in a toy factory. From what I could tell, his issues stem from his witnessing Santa Claus (who was actually his father) undressing his mother in the living room as a child. Not much of a reason to become a wacko adult, but I guess he was a really sensitive soul.

The violence in Christmas Evil is suprisingly subdued, and I can't really understand why anyone would classify it as a slasher film. It's not really as campy as I though it would be, either. In fact, most of the movie is pretty low key and decently acted. Nothing about is particularly gratuitous or obnoxious. It's just about a guy who wants to be Santa Claus and spread good holiday cheer, even if a few people have to get killed.

What sets it apart from One Hour Photo is that it's not as sterile (i.e. dull) and the ending is way better than the cop-out conclusion of the Robin Williams movie. Christmas Evil is certainly no Taxi Driver, but it doesn't try to wrap up everything so nice and neat. And, of course, a crazy Santa is way more interesting than a crazy guy who develops photographs.

John Waters is a big fan fan of Christmas Evil, and I can understand why during certain parts, but it is nowhere near as outrageous as most John Waters movies. It's not really outrageous at all, but, instead, quietly twisted. It's difficult to determine what sort of film watcher to recommend this movie to, because it doesn't go far enough into horror or campiness to satisfy those who enjoy that sort of thing. Nor is it as gritty as Taxi Driver or as slick as One Hour Photo.

Christmas Evil might just work as a mildly dark alternative to tradional holiday fare, but I don't know that it will blow most people away.",1166832000,3,3123,4.61981981981982
1394430,1,B000055XLZ,"If you are looking for a little holiday horror to counteract all the jolliness of the season, don't bother with this.  ""Christmas Evil"" is nothing more but a collage of scenes trying to pass off as a horror flick.  The film really doesn't have any defining plotline to speak of and the motives behind the killer aren't all that apparent.  The trauma he goes through in the beginning is pure nonsense and hardly makes for a springboard to start the story.  Three of us watched this Christmas gunk and all three agreed it was a waste of time.  The only funny parts were when Harry was writing in his little books of naughty and nice but a few scenes of amusement doesn't make up for a badly plotted and poorly executed film.  This is heading back to the RETURNS department very soon.  F",1166486400,,784,4.440559440559441

He has a job working at a toy factory in the big city and his obsessions include spying on local neighborhood kids making sure that they are nice and not naughty at all, when some of the employees made him mad he suddenly snaps as he slips into a Santa Claus outfit to give presents to all the good boys and girls including trying to elimate those who pushed him to the limit.

Dark comical and well-made horror thriller that has gained a cult following with acclaimed by infamous cult movie director John Waters (""Pink Flamingos"") who declaired it as his favorite Christmas movie. The movie slowly builds up good character development and psychological ideas, the film does have some violent death scenes and no where as sleazy as ""Silent Night Deadly Night"". There's a bizarre twist in the end that makes you wanna question about the movie, it's a recommended movie if you want a good psychological slasher horror thriller with a dark comedy edge to it.

This new special edition DVD has two audio commentaries especially by the legendary John Waters himself whom is the biggest fan of this movie ever! there's outtakes, deleted scenes, audition footage, good picture and decent sound quality and comment card gallery.

1394432,5,B000055XLZ,"Ok so this is a Troma film and you can feel managements influence in the film. We have an outrageous sex scene that feels a bit tacked on. We have a few gory bits to get press in Fangoria that also feel a bit unneccessary. The film is not high budget but if you look past that you are rewarded.

 I find this film to be a true gem. The horror of this movie doesnt come from cheap gags and gore it comes from the fact that this film forces you to ask yourself questions and reevaluate yourself and what you hold to be true.

 Far from being a 'insane maniac' as some have described him, I find the lead to be a fairly sympathetic character, the role is brilliantly played by Brandon Maggart btw. He feels deeply the drudgery of everyday life, he sees the greed and self-serving nature of most people, he feels the crushing weight of family expectations. Fairly common problems in modern life, so as you follow the character when he snaps the horror in this film comes from the fact that you cant really hold some of the bad things character does against him too much.

 There are magic moments in the film too, the myth of Saint Nicholas is explored and believably explained, its magical to see. Really a great film, one I highly recommend, don't expect to be coddled though this film is quite raw. The only guarantee is that if you watch this film you will feel something, you may like it or you may not.",1138579200,7,1404,4.299242424242424
1394433,3,B000055XLZ,"A delightful little Xmas tale about a maniac turned Santa Claus who goes forth to avenge the wrongs done to him, and to preserve the wholesomeness of this cultural holiday, but whose mission goes awry along the way. ""Harry"" is traumatized as a young child when he hurriedly and expectantly runs down to the living room to see Old St. Nick gently placing presents by the tree, but what does he see, but apparently, dear Santa is performing cunnilingus on his mother! Turns out that ""Santa"" was actually his father, but this creates a psychosis nonetheless, which he carries with him into 'adulthood', feeling deeply offended when toy factory co-workers lambaste the holiday and the character of Santa Claus, as well as himself, being the butt of jokes and the company scape-goat. His past-time the rest of the year includes spying on children with binoculars and ""keeping a list"" of all the good and bad girls and boys, about which he actually keeps a journal called, not surprisingly, ""Good & Naughty Girls & Boys"".

One day near Xmas, he reaches his tolerance level, dons the beard and red suit, and sets out to become the veritable personification of Xmas. He also paints a sleigh on his white van, steals bagfuls of toys from the assembly room, and goes on his way to deliver toys to the needy at a nearby children's hospital, and is met with enthusiasm by the resident nurses and orderlies, after getting past a reluctant security guard, that is. Later that night, which proves to be the key scene in the film, he drives up to a church, and awaits the congregates to emerge - and when they do, he is treated with ridicule to which he stabs one through the eye with a toy-soldier's bayonet, and candy-cane axes another, after which he speeds off into the night. Subsequently, he passes by the company party and is spotted by a couple of revelers who pull him into the celebration. He eventually assumes character, uttering a hearty ""Merry Christmas!"" to the sounds of applause by all present, and proceeds to join in the festivities with dance and song. Another notable scene occurs herein, when just before leaving, he points at the exuberant children advising them to be good, listen to their parents and study hard, to which he will bestow them presents every year - but if they are naughty, he will bring them something ""horrible"". He then bellows another ""Merry Christmas!"" and takes his leave amidst the visibly disturbed parents.

The Police are alerted to the earlier evening's massacre, and go about searching for this killer Santa, lining up Kringles for witnesses, and broadcasting the bad tidings of discomfort and fear on the news. He is spotted later on, and a mob forms to capture him, but is at first protected by some neighborhood children, fending them off, until he makes his escape in his ""slay""-van to his brother's house, with whom he has had an ongoing animosity with. Feelings of harbored resentment surface as ""Harry"" is strangled into unconsciousness and placed back in his van. He awakens and slugs him one before screeching off again.

The first hour is rather slow and even laborious, so you may wish to catch the second hour, or skip ahead to when he begins actualizing his dementia in the mirror. In the end, a very surprising conclusion in which Harry finally receives his heart-felt wish.

This is not the typical movie in the common sense of the word, both in his method of operation and the fate of the character. It might have been a bit of an overkill, but he did actually rid the world, and himself, of rotten antagonists against his person, and what he believes in. In the cinematic fictional sense, the punishments were justified, as well as being poetic. Harry was a tortured soul who righted the wrongs done against him, although stepping over the line, considering the theme of the holiday. There was also no glaring dualism herein, no grand ""good vs. evil"" scenario, but focused instead on one man's deadly obsession, who actually succeeds in his final endeavor, which actually proved to be a rather charming scene.",1133654400,2,4062,4.773826458036984
1394434,5,B000055XLZ,"The greatest of all Christmas themed horror movies, Christmas Evil is about one man's descent into madness.
What really sets this movie apart from other similiar ventures is its intelligence and genuinely disturbing elements that may be a bit to ""real"" for some to handle. It is the films realism that gives it power.
As hard as it may be to believe, this movie is actually packed Christmas spirit! It is a true holiday movie, albeit a holiday film for those that enjoy anything but conventional. This is not a slasher movie though, it is a psychological thriller. The emphasis is not on killing and gore (there is actually very little), but loneliness, childhood trauma, and the commercialization of Christmas. There is plenty of ""evil"" in Christmas Evil, but not what you would think.
A true cinematic masterpeice of the highest order that deserves to be seen by any true movie fan! Thank Troma for having the guts to give this wide distribution.
The DVD has several extras of merit, and the menus are a joy to look at. The film transfer is rough at times, but this only adds to the tension of the film.

I thought it was a really good idea, but there just wasn't enough happening. Nobody is murdered until the 2nd half of the movie, and even after that, I can only remember one other killing. For a slasher movie, I think more action & violence would have been in order. But still, the acting was pretty solid for a ""b"" movie, and the killer's dimentia was well done. I liked the film well enough to watch it again at some point. I bought this movie as part of a Horror Classics set at Best buy for $6, you get several other movies with it, so if you want to watch it for cheap, that is the way to go.",1091664000,,700,4.079710144927536

7931264,3,B000055XLZ,"Harry Stadling is completely obsessed with Christmas. Every inch of his home is covered in Christmas decorations. He dresses in a Santa suit for bed and he plays Santa in his own neighborhood. You'd think that it would just be dressing up and listening to the local children's wishes for Christmas, but it goes much further than that. He has ledgers full of notes about his observations in passing and with binoculars of each child in his neighborhood. This is a literal naughty and nice list made from creepy voyeurism and obsession.

Harry works at a toy factory and others think of him as a bit of a loser. He finally gets a promotion that only further exposes the corruption within the company. The higher ups create a program to donate toys to needy children with company money matching employee donations, but they lied. Only employee donations will go to the kids because the company wants to look good without actually losing profits, rightfully outraging Harry. His reaction is to become Santa (and truly believe it) in a fugue state on Christmas Eve, rewarding good children, punishing bad children, and killing bad adults. He takes a huge amount of toys from his job and delivers them to a hospital for sick children.

This movie is a mixed bag a movie with odd editing and weird situations. The corruption at his work and in the adults around Harry seems to be enough reason for his mental break. He also has childhood trauma when he witnessed his mother and father (dressed as Santa) caressing each other after he was supposed to be in bed and then he dropped a snowglobe, cutting his hands on the broken glass. This part of film wasn't really needed and only served to show his parents' awkward foreplay scene several times throughout the story. My favorite scene is when Harry gives his neighborhood kids presents causing their parents to realize he's the killer Santa. The children form a shield around him and an angelic blonde girl gives her father's switchblade to Harry. It's a weird scene, but shows his genuine goodwill beneath the psychosis and voyeurism especially compared to every other adult (and some kids) in the movie.

Christmas Evil is a bizarre movie where creepy Harry who thinks he's actually Santa is the most likeable person in the whole thing. His grievances are valid and ones we are still dealing with today. The film has a weird mix of 80's tropes (consumerism and corruption), slasher tropes, and a heartwarming underbelly where hospitals and good children get deserved free toys. This film is surprisingly watchable and entertaining for what I expected to be a slasher dud. Despite the overall weirdness and bizarre ending, I enjoyed this killer Santa story that had much more heart than expected.",1516924800,,2740,4.837953091684435

During Christmas 2016, I started buying up new Christmas horror movies such as Secret Santa, All Through the House, Cannibal Claus, and Jack Frost on blu-ray. I decided to buy this on Blu-Ray too. I gotta say, it's really starting to grow on me after seeing it clearer and crisper. The story is interesting about a creepy guy named Harry Stadling who works at a toy company and obsessed with Christmas, and even spies on children to see if they're being naughty or nice and writes about them in a book.

Harry really is an interesting character. He tries to become Santa. He dresses like him all year long. This year, he puts on a Santa suit, complete with glued on whiskers and goes around delivering toys from his company (Jolly Dreams Toy Factory)  to needy children at the local orphanage. One minute he's happy and jolly, partying with people, then the next he's slaughtering people at church. Brandon Maggart who plays Harry did his job well. Harry is a true psychopath.
