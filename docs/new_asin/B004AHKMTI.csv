8420258,5,B004AHKMTI,"I have long loved this movie.  It's a pretty typical adventure movie, with fairly atypical actors who seem to really enjoy working together.  Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson have a lovely onscreen chemistry.  Not an epic masterpiece, but a seriously fun little movie.",1487289600,,269,5.068181818181818

The script is so unreal that it makes you say ""Boooohhhh!!!"" after 10 minutes of watching it.
