5734567,5,B00CPZH8ZI,"As a child living in Washington during his brief time in office, I was inspired by JFK. The country, and the world, seemed so full of possibility for GOOD then --- real hope and change! Not death, debt and destruction here at home and across the globe. There was belief in the good that government can, and should, do (for the people, not the corporation) which was in concert with the preamble to the Constitution. Then it all ended on that awful Friday afternoon.

It was a teachers' administrative day, so there was only a 1/2 day of class and I was spending the afternoon with my grandmother. We were eating a late lunch and watching the Guiding Light... then the cut in, the breaking news. That night, my family drove down to the White House (you could get up close in 1963) to see the North Portico draped in black. Sunday, after dinner, we joined the throngs going to the Capitol rotunda, walking around Lincoln Park in the bitter cold. It was the first time I'd ever seen adults cry, and even at the young age of 10, I could feel the despair... More than a President was lost almost 50 years ago.

Anyway, this collection brings back wonderful memories of a very special time in history.",1380931200,29,1195,4.477064220183486

5734577,5,B00CPZH8ZI,"was not sure what to expect of this.  was delighted to discover newsreels and broadcasts of stories that remind us that President John F. Kennedy was very charismatic, witty, smart, and truly special.  Reminds us of how much we lost and have never recovered.  this could be used in the classroom.",1387152000,,296,4.764705882352941

5734579,2,B00CPZH8ZI,"much is just newreel footage which is fine
as far as it goes, but what bugs me is the
fact that all of this (6dvds) could have
filled up two dvds quite nicely.  it's a
puzzling waste of space and only
increases the cost substantially.",1385337600,5,234,4.2

5734581,4,B00CPZH8ZI,Looks great.  I was in college during the early 60's.  There hasn't been anybody in politics that I have been that enthused about since JFK.  I would buy this collection if someone told me that it also had his famous televised news conferences in the collection.  So does it?,1384646400,,275,4.551020408163265
5734582,3,B00CPZH8ZI,"Some good videos in here, many are repetitive of the material that has long been out there, so for long-time JFK admirers who have already bought previous videos, you won't find too much that is new here. The disc with all the old, short newsreels is the least impressive to me, and would have better been used for some little known (today) but still great addresses JFK delivered to the United Nations, and to the American people, in person and on TV. So, my criticism is mostly concerning the selections included here. The ""home movies"" of the family are nice, but totally in silent format, which is somewhat jarring actually. Perhaps a little background music and/or voice-over would have been useful.

This box set will probably satisfy younger people who are ""new"" to JFK history, but for those of us who lived during those exciting years and have already bought other similar videos over the decades, there isn't much here that we haven't already seen and heard many times before.",1384560000,,986,4.8

5734585,5,B00CPZH8ZI,I was absolutely captivated by the newsreels on this DVD set. Pure history without current day commentary is refreshing. Should be in every American's library.,1382140800,3,159,5.4
5734586,4,B00CPZH8ZI,"Incomplete.

This appears to be a fine video collection of the life and times of President Kennedy. Still, this collection earns only four stars because of the notable omissions of speeches which certainly should have been included.

The most notable omission was the Commencement Speech JFK made at American University. This surely should be included as one of the most memorable -- and remarkable -- statements ever made by an American president.

On June 10, 1963, at the height of the Cold War, JFK stated that the most important topic on earth is peace. He stated:

""What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.""

JFK spoke of a ""genuine peace must be the product of many nations."" JFK reached out for concliation and reason, and that probably did not sit well with the Military Industrial Complex.

When has an American president since spoken in these terms?

The American University speech ran approximately twenty three minutes. It is readily available on YouTubeand should have been included in this collection. It really must be seen to be believed because this is the last time such a concilatory statement has been publically made.

This speech was JFK's shining moment. The inclusion of this speech would have made the purchase of this collection worthwhile.",1381968000,50,1733,4.677631578947368
