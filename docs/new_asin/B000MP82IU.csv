Each second, the brain processes information from billions of nerve cells located throughout the body. Drugs can interfere with this vital communication. While proper use of prescribed drugs can help ease pain, abuse of illegal street drugs and legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco can do damage to the human brain or body. Join Stephanie Yu and Z Wright as they explore the complex workings of the human brain and the ways in which drugs can affect the performance of this amazing master control system. Through animations, interviews with doctors, and moving conversations with teenage drug addicts, this video teaches kids respect for the capacities of the human brain, and makes a strong case for keeping young bodies drug free.""",1514505600,,840,5.0503597122302155
