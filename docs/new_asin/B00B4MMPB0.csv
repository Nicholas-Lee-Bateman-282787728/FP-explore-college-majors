8562434,4,B00B4MMPB0,"Jubeh (Tak Sakaguchi) has a killer fastball...literally. He has some strange abilities such as being able to kill people with a blazing fastball and being able to pull a lit cigarette from out of the air that is off camera. He uses his talents to kill members of the Japanese mafia and chain smoke.  He goes to prison for his vigilante crimes and is forced by his neo-Nazi warden to play baseball for the prison team against the St. Black Dahlia High School girl's team is what amounts to a set up we haven't seen since the likes of ""Rollerball.""

The film is campy funny. It has Troma style blood squirts as well as some dark comedy. It is a silly Japanese grindhouse with subscripts. Clearly a film not for everyone.

Parental Guide: F-bomb (written in English subscript). No sex. Male rear nudity. Worst cavity search scene.",1387411200,2,827,4.612244897959184
8562435,5,B00B4MMPB0,"Dead Ball is a madcap comedy with a goofy eye for humor.  Bathroom jokes, midget jokes, bad jokes, awful jokes, honestly fun jokes, you have to take the good with the bad with this one.  CGI gore mixed with real gore gags, this baseball game of destruction is highly enjoyable if you're its target audience.

Regular Joes: 3/5
Japanese cinema fans/5/5
Don't like Spoofy Comedies: 3/5

The Comedy is make or break.  If you don't like juvenile, stupid humor, then avoid.  But the gore is good, and the movie is fun.  End of story.",1366934400,2,528,4.553191489361702
8562436,4,B00B4MMPB0,"Director Yudai Yamaguchi definitely knows what fans of splatter (like me) want to see on-screen. Blood geysers, decapitations, amputations...Yamaguchi knows how to deliver.  DEADBALL is the famed director's most recent release, and it is a perfect addition to his canon of work.  Although the film doesn't showcase much of anything new, it is vastly entertaining and certainly worth checking out.

I've been a fan of Yamaguchi's work for a while now, ever since I reviewed his film YAKUZA WEAPON a while back (unfortunately, the review is no longer available on my site since it crashed in December of last year).  The director's over-the-top style combined with a panache for gore gives audiences a jolt of hyper-violence they will not soon forget.  And his films are simply so much fun to watch.

DEADBALL is shot well and the acting is pretty good overall.  I especially enjoy seeing Tak Sakaguchi onscreen; he is an exceptional talent and I always like to see what he does next.  In this performance, his role as the sullen Jubeh, who always seems to find a cigarette in every seen, is exceptional.  He personifies the bad-but-misunderstood hero.

What truly stands out for me in this film is, as expected, the gore.  Director Yamaguchi goes above and beyond when it comes to special effects, and he showcases that talent in this film.  DEADBALL contains some truly excellent gore and, as per his stye, it is presented in all of its zany, beyond-tasteless glory.

Although the premise might seem a bit far-fetched, you should never go into a Yamaguchi film with a serious mindset.  If you do, you're bound for disappointment.  But if you go into these movies with the right frame of mind, then you're in for a real treat.  I recommend giving DEADBALL a look...just make sure you don't eat while you're watching it.  Doing so might cause you to lose your lunch.",1366070400,2,1864,4.848101265822785
8562437,4,B00B4MMPB0,"This one was wow I really cant understand where they come up with the sheer craziness of this one. It takes the original and adds crazy by 100. But I think it goes tooo far sometimes with some of the stuff. The original had charm, this one seems more shallow and lets be really crazy/wierd just to be weird. Still its a really cool movie just for Tak and his badassedness in most anything he plays in. So if you're a fan of the original Id recommend it, theres even a few nods to it in this which I enjoyed. This was a riot to watch with friends so Id recommend that setting watching these types of movies anyway.",1365811200,,613,4.159663865546219
8562438,2,B00B4MMPB0,"""Deadball"" may be the first sports splatter comedy.  Baseball prodigy Jubeh Yakyu (Tak Sakaguchi) is the most feared and dangerous juvenile delinquent in Japan.  After accidentally causing the death of his father with a super-powered, deadly fireball pitch, Jubeh swore off baseball and turned to crime and now, at 17, has been sent to a reformatory for hardened criminals.

Headmistress Ishihara, the granddaughter of a World War II Nazi collaborator, runs the institution with an iron fist and the enthusiastic help of sadistic assistant, Ilsa.  Shortly after arriving, Jubeh learns that his younger brother had done time there and died mysteriously.  Jubeh is presented with an ultimatum by the governor:  join the reformatory team in the national tournament for juvenile inmates, or witness the death of his innocent cellmate.  Knowing that the death of his brother is in some way connected to the team, Jubeh agrees.

""Deadball"" is an outrageously over-the-top movie filled with impossible situations, killer baseballs, grisly gore, and cartoonish, Amazon-like women.  It intentionally attempts to offend practically every race, ethnicity, gender, and institution imaginable as it barrels along.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, cast interviews, spinoff short, and theatrical trailers.",1365552000,2,1328,5.661616161616162
