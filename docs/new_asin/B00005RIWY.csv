1655535,2,B00005RIWY,"I guess if you haven't read the novel and like TV-movie whodunits this may do to kill two hours of your time, but having read the novel I was really disappointed with this adaptation.

The story has Hercule Poirot investigating a series of petty thefts and eventually murders in a student hostel run by his secretary's sister.  However, whereas the Agatha Christie novel featured a cast of multicultural students (African, Indian, West Indian) as part of the suspects, the hostel population is strictly Anglo-Saxon in the TV-movie adaptation. They've also added a silly subplot in which the Chief Inspector is staying with Poirot (leading to a rather tasteless joke about bidets) and also Miss Lemon, Poirot's secretary, hangs around during the investigation without really having anything to do.

Also, Agatha Christie generated suspense in this particular storyline by not letting the reader know the connection between the thefts and the murders right away.  In the adaptation, you know from the opening scenes why the killings are being done and they've added some undercover agents to the story. As the Amazon reviewer points out, the clues are also clumsily presented in the TV-movie.  However, unlike what the reviewer points out, the fault is the adaptator's, not Christie's.

I know changes must be done to adapt a novel to TV, but I thought all the changes made here only made the story seem clumsily plotted.  And, although the leading actor makes a good Poirot, I though the rest of the acting was consistently bad and cartoonish.  The TV-movie also suffers from some really cheesy sound and visual effects (the most annoying being a cute mouse that pops out during the whole movie).

But as I said, if you like TV-movie whodunits, you're probably not as picky and may enjoy it.  (Evidently the other reviewers did.)  I thought it was pretty crappy.  At the risk of sounding cliched: ""The novel was much better than the film.""",1146009600,2,1938,4.96594427244582
1655536,5,B00005RIWY,"Both my sister and my mother have read almost every mystery that Agatha Christie ever wrote, but I never thought to start.  Then I sat down one evening to watch television with them, and I was at once enchanted.  It was an episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot on A&E.  The David Suchet Poirot films (both full length movies and short films) come from this series.  I enjoyed that first show so much that I watched the series religiously until it went off the air.
I started reading some of Agatha Christie's mysteries this year, and I firmly believe that David Suchet is the best portrayal of Hercule Poirot that ever was.  I have seen other notorious actors, such as Peter Ustinov and Tony Randall, play the part, but they do not achieve the full embodiment of the persona (both physical and psychological) that David Suchet does.
HICKORY DICKORY DOCK isn't an immediately predictable film.  I honestly did not know who the killer was until Poirot revealed the truth.  This is not one of those mysteries where you can tell what the detective or the police or the killer will do before they even do it; this film left me completely on the edge of my seat.  HICKORY DICKORY DOCK has a storyline that does not follow some predetermined, overused mystery plot; it is creative and exciting.  Additionally, the historical accuracy is extreme, right down to the shoes.
I highly recommend any of the David Suchet Poirot films to anyone searching for an interesting, exciting mystery to watch.",1046822400,,1484,4.743190661478599
1655537,5,B00005RIWY,"When a series of petty thefts at a student hostel turns into a case of murder, it is up to the great Hercule Poirot to solve the baffling crime.  However, he soon finds himself involved not only in a case of murder, but smuggling and political doings as well. Not only that, he foolishly invites the rather sloppy Inspector Japp to stay with him, while Japp's wife is away, which make for a rather rough time ala the ""Odd Couple.""  HICKORY DICKORY DOCK is another in the BBC/Mystery series featuring the wonderful David Suchet cementing his claim as the definitive Poirot.  Phillip Jackson adds a nice touch of earthy humor as his foil, Chief Inspector Japp.  David Burke, best known as Dr. Watson in the Jeremy Brett SHERLOCK HOLMES series, appears in an extended cameo as a dying politician.  Once again, great care and intelligence is lavished on this production that would make Agatha Christie proud.  Another winner for Poirot fans and a film I highly recommend.",1018396800,2,967,4.7604790419161676
1655538,3,B00005RIWY,"I really enjoyed the novel and was expecting to enjoy the movie version, but I found it curiously dull as compared to many of the other adaptations.  No Captain Hastings and a mouse.  This mouse, while cute, appeared far too often - crawling around the clock, arriving in rooms at the precise moment they were murdered, even acting as a catalyst in the climactic scene.  The real interesting aspects of the book, and much of its humor, came from Dame Agatha's casting of these motley group of students.  As a product of her time, she had used racial epithets in her earlier works that American publishers changed because they were offensive.  She changed though.  Watching her evolve with the times, and reflect those times in her novels provides a fascinating look at the social evolution of the 20th century.  She has a lesbian couple in ""A Murder is Announced"" and in Hickory Dickory Dock - she had Ram Lal - an Indian student, very political yet polite and the extremely charming and affable Akibombo from Africa.  However, these were the two characters that were cut from the adaptation.  They did not have large dramatic parts which made them more expendable, but they added warmth and humor to the assemble that made the book very charming.  The group of students in the movie seemed simultaneously dull and unattractive personality-wise although they were supposed to have a lot of camaraderie as young folks all living under the same roof.  The mystery itself was secondary in this story - so not top-shelp Christie who-done-it in my opinion.  The humor and interest in the movie are the trials and tribulations poor Japp endures as Poirot's house-guest.  Miss Lemon has a larger part this time, and is a constant presence.  And finally -  the trying-not-to-be-horrified looks Japp and Poirot try to suppress as each tries to impress the other with their native cuisine is priceless.  Too few and far between though - unless you're a huge Christie fan, I would suggest exploring the other movies first.",1017273600,3,2011,4.853372434017595
1655539,5,B00005RIWY,"This is my favorite Poirot mystery. The dvd transfer is excellent as well. The initial Poirot releases on dvd had terrible transfers and looked as if they were being projected on a gym class wall, but Acorn seems to have gotten it right this time with quality audio and video. Follow the mouse as he seems to pop up everywhere and finally takes a starring role in this amusingly different Poirot adventure. Enjoy!",1015545600,2,413,4.671232876712328
1655540,5,B00005RIWY,"The star of this Hercule Poirot entry, ""Hickory Dickory Dock"" (Acorn Media: AMP 5025), seems to be a mouse that gets more screen time than do some of the human cast. Barring that, we have here a very convoluted tale of diamond smuggling , social awareness and protest (not found in the original novel), petty thievery, and murder. There is also a bit of ""comic"" relief, this time with Japp (Philip Jackson) staying as a guest of Poirot and wrestling with unappetizing meals and a strange bit of plumbing in his room that no one seems willing to explain to him.
 Another feature unusual to this series is that of Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) being directly involved in the situation that brings her boss to the hostel, run by her sister, where a mixed group of young people are all entangled, in one way or another, with the seemingly triple plot-strands of the thefts, the smuggling, and the murders--all against a background of the Jarrow Marchers and their dying leader, whom Japp suspects of a murder many years before.
 I really shouldn't say more, lest I spoil the fun. Suchet is up to his high standards as the comical but dangerous Belgian, Moran is truly human in this episode, and Jackson gets a chance to show us the home environment of his Chief Inspector. The photography is nicely in the film-noire tradition (although in color), and the secondary characters sharply drawn and believable. Except for the murderer leaving a photograph on a body, every thing seems perfectly logical. That mouse, however, is annoying.
 This Acorn Media DVD includes some low-tech bonus tracks about Suchet and Christie, some of the cast, and Poirot/Suchet trivia questions. Lots of fun all through.",1010880000,8,1690,4.840830449826989
1655541,5,B00005RIWY,"In the opening scenes of this tale, a furry little mouse scurries through the walls of a boarding house in London searching for morsels of food. As in the children's nursery rhyme he scurries up the clock just as it strikes the hour. Having made his way to a bedroom in the upstairs, he pauses and twitches his whiskers. The crumbs from a bedtime cookie are lying on a saucer..but he hesitates. Something strange is happening and he dare not advance to the plate of crumbs. What is this...oh my goodness one of the humans is killing the nice young girl who always eats cookies at bedtime. What awful things happen in the hours around midnight!!
Agatha Christie was given to using lines from literature for the titles of some of mystery tales, but HICKORY DICKORY DOCK is no nursery tale. Someone is killing the young men and women occupants of a youth hostel in London. The boarders are all attractive and energetic people...how could one of them be the culprit. What could be the motive..lust, money, a deadly secret??? The mouse knows the murderer's identity and the secret but the police are stymied.
Enter Hercule Poirot! Well not exactly. First, there's Miss Lemmon. Seems her sister is in the boarding house business and she has noticed strange goings on at her establishment. Miss Lemmon asks Poirot to investigate her sister's complaints which he is reluctant to do. After all, how can the great Belgian detective worry about trifling matters like misplaced items at a boarding house..even for Miss Lemmon!! Poirot does as he is asked however, and soon he is involved with murder. With the help of the Lemmon sisters he cracks the case and not a moment too soon. A wild chase at the end involves Hastings and the good Inspector.
HICKORY DICORY DOCK has an interesting cast including the handsome young man (Jonathan Firth) who played Albert in the miniseries VICTORIA AND ALBERT. (I understand he IS the brother of Colin!!)",1006387200,13,1931,4.7844311377245505

7952310,5,B00005RIWY,"To me, David Suchet ""is"" Hercule Poirot.  This has long been one of my favorite Agatha Christie stories, and I like this film version.  There are obviously differences between the book and the movie (when is that *not* the case in an adaptation?)--for example, at least one book character is eliminated--but overall it's a good translation of the story.  I need to go and reread the book again to recall many specific details.

Uncharacteristic typing errors by his secretary, Ms. Lemon, prompt detective Hercule Poirot to ask her if something is wrong.  Ms. Lemon explains that she's worried about her sister, who manages a student hostel where a number of thefts and acts of property damage have recently occurred.  Poirot meets with Mrs. Hubbard and then gives a lecture presentation to the students about his crime solving activities.  Soon afterward, one of the female students at the hostel comes to see Poirot and confesses to the thefts, though not to the damage done.  But she knows who did that and plans to urge the guilty person to come forward.  Before that happens, this student dies, seemingly of a drug overdose.  But Poirot believes that she was murdered and begins to investigate all who live and work at the hostel.  Many secrets start to be uncovered--secrets that someone in the building is willing to kill to keep.",1424649600,,1336,4.867256637168142

7952312,3,B00005RIWY,"THE REASON I GAVE IT FIVE STARS:
1) Like most Hercule Poirot mysteries, it has a fair plot
2) The acting is quite good
3) For a murder mystery, it's not overly violent

THE REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT FOUR STARS:
1) There are much better plots out there
2) It is takes to much time for Poirot to actually DO anything- it makes him look rather slow
3) While Japp ate Poirot's unappetising meals, Poirot wimped out and refused Japp's meal
4) The motives for the crimes are not absolutely clear",1373587200,,487,4.293478260869565
7952313,4,B00005RIWY,"NOTE: This film review is the same as my book review of Agatha Christie's HIKORY DICKORY DOCK. I've seen this film version 3 or 4 times as well.

HICKORY DICKORY DOCK is unique in that it involves Hercule Poirot's confidential secretary Miss Lemon. Christie is ruthless in her general description of Miss Lemon, often referring to her has being little more than a highly intelligent, unemotional calculating machine. In addition to effciently running Poirot's front office, Miss Lemon is concerned primarily with inventing her own filing system. The poor thing is also described as ""hideous"" in appearance.

I found it very interesting how BBC's Mystery! altered the character of Miss Lemon for TV. There's nothing at all ""hideous"" in actress Pauline Moran's characterization. She is much more outgoing & has a strictly platonic--but hurmorous--relationship with Poirot's sidekick, Captain Hastings. Many times they exasperate the fastidous Belgian detective. This makes for a good script. Pauline Moran is perfect in this role. The one thing that keeps Miss Lemon at least a little aligned with Christie's original character is a very tight roll of large curls crossing her forehead as a fringe--this hairdo is, indeed, deliberately hideous.

I like both Christie's Miss Lemon & BBC's version.

Well, back to HICKORY DICKORY DOCK.

In this story Miss Lemon's sister is introduced (for the first & only time.) Poirot is bowled over by the fact that Miss Lemon even HAS a sister--or any family at all. He seems to think that she was created by a purely technological union of two typewriters. As it turns out, the sister manages a youth hostel of full-time students. Thefts begin occuring & other strange incidents. Miss Lemon & her sister ask Poirot to look into things.

The resulting story has more than a few highly implausible sub-plots, including the existence of a drug smuggling ring. This raises the question, is Christie's mystery world meant to be realistic or fanciful? I don't think it was necessarily meant to be realistic, but even at that Christie often goes wide of the mark. For example, in HICKORY DICKORY DOCK the drug smuggling motif goes like this: The drug cartel has come up with the perfect plan to get drugs into Englad--they hide them in a secret compartment in--get this--STUDENT BACKPACKS! After all, no one would suspect (albeit unwitting) foreign students going throughg British customs with their backpacks...oh, Agatha, Agatha.

On the plus side, there's plenty of humor in HICKORY DICKORY DOCK that makes it worthwhile reading. I also think that Christie demonstrates a certain degree of tolerance for racial & political differences. One of the few students who ISN'T hiding something is a female MD student from Africa named Elizabeth. Not only is she above suspicion, but she is studying primarily in order to eventually improve things back home. She's also a Communist & Christie sort of takes it all in stride (after all, Christie's the one who created her up in the first place.) Unfortunately the other students have nicknamed Elizabeth ""Black Bess."" I honestly don't think AC was showing prejudice--I think it was to favorably comapare this stdent's superior, achieving attitude to Queen Elizabeth I, but I can also see why it should have been left out.",1327622400,,3293,5.098330241187384
7952314,5,B00005RIWY,"""Hickory Dickory Dock"", based on the 1955 novel, is a feature-length film from Series 6 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", which originally aired on Britain's ITV in 1995. The opening sequence is of a mouse running through a grandfather clock at a student hostel in Hickory Road, where it then witnesses a student steal a diamond ring from another while she sleeps. The mouse returns every time the action returns to the hostel, and we sometimes view the scene from the little fellow's point of view. It's a cute gimmick and one of two sources of humor in this otherwise grim mystery. Poirot has invited Chief Inspector Japp to stay with him while Mrs. Japp is out of town, having observed the police detective's disheveled state. Needless to say, the two men do not share tastes in food, heating, or plumbing.

When Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) makes an outrageous three typos in one letter, Poirot (David Suchet) asks her whatever is the matter. She is preoccupied with the troubles of her sister Florence (Sarah Badel), who is the housekeeper at the youth hostel that has experienced a string of odd thefts. Poirot promises to look into the matter and proposes to meet the seven residents of the hostel by giving a dinner lecture there. When he makes it clear that he is investigating the thefts, one young woman, Celia Austin (Jessica Lloyd), confesses that she is a kleptomaniac. But that doesn't explain all of the thefts, nor will it explain the three subsequent murders that occur at the hostel. And Poirot isn't the only one watching the hostel, nor are the students all who they appear to be.

This is an especially enjoyable Poirot mystery for its humor, augmented by director Andrew Grieve's use of the mouse, inspired by the nursery rhyme of the same title. It is also one of the few where Miss Lemon actively participates in the investigation of the crime. Perhaps because her sister is involved, Miss Lemon accompanies Poirot almost everywhere on this case. Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) is there to investigate the murders as well, his leave having been cancelled due to labor activists converging on London. Three murders is a lot for a Poirot mystery, and it sometimes seems that the plot is more complex than necessary. But it does all add up in the end and does not suffer for being somewhat overwritten.

The DVD (Acorn 2002): Bonus features are the usual for the Collector's Set discs. There is a text interview with David Suchet, a brief text bio of Agatha Christie, a list of Poirot books, the same as on the other discs. There are selective filmographies of 4 cast members, 10 Poirot trivia questions with answers, and 4 Poirot quotes. No subtitles.",1308787200,,2676,4.787878787878788

But looked at simply as a TV-movie ""whodunit"", I enjoyed this production.  Acting, directing, pacing, and music all rate solid marks, keeping things moving along and preventing an understated story (this is no ""Murder on the Orient Express"") from becoming dull and routine.  You sure to see a lot of that mouse, though.  I guess if you have a trained mouse that can act on cue you have to make the most of him.  A clean DVD image and a handful of modest extras round out this pleasant little DVD.",1206403200,,662,4.576271186440678
