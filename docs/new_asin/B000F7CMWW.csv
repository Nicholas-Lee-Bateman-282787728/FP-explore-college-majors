This series is really good. I have viewed many like this but they don't take the time to verify what they say, and most are totally off base and against scripture.  I like this whole series because they not only check what they say, but they show how, with a little effort Science actually supports the scriptures. It is really awesome how they do it. I highly recommend the whole 4 Set pack Series with the 12 DVD's ... Your investment is minimal compared to what knowledge you will pull out of the whole set. The only thing that I disagreed with was the RED SEA Crossing place. Because of Ron Wyatt's discoveries of the chariot wheels and an actual chariot on the bottom of the Gulf of Aqaba up north by Nuweiba. It gives solid proof of where the actual crossing of the Red Sea took place. Other than that, an excellent series on the bible. James Banfield",1352332800,3,1084,5.124293785310734
8118523,5,B000F7CMWW,"I had recently purchased Sets 1,2 and 4 from the local Family Dollar, however they neither had nor could they order Set 3.  As I was able to order the ""missing set"" through Amazon, I was more than simply pleased to get what I wanted and for only 60 cents more than I paid for the others that I bought in the discount store.  To have had the item sent directly to my house was so convenient and it arrived without any damages what-so-ever made the whole transaction a pleasant experience overall.",1350432000,,495,4.369565217391305
