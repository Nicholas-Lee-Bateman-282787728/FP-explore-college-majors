It's absolutely the benchmark for rock and blues guitar. Only the Allman Brothers Live at Fillmore East is this good. Period. I'm glad some people don't like it or I would have to go see him in huge venues which isn't my style.",1465171200,,355,4.313432835820896
8471695,3,B005GIAYZC,"For hardcore fans only, I'd say. the jean-clad ""go-go dancers"" were a major embarrassment. Thank God Joe Bonamassa is out of the sleazy rock club circuit.",1361577600,,154,4.961538461538462
8471696,5,B005GIAYZC,"I've been a big J.B. fan for a long time, and of all his live DVD's, all are great but this one back in 2001 is his best. No  soft stuff, all rock, and in a small club.  A MUST for any J.B. fan..",1360454400,,195,3.409090909090909
8471697,4,B005GIAYZC,"I bought this DVD (a brazilian edition) some months ago. Yes, Joe was just a kid, performing some amazing guitar solos, accompanied by two other guys. What an amazing power (rock and blues) trio they are! In my oppinion, the presence on stage of those ""bonamettes"" is absolutely unnecessary, but as Joe mentioned, ""it's all part of the fun"". For guitar lovers, it is a must.",1358985600,,374,4.681818181818182
8471698,5,B005GIAYZC,"You can get this DVD for $20 thru Joes website and it was delivered in 2 days. I didn't do any research as to where this was recorded but the year was Dec 2001 at a decent sized club . Joe was probably around 24-25 years old with a stripped down 3 piece band . Joe just flat out delivers the hot rodded blues , this guy must have practiced 8hrs a day every day when he was learning and it shows in his playing here not to mention what he's done in the years since this show was recorded. An added bonus , there's a blonde and brunette go go dancing thru the show, what more is there to like",1353456000,2,590,3.884297520661157
