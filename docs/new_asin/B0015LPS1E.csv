And unlike so many of today's horror pics, there's an actual story here. Cool making of featurette as well. I rented this, now I am buying.",1211500800,3,260,4.326530612244898
3145743,4,B0015LPS1E,"Timber falls is a very good slasher movie with a refreshing new twist..
Although you do see the tables with assorted knives and other cutting and hacking devices as you see in SO many of the horror movies of today""not that I mind it"" this is not a Hostel or a Saw..

It has quite a different angle.

A crazed family that consists of a barren wannabe mother her disfigured brother""He aint cute"" and her husband set out to find couples to conceive babies for Ida""the Barren wannabe mother"".

The beginning shows you the last couple that they captured and what happens to them and what went wrong with that scheme and why they need to find another couple to give Ida a child. That was in case you were worried about there being only two victims..Plus I will give no spoilers but a lot of blood is spilled.

The main characters in the movie that play the new couple in danger are very attractive, ""Sheryl and Mike""They go on a hiking trip and bump into some local redneck bullies that lend to some of the excitement as well as the uber religious ""only if it falls in their favor"" family that kidnaps, tortures and does other horrible things to them.

I liked this movie a lot..it has elements of a lot of movies I love like wrong Turn, Hostel, The Hills have Eyes,. but manages to keep it's own identity.",1211155200,3,1300,4.377593360995851
3145744,4,B0015LPS1E,"Just watchedd this movie and I have to say that it was a pretty good ""straigh to video release"". The acting is good and the production is better than most b-movies. Although the story is something we have seen a few times before there was an interesting twist to the whole ""hikers in the woods get kidnapped and tortured by a disfigured psychopath and his creppy family"" genre. The only thing i really didn't like was the end but overall a good movie and worth the watch. If you like Horror movies than its a good additon to the collection.",1211068800,5,540,4.41

3145746,2,B0015LPS1E,"It's become fashionable lately to name horror movies after a location.  Maybe all the good horror names have been used up, maybe the writers lack creativity, or maybe it's just easier to remember.  The latest in this string of peculiar American towns is Timber Falls.

Now, ""Timber Falls"" sounds a little bit silly, because all I can think of is someone shouting ""TimmmmmBEEERRRRRRR!"" as a tree falls. But maybe that's a point, because there's a lot of silliness going on in Timber Falls.

Timber Falls features a disfigured and deranged killer, a crazy family with a bizarre ideology, and ""normal"" folk who are secretly in league with the crazies.  It's Misery meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Where Timber Falls distinguishes itself is the reason for the family's actions.  TIMBER ALERT: I'm going to be felling a lot of spoiler trees in a moment.

There's lawman Clyde (Nick Searcy), who also happens to be the father of this insane clan.  He may look normal, but he's actually the patriarch of a breeding program committed to producing a child for his beloved Ida (Beth Broderick). Ida has been driven mad by her repeated attempts at having children, the film's primary creepy moment encapsulated in the aborted fetuses collected in her basement.  And tacked onto this bunch is Deacon (Sascha Rosemann), Ida's brother - a deformed, deranged serial killer.

Deacon is the muscle in this little operation dedicated to finding a new child for Ida and Clyde. Their master plan: find good breeding stock (i.e. stupid city people screwing around in the woods), ensure they aren't ""living in sin"" by marrying them if need be, and then forcing them to procreate until a baby arrives. It's not a particularly good plan, given that the first couple in the opening scenes dies rather than comply. But without a lot of stupidity Timber Falls wouldn't be much of a movie.

Into this mess stumbles Sheryl (delicious Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall).  They're on a romantic hiking trip and think nothing of going off into uncharted territory - Timber Falls in this case. When they come across a group of sadistic hunters who threaten to 1) molest Sheryl, 2) steal her clothes, 3) wave shotguns in their faces, and 4) blackmail the couple into buying some moonshine...Mike chooses to pay them off rather than reach for his concealed handgun.  Sheryl, in the height of stupidity, demands Mike remove all the bullets from his gun.

Now I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure the trip's over, right?  The hunters did everything but actually assault the couple.  Get rid of the gun? Are you kidding me lady?

Predictably, Sheryl is kidnapped and Mike goes on a tear to retrieve her.  He then is 1) skewered by a sharp stick in the arm, 2) snared in a bear trap, 3) shot, 4) stabbed in the gut, and 5) tortured repeatedly.  Throughout, Mike is defiant, hurling insults at his captors even though he and Sheryl are tortured until they comply.  Somebody should tell Mike he's in a horror movie.

There's so many problems with Timber Falls. Deacon - who exists to menace the couple as Clyde and Idea are clearly not scary enough -- seems to be tacked on from another movie. Sheryl and Mike are dumb as rocks. And the ending sets up Timber Falls for a sequel it didn't earn.

The sad thing is that Timber Falls had potential - the contrast between city and country folks, the uncomfortable probing questions about religion from a young couple who probably hasn't thought much about settling down, and the idea of becoming brutalized in rural America...these are all scenes that build up dread. It's just that Timber Falls isn't sure what to do with its raw material.",1294185600,3,3655,4.775834658187599
3145747,4,B0015LPS1E,"I caught part of this movie on television and it referenced a State Forest (Kumbrabow) in West Virginia that I've been to a few times, so it caught my interest. I looked for a discount price, and now here I am writing this brief review. The movie isn't actually filmed in West Virginia, it's filmed in Romania; but that has little impact on the actual film. The movie is well paced, and has some decent character development. Not packed with ""boo"" type scares; but still manages to maintain a feeling of tension/anxiety throughout the film. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. I would definitely recommend picking this up for $10.00 or less if you see it on sale or run across it on the net.",1277424000,,719,4.538461538461538
3145748,4,B0015LPS1E,"A very good, simple horror flick.  Not the most original plot, but very enjoyable.  Mostly solid acting.",1276387200,2,104,5.0588235294117645
3145749,3,B0015LPS1E,"Slasher flicks.  You either love 'em or hate them. I am on the fence with this one. On one side is razor wire and on the other side is quicksand. So you see my predicement. Most victims in slasher movies are commonly one sandwich short of a picnic. The couple in this movie also forgot the potato salad.

City dwellers Mike and Cheryl decide to hike in the rural hills of West Virginia.  Unbeknownst to them, them thar hills is crawling with Bible-thumping lunatics, card-carrying rednecks, a drooling mutant and an unkempt, greasy haired woman dragging a child's wagon behind her. Mike and Cheryl even ask for directions from this person who looks like she has a permanent table at ""Uncle Jimmy Bob's Fried Possum Shack.""

They follow her directions(oh-oh) and as soon as they find a clearing they decide to have an impropmtu session of afternoon delight. Coitus is interruptus by a trio of card carrying rednecks who menace the couple, then extort 50 dollars from them.

Now comes the scene where I lost further vested interest for the welfare of the couple.

Remember-they have just been scared silly by rednecks.  Well Cheryl is horrified to learn that Mike is carrying a loaded revolver. They compromise--she tells him he can keep the gun but to toss the bullets. He throws the rounds into the lake, the fish get fed and we're left with a movie starring Dumb and dumber.

I watched the movie until the end well aware that here was a couple too stupid to live but to be slowly tortured.  The balance of the film involves-named fetus's in mason jars, mutilations, forced copulation, chopped fingers, a gory whipping, a drooling mutant's attempt at sex, impalements, shotgun blasts, cut throats, a moonshine molotov cocktail.

The last scene is one of those ""surprise"" scenes but like the couple it doesn't make sense. Although it is revealed that Cheryl is aleady 8 weeks pregnant before the torture scenes-it is now one year later and Mike and Cheryl have survived their weekend hiking trip and now are doting parents of a baby boy. They leave the room and suddenly a baby hand reaches up from the crib holding a miniature scythe. Give me a break!  LOL",1276387200,3,2156,4.722666666666667
3145750,5,B0015LPS1E,"My husband and I love movies in what we call the backwoods psycho genre. We love ones such as the Wrong Turn trilogy where the characters are inbred deformed cannibals but they do all tend to be similar. In this case it was nice to have a change of pace. We are not religious so to have a chance to make fun of crazy bible thumping psycho freaks for a few hours was entertaining. There were also some good twists and turns where some of the characters you assume are bad guys end up trying to help the ""city folk."" I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't take their movies too seriously and wants a good B grade horror movie to veg out to!",1264723200,5,642,4.144
3145751,3,B0015LPS1E,"While it breaks no new ground, Timber Falls (2007) has its moments, and is a competently executed thriller.  Sheryl (Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall) are in West Virginia's Lake Kumbrabow State Park, to do a little hiking and camping.  When Claire disappears after a skinny dip, Mike charges into the woods to find her, only to have an animal trap clamp down on his leg.  Soon the unfortunate couple find themselves in the hands of an ultra-religious family of three, willing to torture, maim, or kill, to get the services of a surrogate mother.

Harmless looking folk, Clyde Foster (Nick Searcy) is a forest ranger, and his wife Ida (Beth Broderick), tends to things around their cabin.  Ida being unable to carry a child to term has caused the couple to resort to rather extreme measures (apparently adoption is not an option).  Ida's deformed brother Deacon (Sascha Rosemann), gleefully manages the torture department.  When the captive couple refuses to cooperate, and attempt to conceive a child, the family begins to get persuasive, and blood starts to flow.  Mike, who up to this point has been kind of a wavering between being a hero and a klutz, sees the situation with clarity, and seems to get his act together after taking a nasty whipping.  Still he keeps running his mouth, and takes wound, after wound, after wound.

Nick Searcy and Beth Broderick do a pretty convincing job as the genteel, true believing couple, who go from passive to fanatic, to manic.  They both look very benign, which helps make their transformation even more eerie.  The level of gore and violence doesn't reach extreme levels, and if anything, the character Deacon is just underused.  He looks repulsive and has a nasty tool, but really doesn't do very much.  It seems like an opportunity to do some major mayhem was missed.  It might have been cool, if they could have found some way to feature the waterfall in the story.

The film is presented in widescreen, subtitles are not available.  A forty minute behind the scenes featurette is pretty comprehensive, and features both the principal characters and members of the production team.  Deacon's gag interview however, runs much too long.",1257897600,,2188,4.899456521739131
3145752,1,B0015LPS1E,"Even the people who liked this movie are quick to add that there isn't one original scene or shot in this movie.

Another juvenile poke at West Virginia (but I guess it's really Romania), another swipe at those kooky Christians who have one mutant offspring and obviously want many more.  I don't fault the actors and the production values...but I despise the filmmakers who thought we needed another one of these movies.

It is so by-the-numbers that I'll bet most of the viewers didn't even have a problem when 2 plus 2 equaled...5.

What do I mean?  SPOILER AHEAD.  And, honestly, could the term SPOILER AHEAD be used for this movie?  If someone can spoil something in this movie for you, welcome to the wonderful world of film, because you are definitely new to this art form.

Okay, big climax.  A major character has been tortured nearly as bad as Jim Cavaziel in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  He even gets shot, which Cavaziel didn't get.  He's delirious, he's bleeding out, and then...he gets a big rod run directly through his gut.  Which, by the way, means it connected, if not severed, his spine.  The usual ""don't you die on me, don't you die on me.""  Expressionless, pale.  Glazed eyes frozen open.  Bummer.

Then the final scene.  And there he is.  Oh.  Good.  I guess.  No explanation, nothing...but there he is.  And nobody's protesting.  Why?  Because if the movie had done something DIFFERENT--like maintain a consistency or a stab at logic--it would not have DONE THE SAME THING THAT EVERY MOVIE LIKE THIS DOES.  Pure formula.

I was just walking around Santa Monica last week and passed a movie company's lobby.  I looked in and saw the posters on the wall.  The TERMINATOR movies, a couple of Bruce Willis pics, TOMBSTONE...and the newest poster was TIMBER FALLS.  I'd never heard of it.

Pretty standard damsel-in-distress-in-the-woods fare. Young-and-beautiful couple go on a hiking trip, encounter some of the locals (with the usual misdirections), run afoul of them simply because one set of mores is different than the other, and wind up in big, big trouble. You've seen it all before. If you're a fan of this sort of movie, you've seen it all before many, many times. Nothing here original, no interesting twists in the plot (or in the ideas behind it, which is often where one finds the most interesting twists), no standout acting or technical details.

3145756,1,B0015LPS1E,"I only watched this movie because it was supposed to take place in West Virginia. The first thing I noticed was that it was not West Virginia. I have lived here my entire life and have been all over the state and I did not recognize it. Then, the State Park they visited does not even exist. Come on! If you are going to make a movie about West Virginia, at least use a real State Park! But that would have been impossible because I found that they filmed this in Romania!

The mention that Charleston (the state capitol) smelled like feet was a stretch too. Yes, the chemical plants in surrounding towns do smell like feet at times but the actual city of Charleston does not. It is like any city in any state in fact.

My other huge problem with this movie was that the evil hillbillies are portrayed as Christians. A true child of Jesus Christ, a Christian, would never do the things these people did in this movie! This is a horrible testimony of what Jesus Christ is like and what his followers are like. There are people who are absolutely nuts like these people who claim to hear Jesus telling them to do things but I don't think this movie was very clear in differentiating that fact. And for that, shame on those that made this awful movie!

The quality of this low-grade movie was actually a step above the rest of this type but the content was just too annoying and too incorrect for me. And the fact that almost every movie about West Virginia makes us all look like hillbillies gets old too. Anybody who has that opinion should visit Charleston and they will see that we are just like people in any other city and most of us do not have a southern accent to go along with it!

I do not recommend this movie unless you are braindead and then I still wouldn't recommend it!",1229212800,3,1783,4.3293413173652695
3145757,3,B0015LPS1E,"This movie probably would have been commercially successful on the big screen had Lindsay Lohan and Paul Walker starred in it. But it would have missed that down to earth, everyday people feel. The cast was perfect. The only thing I do not like is this trend where every person of faith, in contemporary movies, is a nut; and nutty this family in the woods is. The story is nothing new; yet another offshoot of Deliverance, but these two innocent lovers were tortured like no one in movies since Jesus in Passion of the Christ. They were torchered as much pshychologically as physically. This movie was so good, I ordered it halfway through from Amazon before I finished watching it. I had never seen this movie before.

It was nice to see ""young love"" perservere, even if old ""Boomerang knife"" does lead one to believe they will be mashed potatoes by midnight. They went through too much not to survive. Would've been nice if the ""hillbilly brothers"" had wanted to rescue them out of altruism, instead of selfishness. I cannot think of one bad thing about this movie, except or the broadstroke of ""looney believers"" that is pervasive in many Hollywood movies. I liked all the actors. I do think Sheryl is keeping a gun around the house now. Heck, she is probably keeping an AK-47 under the sheets. Josh Randall was great as the suffering hero, who withstood  torture on top of torture for the woman he loved. He portrayed the ""old school"" hero. She , the scared little damsel, morphed into Jamie Lee Curtis and Andrianne King at the end to perfection. I am going to watch this one over and over. Definately not a waste. I give it a 3.5. NOt a boring moment. Nothing overdone. The right amount of gore. The very end was predictable, but still effective in this movie.  Hillbilly hades.

The central family has bizarre plans for the couple, and for their yet-to-be offspring.

  ***WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD****

  The highly religious family we meet early on turns out, before the half-way point, to have some pretty psychotic villains.  Some people may watch a movie like this and think there's some kind of anti-religion messsage in there; that's not what I got at all.  In this we got a bible-quoting, Christian family who turn out to have twisted things to extremes, in the next horror movie like this we might get a bunch who's twisted some other belief or philosophy to weird, unexpected extremes; I don't think it's intended to indict any larger group.

  In terms of production, acting and all, it's well done.  Some good twists, some original ideas mixed with classic horror themes (i.e. the house in the woods, the disfigured killer, the unseen watchers in the woods), and good characterization - particularly with the unfortunate lead couple - add up to make this stand out.  Strongly recommended for fans of such horror as Texas Chainsaw, the Friday The 13th series, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>.",1226275200,,2892,6.966759002770083
3145760,3,B0015LPS1E,"An attractive, young, virile couple (Mike and Sheryl) go hiking in the wilderness.  They ignore the park ranger's trail advice (fools) and they meet a simple yet helpful woman named Ida.  Ida provides details about hiking trails, and inquires about the couple's piety.  Naturally, she recommends the most dangerous and most picturesque of the trails: Timber Falls.

Along Timber Falls the couple decide to have sex in the woods.  (Morons)  Naturally, they run into a stereotypical group of hillbillies who speak with thick drawls and don't got no learnin'.  During the exchange, Sheryl sees Mike's pistol, and convinces him to throw away the bullets.  (Imbecile)  Then they camp, get drunk, and copulate.  The next morning she bathes solo in the lake.  (Idiot)  Mike follows it up by losing his Boy Scout merit badge for ""Not Stepping in Bear Traps"".  (Jackass)  The rest plays out exactly as you would expect it to: hillbilly, darkness, deformity, religion, formaldehyde jars, torture, candles, whips, and assorted edged weapons.  Although, the warped family provides an interesting Children of the Corn warped sense of religion twist.

There are some positives, however.  There are some very interesting filming techniques, close-ups, and clever use of lighting and angles.  I felt at times that the visual concepts were ingenious.  Not the typical choppy filming techniques of today that leave too much to the imagination and cause vertigo.  The action was intense and believable - especially the torture.  And despite the fact that Hellen Keller could have yelled out what was next, the movie is enjoyable in a horror/comedy combination.

Conversely, a good majority of this movie is just lazy.  It's in West Virginia - aren't they all in West Virginia?  It's the classic city-slickers versus rednecks.  (I loved the ""Popeye with deformities"" angle)  It borrows from the torture-porn genre that seems in vogue, or at least until desiccated by the Saw series.  There are even two ""girl trips while running from a villain"" scenes.  One eventually runs to a waterfall/cliff, a literal dead-end - plagiarized from Kiss the Girls.  As a matter of fact, the movie appears to have borrowed the set from Kiss the Girls, even the underground tunnel system.

Overall it's just average.  Neither bored nor excited, I didn't care what happened to the blatantly dumb couple.  The main characters inability to elicit empathy made me almost root for the hillbillies. It's good enough to rent...if you haven't tired of Wrong Turn 1 or 2.",1223942400,7,2525,5.112745098039215
3145761,3,B0015LPS1E,"I enjoyed this one.  I've seen some losers recently, but this one delivered for the most part.  Tired old plot, perhaps, but on par (I thought) with the  heavyweights in the genre.  The obsessive wannabe holy parents spin is an interesting one, and gives the whole tale a different angle from what I've seen.

Also, I don't mean to ruin it (but everyone will know it's coming) the `punishment' handed to the punishers will have you standing in applause.

But, the ending...  A gripping, brutal, suspenseful nail biter with a hero and heroine you actually give a **** about can be flawed in one easy step:  in the last two seconds, just give it a standard PG-13 finale shock and you can toss it up on the shelf with the rest...

Ugly, mutated villian, check. Quite a bit of blood, with some torture, check. Nothing about this film is original, however it did deliver what it set out to. I myself was never bored, but also not blown away by anything that happened. The plot was pretty good, even though you can guess as to what is gonna happen next. The acting is convincing, but noone will get nominated for a academy award. The blood and torture scenes were very well done, those being my favorite parts of the movie.

 Mike and Sheryl set out to go camping in the mountains, while hiking they stop for alittle foreplay, when getting stopped by three redneck guys that just want to have a little fun harrassing the young pair.

Setting up camp near a lake, the next morning Sheryl goes for a swim in the nearby lake, only to be kidnapped. Waking up Mike realizes his girlfriend is missing. He embarks on a terrifying quest to save her. The young man soon finds a very bizzare family that will stop at nothing to get what they want.

3145764,2,B0015LPS1E,"I, too, was surprised by this movie.  Although the premise is not new (couple hiking in the mountains gets abducted by some crazed locals), the nice twist was this couple was barren of children and looking for a ""holy"" couple who would mate and supply them with their first born.

Referred to as West Virginia, the movie was actually shot on location in Romania.  The scenery was nice, the acting very believable, and the story fast paced.  So, you might be asking why I rated the movie so low.  And I'll tell you...

Two MAJOR gaffes stopped this movie from getting a 3-star (or better) rating.  The first incident happened after the couple had encountered the three brothers.  These brothers caught the couple in a prelude to more than a kiss (in one of the more uncomfortable moments of the movie).  They warned them on the spot to be careful of the path they chose while camping AND they bilked them out of $50.00.  Why on earth the two didn't turn around, go back to the ranger station, and report this was just unbelievable.  The second (and by far the WORST) was the ending.  I'm not going to tell it, but that by-the-book, nothing new ending just ruined it.

The movie is rated R for gore, is directed by Tony Giglio, and the run time is 95 minutes.  I can't really recommend it, but I can't really say stay away either, so you decide.",1213056000,2,1343,4.450819672131147
3145765,3,B0015LPS1E,"This is a solid 3 1/2 stars, one of the better direct to video releases you'll find in the genre. The camerawork is above par, the acting is believable, and the story is generally cohesive and well told, not to mention quickly paced. The theme is not particularly new, as a couple looks to escape the city for a camping getaway in the beautiful backwoods. The misplaced pair are part of the classic liberal urbanites clashing with the ultra conservative and extreme fundamentalists of rural Appalachia.

What strikes you first is this couple is given every indication that this trip is not a good idea. They are warned on two occasions to avoid the path they will take, and are harrassed near the point of being raped by locals in the woods, but that does not deter them from finding the most isolated locale possible to pitch a tent. This alone is enough to lose a star. When the woman turns up missing the next morning, the boyfriend frantically searches for her, leading us to a couple who are desparate for a child but unable to conceive. Their solution: find a verile couple to have one for them. And they have a deviously warped biblical view of the world to justify this. Truly their characters are devious enough, but we are given a brother who is, of course, deformed and mentally deranged, and the violent one in the family. He is really an afterthought in the movie, but he exists to perform some of the more grisly scenes that are effectively carried out over the latter half of the film.

You'll find plenty here that you have seen before, but there is enough of a twist to the typical backwoods theme to keep it fresh. The film is brutal at times - beginning with the very first scene - and there are a few scenes that do make you grit your teeth. Overall, it's a satisfying flick and a worthwhile addition to the genre, if not your collection.",1212192000,7,1858,4.494082840236686

Although you do see the tables with assorted knives and other cutting and hacking devices as you see in SO many of the horror movies of today""not that I mind it"" this is not a Hostel or a Saw..

It has quite a different angle.

A crazed family that consists of a barren wannabe mother her disfigured brother""He aint cute"" and her husband set out to find couples to conceive babies for Ida""the Barren wannabe mother"".

The beginning shows you the last couple that they captured and what happens to them and what went wrong with that scheme and why they need to find another couple to give Ida a child. That was in case you were worried about there being only two victims..Plus I will give no spoilers but a lot of blood is spilled.

The main characters in the movie that play the new couple in danger are very attractive, ""Sheryl and Mike""They go on a hiking trip and bump into some local redneck bullies that lend to some of the excitement as well as the uber religious ""only if it falls in their favor"" family that kidnaps, tortures and does other horrible things to them.

3380243,2,B0015LPS1E,"It's become fashionable lately to name horror movies after a location.  Maybe all the good horror names have been used up, maybe the writers lack creativity, or maybe it's just easier to remember.  The latest in this string of peculiar American towns is Timber Falls.

Now, ""Timber Falls"" sounds a little bit silly, because all I can think of is someone shouting ""TimmmmmBEEERRRRRRR!"" as a tree falls. But maybe that's a point, because there's a lot of silliness going on in Timber Falls.

Timber Falls features a disfigured and deranged killer, a crazy family with a bizarre ideology, and ""normal"" folk who are secretly in league with the crazies.  It's Misery meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Where Timber Falls distinguishes itself is the reason for the family's actions.  TIMBER ALERT: I'm going to be felling a lot of spoiler trees in a moment.

There's lawman Clyde (Nick Searcy), who also happens to be the father of this insane clan.  He may look normal, but he's actually the patriarch of a breeding program committed to producing a child for his beloved Ida (Beth Broderick). Ida has been driven mad by her repeated attempts at having children, the film's primary creepy moment encapsulated in the aborted fetuses collected in her basement.  And tacked onto this bunch is Deacon (Sascha Rosemann), Ida's brother - a deformed, deranged serial killer.

Deacon is the muscle in this little operation dedicated to finding a new child for Ida and Clyde. Their master plan: find good breeding stock (i.e. stupid city people screwing around in the woods), ensure they aren't ""living in sin"" by marrying them if need be, and then forcing them to procreate until a baby arrives. It's not a particularly good plan, given that the first couple in the opening scenes dies rather than comply. But without a lot of stupidity Timber Falls wouldn't be much of a movie.

Into this mess stumbles Sheryl (delicious Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall).  They're on a romantic hiking trip and think nothing of going off into uncharted territory - Timber Falls in this case. When they come across a group of sadistic hunters who threaten to 1) molest Sheryl, 2) steal her clothes, 3) wave shotguns in their faces, and 4) blackmail the couple into buying some moonshine...Mike chooses to pay them off rather than reach for his concealed handgun.  Sheryl, in the height of stupidity, demands Mike remove all the bullets from his gun.

Now I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure the trip's over, right?  The hunters did everything but actually assault the couple.  Get rid of the gun? Are you kidding me lady?

Predictably, Sheryl is kidnapped and Mike goes on a tear to retrieve her.  He then is 1) skewered by a sharp stick in the arm, 2) snared in a bear trap, 3) shot, 4) stabbed in the gut, and 5) tortured repeatedly.  Throughout, Mike is defiant, hurling insults at his captors even though he and Sheryl are tortured until they comply.  Somebody should tell Mike he's in a horror movie.

There's so many problems with Timber Falls. Deacon - who exists to menace the couple as Clyde and Idea are clearly not scary enough -- seems to be tacked on from another movie. Sheryl and Mike are dumb as rocks. And the ending sets up Timber Falls for a sequel it didn't earn.

The sad thing is that Timber Falls had potential - the contrast between city and country folks, the uncomfortable probing questions about religion from a young couple who probably hasn't thought much about settling down, and the idea of becoming brutalized in rural America...these are all scenes that build up dread. It's just that Timber Falls isn't sure what to do with its raw material.",1294185600,3,3655,4.775834658187599

The movie is well paced, and has some decent character development. Not packed with ""boo"" type scares; but still manages to maintain a feeling of tension/anxiety throughout the film.

3380246,3,B0015LPS1E,"Slasher flicks.  You either love 'em or hate them. I am on the fence with this one. On one side is razor wire and on the other side is quicksand. So you see my predicement. Most victims in slasher movies are commonly one sandwich short of a picnic. The couple in this movie also forgot the potato salad.

City dwellers Mike and Cheryl decide to hike in the rural hills of West Virginia.  Unbeknownst to them, them thar hills is crawling with Bible-thumping lunatics, card-carrying rednecks, a drooling mutant and an unkempt, greasy haired woman dragging a child's wagon behind her. Mike and Cheryl even ask for directions from this person who looks like she has a permanent table at ""Uncle Jimmy Bob's Fried Possum Shack.""

They follow her directions(oh-oh) and as soon as they find a clearing they decide to have an impropmtu session of afternoon delight. Coitus is interruptus by a trio of card carrying rednecks who menace the couple, then extort 50 dollars from them.

Now comes the scene where I lost further vested interest for the welfare of the couple.

Remember-they have just been scared silly by rednecks.  Well Cheryl is horrified to learn that Mike is carrying a loaded revolver. They compromise--she tells him he can keep the gun but to toss the bullets. He throws the rounds into the lake, the fish get fed and we're left with a movie starring Dumb and dumber.

I watched the movie until the end well aware that here was a couple too stupid to live but to be slowly tortured.  The balance of the film involves-named fetus's in mason jars, mutilations, forced copulation, chopped fingers, a gory whipping, a drooling mutant's attempt at sex, impalements, shotgun blasts, cut throats, a moonshine molotov cocktail.

The last scene is one of those ""surprise"" scenes but like the couple it doesn't make sense. Although it is revealed that Cheryl is aleady 8 weeks pregnant before the torture scenes-it is now one year later and Mike and Cheryl have survived their weekend hiking trip and now are doting parents of a baby boy. They leave the room and suddenly a baby hand reaches up from the crib holding a miniature scythe. Give me a break!  LOL",1276387200,3,2156,4.722666666666667

There were also some good twists and turns where some of the characters you assume are bad guys end up trying to help the ""city folk.""

3380248,3,B0015LPS1E,"While it breaks no new ground, Timber Falls (2007) has its moments, and is a competently executed thriller.  Sheryl (Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall) are in West Virginia's Lake Kumbrabow State Park, to do a little hiking and camping.  When Claire disappears after a skinny dip, Mike charges into the woods to find her, only to have an animal trap clamp down on his leg.  Soon the unfortunate couple find themselves in the hands of an ultra-religious family of three, willing to torture, maim, or kill, to get the services of a surrogate mother.

Harmless looking folk, Clyde Foster (Nick Searcy) is a forest ranger, and his wife Ida (Beth Broderick), tends to things around their cabin.  Ida being unable to carry a child to term has caused the couple to resort to rather extreme measures (apparently adoption is not an option).  Ida's deformed brother Deacon (Sascha Rosemann), gleefully manages the torture department.  When the captive couple refuses to cooperate, and attempt to conceive a child, the family begins to get persuasive, and blood starts to flow.  Mike, who up to this point has been kind of a wavering between being a hero and a klutz, sees the situation with clarity, and seems to get his act together after taking a nasty whipping.  Still he keeps running his mouth, and takes wound, after wound, after wound.

Nick Searcy and Beth Broderick do a pretty convincing job as the genteel, true believing couple, who go from passive to fanatic, to manic.  They both look very benign, which helps make their transformation even more eerie.  The level of gore and violence doesn't reach extreme levels, and if anything, the character Deacon is just underused.  He looks repulsive and has a nasty tool, but really doesn't do very much.  It seems like an opportunity to do some major mayhem was missed.  It might have been cool, if they could have found some way to feature the waterfall in the story.

The film is presented in widescreen, subtitles are not available.  A forty minute behind the scenes featurette is pretty comprehensive, and features both the principal characters and members of the production team.

Another juvenile poke at West Virginia (but I guess it's really Romania), another swipe at those kooky Christians who have one mutant offspring and obviously want many more.  I don't fault the actors and the production values...but I despise the filmmakers who thought we needed another one of these movies.

It is so by-the-numbers that I'll bet most of the viewers didn't even have a problem when 2 plus 2 equaled...5.

What do I mean?  SPOILER AHEAD.  And, honestly, could the term SPOILER AHEAD be used for this movie?  If someone can spoil something in this movie for you, welcome to the wonderful world of film, because you are definitely new to this art form.

Okay, big climax.  A major character has been tortured nearly as bad as Jim Cavaziel in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  He even gets shot, which Cavaziel didn't get.  He's delirious, he's bleeding out, and then...he gets a big rod run directly through his gut.  Which, by the way, means it connected, if not severed, his spine.  The usual ""don't you die on me, don't you die on me.""  Expressionless, pale.  Glazed eyes frozen open.  Bummer.

Then the final scene.  And there he is.  Oh.  Good.  I guess.  No explanation, nothing...but there he is.  And nobody's protesting.  Why?  Because if the movie had done something DIFFERENT--like maintain a consistency or a stab at logic--it would not have DONE THE SAME THING THAT EVERY MOVIE LIKE THIS DOES.  Pure formula.

I was just walking around Santa Monica last week and passed a movie company's lobby.  I looked in and saw the posters on the wall.  The TERMINATOR movies, a couple of Bruce Willis pics, TOMBSTONE...and the newest poster was TIMBER FALLS.  I'd never heard of it.

I have lived here my entire life and have been all over the state and I did not recognize it. Then, the State Park they visited does not even exist. Come on! If you are going to make a movie about West Virginia, at least use a real State Park! But that would have been impossible because I found that they filmed this in Romania!

The mention that Charleston (the state capitol) smelled like feet was a stretch too. Yes, the chemical plants in surrounding towns do smell like feet at times but the actual city of Charleston does not. It is like any city in any state in fact.

My other huge problem with this movie was that the evil hillbillies are portrayed as Christians. A true child of Jesus Christ, a Christian, would never do the things these people did in this movie! This is a horrible testimony of what Jesus Christ is like and what his followers are like. There are people who are absolutely nuts like these people who claim to hear Jesus telling them to do things but I don't think this movie was very clear in differentiating that fact. And for that, shame on those that made this awful movie!

The quality of this low-grade movie was actually a step above the rest of this type but the content was just too annoying and too incorrect for me. And the fact that almost every movie about West Virginia makes us all look like hillbillies gets old too. Anybody who has that opinion should visit Charleston and they will see that we are just like people in any other city and most of us do not have a southern accent to go along with it!

But it would have missed that down to earth, everyday people feel. The cast was perfect. The only thing I do not like is this trend where every person of faith, in contemporary movies, is a nut; and nutty this family in the woods is. The story is nothing new; yet another offshoot of Deliverance, but these two innocent lovers were tortured like no one in movies since Jesus in Passion of the Christ.

It was nice to see ""young love"" perservere, even if old ""Boomerang knife"" does lead one to believe they will be mashed potatoes by midnight. They went through too much not to survive.

I cannot think of one bad thing about this movie, except or the broadstroke of ""looney believers"" that is pervasive in many Hollywood movies. I liked all the actors. I do think Sheryl is keeping a gun around the house now. Heck, she is probably keeping an AK-47 under the sheets. Josh Randall was great as the suffering hero, who withstood  torture on top of torture for the woman he loved. He portrayed the ""old school"" hero.

  ***WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD****

  The highly religious family we meet early on turns out, before the half-way point, to have some pretty psychotic villains.  Some people may watch a movie like this and think there's some kind of anti-religion messsage in there; that's not what I got at all.  In this we got a bible-quoting, Christian family who turn out to have twisted things to extremes, in the next horror movie like this we might get a bunch who's twisted some other belief or philosophy to weird, unexpected extremes; I don't think it's intended to indict any larger group.

  In terms of production, acting and all, it's well done.  Some good twists, some original ideas mixed with classic horror themes (i.e. the house in the woods, the disfigured killer, the unseen watchers in the woods), and good characterization - particularly with the unfortunate lead couple - add up to make this stand out.  Strongly recommended for fans of such horror as Texas Chainsaw, the Friday The 13th series, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>.",1226275200,,2892,6.966759002770083

They ignore the park ranger's trail advice (fools) and they meet a simple yet helpful woman named Ida.  Ida provides details about hiking trails, and inquires about the couple's piety.  Naturally, she recommends the most dangerous and most picturesque of the trails: Timber Falls.

Along Timber Falls the couple decide to have sex in the woods.  (Morons)  Naturally, they run into a stereotypical group of hillbillies who speak with thick drawls and don't got no learnin'.  During the exchange, Sheryl sees Mike's pistol, and convinces him to throw away the bullets.  (Imbecile)  Then they camp, get drunk, and copulate.  The next morning she bathes solo in the lake.  (Idiot)  Mike follows it up by losing his Boy Scout merit badge for ""Not Stepping in Bear Traps"".  (Jackass)  The rest plays out exactly as you would expect it to: hillbilly, darkness, deformity, religion, formaldehyde jars, torture, candles, whips, and assorted edged weapons.  Although, the warped family provides an interesting Children of the Corn warped sense of religion twist.

There are some positives, however.  There are some very interesting filming techniques, close-ups, and clever use of lighting and angles.  I felt at times that the visual concepts were ingenious.  Not the typical choppy filming techniques of today that leave too much to the imagination and cause vertigo.  The action was intense and believable - especially the torture.  And despite the fact that Hellen Keller could have yelled out what was next, the movie is enjoyable in a horror/comedy combination.

Conversely, a good majority of this movie is just lazy.  It's in West Virginia - aren't they all in West Virginia?  It's the classic city-slickers versus rednecks.  (I loved the ""Popeye with deformities"" angle)  It borrows from the torture-porn genre that seems in vogue, or at least until desiccated by the Saw series.  There are even two ""girl trips while running from a villain"" scenes.  One eventually runs to a waterfall/cliff, a literal dead-end - plagiarized from Kiss the Girls.  As a matter of fact, the movie appears to have borrowed the set from Kiss the Girls, even the underground tunnel system.

Overall it's just average.  Neither bored nor excited, I didn't care what happened to the blatantly dumb couple.  The main characters inability to elicit empathy made me almost root for the hillbillies. It's good enough to rent...if you haven't tired of Wrong Turn 1 or 2.",1223942400,7,2525,5.112745098039215

 Mike and Sheryl set out to go camping in the mountains, while hiking they stop for alittle foreplay, when getting stopped by three redneck guys that just want to have a little fun harrassing the young pair. After warning the two to be careful what they do in woods, that everyone is watching, the young couple set out to complete their hike. Setting up camp near a lake, the next morning Sheryl goes for a swim in the nearby lake, only to be kidnapped. Waking up Mike realizes his girlfriend is missing. He embarks on a terrifying quest to save her. The young man soon finds a very bizzare family that will stop at nothing to get what they want.

 As for the ending you see it coming a mile away. Nothing in the film was too shocking or over the top. On a more positive note, it is a descent B movie to watch and has some good gore moments.",1213401600,17,1507,4.39068100358423
3380261,2,B0015LPS1E,"I, too, was surprised by this movie.  Although the premise is not new (couple hiking in the mountains gets abducted by some crazed locals), the nice twist was this couple was barren of children and looking for a ""holy"" couple who would mate and supply them with their first born.

Referred to as West Virginia, the movie was actually shot on location in Romania.  The scenery was nice, the acting very believable, and the story fast paced.  So, you might be asking why I rated the movie so low.  And I'll tell you...

Two MAJOR gaffes stopped this movie from getting a 3-star (or better) rating.  The first incident happened after the couple had encountered the three brothers.  These brothers caught the couple in a prelude to more than a kiss (in one of the more uncomfortable moments of the movie).  They warned them on the spot to be careful of the path they chose while camping AND they bilked them out of $50.00.  Why on earth the two didn't turn around, go back to the ranger station, and report this was just unbelievable.  The second (and by far the WORST) was the ending.  I'm not going to tell it, but that by-the-book, nothing new ending just ruined it.

The movie is rated R for gore, is directed by Tony Giglio, and the run time is 95 minutes.  I can't really recommend it, but I can't really say stay away either, so you decide.",1213056000,2,1343,4.450819672131147
3380262,3,B0015LPS1E,"This is a solid 3 1/2 stars, one of the better direct to video releases you'll find in the genre. The camerawork is above par, the acting is believable, and the story is generally cohesive and well told, not to mention quickly paced. The theme is not particularly new, as a couple looks to escape the city for a camping getaway in the beautiful backwoods. The misplaced pair are part of the classic liberal urbanites clashing with the ultra conservative and extreme fundamentalists of rural Appalachia.

What strikes you first is this couple is given every indication that this trip is not a good idea. They are warned on two occasions to avoid the path they will take, and are harrassed near the point of being raped by locals in the woods, but that does not deter them from finding the most isolated locale possible to pitch a tent. This alone is enough to lose a star. When the woman turns up missing the next morning, the boyfriend frantically searches for her, leading us to a couple who are desparate for a child but unable to conceive. Their solution: find a verile couple to have one for them. And they have a deviously warped biblical view of the world to justify this. Truly their characters are devious enough, but we are given a brother who is, of course, deformed and mentally deranged, and the violent one in the family. He is really an afterthought in the movie, but he exists to perform some of the more grisly scenes that are effectively carried out over the latter half of the film.

You'll find plenty here that you have seen before, but there is enough of a twist to the typical backwoods theme to keep it fresh. The film is brutal at times - beginning with the very first scene - and there are a few scenes that do make you grit your teeth. Overall, it's a satisfying flick and a worthwhile addition to the genre, if not your collection.",1212192000,7,1858,4.494082840236686

8259040,3,B0015LPS1E,"Completely unnecessary entry in the Hills Have Eyes/Wrong Turn genre has a city couple hiking in the woods, eventually encountering the usual inbred redneck psychos that turn up in these movies.  Timber Falls is certainly well made but it has no new ideas to add to the genre beyond making the rednecks fundamentalist Christians and that never really rings true given the amount of seemingly remorse-free killing they do.  The movie might think it's making a statement about religious hypocrisy but it would be much closer to the truth to say that the villainous couple at the center of Timber Falls seems to have no coherent belief system whatsoever.  This one is by the numbers predictable every step of the way.  As for those who think the baby angle is original--apparently, they never saw The Hills Have Eyes 2 or Dying Breed. If you like these types of movies there's probably a chance you'll like this one but I can't think of a good reason for it to actually exist--the material feels so warmed over it's like sitting through other filmmakers greatest hits.  When you can watch The Hills Have Eyes (either version) or Just Before Dawn instead why waste your time sitting through this?",1494201600,,1192,4.795121951219512

8259042,4,B0015LPS1E,"Liked this movie.  It reminded me of Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, or Rest Stop.  This couple goes hiking and camping, and don't realize someone is watching them.  Later they are taken by a mountain hills couple so the girl can have children for them.  The young couple never thought that there were strange people in the mountains.

8259046,3,B0015LPS1E,The movie was alright.  It wasn't great but it was watchable.  A religious couple (along with the help of the wife's brother) abduct a couple out hiking.  The religious couple torture the couple until they agree to meet their demand.  The movie has a little bit of gore but nothing impressive.  I thought the ax to the skull was sorta funny but the lashing and pinky removal and the few others were nothing notable.  It would have been nice to be given a bit more information about the wife's brother who's face was scarred.  The brief bit if into the viewer if given was that their father was a bit rough on him and ect...not really any details to explain the scarring although I guess the father tortured him.,1296345600,,711,4.465116279069767
