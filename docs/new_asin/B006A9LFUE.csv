8495721,5,B006A9LFUE,"I bought this just for The Magic of Ordinary Days, and that movie alone was well worth it. It is my all time favorite Hallmark movie. The acting is actually really good (surprising for Hallmark) and the story is beautiful. It was completely clean and family friendly. The other two movies were a bonus for me and they were decent. Highly recommended.",1473120000,2,350,4.661290322580645
