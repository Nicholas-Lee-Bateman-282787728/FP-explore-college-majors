8759243,2,B01ENPQV64,"""The Haunting of Emily"" (2016) and ""Delirium"" (2012) are the same film. After being missing for a whole year, Emily (Taylor Pigeon) magically appears. She does not speak. She lives primarily with her mom Rachel (Jolene Kay) and step father Tim (Nathan Polzin).  Barry (Chris Gann) has visitation rights two days a week for 4 hours each. Tim suffers from demonic hallucinations. Rachel hears scratches and Barry comes across as not as nice guy. While trying to figure out what is happening...

Much of the film is about Tim and his alternate reality, sometimes in black and white, sometimes with a red filter, and sometimes looking like reality. I am sure there is some meaning there I missed.  I thought the female characters looked too much alike. Then there was the opening scene which was a big WTF which they tie into the ending. Acting was fair.
