Musical accompaniment is whatever came on the DVD, video tape, or website these clips were pulled from. Sometimes the music is suitable, sometimes it's a few random 78s, sometimes it's a solo theater organist, and at least once there's nothing at all. The films are arranged chronologically and edited terribly. A clip will fade in, play for a while, and fade out. Other than a caption giving the title and year of the clip, there is no information; no narration or explanation of what is onscreen - or why. Judging by horizontal scan lines, this is a transfer from a VHS tape. It's as if someone downloaded a stack of clips from YouTube and had at it. The final result is jarring, baffling, and incredibly random. I'm not being super-fussy and whining that my favorite films aren't represented. I'm whining that this is the worst way to present silent cinema. At the end of the compilation, a perky voice-over urges you to seek out more of these cinematic treasures - if you've enjoyed this presentation. Well, it's impossible to enjoy this presentation. It really is. If I wanted to keep people away from silent films, this compilation is how I'd do it. Note: the photo on the Amazon page is all wrong. It's the cover of a book with a similar title, but completely different content. There is no Kevin Brownlow, for instance.",1471564800,,1478,4.666666666666667
8517648,5,B007IM0GQG,"Service and product was great. I already read the book Silent Lives, so this was a nice follow-up. I'd been on the fence about purchasing some of the silent movies, so it was great to get additional insights before deciding which to purchase.

Fast, and product was delivered as promised - thank you!",1416182400,,300,4.660377358490566
8517649,5,B007IM0GQG,"Try to introduce viewers of any age to the art of silent film and you find yourself talking about its history as well. Silent movies--those that told stories--existed for barely thirty years, from roughly 1903 to 1929, but the steady refinements in story construction, in camera technique, in editing, and in acting during those years represent an amazing series of triumphs, each one serving to enrich the sophisticated and sensitive art that we associate with the best films of the era.

I wish SILENT LIVES: CLASSIC SCREEN MOMENTS had been around when I was teaching young people about early motion pictures. Here are 23 clips of silent-era films, both shorts and features--comedies, dramas, horror films, swashbucklers--arranged in chronological order and running a leisurely 88 minutes. They are conveniently indexed so that you can watch one clip or ten--or simply skip around. Todays students, so attuned to digital animation, might enjoy the juxtaposition of Georges Mliss THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE, which astonishes with elaborate and ingenious special effects, and Buster Keatons STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., which astonishes with no special effects at all.

Each clip may be viewed with musical accompaniment or with Lon Daviss commentary. The commentaries open many avenues for exploration, but there is an even better reason to listen to them. Davis has not selected the clips haphazardly or with the intention of creating a roster of greatest hits. THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY is here to kick things off, and there are other such milestones along the way, including NOSFERATU and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. But whereas many historians might have felt obligated to represent D.W. Griffith with the ever-controversial THE BIRTH OF A NATION, Davis chooses the lovely and moving Biograph short THE NEW YORK HAT and the monumental, doomed masterwork INTOLERANCE. Anyone who knows the name of Harold Lloyd is familiar with SAFETY LAST; Davis shows us the equally delightful GIRL SHY instead. And while the biggest names of the silent screen are all here--Pickford, Chaplin, Fairbanks, Valentino, Lloyd, Chaney, Barrymore, and Keaton--how the heck did Davis manage to squeeze in the undervalued yet unforgettable Roscoe Arbuckle, Marie Dressler, Will Rogers, Mabel Normand, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Gloria Swanson, and the solo Stan Laurel?

Anyone new to the pleasures of silent film should also seek out Lon Daviss companion volume SILENT LIVES: 100 BIOGRAPHIES OF THE SILENT FILM ERA.",1383609600,,2482,5.326530612244898
8517650,5,B007IM0GQG,"Much can be praised and has been praised by previous reviewers about Lon Davis' DVD on what he titles Silent Lives, a history of silent film from its earliest times to 1929. History per se has little appeal for some, but Davis' key word in his title along with history is ""visual."" The narrative, performed by Davis, informs, as we follow the evolution of silent film, but does so with example, with cuttings from some of the greatest silent films. So you're not so much watching a video of a history, but rather experiencing the evolving of silent film with restored excerpts.

The DVD has appeal for the veteran silent film aficionado, as exemplfied by previous reviews. However,for folks like me who are new to silent films, Silent Lives serves as a tremendous introduction, starting with the earliest silent films and progressing year by year to 1929. Davis' narration informs, yes, and you learn a great deal about the silent film era, genre, acting styles, etc.; in short, its evolution until its demise with the advent of talking pictures. The DVD's title suggests ""history,"" but a proper emphasis should  be given to the kind of history it is, a visual history. The narrative becomes secondary to the visual presentation of cuttings from many of the greatest refurbished surviving silent films. So, a history it is, no doubt, full of facts and insights enthusiastically presented by Lon Davis.

But the DVD is much more than visual history. Perhaps its greatest appeal, especially for novices to the genre, are its ""classic screen moments,"" the films themselves that have remaining in them still to this day so much artistic and literary appeal. Many of the films ""work"" still, they survive as vibrant artistic expression. And while the histrionics at first appear somewhat incredulous, you gain more and more appreciation of the talent required as you listen to Davis' explanations and witness examples of high performing art.

The primary reason for newcomers to buy this DVD is that it provides a condensed history of silent film, and an appreciation of an artistic expression that is the foundation of modern film. Besides, it is fun to watch.",1336003200,3,2155,4.94475138121547
8517651,5,B007IM0GQG,"If you follow film websites or read film magazines then I'm sure you have read somewhere that because of all the media coverage it has received and all the Oscars that it was awarded, the new silent film THE ARTIST has opened up the world of silent film and silent filmmaking to a whole new generation of fans (of all ages). For those of you who are interested in pursuing silent movies further, there are three simple things that you can do. 1) Watch or record Turner Classic Movies' SILENT SUNDAY NIGHTS which are most every Sunday night at midnight. This is the easiest way to expose yourself to the films on a regular basis as TCM owns the rights to hundreds of silent movies. 2) Check out the website -silentera.com- to find out which silent movies are available on home video. You'll be flabbergasted at the number out there but silentera can tell you which titles to avoid as not all DVDs are created equal (beleive me with silent film DVDs you DO get what you pay for). 3) Order this DVD from amazon as soon as possible (remember the fickleness of the marketplace, here today: gone tomorrow) for Lon Davis' SILENT LIVES: CLASSIC SCREEN MOMENTS is the ideal introduction to silent movies.

As someone who has taught a number of courses on silent film locally, I have used this DVD on several occasions to enrich my presentations and to help ease people into the world of silent film. Mr Davis has made it easy by selecting some of the best known and most readily available titles (THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, THE MARK OF ZORRO, THE SHEIK, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA to name a few) along with clips of the big three of silent comedy: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, & Harold Lloyd. There's even a clip from THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE, a hand colored film from Georges Melies, the subject of Martin Scorsese's recent film HUGO. Accompanying these clips are appropriate background musical selections that fit right in and enhance the viewing experience. Mr Davis' commentary (which is optional but very necessary for beginners) tells you what you need to know in a friendly and accessible manner. So let this be your guide to the fascinating world of silent film. Once you get started, you won't want to stop. After you've watched the DVD, then you'll need to read Lon Davis' book SILENT LIVES: 100 BIOGRAPHIES OF THE SILENT FILM ERA for it was the book that made the DVD possible.",1335830400,3,2375,4.627962085308057

IF YOU LOVED ""THE ARTIST"" YOU WILL TREASURE THIS DVD

Film Historian Lon Davis has hit another home run with this companion DVD to his best selling book ""Silent Lives."" This disc is filled with all kinds of priceless treasures from iconic silent era films that were part of ""Silent Lives.""

The clips include some of great silent stars. Included in this disc is an evocative musical score for each segment. The commentary track by film historian and author Lon Davis is truly facinating. Lon paints a wonderful background that is truly illuminating. I was facinated by the clips from ""The Great Train Robbery,"" George Mlis ""The Impossible Voyage,"" (LOn gives great background on this);  a great clip from D.W. Griffith's classic "" Intolerance,"" included also is ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with Lon Chaney, and Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr. and many more. Lon also includes rare clips from Harold Lloyd that he received from the heirs of Lloyd. Their deep respect for Lon culminated in his inclusion of the wonderful, rare gems.

With the great response of the Academy Award winning ""The Artist,"" there are many fans who are now interested in the world of silent cinema. The great book ""Silent Lives"" and this companion DVD is a perfect introduction to the history of the silent films. Congratulations to film historian Lon Davis for creating this masterpiece disc.
