7999688,1,B0000CNY5D,"This is NOT the George Archainbaud/Gig Young crime story from 1950.  Rather, it's a 1971 spaghetti western directed by Eugenio Martn, starring Lee van Cleef and James Mason.

 My review of the Martin/van Cleef HUNT THE MAN DOWN (aka BAD MAN'S RIVER):

  Awful.  Terrible attempt at fusing comedy, tinkly popular tunes and spaghetti western action.  Painful to watch and, because it has such a needlessly convoluted plot, almost impossible to describe.  The three stars (van Cleef, Mason, and Gina Lollabrigida) look lost and a little ashamed.  Not worth your time at any price.",1104624000,7,577,5.10752688172043
