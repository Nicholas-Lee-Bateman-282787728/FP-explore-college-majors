5679233,3,B00BWH6DL0,"The recruits of a small Polynesian training camp spend their nights frightening each other with terror tales of the spirits that supposedly lived on the island, but as they will soon discover through the deaths of several of their friends, the stories are true! Writer/Director Gilbert Chan breaks into the international Horror scene with the eerie and atmospheric 23:59, which takes its name and ghostly legends from Polynesian folklore. 23:59 assembles a talented group of young actors to play the unfortunate troops in the haunted platoon, with Henley Hii providing a strong lead as the crowd skeptic, Jeremy. It is only through the deaths of his fellow classmates and a few ghastly revelations of his own that Jeremy is able to confront the spirits and put them at ease. Chan offers an even blend of shock and terror through his startling imagery, but leans towards more traditional scares that are built on the deepening mood that surrounds his characters. 23:59 holds a certain appeal for fans of the similarly-themed DORM, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, and WHISPERING CORRIDORS.

8574744,5,B00BWH6DL0,"I think this is one of the most moving stories I have seen in a long while. There were a few parts that were a little cheesy, like the interaction of the recruits when bullying is going on, but overall I enjoyed the movie. And as my review title says, it made me cry in the end. I think I will fully purchase this (rented through Amazon), because this is a movie I will want to watch again.",1392854400,3,390,4.012820512820513

8574746,5,B00BWH6DL0,"I found this movie to be real good. This is the first military ghost story that I ever watched. The director of this movie did research about the story, because it was inspired by true events. He actually did find newspaper stories about the death of the soldier, and the dark secrets on the haunted island. The young cast was excellent and the ending was very good. The disfigured girl and her mother actually are the main characters in the movie. It's a mystery, a psychological thriller, and also about redemption. It is also a very sad story which will deal with your emotions. Not to be missed, just buy it the price is great. Gary Rotella",1375833600,2,644,4.512820512820513
