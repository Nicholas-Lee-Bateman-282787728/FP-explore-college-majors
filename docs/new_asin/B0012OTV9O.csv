8247101,4,B0012OTV9O,"If should be noted that the 6 DVD set does NOT have a box.  The six Alpha cases are simply shrink wrapped into one sales unit with a label on it.  It was still cheaper to buy them this way, however.

Only Menace From Outer Space pictured was DVD, the rest were DVD-R.  Menace also has the lowest catalog number.",1489449600,4,311,4.133333333333334

8247104,5,B0012OTV9O,"Some people complain about the special effects in this series. THERE WAS NO CGI. They did their best. The story is good, so is the acting.  Just plain fun!",1408492800,8,155,4.344827586206897
8247105,3,B0012OTV9O,Very nice to view the old material.  I enjoyed the simple special effects and the rocket designs because I am a model rocket hobbyist.  The video quality is very substandard compared to even older movies from the 40's.,1369353600,9,218,4.7105263157894735
8247106,4,B0012OTV9O,This was one of the earliest TV shows of space and the future.  A lot of fun to see these programs again.,1362268800,5,105,3.772727272727273
