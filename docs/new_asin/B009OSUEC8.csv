8717768,5,B009OSUEC8,"Applying to college is one of the most dreaded and stressful events in a young student's life. It's the fear of the unknown, who will review my application? What type of student makes the cut? Are my grades and test scores all that matter? Those questions remained a mystery until now. For the first time, an admissions insider has finally revealed the answers in the DVD, Tap Into College. This video presentation mimics a one-on-one session with private admissions coach, Patrick Cunningham. His low-key, up beat delivery is engaging and informative without feeling preachy. Cunningham hones in on the essence of what a student needs to communicate in their application and how to present them self in the best light possible. The seminar is easy to follow and the core themes can be applied to any essay based application process whether it's for undergraduates, graduate or post graduate programs.  I really wish something like this had been available when I applied to school. I look forward to sharing these tips with my kids when they are ready to apply to college.

What an amazing presentation.  I have been in education for many years and Patrick was able to take something as important as preparing our students for college and making it relevant and understandable to everyone.  He is funny, engaging, intelligent and full of worthwhile information.  If you are a parent with children close to entering college or an educator who want to pass on college entrance information with your students, this is a MUST HAVE product!",1350345600,,634,4.833333333333333
