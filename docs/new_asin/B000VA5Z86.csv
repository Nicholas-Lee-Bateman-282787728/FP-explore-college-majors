8217721,4,B000VA5Z86,Great game... poor price for an ESPN broadcast.  None the less a great championship game!,1211846400,,89,4.933333333333334
8217722,5,B000VA5Z86,"What the general description fails to say is that App State's quarterback runs for nearly 200 yards in the first half alone.  Another outstanding year for Appalachian State, beating Michigan first game of the year. I hope that Edwards goes into the pros as a high draft pick simply because of his versatility.  Anyone who purchases this video will appreciate his efforts.",1208390400,,371,4.967741935483871
8217723,3,B000VA5Z86,"Having seen the 2007 Division 1 Mens Ice Hockey Championships in person there was little chance a DVD would ever duplicate the awsome experience I had. However as I forgot to tape it on my VCR I was happy to find a DVD of the game on Amazon. When I played the DVD with a friend who attended the game with me, we both felt a little dissapointed in the editing. Yes, all the action was there, but no pregame or between period segements that ESPN had were not there. The post game celebration which I enjoy the most was not there either. It took the feel or atmosphere that the game had. At least I experienced it in person, but its the little things that NCAA On Demand did not include that keep this from getting 5 stars. And to be fair maybe ESPN dosen't let them include more, but it will be the last product produced by NCAA On Demand that I will order. That being said, I am still glad to have the DVD to relive the fantastic third period finish.",1199577600,,949,4.163043478260869
8217724,4,B000VA5Z86,"This is a game for the ages with underdog Johns Hopkins University getting off to a tremendous halftime lead only to see Duke come storming back in a nail-biter. Yet, it was not to be Duke's first NCAA lacrosse championship. Hopkins earned its 9th NCCA lacrosse title and 44th national lacrosse title overall. The disappointing part is that the recording is not HD - that's a shame.",1198972800,4,382,4.7164179104477615
