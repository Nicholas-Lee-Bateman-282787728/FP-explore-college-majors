7666491,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Very, VERY slow build up to a tremendous finale.  I would have preferred a bit less focus on the initially creepy then just-plain-annoying cult story development.  You pretty much know within the first 30 minutes that the spirit of Charlie Manson is hovering above the LA hills and it's not going to end well.  But I was not disappointed in the movie at all.  Would totally recommend.",1460073600,4,384,4.686567164179104
7666492,5,B01BSW1NW2,"One of the best thriller movies of late. Even though you know early on what may happen, its not evident how it will play out.  The build up is very tense and keeps you on your toes.  The characters are really engaging and so well played.  The back and forth between Will's suspicious mind and learning of his mental state, the scenes between Logan Marshall-Greene and Michiel Huisman, and Tammy Blanchard's cult-ish quality really made this a great film to watch. You could easily side with any one of the characters at any time.  The music and pacing reminded me of The Shining and the last act just comes upon you suddenly and takes hold of you.  Very well done by Karyn Kusama and all the actors.  I can see why it got so much positive buzz.",1460073600,12,744,4.394160583941606

7666495,1,B01BSW1NW2,"I could only handle 30 minutes of this before totally giving up on it and kissing $3 good-bye. I had rented it because I was intrigued by other reviewers' descriptions. In particular, some people said it had an eerie kind of atmosphere in which the suspense continued to build. OMG. Really??? Far from being eerie or suspenseful, it was incredibly banal, with one awkward scene after another. The ""conversations"" only last about a minute before one of the characters decides to ""go for a walk"" or get another drink. Another, equally brief and awkward conversation between two other characters would then ensue. It was incredibly tedious and I had absolutely no interest in seeing where it was headed.

Some people might say that the plot was slow, but I think that was beauty of it; it keeps you guessing for a while as to what the deal is and who the ""crazy ones"" really are.

7666505,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Eerie from the get-go, this film builds tension through flashbacks and setting.  Probably will appeal more to fans of dark suspense type of horror, rather than the current crop of slasher/shockers.  A nice surprise in a genre I'd all but given up on.

My guess is that the film's slower pace will be appreciated by older (35+) viewers who have some familiarity with longer set-ups (think Rosemary's Baby).

7666519,5,B01BSW1NW2,Superb psychological thriller that slowly yet determinedly builds towards a nerve wracking ending.

7666522,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Creepy segues into catastrophic.  A group of friends that hadn't seen each other for two years gathers together for a dinner party only to find that the hosts are really eager to discuss this new method of coping with trauma - complete with a video!  The principal character, Will (played hauntingly by Logan Marshall-Green) really isn't having it, this being the house where his son died years earlier.  As the behavior of the hosts and their two special friends becomes even more unsettling, Will, in turn, becomes more convinced something is really wrong.  The ensemble cast is very strong and compelling and the direction and writing have a way of slowly ratcheting up the tension until all hell breaks loose.  A very good film on every level, particularly emotionally - its take on trauma comes close to making a statement.  Well worth watching.",1488326400,,850,4.909090909090909
7666523,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Not a great movie, perhaps, but definitely a good one. The movie is convincingly ambiguous as to whether or not there's a problem at the party, but as a viewer, I had two issues. The first is that in almost every scene, the party guests are drinking, and yet even after a full evening of this, no one seems drunk. The second issue is that there is more than enough weird crap going on at the party for people to leave, and yet no one does. Eden slapping one of her guests across the face would be enough to make me leave a party, even if I wasn't the person being slapped. Then after Eden and her boyfriend announce that they joined a cult in Mexico and proceed to show a disturbing recruitment video, WHY don't people leave? It can't be because these old friends feel obligated to support each other. They haven't been there for each other for the past two years, so why must they stay tonight? But I deliberately didn't read any spoilers ahead of time (and I suggest you don't, either) and therefore felt real tension and suspense as I tried to figure out what was going on. I will say only that the ending was satisfying to me as a viewer, so it's worth your time to watch.",1487635200,,1176,4.278026905829597

7666529,1,B01BSW1NW2,"It was a painfully slow horror movie. The buildup took most of the movie, absolutely nothing happened till the end, so you end up watching just a bunch of people acting strangely for almost the entire movie.

7666530,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Netflix was constantly suggesting this movie to me, but the blurb sounded terrible. It's kind of what you'd expect on one level... you know, horror movie set at a dinner party can only go a few ways. It's very well done though. The flashbacks are minimal considering it's a movie that relies on evolving understood context.

I'm a sucker for a strong finish though (yes, I know how that sounds), and this one really comes through. The final scene references a shot earlier in the movie that seemed at the time to be a little unnecessary (in a movie with not a lot of fluff).

7666537,4,B01BSW1NW2,"The movie takes a little while to get good.  It builds slowly, but organically, giving you the viewer the choice to maintain trust in the protagonist or question your trust in him.  I enjoyed the film-making and characterization, and the production quality was excellent for a lower-budget movie.  The acting ranges from decent to great, but very little of it falls short.

I truly don't understand the negative reviews, especially the one star reviews.  There is no way, given how many films are absolutely awful, that this movie could even qualify under 2 stars for people who dislike it.  Don't trust the one-star reviewers; I question either their intellect, or their taste.  At worst, this is a mediocre or even bland movie, but it can't possibly be an actually ""awful"" movie.

It was slower than many movies, but it wasn't uninteresting.  I enjoy films that rely on the basics: solid acting, solid scripting, coherent plot devices, etc.  If you're looking for Insidious 4 and try to find it here, you'll be disappointed, because this is a slow-burning psychological thriller, not a ""horror"" movie.

But seriously, these one-star reviews are outright deceiving and obnoxious.  You people need to go watch truly terrible movies before you blast someone's hard work, which was actually decent/good/great, with a one-star review.  We pay $40 for movie dates to watch abysmal, dull blockbuster movies at a theater, and you give a well-written indie thriller that's a few dollars a one-star review?  You should probably reconsider viewing life with more complexity than, ""this is awful"" or ""this is amazing"".  There's a whole spectrum in-between when you're done being ridiculous and hyperbolic.",1484438400,,1695,5.135036496350365

I watch and read lots of mysteries, suspense, and thrillers, and often figure out what will happen next. Or in the case of mysteries, Ill figure out who the killer is early on. That was not the case with this movie. I kept guessing what was going to happen next, and was surprised almost every time because something else happened instead.

This movie did progress slowly, but to me it didn't matter because I was anxious to see what would happen next. I really enjoyed that the main character, Will, kept observing and questioning things that were happening. For example, one of the hosts locked the front door, and Will instantly inquired as to why. I thought this was a wonderful example how in society, just to be polite and not make waves, people will often let things go that they really should be reacting to.

After you watch this one, I would love to know what you have to think. And I don't often watch movies a second time, but I will be making an exception for this one.",1481500800,,1153,4.429245283018868

It's a completely redundant twist that cheapens the movie by moving the scope of the movie from a very personal drama to a much larger canvas.
It completely undermines the whole perceived intention of the movie.
What a shame, still, up to that point I liked it a lot, even though you clearly sense from the beginning that Will's suspicion is completely justified and not merely paranoia.
This also changed the movie for me as it wasn't so much a riddle of where it was going to go, but more when the bomb was going to burst.
Sorry, but the two hosts and their two person entourage were just way too creepy to have the story move in a different direction.
They should have played it more subtle, leave out the entourage, well, any number of things they could have done.

Unfolding over one dark evening in the Hollywood Hills, this film blurs layers of mounting paranoia, mystery, and horror until both Will-and the audience-are unsure what threats are real or imagined.

THINGS THAT WORK  Sound, meaning that music is used when needed but the movie also knows when it should be silent. The angles and shots chosen for the film are very good. The right emotions is given by the actors, you can feel the emotion depicted by the characters like creepy, awkward, and crazy. The emotion is also captured very well by how the camera focuses on a character that is speaking while moving around the room. You truly feel the intensity in the scenes which is also thanks to that lack of music in certain scenes.

THINGS THAT DONT WORK  it is a slow burn movie, so some might find it hard to appreciate. Opening credits feel out of place. Even though the actors give an amazing performance some secondary characters at times don't land their lines and it doesnt feel real. Since the film is pretty much 98 percent in the house and the character you follow used to live there, you would think you would feel the layout of the house but sadly at some points you feel a little lost. The third act is awesome but sadly the last 2 to 3 minutes could have been better. It could be the fact that since the third act was so good that the ending couldn't compete.

SCORE  considering how very few things don't work this film is a Solid 9 out of 10, all of the things that I found wrong could have been forgiven if it wasn't for those last minutes of the film. Again you might love the ending but it didn't work for my friends and me.  I still highly recommend you check this film out",1475625600,,2203,4.599489795918367

The writer did an unbelievably fantastic job of weaving together the challenge of coping with grief and the disorientation of being confronted with cult-like behavior (the kind that turns familiar faces into masks for strangers) to make something sincerely disturbing.
You experience the fear and discomfort the protagonist is dealing with almost viscerally through a combination of excellent performances and spot-on directing. It's like a nightmare that you keep waiting for him to wake up from, as the surrounding events become ever more spooky and out of control and we approach the climax you knew was coming (though you fool yourself into thinking it might be avoided).",1474156800,,759,5.229508196721311

Besides the overused and drawn out opening scenes often found in cheap movies of a car driving on a long stretch of road was the pointless early scene of hitting a coyote most likely meant as allegory for the story's denouement.  Acting was as robotic as it gets, but part of the blame belongs
to the script and set which was basically contained within a few rooms of a house. The dialogue was boringly predictable laden with obscenities spiced with alcohol and with no purpose other than to give emotional impact to a pervasively dull plot. A plot centered about a stereotypic party reunion of acquaintances past and present gathered to meet, duh - the predictable messy ending. So tedious and lacking in creative intelligence was this rehash I found relief in frequent use of ff.",1473465600,3,865,4.65359477124183

7666570,3,B01BSW1NW2,"Possible spoilers.  This mysterious film by director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight, Aeon Flux) is a good example of how a technically well-constructed and produced story can be offset by actions that most of us find unbelievable.  The movie opens with Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) driving up one of those dark roads to a dinner party in the Hollywood Hills.  Suddenly Will strikes a coyote running across the road.  Still alive, Will does the humane but brutal act of putting the animal out of its misery.  The lengthy scene must have a purpose wouldnt you think?

That aside, Will and Kira are heading to Wills old house where his former wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband David (Michiel Huisman) want to reunite with Will and a host of their former best friends.  Most haven't seen each other for 2 years, primarily the result of a tragic event that separated Will and Eden.  We experience the party, including an extravagant table setting with no one around who prepared or placed it as near as I could determine, through Wills eyes.  The guests are also wowed by the fact that David is serving bottles of a 1985 Chateau Lafite Rothschild which goes for about $500 a bottle.

But Will senses something is amiss, especially after David shows a video he made where some philosophical goofball has assembled a group of people to watch one of their friends  a cancer sufferer  to die a peaceful death.  Now at this point Im out the door, aren't you, even if the doors are locked with keys from the inside?  Who does that?  But after various stages of displeasure, they all decide to get on with the evening.  Then the gathering is joined by 2 of David and Edens houseguests.  First there is Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) who we first meet, naked from the waist down, standing in a doorway making goo-goo eyes at Will.  Then there is a somewhat older Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch) who pops in.  Uh..huh.

Only Will seems to think it is all very odd and he does a good job confronting the events, only to be chastised or counselled otherwise.  Did I mention that this part of metro L. A. has spotty cellular service?  Anyway, once you get past the stupidity of the events and the resultant reaction of what seems to be otherwise smart people, the movies does get fun.  The last 30 minutes are tension filled and rewarding.  It just took an unreasonably bumpy road to get there.",1472169600,4,2418,4.66193853427896

7666583,5,B01BSW1NW2,"How did this thriller escape notice for so long?

This is how a twist ending is done  as chilling as it is perfect, reads the cover blurb from Entertainment Weekly. Theyre right.

Will (Logan Marshall-Green, Devil) and his partner Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi, Miles Ahead) receive an invitation to a dinner party hosted by Wills ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard, Into the Woods) and new husband David (Michiel Huisman, Game of Thrones). Its to be a gathering of old friends and perhaps a chance to make peace with the past. Will and Eden divorced after the accidental death of their young son, and he has never gotten over it.

But who could? Well, Eden apparently. And thats as unsettling as revisiting his former  home in the Hollywood Hills and seeing people hes avoided in the past two years. As the party gets underway, Eden and David share the reason for their newfound serenity  a video about a new spiritual faith. The content is disturbing, but the guests are willing to shrug it off and keep rolling. Everyone except Will who rejects its message of the inevitability of death and its no-fear philosophy. As the evening goes on with its excellent wine and party games, Wills anxiety grows. So does ours. Were with this guy  theres something just not right going on. And were pretty sure its going to blow up in our face.

The Invitaton plays like a classic Twilight Zone episode, a series that also explored issues of the day. There are no movie-villains here, director Karyn Kusama (Jennifers Body) writes in the enclosed booklet. She repeats as much in the commentary she shares with writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, who have worked with her for years. These likable guests are all people we know  or could know. Some are incredibly damaged, messed-up people who do extremely destructive things, she continues.

The evil bits might come from maintaining societal conventions, author-editor Britt Hayes of ScreenCrush writes in his analysis. Conflict develops from the frustration people feel when others don't act or believe things the way we think they should. And when folks try to force those beliefs on others. Most of us will never face the human excrement who killed people in Nice or Orlando, or those who shot grammar school and university kids, thank God.

All we have to worry about is neighbors, co-workers, friends and family.

Digitally shot, Drafthouses 1080p picture looks great with rich color and good detail. Kusama and cinematographer Bobby Shore employ masterful visual tricks to enhance the story. Will and Kira drive up into the hills against a cool blue night, and scenes outside the house remain in the starker palette. The homes interior glows with inviting golds and reds that transform into a smoky hell as events transpire. Spacious rooms become claustrophobic, almost cell-like. The final scene blends both palettes to create a shocking, disturbing finale. Audio from an immersive 5.1 soundtrack also highlights keynotes with a score by Theodore Shapiro, well delivered dialogue and sharp effects.

Disc extras are good including the commentary and a making-of feature with cast and creator interviews. Just don't spoil anything for yourself by viewing ahead of the film. Also find two music videos.

We never expected anything this good from the creative team that brought us Aeon Flux (2005). Thats the power of independent filmmaking.
A slow burn can outdo action shock even when its expected. The cast is loaded with great character actors including John Carroll Lynch of Fargo, Zodiac, Shutter Island and Gran Torino. On TV hes made an impact as Twisty the Clown in American Horror Story and Eastman in The Walking Dead. Michelle Krusiec (Hawaii Five-O) and Lindsay Burdge are also standouts. Whether you catch The Invitation for its chills or its social observations, be sure to give it a look.   Kay Reynolds",1470009600,,3853,4.9875195007800315

7666588,3,B01BSW1NW2,"We sat down to view The Invitation in a second-hand rush of excitement, the kind born of having heard a lot of excited chatter about it from horror fan friends.  People said you couldn't believe what was going to happen, that it started like a normal movie and then whammo!  It took you top a place unrecognizable as human existence.  Well, that did happen to me while watching Glitter starring Mariah Carey and Terrence Howard but that was back in 2001 and I was ripe to repeat that experience.  Pauline Kael used to say that the best American movies managed just that feat, a clever combination of several genres of film so that, in say McCabe and Mrs. Miller, you were watching a Western on the one hand and a nouvelle vague film on the other (and a musical with all those dour Leonard Cohen songs thrown in).  Anyhow, The Invitation, directed by talented Karyn Kusama of Girlfight fame, was exactly what we were looking for and I was all nestled in with my popcorn expecting something really great when I noticed the name of Michael Huisman in it.

That instantly shifted the mood.  My wife really likes him, me not so much.  He was OK playing Liam when Nashville was on ABCthe Irish rock n roller who threatened to give Rayna Jaymes the Bono treatmentbut in over his head, or so I maintain, when they hired him to be the new love interest for the Khaleesi.  I cant even pronounce his name but I always recognize him on GOT when hes naked, for he has the tinest butt God ever gave to a man, what my friend Dans girlfriend referred to as ass negative.  Anyway hes just lost next to the blonde powers of the Khaleesi, not to mention all the other colorful characters in her storyline, the one whos turning to stone but still loves her, the Grey Worm, the Imp, her handmaiden whos so beautiful, her first husband Aquaman, et cetera.  Now he appears in The Invitation as a mysterious cult leader with a haggard, yet luscious alcoholic wife, who looked strangely to me like the young Judy Garland, but old.  We soon determined that the wife indeed was the young Judy Garlandat least she had played the part in the docudrama about Judy Garlandand then when she grew up she was Judy Davis.  (In Me and My Shadows, also 2001the year of Glitter: in fact.)  Well, Huisman underacts and Blanchard overacts, but otherwise than that, they seem like they're evil from the start.  If you don't get that within the first ten minutes you haven't been to Understanding Overacting School very long.

The set-up has a little bit more backstory built into it, and that may have helped the positive buzz about the movie, that its a B or C movie with A level rewards, the wasy Val Lewton in the 40s at RKO had only ten thousand dollars, no budget for special effects, so he had a bus emit compressed air and everyone jumped out of their seats thinking it was the cat woman attacking.  Basically the evil couple has invited the previous husband of the Judy Garland character, and his new, black, girlfriend, and the previous husband is wary as hell of these new advances.  So they go to the party expecting the worst and you think it is going to have some Cassavetes realness about it.  It also seems like Michael Huisman is living large, they are in some fabulous Benedict Canyon like section of LA in a designer home living the lifestyle of the rich and famous.  Logan Marshall Smith, who actually looks so much like Michael Huisman that I may have confused them, gets drunk and belligerent right away, and rightfully so, for he feels as if his first wife left him only to marry a doppleganger of himself only one slightly more good looking and with hella more in the bank.  The spoilers which I will not reveal are of the sort that used to happen in slasher movies all the time where the minority characters get murdered firstbut here Karyn Kusama seems to be both conscious and unconscious of her narrative choices in this regard.  However, I won't say any more, only to say that by the end of the movie (which is very short, not even as long as an episode of Sherlock), one of us was applauding and raving about The Invitation, and the other of us was tapping his fingernails sharply against a formica deco coaster from the 40s, wishing that he had had the cojones to insist on watching Crossroads, with reliable Britney Spears, for the fifteenth time.",1469750400,4,4337,4.51213282247765

(An excellent example is They Look Like People)  What makes them work?  Actors who seem authentic and real, and a bit of chemistry between cast members.

I'm surprised they didn't squeeze a transvestite in there to round out the little rainbow group....Maybe that was the twist coming or the plot that was yet to unfold at the hour mark.

7666623,5,B01BSW1NW2,"This is one of those few movies that feels more like art than a movie.  For the first hour or so, it makes you feel exactly what the main character feels, uncomfortable--which is probably why it has so many mixed reviews.  I don't mean uncomfortable as in how most movies try for that with pure shock value, but uncomfortable the way that you actually feel at a party with people that you don't want to be at.  If you need likable (and in my opinion unrealistic) hero characters, this is not for you.  If not, it definitely has an effect on the viewer.  For the last 30 minutes or so after that, it is gritty, adrenaline pumping, and more importantly to me, realistic.  There are no heroes and villains spouting cliche lines and no one is creating macgyver style weapons or suddenly a martial arts fighter. They're just reacting, in a way that comes off as honest and terrifying.  I'm still not sure what I think about the very last scene, but the fact that I'm even thinking about it means something too.  Amazing jobs by all involved in this.",1466380800,,1044,4.457894736842105
7666624,3,B01BSW1NW2,"I normally love these kids of movies that leave you guessing and trying to figure out what is going on- within reason.
The end of the movie is great though I was left with some questions- but then I am nosy and want a tidy little package all tied up when I finish watching a film.

Spoilers ahead- stop if you do not want to know

Starts out these friends are invited to a dinner party. One of the guest is the ex husband (Will) of the party thrower.
We get the feeling of unease right from the start but that would be normal to go to your ex wive (Eden)  and new husbands home (your former home) for a dinner party.  Boring boring way drug out crap now..........then they finally show a video and alarms go off for some of the guest, one guest even leaving the party.  The Husband now locks all the doors to the house, which is not odd except they are double sided dead bolts meaning you need a key to unlock them even from inside the house.

The Story progresses so slowly but finally we learn the divorced couple use to have a son who was died thus all the sadness in the father (Will).  We are still not sure why all were invited and it really does not touch on why those particular people would be chosen to attend. Will is suspicious of everything and causes rifts and unease in the house which most guest seem to think is more because of his being the ex of Eden.

Logan Marshall-Green ----Played (Will the Ex Husband) you may know him from Quarry  or Madame Bovary. He has many other credits but those are the ones I know him from.

Emayatzy Corinealdi----Played (Kira Will's new love interest) she was Belle in the remake of ROOTS the tv mini-series and she also has others roles but I am not familuar with them.

Tammy Blanchard----Played (Eden The Ex Wife) I do not know her works but when I looked it up she was in Guiding light 16 years ago and has worked steady since, including Elementary Tv Series.

Michiel Huisman  ----Played (David The new Husband) you may know from  Game of Thrones (TV Series) Daario Naharis or even Orphan Black (TV Series) Cal Morrison.

I will not give away the BIG surprise which by this point you have guessed...and really the best part of the movie is the first 10 mins or so..and the last 20 mins..the rest seems to be filler and not really adding a lot to the story. They could have shortened the film or really worked the script to be more flowing and interesting in the middle. We were ready to shut it off after 30 mins but since I bought it just sure it would be a great film I wanted to push through.  DO yourself a favor- skip it or if you must rent it only..",1466294400,3,2611,4.2444444444444445

I felt that the long drawn out plot made the ""surprise"" ending not that surprising.  But considering what passes for a Thriller nowadays, I gave it a 3.5.  I cleaned my room while watching it and it did take longer since I had to be involved, but not so much, thanks to the long winded set up.",1466035200,,568,3.956140350877193

You will be engaged throughout, on the edge of your seat, and guessing until the end.  Rarely do I have almost nothing negative to say when reviewing a film, but this is one in which a negative is hard to find.  Highly recommended!

7666639,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Will and Kira are invited to a dinner party by Will's ex-wife Eden and her new husband David. It's been two years since they've seen each other, so awkwardness is expected. What is unexpected is their newfound happiness and serenity with New Age ideals about pain and death. Will suffers as he relives painful memories wandering the same house where his and Eden's son died and where Eden attempted suicide. Are Eden, David, and their odd friends simply enamored with a new way to manage their pain or are they dangerous?

The Invitation is a cult that claims to rewire the brain so grief and death are easier to process and a natural part of life that Eden, Will, and their weird friends Pruitt and Sadie. This sounds basically harmless if a bit odd. A few things lend a sinister undercurrent to the awkward gathering: the mindless happiness of its followers, the violence with which the followers react to the smallest scorn or opposition, the video of the group assisting a woman committing suicide, and the accounts of some of the members. Throughout the film, there's a strong case for either side: the cult is sinister and violent or the cult is weird but relatively harmless. The same goes for Will. At times, he's reasonable and clear headed, but sometimes he's overcome by grief and lashes out, giving his perspective that there's something wrong an irrational undercurrent. The film does a wonderful job building the suspense and keeping the viewers guessing.

I had a few problems with the film. While much of the party held unease and awkward moments, I found them to be drawn out and boring at times. In one particular scene. Pruitt shares his tragic story that involves him killing his wife by accident and everyone is pretty horrified. Clare right afterward wants to leave and Priutt accompanies her out because he's blocking her car in the driveway. No one thinks to protest or say anything after this man just admitted to committing murder and then wants to be alone with someone. The ending is only predictable because it's a horror film and wouldn't be very horrific if Will was wrong. The events are shocking even though I saw them coming plus the ending holds something even more surprising. Overall, it's an enjoyable film with unexpected moments and masterful suspense.",1465084800,,2292,4.8295165394402035

Perhaps audiences these days are content with jump scares and gore in a horror/suspense film so that they feel they are getting their money's worth.  And yet, I admit there was a little hesitancy I had watching this film since a number of reviews written on Amazon described the movie as being too slow.  Well, as soon as the credits started rolling, I had come to the conclusion that a.) Amazon reviews are not always to be trusted.  And b.) Audiences are very impatient.  This film had me wrapped around its finger after the first ten minutes.  It does an remarkable job of creating an underlying sense of tension that ratchets up higher and higher till the conclusion.  And boy, what a conclusion!  And that final scene...  The Invitation is simply one of the best movies I've seen of this year.

P.S.  If you do decide to watch this movie, and I hope you do, AVOID THE TRAILER AT ALL COSTS.

Will, the woman's ex-husband, is hesitant to return to the house he once shared with her and immediately notices that something is off with both her and her boyfriend who have invited two strangers to this otherwise reunion of old friends. As the night progresses things become stranger and Will can no longer hide his feelings. As his paranoia begins take over it becomes evident to him that something is going on behind the scenes, but it is difficult for him to convince the other quests that this is the case.

It seems the couple are eager to share the wonders of this guru/cult leader who helped the wife overcome her grief over her son. Soon the guests, particularly the ex-husband, suspect all is not right with this new agey couple and the tension quickly builds.

7666685,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Invitation""

1. The Invitation is a thriller that defies the odds. It should have been a B-movie that sunk without a trace in the midst of the year's releases. It's super low budget, having been made for about $1,000,000, and filmed in 20 days. It was written and directed by the people that gave us R.I.P.D., Ride Along, on Flux, Jennifer's Body, and the 2010 Clash of the Titans remake. Even the main plot device of the film has been used in many schlocky horror movies.

Yet the movie transcends all those limitations to become a truly tense thriller.

2. The movie focuses on Will, who has suddenly received an invitation to a dinner party from his ex-wife and her new husband after being out of touch for two years. Reluctantly, Will takes his new girlfriend Kira with him, and they head to his old house, where he meets several other friends... and a couple of strangers. Will's ex-wife, Eden, and her husband David, introduce the party to the teachings of a New Age group that they have joined - and which causes them to act very strange.

3. There's a very well-done scene where the group plays a game called ""I Want"". Pay attention to that, and compare it to what Eden and David are officially trying to get across to their guests. It's a common element in actual New Age groups.

4.  While Will is getting more and more paranoid about what's going on, the rest of the party tries to counterbalance him by being very polite and overlooking the things that are bothering Will. The movie is subtly asking us, ""Is there a limit to politeness? How much should we overlook in the world, in order to keep the peace?""

And perhaps the most important question the movie asks is ""Just because you're paranoid, does that mean you're wrong?""

5. Where I live, people celebrate the 4th of July not only by setting off fireworks, but also dynamite. The bigger the piece of dynamite, the longer the fuse you need to attach to it, so you can get safely out of the way.

Some people may find the movie kind of slow. I see it as a long fuse. By the time you finally figure out whether Will is mentally unstable or really onto something, it's too late. Everything explodes. And it explodes loudly.

6. This is partly a ghost story. But not a spooky supernatural one. These are real ghosts, the ones that get deep into your soul and haunt you forever. These ghosts are worse than anything that might float through your house and play your piano.

7. We learn early on that there is some traumatic history between Will and Eden, which was at least partly to blame for their divorce. But the movie just drops pieces of that backstory slowly into the increasingly strange evening in which Will finds himself.

Will and Eden each struggle with the loss they suffered. But they struggle in different ways. Will hangs on tightly to the ghost, afraid that letting go would be an insult to the memory of what happened. Eden goes the entirely opposite direction. By joining a New Age movement, Eden feels she has successfully moved on from her painful past. But in the process, she may have betrayed herself.

8. In some cultures, especially in Asia, the color red is used to symbolize a celebration, a reunion. This is commonly done as a display of a red lantern. Pay attention to how the color red is used in the film - both inside and outside the house. There is more than one way to raise a red lantern. There is also more than one type of reunion.

9. Ultimately, the dinner party is a metaphor. The movie is about how people handle the worst traumas of life. Some go deep inside themselves, and hold the pain close. Others run from the pain, even if it means running from themselves. These are both desperate, but understandable, ways to handle the situation. The dichotomy between Will and Eden illustrates one of the most fundamental of life's problems. It is up to you to decide if one of them had the better solution.",1461542400,16,3940,4.507713884992987

My expectations were sky-high after reading festival reviews in 2015 and let me tell you, the feature did not disappoint.

Will and his new girlfriend Kira shows up to his ex-wife Eden and her new husband David' dinner party, high up in the Hollywood hills. But a tragic past haunts what should have been a joyous evening and Eden and David's strange behavior and some mysterious house guests only adds to the ever escalating sense of tension. Is Will becoming unhinged or is something more ominous afoot.

I'm not a fan of director Karyn Kusama previous efforts but d##n she absolutely knocks it out the park with this taut pressure cooker of a film.
The less you know going in the better, trust me.
The director' approach is brilliant as is the acting and the structure of the story (the climax is just a natural conclusion, chaotic as it may be)

Now, this movie won't win any awards, but the actors do a great job with the script and the director does a wonderful job making sure the atmosphere stays tense, putting you on the edge of your seat several times. Without giving away too much of the movie, let's just say that the rest of the folks should have left when actress Trish Gates went to her car (I can't remember the actress's name in the film).

I enjoyed seeing actor John Lynch, who played in The Walking Dead, and actress Emayatzy Corinealdi, who is definitely an under-rated actor. And actor Logan Marshall-Green, who plays Will in this movie and starred in Prometheus, certainly isn't hard to look at :)

Some people might find the ending a bit corny and out of place with the rest of the film. I can understand that since I felt the same way a bit. But then I thought about the premise - how dealing with grief can make use do crazy things. How, when unbearable events take place in our lives, we seek an explanation or a way out of the hurt and pain. Sometimes the way out isn't one at all (characters Gina and David). And sometimes people manage to find strength within themselves that they didn't know existed (characters Will & Kira). So - I think the ending wants us to realize that there are a lot of people going through things in their lives and you never know where or who they are.

Eden was in Mexico being part of a cult that helped her get over her grief knowing she will be with her loves ones in the afterlife. Will suffers from the loss of his child and has bad memories.

Will suspects something is going on, but everyone else doesn't see it. As the audience we find the explanations acceptable, and Will maybe has issues...or not.

7666745,4,B01BSW1NW2,This movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending was disturbing but it tied things together well.  I wouldn't recommend watching this at home alone because that's what I did and BIG MISTAKE! as far as thrillers go this one definitely fits the genre to a T.  If you're a horror lover check this out for sure! Very realistic! that's what makes it so scary!,1460246400,8,370,4.3478260869565215

7666748,4,B01BSW1NW2,"A man and his girlfriend are invited to a dinner party by his ex-wife and her new husband after she disappeared following the death of their son. Also invited are mutual friends from the exes past. As the night goes on, things start out innocent enough, but the man starts to suspect that something is not right about his ex-wife and the new man in her life. It isn't long before he feels himself start to unravel and question whats going on around him.

This slow-burn horror/thriller is the latest indie film to really keep my attention. Following the ranks of The Witch, The Invitation takes on a different disguise in making you feel uneasy about what you are seeing. While it certainly isn't as disturbing, it definitely makes you question yourself as much as the lead is. The group of characters is quite large, when this happened, I found myself thinking that some of the characters may end up being underdeveloped. I was definitely wrong. Each character is very well-developed enough to where you get a strong sense of who they are. And besides the obvious ones, all of the invited guests are likable, which I was also surprised about. I will say that there were certain characters I did want more of, but thats only because I liked them that much.

For a moment this hardly feels like a horror/thriller, it seems like an innocent get together amongst old friends, but then the rug is just pulled out from underneath you and things suddenly change. Im not saying its super suspenseful, but it is very much on the edge of your seat where you are so engaged and you have no idea how this will all escalate. As I said above, you are also questioning your own sanity as to what you think is real. This is because the film is shown through the point of view of our lead and it perfectly captures how hes viewing things and we can see why hes viewing it at that, but we get thrown curveballs that can leave us out in the dark. Its very rare that I see a film that keeps me as engrossed or questioning whats going on, and this is definitely one of those films.

As for the cast, each cast members does very well with their parts, but most especially our lead male Logan Marshall-Green as Will. For the reasons stated above, he does a tremendous job as a man questioning not only everyone at the party, but also himself. There are moments of amazing subtlety in his performance and moments where he freaks out and comes off as very realistic, and its really easy to feel for him and put yourself in his shoes and just get on his level. Also worth noting is Tammy Blanchard as Wills ex-wife Enid. Shes another one who does a great job of using subtlety in her performance. Theres just so much in her performance and how she carries herself throughout the movie that makes you question whether shes trustworthy, or if she is as innocent as she appears. And of course there is John Carroll Lynch who does a great job in his role as the creepy man who appears at the party to where you don't keep your eyes off him because he comes off as that sketchy.

The Invitation is a solid horror/thriller that keeps you engrossed all the way through with the likable set of characters, a story that keeps you guessing, the escalation of suspense, and just the self-questioning throughout until the intense climax.

7666749,5,B01BSW1NW2,"In a wasteland of superheroes, lowest common denominator comedies, and 50 shades of crap, people forget that special effects, A-list actors, and hyperactive stimulation are nothing more than excessive factors.

Logan Marshall-Green as Will, the protagonist, artfully conveys a palpable sense of dread and suspicion. Is it all in his head? The Invitation startlingly does what a majority of psychological thrillers unsuccessfully try to do: keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering how and when the pressure cooker will explode. The screenwriters worked wonders getting us to identify with Will while simultaneously second guessing him. Creative camerawork and audio manipulation add to the intrigue. Wonderful actors. Talent displayed in every aspect of the production.
When John Carroll Lynch shows up to a party, get worried.

Wow. This is filmmaking distilled to its vital essence.",1460246400,19,888,5.522058823529412
7666750,4,B01BSW1NW2,"Word of Mouth Film - Great amount of suspense -- and if you appreciate smart, logical characters, this film does a pretty good job with it.

7666751,5,B01BSW1NW2,"It is important to go into this film with as little advance knowledge as possible. All you need to know is that the film focuses on a grieving and paranoid man, whom after recently losing his young son in a tragic accident, attends a dinner party at the posh Hollywood home of his ex-wife. As the night progresses, the guy begins to suspect that things are not as they seem. As the film moves along slowly but methodically and with an atmosphere of unbearable suspense, you're not entirely sure that this story will go in the direction you are suspecting. Whether it does or does not, you'll have to discover for yourself, but I can assure you that most viewers will not see what ultimately transpires coming. I sure didn't. This is one of those movies that you want to set up about 20 private screenings of, and then sit back and enjoy watching others experiencing this movie. From the Director of ""Girl Fight,"" ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Jennifer's Body"", comes a very engrossing, heartbreaking and horrifying movie that deserves cult status.",1460160000,6,1034,4.718232044198895

7666753,5,B01BSW1NW2,"Holy Smokes. I will first state that this movie is Insane in the most
positive way possible and that it is a true Marvel to watch. I will start with the story which is about a man and his girlfriend who get invited to a dinner party at his ex's house with her new man along with a group of other friends after 2 years. The story then starts to unfold that something isn't quite kosher. The pace was scary good with some of the best pacing I have ever witnessed in cinema history. I will move onto the acting which is Absolutely Stunning with both ""Logan
Marshall-Green"" and GOT's actor ""Michiel Huisman"" stealing the show.
They both deserve awards for their performances. The entire cast did
Amazing but those two stole the entire movie. I will now continue with
the action and drama section. Wow this is where it truly comes to
fruition that this is a contender for the best movie of 2016. I mean
the atmosphere and the tension that builds towards what is in my
opinion the most Awesome culmination to a film I have seen in the past
decade. I will finish with the Cinematography which was Impeccable with
every scene building up something sinister and not quite right with the
whole entourage that is gathered for the dinner party. I will close
with saying that this movie is a Masterpiece and it kept me on the edge
of my seat the entire time. OMG the ending was Epic and of course no
spoilers. My hat comes off to Karyn Kusama who directed such a
transfixing film.",1460160000,13,1467,4.397058823529412

8751242,2,B01BSW1NW2,"The only positives I found was the acting was fairly decent with several recognizable faces. And I liked the house! I watched it with someone else so I didn't have to pay for it, either!! It started off with a coyote being hit by a car & the main character mercy killing the animal. Doesn't seem to tie in to the movie at all. Then it s-l-o-w-l-y progresses along with a creepy video the party-goers watch. Everyone was uncomfortable but only 1 person left. They played a game like ""I Never"" but it's ""I Wish"" and there's a steamy kiss or two. And how does it tie in? Everyone's uncomfortable again but no one leaves. The host locked them all in & there're bars on the window; the main character thinks everything is dicey & was going to leave but then decides to stay. Oh, really? I don't think I dozed off but what the heck was going on there? No cell reception although they're on a hill & looking across a city with other houses dotting the hillside? Did they forget that the main character had received a very clear cell call just minutes before arriving from a guest at the party? Little ""mysterious"" things were tossed in before the party turns into a massacre. The main character is having visions & not all are relevant to the story line. He gets on the host's computer & watches a video that was supposed to give clues to what was going on, I guess. Was the massacre supposed to be a sacrifice for the couple who was throwing the party? Was it supposed to bring the son back? And the woman they met in Mexico who obviously had a mental problem--why was she even there? There were so many unanswered questions but the biggest one of all was the ending. What the heck?? A red lantern had been lit on the patio & then the main guy & his girlfriend are standing there & you hear police sirens & helicopters. There are red lanterns all over the hillside. I was hoping someone would give a spoiler alert so I could figure out what the ending was supposed to mean. So 1 hour & 40 minutes later, I still don't have a clue what the movie was about.",1525996800,,2049,4.297157622739018
