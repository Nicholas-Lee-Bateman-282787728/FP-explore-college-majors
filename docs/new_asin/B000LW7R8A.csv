2715068,1,B000LW7R8A,There is nothing sexy about this film at all ! Most straight to video releases a have a brick house babe ! Or lots of sex or nudity this is a waste of time. At least if the quality of the movies are going to be B it could offer something ! The people in this movie are all 50 years old ! I don't know what the director was thinking ! At least if you can't come up with a original idea you could bring some appeal to it ! Horrible movie a complete waste of time! I wanted all my time spent refunded !,1129766400,,499,3.7169811320754715
