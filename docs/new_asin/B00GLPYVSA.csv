8624302,2,B00GLPYVSA,"Main thing I wanted to get out here is the awful playback setup.  We have all the Max & Ruby DVDs and this is the first one that plays the intro and ending credits, PLUS Nickelodeon marker screen, PLUS Treehouse video marker screen before and after each ""short"" segment.  On all previous DVDs you would just get the credits before/after each complete 3 ""shorts"" that make up a traditional episode.  It's very irritateing going through the all the credits between each 7 minute (or however long they are) segment.  I don't know if they did this to inflate the running time on the back of the box?  Or what the reasoning may be.

I would actually recommend buying the complete Season 5 for streaming/download either here on Amazon or on ITunes.  You get ALL the episodes on this disc plus a ton more.  I believe it's 26 episodes (3 shorts each) for 78 shorts in all.  Great value, wish I hadn't bought this DVD.

Other than this playback issue, more of the same as past Max/Ruby DVDs.",1399852800,,982,4.497175141242938
8624303,5,B00GLPYVSA,A great collection of new Max and Ruby episodes. All three of my children loved this Max and Ruby dvd.,1398211200,2,102,4.15
8624304,2,B00GLPYVSA,"This collection includes  ""Max & Ruby's Groundhog Day"", ""Ruby's First Robin of Spring"", ""Grandma's Geraniums"", ""Max's Ducky Day"", ""Ruby's Earth Day Checklist"", ""Ruby's Earth Day Party"", ""Ruby Gets the Picture"", ""Ruby's Birdie"", ""Max Plays Catch"", ""Max's Nightlight"", ""Ruby's Bird Walk"" and ""Max Goes Fishing"", 12 spring-themed episodes from the show's fifth and most recent season (2011-2013).

My daughter and I are fairly new to ""Max and Ruby"", and the surface-level complaints I have about these characters and stories aren't anything new: they're repetitive, very basic, Ruby is bossy and annoying and, of course, these two little rabbits apparently live by themselves.  Yet the show's relatively quiet, peaceful nature is still enjoyable in small doses, even though I couldn't imagine watching these more than two or three times.

Unfortunately, the video quality on this DVD is horrible.  Max and Ruby switched to 16x9 widescreen for its fifth season but, since this is the first I've watched it on disc, it's hard to know if they ALL look this bad.  There's lots of jagged edges and aliasing on the characters themselves, which results in poor image detail that makes the animation look much worse than it ought to.  While it's good that Nickelodeon didn't crop this material to full screen (like they do on many other releases), it looked bad on three different setups (old tube TV, newer HDTV and a laptop) so you'll probably see the same problems if you're looking.  No bonus features either.

The show itself is pretty middle-of-the-road...and while a better DVD presentation might have tipped the scales in its favor, this is almost unwatchable in its present form.  I've seen and enjoyed plenty of good-looking DVDs and Blu-rays (animation, live action, and everything in between), but this is most certainly not one of them.  Fans of the show may want to rent it, but it's worth passing over completely for the poor visuals, in my opinion.
