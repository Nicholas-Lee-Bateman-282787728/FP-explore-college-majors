419679,3,630203793X,This is an interesting movie about a bank robber who hijacked a plane and jumped out with a parachute to be pursued by the law but never found. BTW: There really was a bank robber who called himself D.B. Cooper and he did jump out of a plane but this movie is fantasy and is the directors take on what might have happened but shouldn't be taken as actual fact but as a fantasty theory. It was an interesting movie with a good cast which I believe included Robert Duvall and Treat Williams and is worth a rental.,1076112000,3,511,4.224489795918367

419725,4,630203793X,"The other reviews cover the plot, so I won't rehash that.  What I love about the film are the performances and some of the exchanges between characters in the movie.  Yes, Williams and Duvall trade (and have some apart) some great one liners, but the ones I remember (and love) the most are the ones with Harrold and Williams (H to W:  ""I know.  You milked a cow and answered trivia questions for cash...Is this all the $ you made in the last 6 months?!?!?  You printed these, you bastard!""), Paul Gleason and various other characters (G to man (apparently) selling a car:  ""You know what my middle name is???-FLEXIBLE.  Name your price."", to which the man says:  ""Seven hundred dollars."", to which Gleason then responds:  ""You're abusing my flexibility mister."", and my favorite (Gleason-stuck in a trunk-to Duvall, after Duvall wants to know which way Williams and Harrold went):  ""Let me ask you something, Sacagawea...What kind of view do you think I got in here?!?!"".  There are many more too.

It's fun watching Williams have fun with the character too.  This movie is largely forgotten, but it's something you won't find in movies anymore-FUN.  You don't need CGI and big budgets for movies.  One only need go back to 1981 and watch this caper-road movie riff on the D.B. Cooper legend.

Sure wish they would put it on DVD in Region 1.",1400371200,,1342,4.695278969957082
419726,1,630203793X,"Horrible transfer of the film and what appears to be a television version of the film, highly edited, commercial breaks (fading in and out), and all curse words censored.  Once you get past the foreign language menus and play the film, it is Full Screen, very dark, and fuzzy in image.  Decided a used VHS was WAY better, at least it's not censored and chopped.",1398988800,,361,4.538461538461538

419755,3,630203793X,"This movie was okay, I was kind of hoping for a bit more truth to it.  There was one scene where my hubby and I looked at each other with a 'what the heck' look.  Parts of it seemed a bit like Smokey and the Bandit.  A lot of extra characters and car chases.  Was pretty disappointed.",1247443200,,284,3.9298245614035086
419756,4,630203793X,"This is a good action film. Lots of fun. I was the Location Manager on this picture and we made two moves while filming. WE shot about half the film in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and the other half in Tucson, AZ. Believe it or not, when Treat William jumps out of the plane, he actually lands on Mt. Lemmon here in Tucson. I had lots of fun working on it and I think it turned out really good. If you like older, action films with lots of humor, you will like the film. Something to look for...The rapids were in Jackson and when they went over the falls, that was actually done...with doubles, of course. Also, we rented the Baseball Padres 727-100 and I had to get permission from the FAA to open the back so he could jump out. You will have fun with this film and I recommend it highly.",1225584000,7,784,4.1644736842105265
419757,3,630203793X,"The subject of this work is the infamous D. B. Cooper, who highjacked a jet over Washington state in 1971 by utilizing a bogus bomb, collected $200,000 from the airline company, and then parachuted toward ostensible oblivion, evading one of the most extensive massings of law enforcement personnel in United States history.  The production, burdened with serious problems from its outset, with directors John Frankenheimer and Buzz Kulik being replaced in turn by Roger Spottiswoode, is marked by obvious reshooting as continuity is at times seemingly abandoned.  Nonetheless, although flaws abound and logic is sparse, the film succeeds as entertainment, and since the fate of Cooper may ever remain unknown, recounting his story from whole cloth is suitable, with this version fashioned from American poet J. D. Reed's debut novel, ""Free Fall"".  As action opens, Cooper (Treat Williams) is preparing to leap to hoped-for safety into forested Washington (played by Oregon), and he is seen as he eludes state troopers by hiding his bagged stash of 20 dollar bills inside of a freshly slain buck (Cooper jumped with, among his supplies, a collapsible rifle within his pack, and it is deer hunting season).  Apparently, the only man capable of tracking the fugitive is Bill Gruen (Robert Duvall), the victim airlines' insurance company investigator and coincidentally the former Army Ranger instructor of Cooper, whose actual name is Jim Meade, and soon Gruen has trailed Meade to his home where he has joined his wife Hannah (Kathryn Harrold).  Jim and Hannah head for Mexico, with Gruen close behind, as is one Remson (Paul Gleason), another former ranger mate of Meade, with an agenda of his own, and subsequent events are stuffed with outrageous incident including a dangerous raft pursuit through Wyoming's Snake River rapids.  As is no novelty, Duvall gathers in the acting laurels here with his nuanced reading as a persistent insurance company investigator.  Because of its false starts, the film has too much dross to be effectively tidied up by Spottiswoode, but scoring by James Horner is consistently interesting, a musical blend featuring battling banjos, along with jew's harps, dobros, and other instruments of folkish characteristics that highlight British grounded whirligig dances.  The D. B. Cooper highjacking is an incomplete story because there is no certainty as to his fate, and a variety of tales may be invented as a result; this one, in spite of its weaknesses, may be enjoyed on its own terms as it provides solid entertainment and a correctly ambiguous ending.",1116288000,14,2587,5.216867469879518
