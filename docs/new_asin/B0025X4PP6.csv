3849680,4,B0025X4PP6,"My 4 year old grandson, who has autism, really likes this video. He has limited verbal skills but still sings the songs and has learned alot from the educational segments. The singers are not professionals and the singing doesn't appeal to me as much as the Baby Genius videos but then again I didn't buy this DVD for me and like I said, my grandson is captivated by it. My one criticism is that when they are singing about the triangle and showing a sail boat with a three sided sail that the number 4 is showing on the sail. It would have been better to make it a 3 or have no number at all; just a teacher's observation for educational value. All in all a pretty good DVD, I would have bought others if they had more with educational content. My grandson needs as much input as possible in the form that most appeals to him.",1335571200,2,827,4.2405063291139244

8351257,5,B0025X4PP6,"Lots of enjoyment for mom and kids , sing ,dance, interact completely to the dvd.  I recommend this to all moms who want their kids to learn as they grow and this would also help when they start school. Your child will know all the songs they sing at school, because they had a jump start with this dvd.",1400284800,,303,4.135593220338983
8351258,5,B0025X4PP6,terrible singing.  You'll love the songs and your child will learn the concepts but...you'll have to hire a music teacher to correct all of the sloppy singing your child will learn from this dvd.,1388188800,,195,4.735294117647059
8351259,1,B0025X4PP6,"The music and singing quality is awful (the kids singing aren't anywhere near on-key; it makes me cringe!). The songs are stupid and sound like a six-year-old wrote them. They reuse shots in a bunch of the songs. My almost-two-year-old watches it for longer than most tv, though. She's learned to say ""baby boost"" though, thanks to the near constant branding between every couple of songs. I'm just glad it doesn't last longer!",1380412800,,427,4.863013698630137
8351260,3,B0025X4PP6,My toddlers love this dvd. I even find myself singing some of the songs throughout the day. The one thing I don't like is the interruptions between songs. I assume it's a compilation of all the baby boost song videos but in between songs they make you watch the baby boost entrance logo which is very annoying. When I first watched it I thought 'it's already over?!' but then realized it did it throughout the whole dvd. It's just something you have to get used to but whoever made this dvd should have deleted those.,1378857600,,517,4.4526315789473685
8351261,5,B0025X4PP6,my grandson has been watching these videos since  he was 2 months old  and he absolutely loves these  videos.he would watch them all day if they let him.we bought a large collection of the baby boost videos.,1357862400,,207,4.54054054054054
8351262,1,B0025X4PP6,"The disc's title says ""Sing-a-long Baby Boost"" but it does not have subtitles or words displayed on screen. That makes it very difficult for the teachers of parents who want to sing along to encourage the kids to sing.

The songs are not interesting. The accompanying music is very poor. It sounds like something played by a beginner.

In short, this DVD is not worth it compared to others of the same genre, i.e.  VeggieTales Live! Sing Yourself Silly",1347321600,,452,4.69620253164557
