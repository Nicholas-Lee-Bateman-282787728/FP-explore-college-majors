AQ:TOS has a look, Because there aren't any stars this film has a MORE real feel.
 Okay the lead actor does have a slight resemblance to Harrison Ford, But that's not a bad thing.
The music throughout is really good and perfectly suited for each scene.
The villain has a Angus Scrimm/Boris Karloff look that works very well.
  Actually filmed in AFRICA by Mark Atkins, We believe his first time directing, Although he is Theasylum Director Of Photography to go to.

It seems you're reviewing a major blockbuster. It's an Asylum film for C....t's sake. I've watched a few of those, they're not good but they don't pretend to be either; and I must say that this is probably the best one of the lot.
Don't try to watch it thinking it is an Indiana Jones rip off or an Allan Quatermain film but watch it thinking it is an Asylum film and you might be surprised with what they did with the limited budget and the limited time.
The plot has major faults (of course), there's no Temple of Skulls but to me it makes a lot more sense than the Sherlock Holmes film by the Asylum with the dinosaurs.

I did enjoy it. Its a very modest adaptation and does contain a few twists on the original concept that I, surprisingly, didn't mind. Its budget is certainly modest.

The best thing about this film is the color. Allen Quartermain looses his limp as fast as his british accent. He shows no special talents no great shooting ability no great knowledge of african flora & fauna. If your looking for a more modern Quartermain that has a american accent get the hallmark version starring patrick swayze he does a better job acting fighting cancer than any one acting in this film healthy. I guess the only other Allen Quartermain movies other than King Solomons mines are ""Allen Quartermain and the lost city of gold"" Richard Chamberlin{british speaking actor} & "" The league of extraordinary Gentlemen"" Sean Connery {scottish speaking actor-close enough}, both worth getting.

In the genre of the great white hunter/explorer looking for mines that contain some fabled treasure/Indy films, and wannabees this is so low in the pile that you would have to take a coal mine elevator to get to it.  So glad that I caught it on Showtime.  I cannot imagine paying anything for this garbage.  The only treasure in the movie was when the credits started to roll and you knew that nothing else was going to happen - not that anything had previously happened.

3144166,2,B0015D20GI,"Picked this up in a five-buck Echo Bridge 6-movie pack at K-Mart that also had some TV versions of Robinson Crusoe and mummy movies. Never laughed so hard in my life. Highly recommended for connoisseurs of bad cinema.

All those who give this movie a negative review should watch those abysmal big-budget studio Allan Quartermain movies in which Richard Chamberlain plays H. Rider Haggard's main character as a guy who wants to bed all of his male co-stars, in which Sharon Stone wears far too many clothes, and in which James Earl Jones plays an African tribal chieftain with such obvious embarrassment you can practically see the tears in his eyes and hear him thinking to himself, ""Remember, Jim, this is paying for that vacation house in Old Saybrook, Conn.""

And really, all that money invested in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" still didn't make it make a damn lick of sense, and made me feel like George Lucas screwed me. ""Star Wars made me very rich and very fat. Thanks. Here, I dressed up some of my feces as Indiana Jones for you to look at for two hours.""

At least this one doesn't pretend to be anything other than crap, and on that level, it's a helluva lot more enjoyable than ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""

Stuff you gotta love:

-- The swarm of millions of somethings that are as big as birds, buzz like bees but looks like a pixellated screensaver, which causes the entire cast to cower under a rock but which poses no threat or danger whatsoever.

-- The leading lady says she twisted her ankle and couldn't possibly walk on it, and in the very next scene is hiking up a mountain.

-- The leading lady's makeup is heavier than that lady's in your town who drives the pink Mary Kay car. Honestly, she looks like she's auditioning for a role as a Tammy Faye drag queen.

-- They reach the fabled King Solomon's Mines by walking in a general direction up a dirt road. And when they get there, they just stand around and do nothing.

-- Earthquake! For no reason!

-- The two white guys who are found being held captive by an African tribe, but then proceed to do absolutely nothing for the rest of the movie.

-- Everything collapses! For no reason!

-- The big fight between Allan Quartermain and the villain that looks like an improvised b-slap match between the Burger King and Abe Vigoda.

-- Finally, there is no Temple of Skulls. It's never sought. It's never reached. It's never mentioned.

3144168,1,B0015D20GI,"They had only 9 days to film this and not much money and it shows.  Bad script, bad acting, bad direction, bad camera work, bad lighting, bad sound and bad special effects.  The lead actor is a minor South African star but can't bring it off.  Watching the DVD becomes more of a game of spotting anything they did right: the girl who plays Quatermain's servant is strikingly beautiful and regal,  they added in some minor background effects approaching the ""Temple of Skulls"" which were OK, they had some period authentic African natives go topless.

3144181,1,B0015D20GI,"""Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls"" is slow in all respects.  It is has the feel of a historical documentary.  The finale is a bit of an anti-climax and lacks a big-budget punch.

However, the scenery is filmed on or near the locations mentioned in the H. Rider Haggard book.  The tribesmen (if that is not an offensive term) are real South Africans who live in a village that caters to tourists.  The spoken non-English language is apparently genuine and not some Hollywood mumbo-jumbo.  The ""Making of"" and other features, while short, almost make this a two-star movie.

Viewed from a ""we-have-two-weeks-to-make-a-movie"" perspective, the movie works.  However, the budget and time limitations reduce the movie to a one-star movie.  So much potential was not realized.",1279756800,2,778,5.111111111111111
3144182,1,B0015D20GI,"I don't generally give poor reviews but let me say this one is horrible in every way. Horrible acting, horrible follow through on characters, horrible segues between scenes and on and on.

There is a lot of walking. They don't drive when they can, they walk. They jump off a train- to walk. They don't run after the bad man who has kidnapped the pretty girl- they walk. They are even walking when the cave is falling down on them and they may day.

The music is good and it swells when it should, indicates danger when it should, and shows a nice light happy feeling at the end. Unfortunately, dramatic, swelling, suspenseful music will not make for a suspenseful moment if the characters don't act suitably scared, brave and yet with trepidation.

This movie left a lot to be desired. Do not fall for it. The cover looks great, it sounds exciting and yet it is not.",1270944000,6,866,4.468354430379747
3144183,1,B0015D20GI,"""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls"" is incredibly boring. Period. The characters walk and talk a lot, but there is hardly any ""action."" And those actions, not many in number, are amateurish, slow-paced and sloppily edited. And they look very cheap. Allan Quatermain is such a dull hero and it is almost painful to see the guy threatened by the bugs and a rhino.

The story goes like this. In South Africa, a rich aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis (Daniel Bonjour) and his sister Lady Anna (Natalie Stone) are looking for their missing brother. They enlist an adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Cameron Michael) to reach The Temple of Skulls, using a map torn in half. A native Umbopa (Wittly Jourdan) accompanies them. (Unlike the original novel and other film adaptations Umbopa is a woman here.)

If you are looking for something thrilling and exciting, like the action-paced tale of Indiana Jones or compelling adventure story of H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines,"" please watch something else. Those who love the story of H. Rider Haggard will enjoy old British film made in 1937. The 1950 American production starring Deborah Kerr is also good. Even the ""comedic"" take of the story, the 1985 version starring Sharon Stone looks ten times better than ""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls.""

""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls"" is a loose adaptation of H. Rider Haggard classic novel ""King Solomon's Mines."" But as the ""Skull"" title suggests, this film (produced by The Asylum) is actually a low-budget direct-to-DVD production that capitalizes the blockbuster ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" If you are interested in such titles as ""Transmorphers"" and ""The Da Vinci Treasure,"" this is your film.

The only good thing about the film is the beautiful locations. (According to the film's end credits, it was shot in South Africa.)",1252195200,5,1875,5.038709677419355
3144184,1,B0015D20GI,"I tried to watch this, really I did. There didn't seem to be much acting going on, seemed like they were reading their lines off of cue cards held just off screen and the action was the most boring, predicable and slow action of any movie ever filmed. There was at least one spot where two of the actors mouths move, but no sound comes out. What really got me was the native village. The movie up until the native village had a vintage feel but then you see the villagers wearing obviously modern neon-colored miniskirts (neon pink, green and orange) and plastic neon colored beads. Dancing around half dressed for no reason on the planet except to say: Here be native villagers. I finally had to turn it off, I just couldn't watch anymore. And I watch a lot of the lousy garbage movies on the SciFi channel because they are so bad they are funny. This one doesn't even have that tiny bit of redemption. This movie is too bad to even be funny.",1229126400,2,943,4.363636363636363
3144185,1,B0015D20GI,"spoilers alert.
This movie is horrid. Where to begin? The direction was like what a film school student rushed to complete a project might have done. Seems like everyone that had an idea threw it into the mix.  First let's throw 'temple of skulls' in the title before Indiana Jones comes out. Treasure map - yes! Wrap some strings around Allan's wrist like Johnny Depp.  Oh and a cool Indy hat!  Make Allan brusque.  Yes, women love to be treated to rudeness they fall in love with that!

The budget won't let us hire good actors. Okay let's get this over-acting humongous-toothed guy to snarl at every little thing!  Perfect!  He is really scarey.  Train chase scene!  Cool, and then they jump off the train and the bad guy still chases the train but can't figure out to drive back when he sees the train is empty.  Yes, too easy to spot people on the open plains so move on to the next scene and hope no one noticed.  Our hero needs to have a sad back story to explain why he has no woman (currently). Also to explain the lack of interest in his lovely maid.  But wait! She is not just a lovely maid!

Hey! someone was watching a horror film that had a swarm of bugs, let's make our hero and his friends fear for their lives because of a swarm of bugs that flies overhead with not a single bug landing on any of them.  Because they were behind a rock and bugs just zoomed by.  Because bugs are scarey.  Because bugs won't look behind the rock. Because bugs fly by. Oh and the bad guy was able to disappear and be safe allofasudden too but not by hanging out behind the same rock, we don't know where in the plains he disappeared to. But our actors get really scared because of the bugs flying by. Let's move to the next scene and hope no one noticed.

Oh yeah, insert here that the girl has to twist her ankle so Allan can use his superior diagnostic ability in medical matters and tell her she twisted the ankle.  Then the girl won't limp the rest of the way because that would be annoying and too predictable.  She should walk like nothing happened.

Then they are captured!  Then there is the bad guy again!  Then the maid has a surprise and helps them! Then they are inside a cave and the ground breaks apart for no reason!  Scarey stuff! Then the girl is captured by bad guy!  Then he shoots her!  Yes!  Then Allan is suddenly in love with the girl - don't worry, the girl is just fine and doesn't even have a headache.  Then everything is fine and they all force themselves to smile big at the end (oh the painfully long big forced smiles scene). The end.  Um, what temple of skulls?  Who said there was a temple of skulls?  That's just the name, we are not confined as artists to make a movie that is about a temple of skulls just because that is the title of the movie. If you looked for a temple then that is where you went wrong. Allan had a map to the King Solomon mines.",1228780800,14,2884,4.219378427787934

(the whole cast should all look for different careers) The effects are so old school, I have seen better done by kindergarden kids. Even the movies title (The Temple of Skulls) is beyond me. It has nothing to do with Skulls at all. I think they just wanted to cash in on the lastest Indiana Jones movie. my advise to it's director. (like he says on the extras.

Had this been a drama, maybe this would have worked, but as an adventure it needed to be much lighter.  Think Indiana Jones or the Mummy.  Allan Quartermain was completely unlikable.  In fact, I was kind of hoping someone might just punch his overbrearing lights out.  Sir Henry was as obnoxious as possible and Lady Anna was...Well, Lady Anna must have been in the movie for a reason.  The fact that I can't figure out what that reason is does not change the fact that she must have been in it for a reason.  The bad guy, with what appeared to be a new set of false teeth acted menacing enough, but my question is why didn't Quartermain use one of his thousand or so chances to take care of him do it?

3378663,2,B0015D20GI,"Picked this up in a five-buck Echo Bridge 6-movie pack at K-Mart that also had some TV versions of Robinson Crusoe and mummy movies. Never laughed so hard in my life. Highly recommended for connoisseurs of bad cinema.

All those who give this movie a negative review should watch those abysmal big-budget studio Allan Quartermain movies in which Richard Chamberlain plays H. Rider Haggard's main character as a guy who wants to bed all of his male co-stars, in which Sharon Stone wears far too many clothes, and in which James Earl Jones plays an African tribal chieftain with such obvious embarrassment you can practically see the tears in his eyes and hear him thinking to himself, ""Remember, Jim, this is paying for that vacation house in Old Saybrook, Conn.""

And really, all that money invested in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" still didn't make it make a damn lick of sense, and made me feel like George Lucas screwed me. ""Star Wars made me very rich and very fat. Thanks. Here, I dressed up some of my feces as Indiana Jones for you to look at for two hours.""

At least this one doesn't pretend to be anything other than crap, and on that level, it's a helluva lot more enjoyable than ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""

Stuff you gotta love:

-- The swarm of millions of somethings that are as big as birds, buzz like bees but looks like a pixellated screensaver, which causes the entire cast to cower under a rock but which poses no threat or danger whatsoever.

-- The leading lady says she twisted her ankle and couldn't possibly walk on it, and in the very next scene is hiking up a mountain.

-- The leading lady's makeup is heavier than that lady's in your town who drives the pink Mary Kay car. Honestly, she looks like she's auditioning for a role as a Tammy Faye drag queen.

-- They reach the fabled King Solomon's Mines by walking in a general direction up a dirt road. And when they get there, they just stand around and do nothing.

-- Earthquake! For no reason!

-- The two white guys who are found being held captive by an African tribe, but then proceed to do absolutely nothing for the rest of the movie.

-- Everything collapses! For no reason!

-- The big fight between Allan Quartermain and the villain that looks like an improvised b-slap match between the Burger King and Abe Vigoda.

-- Finally, there is no Temple of Skulls. It's never sought. It's never reached. It's never mentioned.

However, the scenery is filmed on or near the locations mentioned in the H. Rider Haggard book.  The tribesmen (if that is not an offensive term) are real South Africans who live in a village that caters to tourists.  The spoken non-English language is apparently genuine and not some Hollywood mumbo-jumbo.  The ""Making of"" and other features, while short, almost make this a two-star movie.

Viewed from a ""we-have-two-weeks-to-make-a-movie"" perspective, the movie works.  However, the budget and time limitations reduce the movie to a one-star movie.  So much potential was not realized.",1279756800,2,778,5.111111111111111
3378679,1,B0015D20GI,"I don't generally give poor reviews but let me say this one is horrible in every way. Horrible acting, horrible follow through on characters, horrible segues between scenes and on and on.

There is a lot of walking. They don't drive when they can, they walk. They jump off a train- to walk. They don't run after the bad man who has kidnapped the pretty girl- they walk. They are even walking when the cave is falling down on them and they may day.

The music is good and it swells when it should, indicates danger when it should, and shows a nice light happy feeling at the end. Unfortunately, dramatic, swelling, suspenseful music will not make for a suspenseful moment if the characters don't act suitably scared, brave and yet with trepidation.

This movie left a lot to be desired. Do not fall for it. The cover looks great, it sounds exciting and yet it is not.",1270944000,6,866,4.468354430379747
3378680,1,B0015D20GI,"""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls"" is incredibly boring. Period. The characters walk and talk a lot, but there is hardly any ""action."" And those actions, not many in number, are amateurish, slow-paced and sloppily edited. And they look very cheap. Allan Quatermain is such a dull hero and it is almost painful to see the guy threatened by the bugs and a rhino.

The story goes like this. In South Africa, a rich aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis (Daniel Bonjour) and his sister Lady Anna (Natalie Stone) are looking for their missing brother. They enlist an adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Cameron Michael) to reach The Temple of Skulls, using a map torn in half. A native Umbopa (Wittly Jourdan) accompanies them. (Unlike the original novel and other film adaptations Umbopa is a woman here.)

If you are looking for something thrilling and exciting, like the action-paced tale of Indiana Jones or compelling adventure story of H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines,"" please watch something else. Those who love the story of H. Rider Haggard will enjoy old British film made in 1937. The 1950 American production starring Deborah Kerr is also good. Even the ""comedic"" take of the story, the 1985 version starring Sharon Stone looks ten times better than ""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls.""

""Allan Quatermain and The Temple of Skulls"" is a loose adaptation of H. Rider Haggard classic novel ""King Solomon's Mines."" But as the ""Skull"" title suggests, this film (produced by The Asylum) is actually a low-budget direct-to-DVD production that capitalizes the blockbuster ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" If you are interested in such titles as ""Transmorphers"" and ""The Da Vinci Treasure,"" this is your film.

The only good thing about the film is the beautiful locations. (According to the film's end credits, it was shot in South Africa.)",1252195200,5,1875,5.038709677419355

There was at least one spot where two of the actors mouths move, but no sound comes out. What really got me was the native village. The movie up until the native village had a vintage feel but then you see the villagers wearing obviously modern neon-colored miniskirts (neon pink, green and orange) and plastic neon colored beads. Dancing around half dressed for no reason on the planet except to say: Here be native villagers. I finally had to turn it off, I just couldn't watch anymore.

3378682,1,B0015D20GI,"spoilers alert.
This movie is horrid. Where to begin? The direction was like what a film school student rushed to complete a project might have done. Seems like everyone that had an idea threw it into the mix.  First let's throw 'temple of skulls' in the title before Indiana Jones comes out. Treasure map - yes! Wrap some strings around Allan's wrist like Johnny Depp.  Oh and a cool Indy hat!  Make Allan brusque.  Yes, women love to be treated to rudeness they fall in love with that!

The budget won't let us hire good actors. Okay let's get this over-acting humongous-toothed guy to snarl at every little thing!  Perfect!  He is really scarey.  Train chase scene!  Cool, and then they jump off the train and the bad guy still chases the train but can't figure out to drive back when he sees the train is empty.  Yes, too easy to spot people on the open plains so move on to the next scene and hope no one noticed.  Our hero needs to have a sad back story to explain why he has no woman (currently). Also to explain the lack of interest in his lovely maid.  But wait! She is not just a lovely maid!

Hey! someone was watching a horror film that had a swarm of bugs, let's make our hero and his friends fear for their lives because of a swarm of bugs that flies overhead with not a single bug landing on any of them.  Because they were behind a rock and bugs just zoomed by.  Because bugs are scarey.  Because bugs won't look behind the rock. Because bugs fly by. Oh and the bad guy was able to disappear and be safe allofasudden too but not by hanging out behind the same rock, we don't know where in the plains he disappeared to. But our actors get really scared because of the bugs flying by. Let's move to the next scene and hope no one noticed.

Oh yeah, insert here that the girl has to twist her ankle so Allan can use his superior diagnostic ability in medical matters and tell her she twisted the ankle.  Then the girl won't limp the rest of the way because that would be annoying and too predictable.  She should walk like nothing happened.

Then they are captured!  Then there is the bad guy again!  Then the maid has a surprise and helps them! Then they are inside a cave and the ground breaks apart for no reason!  Scarey stuff! Then the girl is captured by bad guy!  Then he shoots her!  Yes!  Then Allan is suddenly in love with the girl - don't worry, the girl is just fine and doesn't even have a headache.  Then everything is fine and they all force themselves to smile big at the end (oh the painfully long big forced smiles scene). The end.  Um, what temple of skulls?  Who said there was a temple of skulls?  That's just the name, we are not confined as artists to make a movie that is about a temple of skulls just because that is the title of the movie. If you looked for a temple then that is where you went wrong. Allan had a map to the King Solomon mines.",1228780800,14,2884,4.219378427787934

Sir Henry was as obnoxious as possible and Lady Anna was...Well, Lady Anna must have been in the movie for a reason.  The fact that I can't figure out what that reason is does not change the fact that she must have been in it for a reason.
