2884077,4,B000SAGGLY,"A young Tibetan filmmaker from New York in India to produce a documentary on the Tibetan political prisoners remarks on her feelings of displacement in a foreign land that she seems to be ""dreaming Lhasa.""  Karma's imaginary capital city is to this film what the film was to its makers - an object of intense interest just beyond reach.

Wife/husband production team Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam have been making documentary films for more than a decade, with perhaps the idea of a feature film always out there on the edge of their ambition.  For untested directors using an untested Indian/Tibetan crew with non-professional actors, they've reaped a remarkable return on their investment in a dream.

The story itself is quite simple, about an exile Tibetan in Dharamsala to make a documentary on the Tibetan diaspora.  Karma becomes involved in the quest of one of her subjects, a former political prisoner who has come from Tibet to deliver a sacred object to a man about whom he knows nothing but a name.  Together Karma and Dhondup criss-cross northern India chasing clues to the whereabouts of the mysterious Loga.  Along the way the viewer is treated to glimpses of life in exile, from the young kids wasting hours in clubs and pool halls, to the more determined seekers of justice involved in hunger strikes and political organizing, to the average person just trying to make a living.

For anyone who has traveled the Himalayas or had intimate contact with exile Tibetan communities, the film has a beautiful ring of verisimilitude.  This probably has as much to do with the production crew having been raised in such communities and being able to get the details right as it does to the directorial decision to shoot in documentary style, with no redubbing.

For a bunch of amateurs, the quality of the acting is high, though hardly of the award-winning variety.  More than once Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso's performance as Karma evoked a wince, but her earnestness created a reserve of sympathy that couldn't be completely undone.  By far the best performance is Jampa Kalsang's staid and world-weary exile, Dhondup, whose quest leads to an anguishing discovery.

If you're tired of Hollywood movies, tired of pretentious North American indie films, you'll be delighted by the sincerity of this little film with a big heart from the Land of Snows.

2884078,5,B000SAGGLY,"i really enjoyed this film and to think that only one professional actor was used is amazing-the lead actress isn't even an actress-she's a banker of all things-the film illuminated a real issue-the situation of Tibetan refugees- and it did so in a non-preachy way-it was in the context of a mystery/romance/semi documentary which did not come across as the usual patronizing view of Buddhists as nice little pacifists(they aren't)-the Chinese weren't demonized as people -just the communist regime,which is really evil and always has been-this film was definitely a ""watch again"" effort that is well worth purchasing",1192838400,10,617,5.3061224489795915

8205038,3,B000SAGGLY,"Nice to see Dharamsala, and a good portrayal of Tibetan life in exile. But the main character's acting was terrible, the story was poorly written, and there was very little time for the only genuine part of the movie - the clips of real Tibetans telling their story of imprisonment in China.",1428019200,,291,4.615384615384615

Go into watching it with no expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised.",1307145600,2,357,4.682539682539683
8205041,5,B000SAGGLY,Dreaming Lhasa started in such a way that I wasn't sure if it was a documentary or a film about the making of a documentary....but it rapidly turned into the adventure that gentle friends make into exploring a mystery of the past.  I felt that I can better understand what can happen to a culture where political unrest creates chaos and dislocation.  The clash of Tibetan and western/Asian values was interesting. The everyday spiritual consciousness of the Tibetans was lovely to see.  It's a DVD to own because you'll want to watch it again and again.,1231718400,4,554,4.75
8205042,5,B000SAGGLY,"This cinema realistically portrays the plight of first and second generation Tibetan refugees.  It shows them as real people who want to preserve their Tibetan cultural and religious heritage in lands to which they have been driven by foreign conquerors.  The elderly who have the most profound understanding of of traditional Tibetan civilization are beginning to die off.  The young wonder how they are to preserve Tibetan language amid alien cultures.  Most Tibetans want to return to Tibet; to do so risks imprisonment, torture, and death. This movie shows the struggle, suffering, and hope in which Tibetans live.  It is profoundly moving.",1219190400,6,644,5.2745098039215685

In ""Dreaming Lhasa,"" a young American filmmaker goes to India to make a documentary on the Tibetan monks who have been living in exile in that country ever since the Chinese invaded their nation and overthrew the Dalai Lama nearly sixty years ago.  A Tibetan native herself, Kharma temporarily puts her film on hold so that she can help one of the refugees in the area locate the whereabouts of another monk who disappeared during a protest rally in 1987.

Though ""Dreaming Lhasa"" feels only half-formed at times in terms of storytelling and characterization, the unhurried, contemplative rhythm of the film nicely captures the flavor of the setting and the nature of the theme.  While Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso occasionally lacks projection and confidence as an actress (though at times she is very good), Jampa Kalsang, the actor playing the monk, centers the movie with his quiet stoicism and gravity.

This heartrending subject could probably do with a more passionate treatment, but the quiet serenity of ""Dreaming Lhasa"" is not without its special rewards as well.",1208304000,12,1073,5.073863636363637
