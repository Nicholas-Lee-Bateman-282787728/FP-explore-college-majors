The husband's reaction finally confined him to a mental institution and do them part for 10 years. When released, Eddie,  decides to go on with his former life with his wife, who is re-married and  has raised three children.  The moving part of the story is the fact that  both spouses, despite the horror and pain, cannot let go that tremendous  feeling that had joined them once.  Their attitude towards each other is  almost naive but it has to do with what love is. Beautiful story about  love, passion and hope.",917308800,,610,4.742857142857143
924475,5,6304798458,"This 1997 film features a dream cast, and they are all strong. Sean Penn and his then-wife, along with Travolta and the late James Gandolfini (who went on to star in The Sopranos a few years later) all contribute their bits to the max as a love triangle gone bad. Penn gives a tour-de-force as a crazy alcoholic who is probably not acting as much as he seems to be. The script is smart. This was an art house film in its day, and it holds up well. It's almost noire in its bleak landscape and seemingly hopeless lives. It could have been done by Jim Jarmusch. The only thing missing is a soundtrack by Tom Waits. Watch and discover something great.",1407369600,,648,4.319672131147541
924476,3,6304798458,"According to Amazon's own description, ""This film springs from a long-neglected script by the late John Cassavetes."" (It was directed by his son Nick.) There was a reason for that neglect. This movie is basically a draft of a screenplay that the actors were asked to fill in (probably with some improvisation). I do not fault the acting; it was superb overall. Penn, Wright, and Travolta definitely command your attention though with the closeups, they're hard to miss. I do question the logic of making the film. Who was the intended audience for this movie? Certainly not a mainstream audience; apparently Cassavetes was going for the art house crowd. I suffered through several of Daddy John's -- he was almost always worth seeing in any acting role -- directorial ventures in the 70s, notably ""Husbands."" Those who wince at the lesser Robert Altman films know the deal. A meandering plot punctuated with poignant scenes of self-destruction involving unlikable characters.

I guess this is kind of another in the same genre as ""True Romance."" People you'd cross the street to avoid coming through terrific turmoil and/or violence to end up together in a final scene that begs the question, ""What chance in hell do these people have of making it together and why should I care?"" The instability of Eddie and Maureen (the couple at the center of the film) is ironically made clear by the fact that Harry Dean Stanton, who usually plays quite unreliable (though intriguing) types, is the sanest guy in the room.

In conclusion, study this movie for its acting; avoid it for its story. It's a movie that halfway through, you have to make the decision whether it's worth the rest of your time. I guess it is, but in a rubbernecking way.",1373846400,,1734,4.835016835016835

924483,5,6304798458,This film is a powerful phenomenological case study.  I watched it when it first came out and years later I am still affected.  It stays with you.  The only other films that have lingered on in my psyche in this way are Breaking the Waves and Leaving Las Vegas.  She's So Lovely captures a heart-breaking relational dynamic that is extremely difficult to articulate accurately.  A beautiful film; it is unlike any other.,1299196800,,420,4.777777777777778

12/10: Noticing the amount of secondhand smoke going on throughout She's So Ugly, it's safe to surmise that everybody involved had lost ten years of their lives doing the film. I hadn't seen acting this so unbelievably bad from a cast that contained two major stars, and I don't even think that Robin Wright Penn has been so comparatively bad as other films I've seen involving a female lead with the notable exceptions of Julianne Moore, Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, etc. On the whole, the entirety of She's So Ugly cast has been straight F turkey. It was hard to sit through the movie because I was literally watching a train wreck, and it was also difficult to keep my eyes on the screen. That was so painfully bad that I had to keep noticing that nasty, hideous bump on Harry Dean Stanton's forehead. He and Debi Mazar have to consider retirement from acting because they plain stunk. As for Sean Penn, can there be the most overrated actor alive? She's So Ugly marked the umpteenth time that he broke down crying and feeling sorry for himself in a film. How many times had this been done before? And how many times must this phoniness continue? I am tired of him. Then, there is John Travolta; at the point of him showing up, I had hoped that he would alleviate the pain of the film for me. But nope, he started to stunk it up with the obnoxiousness of his behavior. Speaking of illegal behavior, I couldn't believe that Robin Wright Penn's character was poisoning her fetus with alcohol, smoking, and assumed drug use. Then, I get insulted in the meanwhile that the daughter turned out to be fine. Uh uh...never happens in real life. That was supposed to be a child with a full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Now, honestly...why would anyone, especially somebody with money, to pick up a woman from the gutters who is all beaten up, drugged up, and totally out of it in her mind? That never happens either. Of Sean Penn's character, after ten years in the institution, that's how much he changed? Yeah right...we need more realism here. Some critics have said that this movie is funny. Hm, I don't see it. Finally, I decided that I've had enough and declared She's So Ugly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Without a question, She's So Ugly is beyond bad.",1291334400,2,2297,4.575242718446602
924565,5,6304798458,"This movie is great. The last script John Cassavettes wrote, then Directed by his son Nick after his fathers death.

After reading multiple viewer revues I finally understand why people some people don't like this film. The ending is just too disturbing because it has an anti-Hollywood climax that does not finish with an obvious hero riding to save the day.

Reminds me of classic film noir where the characters are human rather than ""right and moral"" or ""bad and evil"".

Please watch, if your a fan of great acting, calssic independent cinema or film noir you'll enjoy this fine film.

924568,4,6304798458,"There are enough reviews here to give a synopsis of this movie that I don't feel a need to give one. I'll just review the movie.

The acting was really pulled off quite well. I laughed a little, I smiled some, I yelled at the screen quite a bit. The characters were well defined from meeting them instantly. Before the 10 years later, I was crossing my fingers hoping Mo's character would treat him right, so after the 10 year moment, I was a bit angry. Which is good, because that means the movie did its job and sucked me into it's world.

The ending however left me in a bit of shock. The last important line at the end took my breath away, as in that everyone understood Mo and still loved her.

I don't think this movie would stand up to multiple ""just me"" viewings, but I wouldn't mind watching it again with someone else just to get their take on it.

It's definately something that makes you pause. You don't have to agree with the characters choices because the film doesn't try to say the actions are right or wrong, it just shows you what happens and allows you to decide for yourself. It also makes you think a bit (me as a female anyway) on what I would've done.

The ending was appropriate to the movie. I didn't personally agree with the ending, but it didn't take away from the quality of the film because, as I said, it was appropriate.

There is some amazing acting in here. If you like films slightly dark in tone, it's definately worth watching.",1194825600,,1465,4.328467153284672
924569,4,6304798458,"This movie is hopelessly out of step with the times - evoking one of the 60's European cinema's themes of questioning the bourgeoisie lifestyle. It's a fascinating, irrational celebration of passion, even if these feelings have destructive consequences and involve unquestionably insane, violent, socially dysfunctional behavior. Taking an unflinching look at urban bar-flies who live in a hotel worthy for crack addicts, the subversive film is emotionally messy, ambivalent in its social values,  theatrical but gritty, deeply romantic but totally debauched.
The three main characters are repellent, but not nauseating, because they have such flair, are darkly funny and display touching humanity. The actors playing them (Robin Wright Penn, Sean Penn and John Travolta) go not for realism or the usual Hollywood character arc, but for what they see as artistic ""truth"" in any given scene. Whatever. Oops, I mean, all three are outstanding.
Robin Wright Penn is, at the beginning, pregnant and smokes and drinks, looks like she shoots up heroin, and constantly trips over her high heels all over the sidewalk. It seems to be raining all the time, too. She walks and talks like a street hooker in the old Times Square. Even with all this, she, to me, truly is so lovely and heartbreakingly tragic, beautiful and not quite right in the head and bad news.
This film has that oh-so hip mid-90's indy Miramax flavor. (Put it along something experimental like Leaving Las Vegas from a couple of years before and it's not really that weird.) As you can read anywhere else, this script is by the late, some say great, American film rebel  John Cassavetes (hence the theme mentioned above and the ever-present raw feelings) and was directed by his son, Nick. There's a strong sense of mise-en-scene, and for such a wacky story, it's well-paced, lean and taut, and Cheese Doodles leave an orange stain on your fingers. But I digress. I must have been channelling Eddie Quinn, Mr. Penn's character.
Check out Penn's acting genius in this cheerfully deranged flick. Like several of his verbal riffs: he speculates on his wife's clairvoyant abilities and goes off on, ""Can you type 170 words a minute? Can you sew? Can you dance? What can you do?"" and his rather elaborate drink order a little while later before he goes on about seven women controlling the world at their computers. This stuff has to be seen and heard to be believed.
In fact, by watching the DVD's extra feature, An Actor's Look at Cassavetes, a sit-down with the Penns and Mr. Travolta, this movie could be seen, to a certain extent, as the Penns' acting workshop - like, say Hurly Burly. An opportunity within the confines of the Hollywood structure to exercise acting chops for all involved, including the guy from the Sopranos, James Gandolfini, as the alcoholic rapist neighbor, as well as Harry Dean Stanton and Gena Rowlands.  In the discussion, Robin finishes Sean's spoken ideas and I instantly comprehend their palpable chemistry on screen.
John Travolta, back in the day, is at the top of his game in the movie's second half as the maybe-gangster guy who snatched the lady out of the gutter. He has that Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty-era cool, magic charm going on here, both witty and goofy.  Watch for these fun, showy hand gestures he does.
The music on the sound track is suitably bizarre enough. There's a big band standard-sounding opening by the most idiosyncratic Bjork and slightly mesmerizing, creepy songs by Grace Jones.
I could extend this essay, but I've covered my main points. If you want to know the plot, watch the movie or read some other review.",1134777600,2,3628,4.923202614379085

This movie is rich in it's uniqness and characters. It's story of love gone completely blind..so blind that any thing goes. Even though none of us would take our emotions as far as the characters in this movie did,,its fun to imagine,, ""what if"".

924571,2,6304798458,"I wathed this movie i TV just recently, who cares about the swearing being taken out and what not. The movie had very good acting one of the main reasons why i kept watching it although i can't stand seeing Sean Pen drama movies. I found his rehabilitation beliveable although he acted like same-old in a couple parts.

My major gripe with the movie as with many of the movies i've watched late night, is that the ending left me thinking, ""WTF? why did i watch this?"" because the movie made utterly no sense, i mean no completely stable woman in their right mind would do this because its probably the most selfish thing they could have done. She must've been a little off as well, maybe thats why they made a great couple. Plus the fact that the husband (john travolta) seems to be the only normal person in that whole part of the movie, and the sense i got from the other people involved, sean pen and the wife (i forget her name) seem to think that the husbands reactions are strange. MAKES NO FREAKING SENSE!

i swear if i see another well acted movie that ends like crap, I will lose faith in the movie making industry. Maybe this is why i never really heard of any good movies in the 90's (besides popular ones), cause all their endings sucked.",1105315200,2,1250,4.360515021459228

924573,3,6304798458,"All I knew about this movie before seeing it was that it had three decently big stars, and a title that suggests a romantic comedy.  I suppose deep down someone with a particular way of looking at things might interpret this as a comedy, and there are certainly romantic feelings expressed by the characters.  But only armed with what I had, this is a movie that turns the world upside down almost from the start.
This is the story of mostly people of very low intelligence.  They live in the part of town where their smarts allow them to live, basically skid row.  Just about all of the action takes place in incredibly depressing apartments, or the local bar.
Robin Wright Penn is the first of the main characters we meet.  She has barely the smarts to breathe on a regular basis.  She has learned she is pregnant, yet smokes and drinks like everyone else who she associates with.  While her husband is an institution, she has an evening of drinking with a very unlikable James Gandalfini, who beats her when she won't put out to end the romantic get-together.
Enter hubby, played by Sean Penn. This character has an even lower IQ than his Mrs. Penn, and is further crippled by being violently insane.  A very ugly incident happens that sends Mr. Penn back to an institution for a very long time.
Now my thoughts while watching this film is that this character is not far from the real Sean Penn.  The real Penn has acts of violence in his life, and certainly has done dumb enough things to make you wonder if there's a brain in his head (i.e., marring Madonna, and inspecting for weapons in Iraq).  So I may be one of those people look at this as a comedy of sorts if I pretend that Mr. Penn is not acting.
Like I said, the beginning of the movie is startling in the portrayal of how some people live.  The final act begins in a way that is also somewhat startling, in the way you see Mrs. Penn.  You see, she has found John Travolta to marry, and has had kids with them while Mr. Penn has been in the pen for what he considers to be only three months even when he's released.
But then it just fizzles out.  REALLY fizzles out.  Now Penn should never have been released period, but hey, they do release people a lot worse.  And the meeting of everybody involved is probably inevitable, but would not have occurred in real life.  They all get together, where Mrs. Penn needs to decide who she's gonna continue with.  The evidently stable guy who pulled her out of squalor and raised a family with her, or Sean Penn.  We never get to really know the Travolta character, and the way the final scenes are handled are more like slapstick comedy than the world the movie started in.  I just wish they could have come up with an ending the befit the first two thirds of the movie.",1048636800,4,2776,4.376218323586745
924574,1,6304798458,"I must admit that I am stunned by the amount of positive feedback there has been to this film.  It was not in the least bit entertaining, and was quite possibly one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen.
The acting was not bad, but the script was terrible.  The characters are uniformly unsympathetic, which left me totally ambivalent towards their unfalteringly stupid choices.  This film follows the basic theme of ""you can take a girl out of the slum, but you cannot take the slum out of the girl.""  Unlike other similarly themed films, however, this one is not funny, not romanic, not pretty, and not worth renting for a dollar.
The sets are unattractive.  The dialog is disjointed and boring.  There is, in all seriousness, not one single good thing I can think of to say about this film.
Please, if you are seriously considering purchasing this title, RENT IT FIRST.  Better to waste a little money than a lot.  I hope I have helped some of you avoid repeating my mistake.",1036281600,4,979,4.5227272727272725
924635,5,6304798458,"If you read the various reviews of this movie, you will find an amazing array of responses to it. I think this is largely a function of the horrid marketing of this movie. When my friend recmmended that I watch it, I did a once-over of its packaging and decided I wasn't interested. He insisted, and so I reluctantly agreed to watch it. Despite it's packaging, this is not a sentimental romantic comedy in the ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Look Who's Talking"" vein. If this is the sort of movie you like, you should move on and not waste your time with this.
The movie is divided into two parts. The first focuses on the troubled relationship of derelict couple Eddie and Moe (played by real-life spouses Sean and Robin Wright Penn). Penn's character is dissolute, and puts Moe in the bad position of being vulnerable to the sleazy advances of a neighbor (played well by The Sopranos' James Gandolfini). When Eddie finds out what happens as a result, he becomes steadily unhinged. His performance in a barroom scene is one of the most convincing portrayals of drunken progressive madness I have seen on film.
The second part of the film benefits mainly from the introduction of John Travolta in a role that mercifully pulls back from stretching his limited acting range. This IS the Travolta we guiltily derived pleasure from before he decided he was a mega-action flick star. What follows is a somewhat unlikely but morally and emotionally challenged dilemma for Moe (Robin Penn Wright). While viewers who tend to view life in rather black-and-white terms will be horrified by this portion of the movie, open-minded viewers will have the opportunity to analyze the various components of the ensuing relationships and positions of the players. It is troublesome and problematic and so avoids easy answers or judgements. What's great about the film, unlike other indie films that revel in their dispassion, is that it is not afraid to allow you to feel for these characters deeply, despite their many flaws. The performances are great, and the movie stands up to repeated viewings, so I highly recommend the film. Besides, it's probably your only opportunity to find out how to make a ""Siberian Mist"".",1027296000,18,2189,4.855614973262032
924636,3,6304798458,"Eddie (Sean Penn) and Maureen (Robin Wright Penn) are alcoholics who are obsessively in love with each other.  They exist in a psychotic little paradise that is buoyed by Eddie's frenetic energy and drive to please Maureen--when he is around, anyway.  He is prone to disappear for days at a time.  This part of the film is a gritty, fascinating character study.
Eddie goes to jail for ten years.  During that time, Maureen marries Joey (John Travolta), and they start a family.  Eddie is released from jail and he wants Maureen back, which sets the stage for the second half of the film.  Here it goes astray.  It was difficult for me to understand the choices that Maureen makes at the end of this film, even given the fact that she is crazy.  Such craziness seems to be at odds with the suburban lifestyle that she has maintained with apparent success for a decade.  This sets up a basic conflict that made it impossible for me to accept the last half of the film, despite excellent  performances by the entire cast.",1022976000,4,1018,4.574585635359116

Can't say that I blame him. I'm bothered by the same things when the tables are turned.  But yet and still, this is just a good film. It is bizarre and rather unexpected, but for some odd reason, that didn't seem to bother me a bit.  Robin Wright-Penn is an EXCELLENT actress, and I've never seen her acting as strong as it is in this film.  She holds it down, and I mean HOLDS IT DOWN!

Not everyone's gonna like it, though, so ladies, this is NOT a movie you want to watch with your man...trust me on this!

Perhaps we find a grain of truth within She's So  Lovely that identifies with our own lives.  Husband + wife team Sean +  Robin Wright Penn deliver sterling performances and an unmistakable  on-screen chemistry as they come to terms with their roller coaster  relationship, and their sense of belonging in a changing society. Nobody  plays the down on his luck,loveable loser quite like Penn, and Robin Wright  Penn is a revelation as his ideal companion. This is the perfect antidote  to all the high budget - low chemistry romance/dramas on the racks,  combining superb acting and great dialogue, with an engrossing and  uplifting story.",962236800,6,884,4.905405405405405
924643,1,6304798458,"Absolutely one of the all time worst movies I have ever seen (second only to Independence Day).  If you are just absolutely forced to watch this movie, then I highly suggest not eating 1-2 hours before show time.  After  watching it, I actually felt embarrased for all those involved in its  creation (honestly).  I started thinking, ""This can't be for  real.......the film editor must have had a 'beef' with the director and he  deliberately pieced the film together in the wrong order so to get back at  him......Yeah, that's gotta be it.""  You never know at anytime during  the movie just what the heck is going on (it's all over the place).  I  literally had to read the reviews to figure out what it was that I had just  painfully sat through.  Belive me when I say, ""Save your money and  save your time.  'She's So Lovely' is 'So Rotten'.""",952300800,3,845,4.533333333333333

7877242,5,6304798458,"The marketing of this film killed it's potential.  This is not a romantic comedy.  The characters in this film are complex and realistic.  Sean Penn is AMAZING in this!  My favorite part is when he is in the bar rambling about love and kissing and computers.  'There can't be any love, because there aren't any people'.  the 10 years in the future is quite jarring in how different it looks.  The math didn't add up so well where it seemed like 1970's New York and then 10 years go by and it's present day (1998 or whatever)  Robin Wright was also great in this.  I love the ending.  It's incredibly romantic in a really twisted and dysfunctional way.  The soundtrack is pretty great.  yay Bjork!!",1436572800,,697,4.488
