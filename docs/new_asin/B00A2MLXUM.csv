5379523,4,B00A2MLXUM,Not sure why everyone is knocking this movie. Great Norwegian kids movie that actually deals with a variety of ecological issues- the main character car goes electric and the town must contend with water theft. My son loves it!,1388188800,3,227,4.846153846153846
5379524,5,B00A2MLXUM,"I brought this for my grand son, and he watched it several times a day for the first week. He loves this dvd. I will buy from this seller again. I received the package fast.",1381795200,,173,3.9714285714285715
5379525,5,B00A2MLXUM,My 2 yr old loves this movies and makes me watch it every day. It grows on you. I think 18 dollars is a bit high considering you can get this movie on Netflix or red box. It's also available cheeper on amazon prime instant video,1378252800,,228,3.9782608695652173
5379526,4,B00A2MLXUM,"Cute, a very simple story.  It's dubbed but that's not really a big deal.  Dialogue is a bit ""obvious"" but no bad words or violence and has ""do good"" attitude.  A bit much on the enviro friendly angle, but not overwhelming.",1376611200,,223,4.390243902439025
5379527,5,B00A2MLXUM,"I enjoyed the animation,which was very well rendered. The story -line was well thought out. You will love it and it is for all ages.",1370822400,,132,4.32
5379528,1,B00A2MLXUM,"This is one of the most ridiculously stupid movies I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, my 3 year old son absolutely loves it, and so I am forced to watch it on a very regular basis.",1367539200,8,179,4.114285714285714
5379529,2,B00A2MLXUM,"Cute concept, but completely cheesy and not in a good way. Ridiculously overpriced, I can buy my kid a Disney movie for the same amount (or less) and have less annoying characters and better dialogue. The characters are whiny, and my kid was bored.",1360281600,,248,4.659090909090909
5379530,5,B00A2MLXUM,This movie is fun and action packed for about the 5 yr old set. Nice message about how to get along. It's got a good message,1359590400,2,124,3.8076923076923075

5379548,3,B00A2MLXUM,"I got it for my 3yo to watch. It seems good, but it is just a little older. It goes at a slower pace and seems very relaxed. We didn't get past the first half. It was just very slow and didn't catch attention. It's possibly for an older child or what I saw so far would be perfect for a child on the autism spectrum that didn't enjoy big action. I am saving it in our list for when my friend's son with Autism comes over, as I think he will very much enjoy. He likes slower and calmer things.",1465948800,,492,3.881188118811881

5379558,5,B00A2MLXUM,"Our son LOVES this movie. Its probable his favorite at this time. We had it on Netflix for awhile then it went away. We try to teach him to save and be good with money, so we did not by it right away. A month or so later I was leaving for work one morning he asked if I could make some extra money to help him save to buy this show. I told them we would see what we could do. He said ""mommy tell the babies I pray for them so they get better to go home"" (I work in the NICU). Needless to say I downloaded it that night.",1443830400,,519,3.642857142857143

5379567,4,B00A2MLXUM,"My 2 yr old son LOVES this movie and can't get enough of it. It can get a little annoying but no worse than any other toddler movie. The otter is hilarious. The mouth movement of the characters is a bit off but I think it was originally in French not English so I'm assuming the mouth movement is accurate in the french version. This is the only movie though that holds my sons attention the entire movie. The concept is unrealistic but seriously, its a kids movie not a documentary!",1391385600,4,483,4.318681318681318
