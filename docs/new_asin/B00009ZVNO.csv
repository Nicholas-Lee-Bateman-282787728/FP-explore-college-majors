1899139,4,B00009ZVNO,"This DVD contains four digitally remastered (great image quality) classic Dr. Seuss stories:
* Green Eggs and Ham: about Sam-I-Am and his never ending quest to make people sample the dish he loves best.
* The Sneetches: about a narrow-minded and prejudiced group of creatures who don't accept others who don't look exactly like them.
* The Zax: about two hardheaded and proud beings who waste a whole lifetime for not yielding the right of way.
* Grinch Night: about a courageous kid who faces the Grinch and saves his whole town from his malicious Halloween tricks and terrors. (A must see on Halloween night).
It also contains two wonderful sing-along songs: He Will Eat Them and Grinches Inches Closer.
Not only does this collection of cartoons contains the marvelous songs and poetry of Dr. Seuss, it is also a great way to teach kids about human values like open-mindedness, tolerance and acceptance, humility, courage and selflessness. They are filled with original art and are also very entertaining.
Buy this DVD for your kids and enjoy it with them. I would also recommend buying Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat and Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas.

1899140,5,B00009ZVNO,"The video version of ""Green Eggs and Ham"" is much better than the book.  It contains more details and action, which makes it fairly entertaining for little children.  However, Grinch Night is far superior and better for family viewing.
  Although Grich Night is not based on a story book like ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas,"" it demonstrates some good Dr. Seus techniques.  Here the Grinch is portrayed differently and doing magic with both his eyebrows and cart.  The story starts with things pleasent in Whooville when, suddenly, a sweet-sour wind causes things to be unpleasent and, as a result, making the situation suitable for the Grinch to come down and cause trouble with his scary features.  However, a young boy name Eukariah wanders outside and gets blown up the mountain where he walks into the Grinches route and feels he must try and prevent him from reaching Whooville.  However, in doing so, young Eukariah must face the Grinches scary magic, which is too powerful for anyone to overcome as long as the sweet-sour wind keeps blowing.
  Do not be satisfied with ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas.""  ""Grinch Night"" is a must-see and is also easier to be expanded into a movie.",1067212800,3,1189,4.865671641791045
1899141,4,B00009ZVNO,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that you are forced to watch (or fast forward through) several commercials before you get to the DVD menu. There is no way to jump directly to the menu. This is highly irritating, and Universal should be aware that it doesn't make me want to buy any more of their DVD's. However, the Dr. Seuss stories are still fabulous, of course.",1067040000,2,395,4.28
1899142,5,B00009ZVNO,"Grinch Night is the best Halloween special never ran on TV these day. It was a truly memorable expereince on those cold October nights of my childhood. And although it was released (and purchased by myslef) on VHS the grainy picture and sub-par sound really doused the viewing. But now we have it on DVD and a whole new genration of children (and adults) can enjoy this priceless treasure digitally. Thank you Universal reincarnating this masterpiece.
Oh, my only complaint about this volume; shoulda' entitled it ""Grinch Night and Other Favorites"" with the Grinch's snarling visage on the cover......",1065312000,7,601,5.08080808080808

1899195,5,B00009ZVNO,"I love an old classic cartoon/animated short every now and then. Who (no pun intended) doesn't like the Dr. Seuss series? For a change of pace from the modern-day CGI Saturday morning shows, there's this old yet quirky and classic series that manages to inspire each and every time it's viewed. In this DVD compilation, there are 4 shorts, each of varying length. There's the hilarious Zax, or the all-time classic Green Eggs and Ham. However, in my opinion, the real gem here is Grinch Night, with its eerie feel and take on Halloween. This is a sometimes forgotten Halloween classic, and is essential viewing. The special features of this DVD aren't anything special, with some sing-along songs highlighting. Overall, a worthwhile viewing experience down memory lane. 9/10",1395187200,,774,5.0546875
1899196,5,B00009ZVNO,"I remember this compilation when it appeared on TV long ago, and found Dr. Seuss' rather entertaining and even a bit intriguing as ""Grinch Night"" was meant to be a Whoville version of Halloween, while it was not particularly scary, it had a surreal air that one can actually find in some nightmares and painted the Grinch as a rather nasty creature who enjoyed his solitude and scaring the Whos.
""Green Eggs and Ham"" was funny both in rhyme and in reason as it was a lesson in trying something new.
""The Sneeches"" about birds that lived on a beach bearing a severe case of discrimination, learned a valuable lesson that the stars on their bellies really didn't confer anything special.
""The Zax"" was a lesson on stubbornness as neither Zax would move to allow the other to pass on his way.
the late Hans Conried was a wonderful narrator and was the voice of the Grinch in most of Dr. Seuss' works.",1392249600,,897,4.50920245398773

1899199,5,B00009ZVNO,My daughter loves this book.  I read it to her every night and sometimes 3x a day.  So when I saw it in movie form I thought she would love it.  Well she did.  The only down side was it wasn't very long.  But other then that it was a great buy.  It also came very well packaged.,1376265600,,278,3.706896551724138

1899213,1,B00009ZVNO,"While this DVD does have the cartoons it lists, the cover is very misleading. From the look of the cover, I thought these were newer versions of the old cartoons, but they are not. It shows the newer looking Cat in the Hat character on the front of the DVD so, of course, that is who I was expecting to see when I watched the cartoons. However, the cartoons only show the older Cat in the Hat character (the very old one). I would not recommend buying this DVD if you prefer the new Cat in the Hat because you will not see him anywhere on this DVD. This was a big disappointment and the reason why I gave this product 1 star.",1352592000,2,625,4.0894308943089435

1899217,5,B00009ZVNO,How could you not love Dr. Seuss.  Green Eggs and Ham introduces children to rhymes and the concept that what we thnk we do and don't like may not be correct. We have to try it and see.,1323820800,,185,3.8684210526315788

1899220,1,B00009ZVNO,"When it says Green eggs and ham and others, it gives you Dr. Seuss on the loose with three mini shows, including Green eggs plus Grinch Night, but it is exactly the same menu as appears on the Dr. Seuss Celebration disc that has 4 other videos, I bought both thinking there were different videos on each, never imagining that these same videos were on the other disc",1292371200,,366,4.397058823529412

1899222,4,B00009ZVNO,"This is a good DVD for even really young kids. There's no violence and a good moral lesson in each tale. My favorite is the ""The Sneetches"", a great example of how pejudice based on something silly (like a blue star on one's belly) is a terrible way to run a society.

The only thing I didn't like were all the ads and previews for other products, but I guess that's to be expected these days. I recently purchased a ""THomas the Tank Engine"" DVD that had the same problem-- at least 10 minutes of ads for toys and videos before the actual DVD began!

Overall, I think that this Dr, Seuss video is a good choice for toddlers and any kids under 12. I enjoyed watching it too-- the older stories reminded me of the Dr. Seuss books I read as a kid.",1262995200,,744,4.159722222222222
1899233,5,B00009ZVNO,The first 3 cartoons are the best.  Classic Seuss.  Grinch Night would probably scare young children.  I didn't think it was as good as the first 3.  Whatever - Seuss was a genius.,1258502400,,180,4.363636363636363
1899234,4,B00009ZVNO,"I really like the quality of the video and all the features it contains.

1899235,4,B00009ZVNO,"My kids LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie. I love that after you fast-forward through the annoying ads/previews and get to the menu, it starts automatically and then keeps restarting itself, but does NOT replay those annoying ads/previews every time; it plays JUST the movie.

However... the case is AWFUL!!! This is the THIRD time I've bought this movie because the release button in the middle is VERY hard to push, so my children end up just pulling on the movie disc and eventually it breaks. The first time I thought it was a fluke, the second time I realized it wasn't, and this third disc has been transferred into a different case to prevent it from suffering the same fate as it's predecessors.",1246838400,,697,4.666666666666667

Also included is my daughter's favorite, ""Green Eggs and Ham"", which is like seeing the book come to life. It's a great story all-around.

Yes, I have been waiting some time for this particular animated special to appear on DVD as it is definitely a ""Must-Own"". For those people like myself, who grew up watching ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" as well as the various Charlie Brown holiday specials, not to mention all those wonderful Rankin & Bass collaborations, Ginch Night will always have a place in my heart(as well now in my DVD library). Maybe not as memorable (or popular, obviously) as it's Xmas predecessor, the few times as a child that i watched Grinch Night enraptured me. It will always be required viewing around Halloween time right along with ""It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" & ""A Garfield Halloween"". I'm 32 now but will always feel like a child all over again while watching this show.

1899242,5,B00009ZVNO,"Three out of the four cartoons on this DVD run at about 10-15 minutes average length. While the fourth (Halloween Night is Grinch Night), runs at about 20-30 minutes. So all in all, you are getting around 52 minutes worth of Dr. Seuss entertainment, which really isn't all that bad.

Green Eggs and Ham- A decent cartoon but with it being based off of a book, it seems to kinda get on your nerves after a while with all of the rhythms and rhymes. But not too bad. The sound is top notch on the DVD but the color seems to be kinda bland.

The Zax- The shortest of the cartoons on the DVD, this one is pretty entertaining even though it is extremely short. The coloring and sound are great!

The Sneetches- My second favorite cartoon on the DVD. A story that has a true message to it. Sound is good and the color is pretty much intact but there are a few scenes where the color seems to have faded a little.

Halloween Night is Grinch Night- One of my all-time favorite Dr. Seuss cartoons! The creatures in the story are kinda creepy and it is very appropriate for Halloween, hence the title. This is obviously the longest cartoon since it was made for CBS back in the early seventies I believe. This one seems to be absolutely intact with sound and coloring.

Overall, while the only thing that seems to be suffering the most from these four cartoons is the fading of colors. But it's not the DVD's fault. These films were made back in the sixities and seventies and have been shown many times on television since their creation. I am surprised that their condition is not as worse as shown on the DVD.
