8401420,3,B003O5SEBK,These might be worth $20 for someone just starting their first Blu Ray collection! For everyone else rent them first to see if you like them! Because you may or may not like them to each their own!,1396483200,,197,4.2105263157894735
8401421,3,B003O5SEBK,Something is missing in those movies sometimes or as often lots of dialogue and not enough action but also not entertaining but interesting at times.  I will have to Watch them once again and make sure I made the right decision.  Get back to ya.,1386460800,,245,4.4222222222222225
8401422,1,B003O5SEBK,The movies presented are poorly done from both acting and plot.  If I could give no stars I would based on that they actually charged more than 1 dollar for this garbage.,1363564800,9,170,4.3125
8401423,1,B003O5SEBK,"Terrible collection of the worst movies I have seen. Very poor acting, special effects and direction, results in a complete waste of money and time.",1350172800,12,148,4.96
8401424,4,B003O5SEBK,"can't beat the price for ten movies that appear very clear and easy to load.
Just plain un serious fun. Well worth the money",1348617600,2,124,4.208333333333333
8401425,5,B003O5SEBK,"To be fair, all of these movies are horrible...horribly funny!  If you enjoy watching Sci-Fi's creature feature of the month type movies then this is for you.  My family loves watching any random, cheesy, badly acted, bargain basement horror/sci-fi flicks.  Our favs being ""Dead Alive"" and ""Motel Hell"".  Neither of those are in this set since they aren't Sci-Fi, but if you like either of those cult classics then this is a great collection to look into.  If you don't know those movies, please go find copies ASAP.

At $33 this was a no brainer purchase.  I've seen the price change around between that and 46ish.  Both are great deals.  Thats only $3 to $4 per blu ray!  All in a nice case to store them in.  I really don't see how you can go wrong.

I think it makes a great gift as well.  A great addition to any movie collection!",1308787200,18,835,4.4144736842105265
8401426,4,B003O5SEBK,"Let me just drop the disclaimer in here:
These movies are not well-written, the acting is poor at best, and the effects pathetically low-grade.

- BUT -

These are true B-movies, written for pure entertainment. My father-in-law just adores them, and is always thrilled to see the bravado of the tongue-in-cheek tough guy (think Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers), and the heroine with acting ability in inverse proportion to her cleavage. It's truly a riot! Rather than see another ""blockbuster"" with a budget that could have been used to end world hunger (with effects being the only saving grace), I can get the same quality of acting as Shia LeBouef and Megan Fox, without the pretense and the price of movie tickets and concessions. The only reason I stuck with 4 stars was that the acting and effects will often be groan-worthy.

Beyond the hilarity of the acting and plot, and effects that rival those from Hercules and Xena, I do have some serious positive points. The quality of the transfer is absolutely, utterly phenomenal. The sound and picture are 100% HD, completely blows most HD programming out of the water. Simply love watching it on the 47"" LCD, crisp and clear to the point that I would even compare it to Blu-Ray!!!

So, don't look here for deep and thought-provoking plots or storylines, actors who draw you in and get you to feel the character, or state-of-the-art effects. This is a collection of movies that will make you laugh, hysterically at many points. They don't draw from ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca"", more like ""Army of Darkness"". This is for group movie nights, where everyone can sit around with cheesy grins on their face, and where nobody will feel goofy for standing up and cheering when the hero finally beats the monster through sheer bluster and machismo, and gets the girl.

""Happily ever after"", indeed!",1279497600,72,1849,4.857142857142857
