8087427,5,B000BJKWPS,"THE PROBLEM IS THIS: 40+ YEARS (AND MILLIONS OF HOURS) OF MEDIA SAYING THE MOON LANDINGS WERE REAL, AND ONLY A FEW YEARS ARGUING AGAINST THEM.

So everyone coming to this film has had years of being told the official line. That's a lot to compete with and a lot to flush out of the brain.

Just imagine if the USSR (Russia) had carried out the moon landing.

Imagine the dent in US national pride. Well if Bart SIbrel had then come along and accused the USSR of faking the landing.

The US support would have been in the majority - 'of course Russia did not land on the moon' everyone would have chorused.

The problem is that most people see such an historic event, an event that has come to be seen as 'man's' greatest achievement, through political filters.

No if Russia had done it, becuase we don't WANT them to have done,

or YES if the US did it, beacuse we'd WANT that.

Looking at the evidence presented in the films, and looking at the official responses, and debunking, the case for a faked moon landing is over the 1/2 way mark - so its more likely that it was faked than real.

I suggest you watch his films for yourself, and decide for yourself, and try not to let any preconcieved ideas filter what you see.

An interesting fact: When the Soviets managed to build a system that could track rockets from the earth to the moon, the remaining 3 Apollo missions were all suddenley cancelled.",1168128000,9,1403,4.382239382239383
8087428,1,B000BJKWPS,"You know in older cartoons? When Bugs Bunny pulls a fast one on somebody? And they turn the guy's head into a giant lollipop with the word ""sucker"" written on it?  Well, that's me. I actually bought this DVD. I'm man enough. I admit it.

An hour and forty-eight minutes of raw footage. That's what this DVD is. No camera crew reflected in helmets, No wires holding up model earths. No photos or film from some secret model shop making the lunar landscape or painting backdrops with the earth on it. Not a single thing that screams out that the moon landing never happened. It's everything you've ever seen in any given ""how they got to the moon"" documentary, except just more of it- not only do you get the last few seconds where the lunar module actually touches down, but you get the full ten minutes leading up to it... that sort of thing.

If the ""smoking gun"" is that there are slates at the head of every shot, then the... um... ""director""... might want to learn a bit more about how the process of shooting on film. You see, shooting a few seconds of a slate with camera info, exposure info, and so on, is all part of the process. You have to do it. In space or not. You have to. Don't believe me? Look up the New York Film Academy. There's about fifty of them in the US alone. Take a two-week filmmaking class and you'll find out all about it.

Now, I love a good conspiracy theory. But until you've got footage of a director yelling, ""cut!"" with an astronaut taking his helmet off and a swarm of people rushing onto the set to make adjustments, or a call sheet for the cast and crew for the ""flag planting scene"", then you're wasting people's time. Including your own, mister director-man.",1146009600,13,1698,4.380952380952381
8087429,1,B000BJKWPS,"The George Jetson, ""review"" of this item clearly is not. It is yet another non-review.

Along with other Sibrel items for sale here. This has been, ""Sock Puppet"" reviewed.

A Sibrel supporter just comes along and posts a glowing piece. How clever.

Another Sibrel DVD is reviewed here, on Amazon(Astronauts gone wild). A review author admits to not having seen the movie, but gives it a five star vote!

I've not watched this particlar Sibrel orffering, so I can not pass judgement.

I do however wish to warn those that consider purchasing Sibrel products, he and his fan base are dishonest.",1139702400,15,592,4.821782178217822
8087430,5,B000BJKWPS,"This dvd contains numerous never before seens clips including special effects testing / demonstration reels that even say in the opening frame ""This is not meant for public viewing.""

These show quite clearly numerous tests on the lunar lander prop models, and of ""astronauts"" running around in circles on the moon landing set kicking up dust while the speed of the camera is slowed to produce the desired effect of low gravity.

Obviously i am not using me real name, because i am too scared to.

All i can suggest is that you view the sample clips of this dvd from [...] before you decide who you want to believe.",1139702400,8,615,4.572727272727272
8087431,1,B000BJKWPS,"On the back cover of this DVD it states, ""In Apollo 11 Monkey Business, you'll see how the crew of this mission bamboozled the world into thinking that they actually traveled to the moon.""  And a little later, it says, ""This compilation of newly discovered unedited reels will show you how the world was tricked into thinking that the moon landings wee authentic.""  Regrettably, neither of these statements is true.

After watching this DVD several times, I did not see anything that I haven't seen at least a dozen times and it is clear that all of this footage is available elsewhere.  I repeat, all of this footage is available elsewhere, and some of it is available for free from NASA websites.  These statements by the producers of this DVD are nothing but spin and sales hype.  In fact, all this unedited footage, plus eight additional hours is available from Spacecraft Films (for sale here on amazon.com) for only ONE dollar more (that's not a typo).

Instead of convincing me that the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax and the world was bamboozled, the nine snippets on this DVD convinced me without doubt that the Apollo moon missions were real.  By far, the most compelling section was Chapter 3, which shows the moon walk.  In this section, we can see that many of the so-called hoax claims are patently false.  For example, we see nearly parallel shadows cast by the astronauts and their equipment, the flag never moves unless one or both of the astronauts are touching it (in fact it stays fixed the entire time) and when one of the astronauts kicks some of the top layer of moon dust it travels nearly ten feet and never billows like it does here in Earth air.

What would have helped this production is some sort of commentary from the director/producer of this DVD after each clip describing why he feels this clip shows a hoax or how it was done in a studio or why the science and engineering is bad.  Just something to help the viewer understand how and why the Apollo 11 moon mission was a hoax would have been nice.  Or maybe he just can't do that.

In the end save your money and buy a book or another DVD because the feature does not show the crew bamboozling the world and does not contain any newly discovered unedited video or film.",1139702400,20,2253,4.530864197530864
