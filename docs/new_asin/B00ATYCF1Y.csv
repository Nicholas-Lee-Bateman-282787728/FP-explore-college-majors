The series/movies have been wonderfully restored from the ground up.  GL has a great color pallet that truly has to be seen in HD.  Audio is crisp/clear and subtitles are easy to read (movies aren't dubbed just so you know)  The box comes well packed with two massive booklets (both completely in Japanese) filled with character/mech sketches and artwork.  Now you look at the price tag and like most say how in the...can it be that expensive?  Well the box set has been meticulously put together and I'm still in shock of how much is in it and how good it looks.  The blu rays are held in to LP style holders and it includes the soundtrack, drama CDs and special features like behind the scenes, music videos, concerts and much more. The set comes in a solid case with great artwork on the front and back, and it's big!  If there's one set you must get, get this, it may go out of print down the road and then the price will be ungodly, don't wait till then.  Also side note, GL is one of the most enjoyable Anime shows ever made.  It's fast paced, fun, full of energy and has this over the top vibe that has yet to be matched.",1386201600,,1288,4.153225806451613
5510041,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"If you are looking at this collection then most likely you already know just how special and amazing this anime is so I won't bored you by reviewing the show it self.
Yes this is an expensive collection but the quality of the show on bluray is just jaw dropping. The reason there are so many bluray discs here is because they made each episode as high of quality they could get.
Within this collection you will find the complete show, the two movies which is a retelling of the show though they change some things. You are getting two drama cds in Japanese and the soundtrack two booklets again in Japanese the contents inside are drawings and sketches and episode breakdowns.
You get what you pay for and this collection is prove of that, even the box it is shipped in is specifically made so that no damage gets done the beautiful glossy finishing the collection comes in. Paying a lot of money on a collector's item should be reflected by the item itself and this bluray set is prove that it's steep price of admission is definitely worth it.

Edit: I forgot to mention this but this set does come with the English dub and subtitles as well but is only for the episodes and the two movies everything else is just in Japanese. Also this set should be compatible with all American blu ray players including ps3 systems.",1384041600,3,1320,4.477178423236515
5510042,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"So incredibly worth it.

If you think that you're not a big enough fan to dump this kind of money on a piece of art, you're wrong.

I of course am a huge fan of the show and the amount of quality that this product offers to you is incredible.
First off: You receive 4 things.
1. A Blu Ray Case the size of a Record Sleeve, opens like a book to hold 8 CD's 4 on each side. The Series, and the two movies are what's included in this set of Blu Rays. Super high quality and a glossy finish on the outside with a really awesome Gurren Lagann related print on either side of the sleeve.
2. Another Blu Ray case exactly the same as the first one with 7 CD's inside. All bonus footage included and an audio disc with all the music.

Simply beautiful these two sleeves. So simple. Just for holding Blu Rays but you can tell that they really care about this product.

3. A book that summarizes the information that's included on the CD's. Unfortunately its all in Japanese so I can't exactly read whats there to offer but it's still really amazing the work that they put into the simple details about this piece of art.
4. Another book, this one is hardback though and let me tell you. This is something that all Gurren Lagann fans would love to get their hands on. It's the art leading up to the current designs of mechas and characters with detailed notes (in Japanese). It's really something that any fan should see. The dedication to building a character to later touch that cold heart of yours and turn you into a die hard anime fan.

Basically, it's all quality here. Yes, you're paying for it and yes I was skeptical but no longer. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made in terms of Anime. Please, do yourself a favor, quit reading this review and buy it...",1383782400,4,1767,4.247023809523809
5510043,4,B00ATYCF1Y,"""Is it worth it for that price?"" is what you're asking yourself right? The answer is 1000% yes. Save up, get another job, do what you must. This set contains essentially every piece of Gurren Lagann work that was ever conceived by the staff into one gorgeous box.

Besides the blu-ray 27 episodes, it's got the 2 movies, all the parallel work music videos, extra videos, drama CDs (recordings of the characters in alternate timelines or settings, very neat), and a music CD with the music. These blu rays come in two high quality albums with new artwork on them. Aside from this there is a ""Nascent Era"" book with interviews (a book is included that translates these interviews), early artwork and ideas for the show and you really see all the influences, ideas and people that came together to create what I stand by as the greatest Animated entertainment of all time. There is also a book that encapsulates everything in the Blu-ray set, and has beautiful artwork from Imaishi and staff in it.

The episodes and movies have been re-done for Blu-ray and it shows in most parts and especially shows in others. Episodes are crisper, the colors are perfect, everything is just beautiful. I think the audio has been improved as well. I have seen the show several times before, and when seeing the Blu-ray episodes there were a few times I thought ""wow I don't think I heard that sound before."" The episodes and movies have optional english subtitles, and I only noticed one error in the subtitles during my entire viewing and I've already forgotten exactly what or where it was.

There are extras on every disc, and the movies come with commentary from voice actors and staff. This is where the set loses 1 star. None of the commentaries, or extra material aside from the 27 episodes and movies - is subtitled. I only vaguely know Japanese from sheer exposure. It honestly sort of angers me that the interviews and commentary weren't subtitled. I could listen to Imaishi and Nakashima and crew to talk about Gurren Lagann for days on end. And I can't because the interviews and commentaries weren't subbed.

Overall though, yes, buy it. It is definitely worth your money 10 fold over. I felt like I was having a triple christmas the day I received it in the mail.",1373155200,25,2260,4.6708542713567835
5510044,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"TLDR review:

best quality of this show ever. Its AMAZING how different it looks.

best sound of this show ever

box is badass.

book is awesome.

But seriously, The quality of the show is what matters, and it looks GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.",1372723200,,239,4.875
8557751,5,B00ATYCF1Y,It is well worth the price tag the only thing that I did like was that the soundtrack did not have the opening theme,1440460800,,116,3.875
8557752,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"Ok, so the price alone is enough to send someone back a few months but this is totally worth it!!!! all 26 episodes (English dub and japnese audio). If you want the English dub you have to switch to audio and the movies are Japanese with English subtitles. The box is BEAUTIFUL and HEAVY and the blu ray disks are in a huge case by themselves with another amazing cover of the characters. Comes with  a huge book and a ton of other awesome features so stop reading this and buy it already!!!",1430265600,,491,4.279569892473118
8557753,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"I've wanted this for forever! It has mystical powers! When you put the discs into your player and hit the play button (and dance in a circle with no shirt on shouting ""Raw! Raw! Fight the powa!"") Kamina himself will appear a thousand stories high in your neighborhood and rain down manly awesomeness upon everyone in the vicinity!

When you gaze at the pages of the art book it will instantly change your girlfriend/wife into Nia or Yoko while you keep the book open! When you play the music CDs your sunglasses will evolve before your eyes into giant eyewear of awesomeness!

What's more, the special features discs have the power to bring sight to the blind and the drama CDs bring hearing to the deaf! Small pets have been known to come back to life upon removing this item from it's packaging (such is it's power).

Unfortunately I cannot test any of these claims as I do not have $739.99 in my pocket...",1430179200,2,908,4.524390243902439
8557754,5,B00ATYCF1Y,Arrived as described and in a timely manner.,1429315200,,44,4.625
8557755,1,B00ATYCF1Y,"The one star is not for the series but for the price. I know this is the limited super awesome amazing Blu-ray edition and it comes with a ton of extras and 15 discs total but $700-$800 is ridiculous. I could understand anywhere from $100-150 but $700?? That's crazy!!!

If you can afford to buy Ferraris and you happen to live in a mansion than I'm sure this purchase won't break your budget, but if you're a normal everyday working person who pays bills and has a budget than this box set is far too overpriced. I personally hope Aniplex of America fails here in the USA because they're prices are madness and if they were smart than they'd do what Funimation has done and sells at reasonable and affordable prices. Plus Funimation also include DVD with their Blu-ray releases so you get a great combo pack for a decent price.

Funimation's prices for a complete series on Blu-ray ranges from $15-$90 with an average price of $60. They also have their S.A.V.E. Edition from $15-$30.

Overall, Aniplex of America is snatching up amazing series to release in the US for grotesque prices. If Funimatiom or Sentai a Filmworks were to get Fate/Zero then we'd all be able to buy the whole series on Blu-ray for $60-$90 while Aniplex has the license here and releases the series in two parts each going for $200-$300 on Blu-ray.

Please don't waste your hard earned money on Anime Killers of America as well as Aniplex of Japan.",1413936000,14,1423,4.590551181102362
8557756,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"I was hesitant about purchasing the show on bluray rather than DVD given the price difference, but now that I have watched through the special features and seen all of the included extras, I would never go back. Easily worth the price.",1403654400,,235,4.619047619047619
8557757,5,B00ATYCF1Y,"I was worried I'd have buyer's remorse once I received the item, especially considering the price tag, and it had, in fact, been sitting in my Amazon cart for quite some time because of this. I realize now that this was a baseless fear. The Complete Gurren Lagann Limited Edition Bluray Set is a thing of beauty; probably the most beautiful set I have ever personally seen. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible, although as one commenter noted the commentaries and extras are, unfortunately, not subtitled. This almost makes me want to dock it a star, however I was aware going in when I committed to forking over half a grand (and a small part of my soul with it) that this was a thing so I can't bring myself to do it. Everything else about this set is perfect so it kind of balances for me, but I realize that this little detail may be the deciding factor for others who are considering this set and it should be noted. Indeed, it almost kept me from buying it myself. I am so glad I did not let it stop me.

All 27 episodes and the 2 movies have been redone in full 1080p--not up-scaled but actually redone--and it shows. The sound seems to have been redone as well although that could be my imagination and intense feeling of pure awe that was threatening to drown me whilst I binged through the show for, what I realize now, was the first time (all other times pale in comparison and henceforth do not count as they, in no way, showcased this series the way it needs to be seen). There are art books, music and drama CDs, music videos, and more to round out the greatness of this set. I should note that I was thoroughly impressed by the binding on the art and episode description books as well as the quality of the paper and the clarity of the printing; they truly did not skimp when putting this set together. While this may not be a selling point for many, it kind of is for me as it means that I will get many years of pleasure from flipping through these books without worrying about putting too much stress on them. In other words, this set is built like a tank. A tank made of awesome and sunshine and unicorns and more awesome.

Sitting here almost two months after receiving The Complete Gurren Lagann Limited Edition Bluray Set, that's two months of pure bliss, I'm still overcome with emotion from this purchase. My only regret is that I didn't purchase it sooner.

Bottom line, I would have given my first born if that's what it had ultimately taken for me to own this stunningly beautiful and meticulously crafted collection.",1398124800,8,2557,4.4361702127659575
