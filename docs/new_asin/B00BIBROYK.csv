8569021,4,B00BIBROYK,"This was a private collaborative project shot on VHS back in 1992. It sat in Pat Cascio's archive, until at long last it was made available to the public by Paladin Press. It is about an hour and forty minutes long, and is packed with history and Applegate's instruction on the use of the handgun as well as the knife. If you respect Col. Applegate's vast experience and are a student of close combat, I urge you to pick up a copy of this. The cost is reasonable, and you will learn from one of the legends of close quarter battle..",1436227200,,532,4.2772277227722775
