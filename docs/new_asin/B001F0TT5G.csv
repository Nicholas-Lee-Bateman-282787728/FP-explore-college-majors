8300434,5,B001F0TT5G,"The third and final volume in ""Beast King GoLion"" brings this terrific series to a thrilling and very satisfying conclusion.

In the final sixteen episodes, Honerva (Haggar in ""Voltron"".) and Crown Prince Imperial Sincline (Prince Lotor in ""Voltron"".) decide to go all out and stop at nothing to defeat GoLion.  They deploy a team of brutal and sadistic assassins known as The Death Commandos who butcher dozens of Planet Altea's (Arus in ""Voltron"".) citizens like cattle in a slaughterhouse.  Honverva's Deathblack and Mechablack Beastmen (Robeasts in ""Voltron"".) become larger and more deadly and Honerva uses a barren planetiod with a tremendous gravatational force known as Space Wolf (The Omega Comet in ""Voltron"".) to wreak havoc on Altea.

The GoLion Team starts to turn the tide of the war despite The Galra Empire's strength and determination.  They form an alliance with planets formerly enslaved by The Galra Empire, the team commandeers a super weapon The Giant Interstellar Cannon (Pulsar Cannon in ""Voltron"".) to launch a major offensive againt Galra to end the war once and for all.

There are many terrific episodes here.  Among them are three that comprise a three part story arc.  They are ""The Hypergravity Planetoid Trap"", ""No Tomorrow for Altea"" and ""Brave Shirogane's Brother"".  The best episodes not only of this particular set but of the whole season.  The finale is great from start to finish.

As with the case of ""Armored Fleet Diarugger XV"", the series heavily edited to create Vehicle Voltron, there are no loose ends in the ""GoLion"" finale.  The Galra Empire is handily defeated and its rulers are killed.  The viewer actually sees them die.  Nobody survives and flees in hidden escape pods as they do in ""Voltron"" which gives this series a great advantage over its American counterparts.  What also makes the finale work so well is that, in the case with all wars, victory comes at a tremendous price as Ryou Shirogane (Sven in ""Voltron"".) avenges his brother but dies in the process.

A great finale to a truly great series.  Make time to see it.  GoLion!",1365379200,,2087,4.982658959537572
8300435,5,B001F0TT5G,"When I first heard that they were FINALLY going to bring GoLion to America, I was super excited.  I am a huge Voltron fan, love the series but always wondered just what was the real Japanese anime like?  What really happened to ""Sven?""  (Hahaha.)  Come on, we all know he didn't survive :)  Was Sincline really more evil than Lotor?  What the heck was the deal with Zarkon and Lotor's mother?  The series did not disapoint - I fully enjoyed the entire collection and have all three GoLion DVD sets.  It's the real story, a slight violent and nastier side to it than Voltron which was cut up and pieced together by World Events to fit America's youth audience at the time.

Sure the music is corney and the show a bit bizarre, but come on - huge robot lions in space and a super handsome evil badguy Prince makes up for the sillyness. You can't argue with that!",1323129600,,860,4.3584905660377355
8300436,3,B001F0TT5G,"Beast King GoLion Volume 3 is a three-disc set that contains the last sixteen episodes of the series; this series is the original source material for what ended up becoming Lion Force Voltron in the United States.  Unfortunately, the audio level problem that appeared on the first two sets is still present with the third volume.  The audio is so soft that you have to turn up the volume quite a bit in order to hear the audio.

Just like the previous two sets, I could see where changes had been made between Beast King GoLion and Voltron.  For example, shots of blood and people obviously being maimed or killed appeared in this version of the episodes.  Overall, more cuts of this nature had to be made during the episodes included on this last set, when compared to the previous two sets.  This was especially true for the last six episodes of the series.

While Voltron would be acceptable for kids to watch, I can't say the same thing for Beast King GoLion.  This set is definitely being targeted at and marketed to the adults who had originally watched Voltron when they were children over twenty years ago.  However, teenagers might also find this set to be enjoyable.  Even with the issues I have with the audio levels, I would still recommend this set to any Voltron fan that is curious to see what the series was originally like before it became Lion Force Voltron.  However, if you do purchase this set, be sure to watch it when younger children aren't around or after they've gone to bed.",1236038400,5,1501,4.563432835820896
8300437,4,B001F0TT5G,I loved this show even in its watered down  English versions Please make the other series too,1231286400,,93,4.470588235294118
8300438,4,B001F0TT5G,This is it!  Voltron has you have never seen it! Beastking Golion collection 3! This is the third and final collection for Lion Force Voltron series. Get these Japanese with English subtitled episodes because they are very different from the American Cartoon counterparts we are use to. It contains episodes 37-52!  This is Voltron/Golion as you have never seen it!  Highly Recommended it! A,1229731200,2,391,5.078125
8300439,3,B001F0TT5G,"Golion is like a reverse sandwitch. It's two pieces of good, spiced lunch meat with five slices of bleached wonder bread in the middle. The first 7 episodes established the story. Then major events are then hard to find until the last ten or so episodes. Really, only the last four are critical.

The normal Golion episode structure finally becomes reversed as Golion and Altea attack Galra, and Galra is forced to defend itself. The build up to this is pretty slow, as they have to free one planet at a time, then attack. The actual attack on Galra spans the last 3 episodes.

Again, there are no special features. There are previews for Tekkeman Blade, Morbito, and Alteil (an online card game). Also, you get two fewer episodes with this set. You may be asking ""Lion Voltron was 70+ episodes long? Why is Golion only 52 episodes?"" Well, 20+ additional episodes were made for American TV only. From what I understand, Golion just kinda came and went in Japan. It did much better in the US as Voltron. There are no previews for Vehicle Voltron/Dairugger XV, which I found kind of odd. You'd think people willing to see Golion all the way through would be the target audience to at least try Vehicle Voltron.

The last four episodes, all on the last disk, are the key reason to buy this set. They contain most of the character deaths and gore, cut out of Voltron in the US. Although gems like the Galra special forces that look like they stepped out of an old John Wayne war movie, and the ""children's suicide squad"" (it's an episode title) appear in the first two discs.

Again, although it's less episodic than the second half of volume 1 or all of volume 2, this volume is still more of the same with an ending loosely attached. It's nice for fans of old anime, but I still wouldn't recommend this to the average viewer.",1228608000,,1823,4.515151515151516
8300440,4,B001F0TT5G,"These are the episodes that I've been waiting for.  The many adventures of Kogane and the Golion team is coming to a climatic close in Collection 3 of Beast King Golion.

Lives are forever changed and alliances on both sides are tested and pushed to the limits in episodes 37-52.  Some new characters in the mix is Raible's long-lost, presumed-dead son and Ryuo Shirogane, who bares a very strong resemblance to his late older brother, Takashi Shirogane.

Highlight episodes are:
-Space Speed Demon
-The 3-parter (The Hypergravity Planetoid Trap, No Tomorrow for Altea and Brave Shirogane's Brother)
-The Sand Planet of Death
-Angry Youth Suicide Corp
-The 2-parter (Reunion of the Phantom and The Last of Hys)
-The 3-parter (The Great Storming of Galra, Golion's Desperate Battle and Burn, Galra Castle)

*The one standout episode that is NOT for the faint of heart is Golion Hunting (or the Attack of the Red Berets episode in Voltron).  It kind of reminds me of the very first episode of Golion (if you know what I'm talking about).

Some questions arise with this release:
-Will Golion and its interplanetary alliances finally defeat Daibazaal and his great Galra empire?
-Will Planet Galra gain the upper hand and finally put an end to the tireless crusades of Golion, Planet Altea and their allies, all in one fatal, crushing blow?
-Will the slaves of Planet Galra ever be free from Daibazaal's deathgrip?
-Will Prince Sincline ever find out the whereabouts of his mother?
-Who will survive and who will die after all is said and done?
-Will peace ever return to the planets within the Great Dark Nebula?

The only clues that I'll tell you lies within the characters Honerva, Daibazaal's crafty old witch, and the space mice of Castle Graydam on Planet Altea.  I guess that you'll have to find that out for yourselves.

Also, both Golion and Voltron has their pluses and minuses:
-The lions' sound effects (i.e. combining, forming their swords and launching of their arsenal of assorted weapons, etc.) are better in Voltron because it has more of a mechanized sound and feel to it.
-The plots are more interesting in Golion, but both Golion and Voltron has a tendency of having little to some plotholes along the way.  Some of the plots do stay the same in both (depending on the episode).
-Some of the characters' dialogue are retained in both series, but worded slightly different.
-Both series has some pretty good theme music, but Golion's themes helps support its original Japanese roots.
-Some of the character traits are similar to each other, but with Voltron, the names has been changed to protect the innocent....ha, ha!

In conclusion, World Events not only decided to release Voltron twenty years after its release, but both AnimeWorks and Media Blasters decided to get with World Events to finally release its original Japanese counterpart, Beast King Golion, here in the U.S.  Simply comparing them, you can see the differences within each of the episodes and its main plot.  You'll also understand why World Events had to heavily edit and change both the show and its plot.  Despite these slight oversights, I would still recommend this and the other 2 volumes for any Golion and Voltron fans out there.

An underrated show with an interesting continuous storyline.  I'm just waiting for another Toei Animation underrated gem, Armored Fleet Dairugger XV.  We'll just have to wait and see when World Events, AnimeWorks and Media Blasters will set a release date.

I hope that you've enjoyed this (and my many reviews) has much as I've enjoyed watching and writing them.

Get prepped, form your jyuoken and destroy evil.  Happy viewing.",1227744000,7,3655,4.939542483660131
