It keeps you on the edge of your seat up untill the end, which was excellent. I really loved this movie, and I recommend it to any and everybody. James Watson and Francis Crick really take this movie to the next level. Jeff Goldblum (Watson) comes alive in this film, and makes it a very enjoyable experience.",1036972800,4,454,4.290697674418604

It deals with the events surrounding the discovery of the structure of DNA.

609181,5,6303247911,"I've been looking for a copy of this movie for many years.  Unfortunately, I don't even own a VHS system any more, so I'll have to wait longer for a DVD.  I saw the movie once on TV decades ago, it seems -- I see that the tape was released in 1994.  I'm surprised that the reviews I've seen so far barely seemed to notice the character of Rosalind Franklin, played so brilliantly by Juliet Stevenson, one of my favorite actors.  (See ""Truly, Madly, Deeply."")  The contrast between the bumptious, ambitious, unscrupulous Watson (perfectly cast in Goldblum) and the methodical, old-fashioned, repressed Franklin is, for me, the heart of the film.  Franklin died before the Nobel Prize committee awarded its prize for the discovery of the double helix, and Nobel Prizes are never awarded posthumously.  Otherwise she surely would have shared in the honor.",1209168000,,852,4.875

Piece of copied krap....video skips--very irrating--DO NOT Purchase!

I don't know why the @#$%ers at A&E will not release this good program in its own  QUALITY DVD. What a terrible dis-service to humanity and educated people everywhere.

If it is being sold as an educational dvd, think how many more buyers could be spending money for it if it was sold on Amazon.  Selling many units at a lower price seems to make good business sense.

The acting is perfection and the casting includes many talented actors.  I am not a science teacher or a student, but I love this film. I beg that it be released on dvd.  I will be the second in line to order my copy.",1168387200,6,522,3.9711538461538463

609188,4,6303247911,"To respond to the unnamed reviewed from May of this year, the reason why Double Helix isn't availible on DVD or even VHS is because a few years after it's release, the company that produced the movie realized that it was being used in many biology classrooms as an educational video.  Knowing that they could get a lot more money if they moved the movie from regular mass production into specialized educational sales, they pulled it off the shelves and did just that.  The video is now availible in science educator's catalogues - at a price north of $150.",1095638400,94,557,4.616161616161616
609189,5,6303247911,"By P.J. Persad
Unlike most dreary, dull science films, Race for the Double Helix is a dramatic rendering of intellectual competition for the structure of DNA in the 1950s. Throughout the exploits of the [relatively young] American James Watson (Jeff Goldblum) and the Englishman Francis Crick (Tim Piggot Smith) of Cambridge University, science is shown to be more than just picture perfect labs and school textbooks. There are blunders once in while-Watson recalls the incorrect amount of water in each cell while they construct their first model, which makes them look like a pair of fools in front of Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin, and other fellow scientists-and stealth is at times desperately required as illustrated in the scenes where Watson nips a view of the remarkable x-ray diffraction photo of DNA taken by Franklin (this aided in the proposition of a double-helical form) and where Crick attempts to scribble down Chargaff's base pairing rules on his hand of A-T and G-C. A man has to do what a man has to do, I guess. A passion and thirst to make it to the finish line (and the desire for fame, glory, and money), along with the ""fear"" of a renowned scientist like Linus Pauling getting to it first, is also welcome. Social interaction must not be forgotten, but this seems be an exception for Watson. (Goldblum as Watson almost reminds me of James Stewart in his voice's tone of slight stammer/stutters.)

The second half of Race for the Double Helix seems to have more thrills to boot. Where should the sugar-phosphate chains go? On the inside or perhaps on the outside? There is also an emotional confrontation between Franklin and Watson on racing for the gold; she stresses that this is not a game and they are not on a playground. Notable discoveries are evident here in this part including the fact that the strands of DNA must be oriented in opposite directions. (One must also remember to thank Crick for thinking of hemoglobin during times of exasperation.) However, one of the most enthralling moments of the film has to be when Watson is positioned at a desk with cutouts of the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. As he turns them around like puzzle pieces, it dawns on to him after a few tries that purines pair with pyrimidines and not like with like. Then more realization brightens his features as he widens his eyes. He reaches over, lifts up the guanine-cytosine pair, and places it over the adenine-thymine pair. Both pairs match each other perfectly! Here is where I wanted to emit an ""aha!"" exclamation. Goldblum plays this magical scene so realistically with great appreciation for DNA's structure.

This film has sparked my interest in the history of science and my curiosity in research. In fact it has totally enlightened me that I am persuaded to grab a copy of Watson's The Double Helix, along with Maddox's Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA, for further insight and revival of one of science's fascinating races to reveal the ultimate model of beauty and truth: DNA.",1072396800,28,3032,4.862669245647969

7841973,5,6303247911,"This film is indeed excellent; I use it regularly in my history of science teaching.  But I'm not writing to review the film, just to comment on the availability.  I agree that it should be widely available, in commercial release.  But, as one earlier reviewer pointed out, it is restricted to the educational market.  The DVD, released in 2004, is called ""Double Helix"" and is sold by Films for the Humanities and Sciences for $150; FFH earlier released a VHS version, also at an educational institutional price.  The original film, made by BBC Horizon in association with A&E in 1987, was called ""Life Story"" and is about 107 minutes long.

The version being sold here, released in 1994 by Edde Entertainment, is only about 89 minutes long, and therefore is missing about 20 minutes of the original.  I have not seen this version and don't know what cuts were made, and certainly not why they were made.  If the vendors are not selling the truncated version, they should make a new entry for it.

""The Race for the Double Helix"" is also the title of a PBS NOVA program first broadcast in 1976, with host Isaac Asimov and interviews with James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Linus and Peter Pauling.

Look for the original version of ""Life Story"" or ""Double Helix"" of about 107 minutes in your public library or community college or university library until it is released commercially.  You will have to try both titles, ""Double Helix"" and ""Life Story"" and make sure that one of the actors is Jeff Goldblum (brilliant casting!).",1217980800,14,1543,4.7631578947368425
