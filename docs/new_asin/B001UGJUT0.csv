8343637,3,B001UGJUT0,"White trash twins grow up and one is murdered the living one is haunted by the ghost of her dead twin and can not rest until she finds the one who killed her sis.
Good story and good acting make this worth a look. Keep in mind this looks like it was made for the Lifetime network but has a few curse words thrown in. The wimpy killer (Greg Thompson) begged for a bullet in the head and just really ticked me of as did the whisky tango (W.T. white trash) father of the twins, boy was he a worthless waste of air.
I really think the young lady who plays the twins Juliet Reeves, is good in this and I hope to see her again. If you can take the made for video type of movies then this one is worth a look.",1296777600,,702,3.8819444444444446
8343638,1,B001UGJUT0,Horrible ending!  I was so much hoping Ashley's sister would get revenge...but the jerk killer gets away scott free.  What a disappointment.  What a waste of time.  It could have been a great indie film...instead the second coming is going...right into the trash!,1263859200,,263,5.046511627906977
8343639,4,B001UGJUT0,"I saw this at a local film festival in Orlando a while back. I think about a year ago.
Beautifully photographed, well made and a great concept. The concept of twins in horror films has been used many times before, but not this way, no way. I do remember thinking a lot about this flick days after I saw it. It might not have had the huge budget of studio films, but the smart filmmaking and story telling is there.

I thought the main ""Bad"" guy in the film did an amazing job, as he not only is struggling with a great deal of guilt, but also suffering from a horrendous medical problem. Its quite original actually, but I won't reveal more, you've got to see it.

Cool to see this film available to the public.",1243641600,7,711,4.220588235294118
