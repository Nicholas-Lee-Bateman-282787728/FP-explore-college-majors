8180854,5,B000NQRWMA,Totally a fan of Jason Behr and love this movie.  Superb acting and a great storyline.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good movie night with a close friend or partner.,1292544000,,193,4.333333333333333
8180855,3,B000NQRWMA,"I wan't quite sure what to expect from this movie. The concept for the story was a great idea, but for some reason after watching it, I felt like there was something missing. Some parts of the movie seemed rushed, like he (Jason Behr's character) doesn't want help from this woman on getting his life together, and keeps pushing her away, then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, he does want her help, and there's almost no hinting in the story line to show him ""warming up"" to this person. If a friend asked me what I though about the movie, I would say is was just ""okay"" nothing amazing here, not really a stand out performance from any of the actors, but the story itself was a good idea, I just don't think it was fully executed here.",1290470400,2,740,4.369565217391305
8180856,4,B000NQRWMA,"I was really surprised with this movie. I heard that it was at tribeca and I happen to adore Jason Behr. I was so glad I bought this movie. It was wonderful and I found myself sucked into the movie waiting to see what happened next. I recommend this movie, its good just give it a chance. Also on the DVD there are behind the scenes footage which I watched TWICE the first time I watched the movie. :) Give it a shot I think i will surprise you.",1212451200,4,445,4.01123595505618
8180857,4,B000NQRWMA,"This is a small, independant movie. I loved it as it was basically a feel good movie that proved that you really don't have to have a ""and they all lived happily ever after.""  You can guess if you want that they do, but you really don't know.  I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't big budget as it gave a feel of a little more down to earth. Sometimes big budgets loose that feel to them.  Mind you, I found the lead young man very handsome and wonder how he hasn't gotten major production roles.  He certainly was lovely to listen to as well.  Marina Black is always a joy to watch.  I loved the big sister role, too.  Overall, a lovely movie that I will keep for myself (and maybe a few girlfriends to come and look at....  LOL)",1202601600,,727,4.1063829787234045
8180858,4,B000NQRWMA,"It is too bad that this film didn't get a wider release, because it's a very nice story and a nicely made movie with a talented cast. I had a chance to see it at a film festival and my husband enjoyed it too, even though this is not his typical kind of film (no shooting, no kung fu). It is filmed in San Francisco and is a story of a brother and sister who have lost their parents - the brother (played by Jason Behr) is drifting and the older, responsible sister, has gone in the opposite direction, throwing herself into a successful business career, but constantly having to bail out her brother. There is a bit of a magical element to the story, too, when the sister hires a 'fairy godmother' to look after her brother and tries to straighten him out. Among the cast is Jorge Garcia, who plays one of Jake's buddies (and who went on to play Hurley on 'Lost'). Give this film a try and I think you will enjoy it!",1190160000,7,916,4.1807909604519775
