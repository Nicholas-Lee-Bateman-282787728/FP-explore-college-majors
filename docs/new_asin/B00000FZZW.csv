If you're taking this movie too seriously we need to do something to kill that bug up your ass.  This is amongst Goldie Hahn's best work, not to mention outstanding supporting work from Nippsy Russell, while the Central High School cheerleaders completely steal the show.  Get a glimpse of Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, and Bubba from Forrest Gump before they blew up.  Epic theme song from LL Cool J caps a classic 80s soundtrack.

1213478,4,B00000FZZW,This is an older film and has some actors like Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson when they were really young.  Wildcats is a movie about an unsuccessful High School football team that is handed over to Goldie Han as a joke and latter becomes a slap in the face to those who thought she would fail.

Along the way her daughters behave badly so their dad wants to take them away, Goldie shows some bare bosom in a bath tub.  When one of the players injuries himself another student is recruited to play.  Fun and funny, the football scenes look good. A classic.",1386633600,,586,4.490566037735849

I don't understand why people are saying this movie still holds up, because it clearly does not. The sexism, the stereotyping,.the lame jokes.. and the ugly clothes... none of it is relevant anymore...and that theme song is HORRID - ""Sunday's in the snow, referee's whistle blows..football""..Ugh! Are you kidding?? Really??..

Even the scene with John offering to give girls a head dent in their lockers is supposed to be funny - it's not.. it just left me shaking my head; mainly because of the severity of concussions and what we now know about them... John even sustained a concussion, he was told he was going to get a concussion (by Finch) and we see him getting the concussion (even if it's only for acting purposes)... It just isn't funny anymore..

Let it be a thing of the past, and a reminder of how ignorant and uptight people were back in the mid 80's...  It's as stupid and out of date as the rotary phone in the hallway, or as the one guy called Byrd a ""hotdog"".. or the Geri curls.. And Woody Harrelson trying to portray a bad-azz was weak.. It's good to see that we've advanced beyond this being considered a blockbuster (as it was nearly 30 years ago)...well, most of us have advanced...Oh, and to those complaining about the ""foul language"", please stop embarrassing yourselves. You just look stupid saying stuff like that...It's 2013, learn what ""Rated R"" means.",1386460800,,1626,4.596551724137931

They have to be really funny for me to like them, for example Stripes, Caddyshack, Meet the Parents. Well let me tell you this movie did not disappoint at all; it was hilarious from beginning to end. It has some stars in it like Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrleson that were so young then. I recommend this movie to  anyone who loves football and too anyone who loves comedies done right.

One Sunday afternoon I got bored. So I looked for a movie to watch on TV. Wildcats was pretty much the only thing that jumped up at me. Turns out its a cliche football rags to riches female doesnt get taken seriously till they all hug at the end when they get to the championship. It maybe predicable because of my age (20) and I've seen really good football films...(Friday Night Lights, Remember the Titans, Rudy...ect) But this was not a good movie. Decent would be pushing it.

1213798,4,B00000FZZW,"I first saw this when I was a child. I'm 27 now and just bought the DVD. For years I've had the film on a crummy video cassette but now I can enjoy it fully.  This is like fine wine.  It only gets better with age.

Molly McGrath, a school coach is hooked into going to Central High, a school full of underachieving, smart mouth criminals and losers to teach Central's failing football team. Unfortunately their best quarter back LeVander has turned street criminal so the principal ( Nipsie Russell ) hopes McGrath is the new blood needed to win some games. Of course Molly is confronted by the team's hostility at first but when they notice she has a real talent for football and grew up on the sport, they start to respect her. Molly never backs down proving once again that anything a man can do a woman can do better.  The story moves smoothly except for the boring plot line dealing with Molly's eldest daughter, constantly acting out to get attention.  Also the big plot hole is how Molly managed to turn the Central Wildcats into the Dallas Cowboys without explanation. One minute they're the worst team in the district, the next thing we know they're winning the championship!  Go figure. Since this is a comedy overlooking plot holes won't slow up the fun. The highlights are Trumaine ( Wesley Snipes ) who is so disgustingly funny you'll be shocked at some of the things he says. Cerullo's uh...talent ( if you call flatulence a talent ). Flatulence in films wasn't over done in 86' when this is made so it was funny then. It may not be funny to people ( including myself ) who are sick of flatulance being relied on for films of today. And my number one favorite...Finch! The four-hundred pound genius with an attitude!  All the actors have chemistry with each other and keep the ball rolling.  James Keach is funny as Molly's ex-husband who's constantly sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.

Wildcats has all the components of a great film: cute jocks, humor, a witty actress and all around good clean 80's fun.  What amazes me about this is that it doesn't seem that dated even though its nineteen years old. Some 80's films lose their spark but Wildcats is funnier than ever. I never tire of the football sequences or the players' funny catch lines such as: "" If they're the cougars, how come they got a goat? ""  "" What are we b------- about? We got a dog dressed like a cat.""

Wildcats is Goldie's best movie in my opinion. I liked Overboard but with this Goldie really came into her own. There are a lot of emerging actors from this film such as Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson and not to mention the cute cameo from LL. Cool J. Also the man who plays Cerullo is a major hottie! And who can forget the cute little rap song the team does at the end? If you're into light humor or find yourself at home with nothing to do, Wildcats is the perfect movie to just throw in the DVD player and relax. There's no thinking required. The only thing you must have is a sense of humor and the need for two hours of fun-loving entertainment for the entire family ( despite a couple curse words ). Enjoy. And if you haven't seen it, BUY IT!

If you enjoy Wildcats you'll love other funny films of this genre:

Sunset Park

Hardball

The Bad News Bears

A League of their Own

All of these films are good but Wildcats is in a place all its own.",1109721600,15,3350,4.40194489465154

You don't have to like Goldie Hawn, but the supporting cast makes it work--Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, Nipsey Russell, and James Keach--and the jokes still work a couple decades later.

cuteness-- and always worth watching, as  a person everyone know's and feel as if they know.  All the kids in
this were great, as were her ex-husband character, and the late, great Jan Hooks.  Hard to believe we no longer
have her to make us laugh.  Fun story, and good easy to digest silliness to take you away from the world a while.
