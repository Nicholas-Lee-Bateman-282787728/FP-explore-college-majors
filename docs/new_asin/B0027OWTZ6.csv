8354972,5,B0027OWTZ6,Hawaiian Starlight is amazing! Sit back and relax and watch great visuals of our time-lapsed galaxy and space. Almost hypnotic.,1391385600,,127,5.4
8354973,4,B0027OWTZ6,"The overall production is very impressive. However, the details are a bit repetitive and all three disc's we tried
had at least a couple of skips on them including one we sent back.",1378425600,,181,4.515151515151516
8354974,2,B0027OWTZ6,"Kind of boring and repetitive.  I thought it was more of a verbal documentary, it's not.  There is no talking, only scenic pictures of space and the observatory.  The scenes are nice for awhile, but it's quite long.  Maybe good to play in the background at a space themed party, but not much for just sitting and watching.",1364169600,,322,4.5
8354975,5,B0027OWTZ6,"This movie is a wonderful creative journey about astronomy on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The interplay between the two worlds that astronomers navigate, the earth and cosmos, is done with breathtaking majesty.  The musical score is from Halo, and it adds the perfect dramatic overture to the stunning time lapse sequences.  It is hard not to be a fan of astronomy after seeing this movie!  However, beyond the aesthetics, the director has painstakingly added in highly detailed and educational extras that explain each astronomical feature that is in the film.  For this reason alone, this film should be owned by every school in the U.S.  This movie is a five star pick, I highly recommended it.",1243555200,5,689,4.947826086956522
