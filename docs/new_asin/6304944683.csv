2896242,4,6304944683,"Here is a very enjoyable and interesting documentary of one of the best composers of the century.  He was a colorful character as well.  Insightful, funny, and touching stories and observations abound with clips  of interviews of Gunther Schuller, Mingus' musicians, Mingus' wives, and  the man himself. It's as compelling to watch as any good movie.",943228800,5,350,5.196428571428571
2896243,3,6304944683,"Some good footage and anecdotes, but most of the commentary is extremely vague.  I found too much emphasis was placed on repetetive interviews that  merely state opinions held by the jazz world in general, and not enough  footage was devoted to music.  Some songs performed in their entirety would  have been much preferred.  Especially the  call and response with Danny  Richmond, which, although short, is almost reason enough to buy the video",940896000,,445,5.083333333333333
2896244,4,6304944683,"Charles Mingus, one of the most creative forces in American 20th Century music, is examined in depth through archive footage and interviews with two former wives and numerous former bandmates. The music of Charles Mingus  goes beyond simple categorization. Schooled in classical music, with his  early professional exposure in the Los Angeles swing scene, Mingus moved  through numerous styles, working with the major innovaters, such as Duke  Ellington, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Eric Dolphy. A  volatile personality, his gentle and extreme sides are both in view. My  favorite scenes are of Mingus' responses to stupid questions. By the end of  this film, even those people who do not appreciate jazz will agree to  Charles Mingus' place as one of the finest composers & musicians in  American history.",925344000,2,827,5.3

8208455,5,6304944683,"Truly a mind-blowing dvd. The book is the companion piece of work. After reading the book, this dvd is a masterpiece by itself",1376870400,,126,4.521739130434782
8208456,5,6304944683,"The complaints regarding coherency and sequencing of this video as a documentary are valid, and if you are expecting a slick, professional biopic you will be disappointed.

On the other hand, if you want to take a circuitous journey through Mingus' life and achievements, gleaning invaluable insights along the way, this video is not only a treasure, but a tribute to one of America's greatest composers.

Do be warned that there is strong language throughout. Get past that and you will get who Mr. Mingus is in his own words, and the words of his friends, widow and ex wife, and fellow musicians. This is where the video is invaluable to those of us who are touched by his music.

In my case I will admit that for decades I did not care for his music and pretty much ignored him. When I did start listening I discovered that his work is an acquired taste, and once acquired, is an addiction. That addiction is what inspired me to watch this movie repeatedly, and the path that I took getting here should warn you, the reader of this review, to take that into consideration if I get too enthusiastic in my opinions. That said, if you have an interest in jazz and how it evolved from the 1950s through to the end of the 1960s, then Charles Mingus is a key to understand that.  This film, in its disjointed, almost stream of conscious way, provides clues and informed opinions, but will not spoon feed you so-called facts the way, say, a Ken Burns documentary will.

There was a single unifying theme that I picked up from this video and that was Sue Mingus' continuing and abiding love for Charles, and her tireless efforts to ensure that he receive the recognition as a composer that he richly deserves. That, however, is subjective. A more objective lesson I learned from the film was just how close Mingus and his drummer, the late, great Dannie Richmond were. As a drummer that was of considerable interest, and the film placed a lot of emphasis on that relationship, inspiring me to relisten to my favorite Mingus albums with a more critical ear directed to the rhythm section. I then spent hours listening and compared and contrasted the Mingus-Richmond unity to Mingus with Max Roach on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-Jungle/dp/B000SZDMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money Jungle</a>, something I may not have been inspired to do had I not watched this movie. The effort revealed just how connected Mingus and Richmond were musically, which, in turn, has caused me to expand my ideas on tempo, time and the subtle ways the rhythm section can add to the music.

If you are a musician; specifically, a jazz musician, then you may get something from this movie in the way of inspiration or even an approach to the music itself. If you are a strong Charles Mingus fan, this is an essential biography that may be rough around the edges, but does expose Mingus as man and musical genius. Personally, I treasure my copy and watch it probably more than I should. Your views may differ.",1334880000,,3033,4.823076923076923
8208457,5,6304944683,"I knew the man, 'grew up' at the Village Vanguard.  Some friends and several acquaintances appeared to pay homage to the greatest bassplayer.  I even bought a second one for the widow of Jimmy Knepper who is still a friend of mine.  Wonderful purchase for anyone who truly loves jazz.",1265760000,,284,4.64
8208458,1,6304944683,"So, he was a musical genius, so what? I always like the way people ignore the fact that some musical geniuses were plain out of their skulls. Through the years, a lot of jazz musicians (professional and non) paid (and continue to pay) homage to this guy, but would never be able to work for such a schizoid  personality.

People let it slide all the weird things he did, and the way he treated other musicians in a sort of ""blind faith"" following. From what I've read in many books from musicians who've worked for him, and watching this video, it's almost as if they'd bow to him and lick his boots because they got notoriety from playing in his band (i.e. he may be abusive and obtuse, but man, I can make some money and be famous working for him).

Then you get the snooty ""know-it-all's"" who worship him and look beyond his crass idiosyncrasies because they want to be part of the ""In Crowd"" in-the-know about this musical genius. But would never for a moment, want to possess his psychological profile, nor would they even consider socializing with this ""fruitcake"" if it were not for his music alone.

He was an Underdog in his own mind, and brought upon his own paranoia due to his radical viewpoint towards life. Yeah, I like some of his music. But he was a ""space cadet"" in every sense of the word.",1235779200,,1307,4.433333333333334
8208459,3,6304944683,"I have this on VHS tape and DVD.  I've watched it dozens of times.  To me, it's not about Mingus the bass player or composer.  It's about how great artists are often conflicted, complex, sometimes self-destructive and contradictory people.  And in this sense it is a 100% successful documentary with spot-on interviews.  But the archival sound on the DVD is just terrible.  Speaking and more mordern music sound is OK.  Older music is better on the VHS tape.",1187222400,3,458,4.794871794871795
8208460,3,6304944683,"This is great for footage of Mingus...but Gunther Schuller really ruins the documentary-part of the film...claiming that he was Mingus' closest friend and he was the only one Mingus trusted.  Now if that were true, then how come Schuller can't take Mingus' music anywhere near where Mingus took it?  There are too many lame and repetitive interviews...but if you're in for the mingus footage, it's a good buy.",1186531200,2,409,5.0
8208461,4,6304944683,"The material featured on this DVD focuses on chosen points of Mingus'life as a composer and spans a wide sweep of the bassist and composer. For those who relished the thought of finally catching a glimpse of those so Mingusy bass figures, this is going to be a letdown. However, if you are going for Mingus the composer, this is definitely a must-have. There is good quality footage of live performances from the 60s and 70s which provide an appropriate overview of the relentess worker Mingus was and how wide-ranging his inspirational interests were. Mingus's two wives contribute poignant comments and lead you right into the man's passion and anguish. All the musicians interviewed give a clear sense of how galvanizing Mingus's presence was and Gunther's Schuller's musical comments are downright accurate and to the point and he does a concinving job of setting the record straight on Mingus the composer. One thing to mention though, if you like your bass loud and clear, particularly Mingus's warm tone, you might need to turn up the volume. Other than that, you have got to get this simply because there hasn't been much Mingus footage out there yet.",1178928000,2,1159,4.918367346938775
8208462,4,6304944683,"This documentary unapologetically has a mission: to elevate Charles Mingus' status to  ""great"" composer. Whether he is or is not can be argued, but when compared with the likes of Duke Ellington who was unquestionably a great composer, he might move down just a notch. A ""great"" bass player? Unquestionably. Herein lies my complaint: not enough focus on Mingus the bass player. That being said, this documentary makes it clear that Mingus and music are one. The most introspective moments come in the form of home movies of Mingus sitting at the piano composing. One scene in particular has him playing ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" on an old upright to his daughter. Clearly this documentary was a work of love put together by those who revere his music and want to keep it alive. Make no mistake, the music is great and this documentary is a worthy effort.",1106784000,4,851,4.75
8208463,5,6304944683,"Definitely ranks up there with ""Straight No Chaser"" and ""A Great Day In Harlem"".  The interviews with Mingus' sidemen are priceless, as are the discussions with Sue and Celia Mingus.  A crucial documentary for serious fans.",1026950400,3,223,5.166666666666667
