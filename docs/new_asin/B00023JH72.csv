The product arrived in time well packaged.",1309996800,,158,5.115384615384615
2059090,5,B00023JH72,"Those of you looking to buy this product know what Mahabharat is and its cultural and social importance in the life of Indians. I however bought for nostalgic reasons. I still remember those days growing up in Delhi, when Doordarshan was the only state channel to watch. How everyone waited for Sunday 9:00 AM for this epic to be aired, how the streets across the country went deserted with not a soul in sight 'cause everyone is watching Mahabharat, how buses and train schedules were changed so that people could watch this epic and how those miserable power cuts a stark reality those days would never *dare* to switch off electricity during its air time lest they had a death wish an wanted the local distribution center completely gutted :)

Coming back to the product, the packaging is decent. The video quality is fine. But don't expect HD quality 'cause it is not. The discs also have the entire making of Mahabharat which itself makes this a worthwhile buy. The only gripe I have with the making is that instead of it being a single DVD, is distributed over 8 DVDs :(

Other than the above, it is a series which redefined television and in a sense redefined India. A must watch!",1290816000,8,1187,4.59433962264151
2059091,3,B00023JH72,"Hello,

We received the Mahabharata DVD set.  Very 1st DVD of the set is deffective and not working.  We have already contacted DVDCD house informing the deffect in 1st DVD.  We hope that the DVDCD house will replace the deffective DVD with new one very soon.

Thank you for kind co operation",1277683200,3,292,4.538461538461538
2059092,5,B00023JH72,"What a gift B.R. Chopra has given the world with this series.  Having seen the Peter Brooks version--oddly provincial, despite its multinational cast--this is the real thing.  Here the Lord Krishna looks every inch the christ with Apollo-like looks that he is supposed to have--not like some kind of eastern European taxi driver, as in the Brooks version.

No, you must let India tell its tale its own way, and that it does, with songs, dances, fanciful costumes and special effects--this is what captivated the Indian public about this series.  To reject that would be to reject their unique type of humanity, and a wonderful humanity it is.  You may even discover that your own humanity is being described as you move through their story.  This Westerner did.",1263772800,20,761,4.90625
2059093,2,B00023JH72,"I bought this DVD with the idea of getting more deeply into the Mahabarata. The acting is poor, a third grader could do better special effects. There is a lot of spoken Hindi with very little english subtitle. After the second disc I changed my mind about purchasing their version of the Ramayana. This is a very poor product. It's better than nothing at all, but not much.",1262563200,5,373,4.5
2059094,5,B00023JH72,"This is a first quality product and finished in a good quality package.
The packaging is a little different than what I am used to but how else do you compact 16 DVD's to a small a package?
(The dvd's are not individually boxed, but loosly sleeved with 2 DVD's at a time.)
The subtitles in English are a little off sync (varies) as well as the translation is a bit loose at times so there is some loss of meaning of the dialog from time to time.
Perhaps a re-write of the subtitles  and a re-sync would be a big help by someone whose first language is English.
Other than that the quality of the product is first class for an Indian classic.",1260144000,18,641,4.169354838709677
2059095,5,B00023JH72,"First of all this is a beautifull series about the magnificent epic
named Mahabharata.
The only thing I wish to add, is that after reading the original work, you espect to see in the screen the magnificent environment they describe and the superhuman personalities that take part in the story:
Ganga, Arjuna, Karna and many others, all of them Semigods. And then Krishna: God Manifested Itself, (so beautiful that you couldn't takes your eyes away of him, even if you hated him).  Could all that be put in a movie?
And the Rakshasas, monsters like Gatotchak that could grow to gigantic size. (I think that, with the special efects of today, it can be done).
And the herculean Bhima that could uproots entire trees to fight with them.
Then de mavelous feats in the war, like an arrow turning into thousands of them and turning into fire or wind, and the divine Astras, and the events that take place in heaven.
I think it is to much to espect in a movie.
But the Mahabharata epic is so wonderful that you could very well
imagine all of that if you look at this wonderful series as
a representation in a theater.  The dialogues are beautiful and
the message is the same.  I am still going through the 94 parts!
How all of this could be done?  Thank you to all the people that
took part in this work.",1258675200,7,1297,4.436974789915967
2059096,5,B00023JH72,"There is no doubt that Mahabharat is the greatest epic full of knowledge and this serial from B.R. Chopra successfully brings up the core values out of it.
It is one of the best series ever made on the epic with great attention to dharma (righteous duty) and karma (action).
This series brings out much of the important philosophical and devotional content of the epic with practical depiction of human relationships and its complexities in various dimensions which can be applied even in this modern society and can be learned from.
Performance of each character is par excellence. Language is pure and beautiful.
Dialogues are exceptional, the best, and are always meaningful.
Narration by Samay (time) is excellent.
The music is very good, you will love some of the songs.
In total, all fields and areas of Film/TV Series making, make this product a wonderful and an excellent one.

The series is contained in a good quality set of 16 DVDs. Subtitles are also available in English but, are sometimes not in synch with the video.
It is more than worth a buy.",1255910400,27,1060,4.7923497267759565
2059097,5,B00023JH72,Just Love it. I don't consider myself worthy of commenting on this wonderful epic. Hats off to B. R. Chopra,1401408000,,107,4.4
2059098,5,B00023JH72,"I love this set of DVD.  I was recently in India and saw parts of the ""new"" Mahabharat TV program.  Although the setting (props and CGI) was better, it's nowhere near as good as the 1988 Mahabharat show.  The story telling and acting was so much better.  Like most reviewers mentioned, the subtitle could be better but it's good enough to get the story's ins and outs.  But for non-Hindi speaking westerners, I wish I know what else I missed since every now and then they seemed to be saying something interesting.  It would be nice to update or improve the subtitle just to make this great show more accessible to non-Hindi speaking people.  Also I wish the bonus materials have English subtitles as well.  But as of now, all I can do is watch the bonus stuff and make up my own dialogue (which is kinda of fun).  After watch this show, I wanted to read up more about the Gita and Vishnu as well as about the Hindu culture.  Great show.

By the way, the DVD set was in perfect condition, no problem with play back.  The quality of the video is as expected from a TV show  made in the 1988 (just look at TV shows from our late 1970's and early 1980's and you'll get an idea).",1399420800,4,1175,4.262443438914027
2059099,2,B00023JH72,I had to buy these for my grand parents but the video seems to be super low quality. I put the DVD on my computer and then found out the horizontal video resolution is about 240p which is pretty low for this kind of show and in 2013.,1385942400,,233,3.875
2059100,1,B00023JH72,"I received DVDs in time. The video quality is okay. They did not ship the entire set. Instead it was only first 8 out of the total 16. I realized after 3-4 months when I watched the first set and looking for the rest. There is no way to do anything now. Just be aware when you receive this shipment, ensure that you receive two boxes each containing 8 DVDs.

It is the beauty of Amazon Market Place.",1384732800,8,399,4.115384615384615
2059101,5,B00023JH72,"This is an excellent portrayal of the Mahabharat and essential to understanding the wonderful [but complicated] epic.  The actors give first-rate performances.  The character-interpretation of Krishna, Arjun, and Draupadi are incredible.  The Mahabharat's life lessons are presented in the most entertaining way I could imagine.  I'm on my 4th viewing [beginning to end], and boredom is out of the question.  The sets and costuming are elaborate and look as if no expense was spared. I especially appreciate the many outdoor scenes, which lends such authenticity to the story.  The special effects are a little dated, but not annoyingly so.  The spiritual aspect is handled beautifully and will help anyone understand the Indian culture better.",1380067200,4,744,5.473684210526316
2059102,5,B00023JH72,"The Mahabharata is a saga of teachings of 'dharma','adharma' and a spiritual path of living.  There is a wealth of knowledge in each episode and I have watched this series 2-3 times myself

This is one of the best series ever been produced by India's television series on the religious/devotional theme.

Please note that this is an Original DVD series of the Mahabharata (including subtitles) so your purchase will be worth every penny.  It is a pity that the Audio is only currently in Hindi.  There is however, a subtitle option to select an English or Hindi subtitle.",1372464000,2,571,4.785714285714286
2059103,1,B00023JH72,I don't want to say anything more besides it is a bootleg and the subtitles were missing and lagging big time. The sound and the video was choppy.,1362355200,5,146,4.25
2059104,5,B00023JH72,"I just finished watching the whole thing on You-Tube. It's addictive, like a soap opera with the depth and complexity of the Bible! Sure, the special effects are primitive, the action repetitive, and the war scenes not even remotely realistic. (You'll see a lot of arrows colliding with each other head-on, or pinning the enemy's arms to his chariot, or breaking his bow/sword/mace/chariot wheel!) And some elements--like ""time"" as the narrator, or Gufi Paintal's cackling wickedness as Uncle Shakuni--strike me as miscalculations. But the characters and story are literally epic, the themes profound, and the acting generally very good.

For non-Indian viewers, I highly recommend this series as a means of approaching the Mahabharata. The 1965 movie and Peter Brook's version may be hard to follow if you don't already know who the characters are. But after watching the Chopra Mahabharat, you'll have a clear sense of some 50 characters and their interrelationships. This is more or less how most Indians absorb the Mahabharata story (they don't generally read Vyasa, but see these stories performed in various ways), and those who are so inclined will be much better prepared to read it in translation.

One interesting aspect is how the scriptwriters adapted the epic for Indian audiences of the time. For example, notice the series' emphasis on patriotism, meritocracy over nepotism, women's rights (though little is made of caste issues), and opposition to ""partition."" And sometimes it seems as though the central lesson to be drawn from the debacle of the dice game is that gambling is bad! But these are minor details--for the most part, the archetypal timelessness of the tale shines through.",1356048000,2,1703,5.211678832116788
2059105,5,B00023JH72,"This is actually not a review of the series but a warning to potential buyers of this boxset. On offer here is the Arrow Film release dated June 29, 2011 but the set I received (bought on behalf by a friend in the US as Amazon does not ship this set to Malaysia) is actually the IAVC 2005 release. Amazon: please update your product description so that customers do not make any wrong decisions.
As for the series I am into my second disc and I am hooked. And yes, disc one is defective as one previous reviewer observed. I have given the review 5 stars so as not to affect the rating of the series.",1335139200,8,599,4.172413793103448
2059106,4,B00023JH72,"Grew up watching this series and wanted to have a collection to myself. Searched online and came across this copy and it had good reviews. So went ahead and bought it. Print and sound are decent. Do not expect it to be sharp on your HD screen, but good for most part. What would make it great is a digitally enhanced version. But pretty satisfied with this, would recommend it.",1319846400,2,377,4.4
8021375,3,B00023JH72,"While the subtitles in this version are great and the show is great too, the DVD's themselves have issues. Several episodes will not play all the way through, and many skip or have issues with playback.",1517184000,2,202,4.638888888888889
8021376,5,B00023JH72,"One of my Fav story to watch - the words of wisdom contained in this ancient epic story really hold true in this TV series. Chopra did a magnificent job at being able to portray each of their characters, with a true light. I saw good in the 'villains' as well as bad in the 'heros' - showing how the fight for the light is above this simple duality but how repentance is truly key to salvation. The acting was just wondferul, and the special effects, well not as much, tbh totally cheezy but at the same time, i'm not watching this series for the special effects, but for the words, the actions of the people in the story and how it reveals various consequences later on in life. I've learned so much about myself, by reflecting on the similarities and differences I saw in the series and within myself.. If you are into spirituality, knowing the self and such, then I highly recommend this DVD series - it's a gem!",1508716800,2,915,4.356725146198831
