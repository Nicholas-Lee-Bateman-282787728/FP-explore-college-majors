7796621,3,1565857283,"The course is too introductory and limited in scope for any reader somewhat familiar with the subjects. The Professor limits the scope to the discussion of historic facts about the key Philosophers and their major work. He largely shies away from both critical analysis of various theories and the influence they had on the future developments. Somehow, the quasi-chronological approach (with each section developed to a Philosopher - with one exception) also results in somewhat jumpy subject expositions. Most importantly, the series ends most dissatisfactorily. just before the Kantian Philosophical revolution. While this was certainly intentional as defined in the title of the book, but it made the series equivalent of learning the birth of modern science from Newton and Galileo to Maxwell and ending just before the arrival of Einstein.",1451606400,2,845,5.458015267175573

7796623,5,1565857283,"This is a lecture series from a college philosophy class. At first I thought this was just a stuffed shirt philosophy teacher who was out of touch with reality, but I gave it a chance and fell in love with it. The teacher is very good at giving a description of each of the philosophers, and makes them easy to understand. The magic in this course is the flow that this professor provides of the evolution of thought throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. I have never before been privy to such a complete synopsis of the evolution of philosophical thought, and I am profoundly appreciative of this course. I'm not a philosophy expert, but I found this course very easy to follow and understand. It is meant as an introductory course and yet it goes into great detail. The professor is wonderful at presenting the ideas as the philosophers conceived them, without bias or prejudice. I highly recommend this set for anyone who is interested in learning about modern philosophy or gaining a further understanding of the evolution of thought from this time period to the present.",1292025600,4,1077,4.73404255319149
7796624,5,1565857283,"The dawn of Modernity, the 17th and early 18th century is generally a black hole in most people's education.  We know vaguely about Newton and Newtonian physics.  We've heard of Bacon and Descartes.  Maybe we're familiar with Cartesian dualism, or the ""cogito"". We've heard of Locke, and know he had some sort of influence on our Founders.  But much beyond some vague familiarity with the basics, few of us have any deeper understanding of this pivotal era. In fact, many Americans, in particular, have a far deeper knowledge of more remote antiquity (or speculations regarding those past ages).  That fact is unfortunate, for the Early Modern Era is when many of our contemporary habits of thought  first emerged. Like it or not, Post-Modernity is the child of Modernity. And we, in our various, often ungainly and unsuccessful ways, are attempting to deal with the mess bequeathed to us by our forbears. The emergence of the intellectual hegenomy of scientific thinking, the fragmentation of Christianity - and the religious world view - the consolidation of the modern political state - are all phenomena which appeared for the first time in this turbulant era of deep change.
I have found no other source through which one can quickly obtain a comprehensive and fairly deep understanding of this essential period.  In a series of 16 knock-out lectures, one of the leading period authorities, Allan Charles Kors of the University of Pennsylvania, gives a detailed history of the major ideas of an era, and an understanding of which, I again emphasize, cannot be underestimated in its value for a balanced perspective on today's realities. While they are all remarkable, I must single out the lecture on Bacon as a masterpiece of its kind - the most lucid rendering of Bacon's thought in a brief format extant.  My one critique is the omission of a lecture on Montaigne - whom I consider to be the seminal thinker of the epoch.  All in all, however, a great investment, and a real bargain at that.",1193702400,6,1999,4.890532544378698
