8117595,3,B000F52F80,"We Are Angels has Bud Spencer teamed with Philip Michael Thomas again, as they were in Extralarge, only this time Bud's English is quite a bit better. After a long wait, these Italian-released DVDs have made their way into curious fans who had never seen the show. There are 2 hour and a half long episodes on each of the three volumes, so you can get your money's worth if you buy all three. They play fine in any computer as region 2 and the PAL color is simply stunning, especially those scenes shot in the jungle. There are some genuinely quirky moments in these movies, reminiscent of earlier Spencer/Hill movies and they are quite lively and entertainlng as well. The very first episode on volume one has some screw-ups in the audio track near the beginning, but it straightens out after awhile and the other 5 episodes are just fine. For those who can understand the Italian language, there is a special treat: Interviews with Bud Spencer as extras on the DVDs.",1201219200,,968,4.601156069364162
