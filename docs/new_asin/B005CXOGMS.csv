4655063,5,B005CXOGMS,"Before I saw this documentary I was sure it would be full of agnostic bias on part of the History Channel. I was shocked to find this was a completely open-minded piece of work. It was completely balanced and riveting. Before watching this I wasn't sure if the Shroud of Turin was the real deal. Now, after this documentary I'd say I'm 99.9% sure it's real. The end result of a 3D Yeshua sent chills up my spine. Don't know for sure if this is an accurate portrait of him but it's probably the closest thing to date. Highly recommended.",1275264000,,536,4.37
4655064,4,B005CXOGMS,"Overall, this presentation on the Shroud has its merits.  It presents some new data not previously presented in any other DVD's on the Shroud prior to 2010.  It is complimentary to two other DVD's on the Shroud:  ""Jesus and the Shroud of Turin"" and ""The Fabric of Time,"" together with the PBS documentary ""Secrets of the Dead:  Shroud of Christ?"".  I rate these other three DVD's with 5 stars while I rate ""The Real Face of Jesus?"" with only 4 stars due to two conflicting ideologies which are presented, not sufficiently developed, and left unresolved.  On the one hand we have the statement made by a Catholic Priest that Christians believe in a Man--Jesus Christ, not simply in an idea.  On the other hand we have other scholars referring to two poorly presented beliefs from Gnosticism:  1) something to the effect that the present universe is the result of a ripping asunder of the fabric of reality (as if traditional Christianity does not teach this) and that this idea somehow accords with modern science and 2) something to the effect that the Gnostics believed that the kingdom of God is present everywhere in the universe (as if traditional Christianity does not teach this).  Though these particular Gnostic ideas do not necessarily conflict with orthodox Christianity, the references to Gnosticism seem out of place in a documentary which hopes to present to us something more of the humanity of Jesus Christ.  The un-unified Gnostic groups resulted from replacing the natural Judaic paradigm of Orthodox Christianity with one of the various pagan worldviews and redefining all the Hebraic terminology with pagan ideas.  Despite their disunity of thought on other points, one point of agreement among Gnostics is their devaluation of the Jewish historical context of Jesus Christ and of the importance of Christ's actual humanity.  In Jewish Kabbalistic terms, this is tantamount to a denial of the Peshat level of understanding reality--a denial which sabotages any attempt to understand the deeper mysteries (see definition of ""Peshat"" in Wikipedia).  Why does this documentary present ideas from Gnostic ahistorical and dehumanizing systems of thought when the primary import of the documentary is to present to us a possible physical image of the humanity of the historically Jewish Jesus Christ?  After all, the actuality of Christ's humanity is inconsequential to Gnostic systems and even blatantly denied by some Gnostics.  Consequently, the documentary's references to Gnostic thought serve more to undermine rather than contribute to its overall message.  I was left wondering if the directors were simply trying to follow an agenda of certain pop academicians (e.g., Elaine Pagels, Karen Armstrong, et al.) by implying that Gnostic ideas are the solution to some kind of unstated problem.  What is the agenda of the directors of this documentary which led them to inject these passing, incongruent, and undeveloped references to Gnostic thought?  Despite these puzzling Gnostic distractions, this documentary is praiseworthy in that it demonstrates how the enigmatic Shroud of Turin, unlike Gnosticism, may possibly present to us a somewhat realist image of the humanity of Jesus Christ.",1273708800,9,3210,5.24853228962818
4655065,5,B005CXOGMS,"This was a terrific documentary. Although the main purpose of the show was following the development of Jesus' face from the image on the Shroud of Turin, in the process of doing this we are given a history lesson on the Shroud. I have seen many documentaries on the Shroud and I find most of them fascinating, mainly because the Shroud of Turin is so amazing, but this one was very well done. Perhaps what was really interesting in this one was the fact that it really gets across how special the image on the Shroud is. It has three dimensional information preserved on it! I believe the show also gets across the fact that no artist, priest, or scientist of the Middle Ages could have created an image with all the properties that this cloth has been discovered to have. The only flaw is that it brought up the Gnostics for some reason which I think was a bit silly. I do hope, however, that this show will eventually be released on Blu-ray because I'd like to get a copy.",1271894400,3,975,4.392265193370166
4655066,5,B005CXOGMS,"""The Easter Experience"" by City On The Hill Productions, is a good supplement to this  excellent documentary.  Both bring you into the reality of Christ's life and suffering, drawing you closer to God. ""The Real Face Of Jesus"" is one of the best Shroud documentations to date.  We can gaze upon a credibly recreated face of who I believe is the Son Of God.  The documentary details facts, history and speculation surrounding the shroud, but implies the great mystery of its image. It is both awe inspiring and heart wrenching to see the extent of bloody evidence remaining on the shroud.  The man wrapped in the shroud was a man who suffered the horrific pain and torment of cruel Roman abuse, scourging, and crucifixion. Worthy is the lamb, Christ Jesus.",1270425600,32,755,4.776923076923077

Reasonable people do not deny that Jesus Christ was an historical figure - a great moralist and moral leader. Dan Brown and recycled gnostic myths aside (i.e., ""The Da Vinci Code""), Jesus Christ made the incredible claim to be God!  To claim to be God - if you are not God - should immediately qualify you as the world's worst charlatan or be evidence that you are delusional.  Yet, Jesus indeed made this claim and offered evidence, the most astounding of which concerned predictions - and fulfillment - of His own resurrection from the dead.

After the Roman authorities had killed Jesus, the last thing they wanted was for His followers to immortalize Him.  So, they fortified His tomb and stationed a guard. Somehow, the tomb was empty on that first Easter morning.  To posit that a few formerly sheepish pals - most of whom had been MIA on Friday afternoon - could have snatched and forever hidden His body from history doesn't make any sense.

In response to the foregoing, some question the historicity of the Gospels and suggest that Jesus' claims of Divinity were inventions of the early Church.  But there was absolutely nothing to be gained from such a hoax - early followers lost everything by this ""lie""; many lost their lives!  Another attempt to counter the foregoing is the suggestion that Jesus may have talked of being God in a New Age manner.  Maybe, He meant that He was God - just like we are also God!  This is simply ahistorical; it is not in keeping with Jesus' montheistic cultural background.  He did NOT go around saying that everyone was God!

4655068,5,B005CXOGMS,"Just watched this on the History channel and ordered the DVD.  Can't wait to have a copy to review it again.  I have been watching everything I could find for many years (I am 65) and I think this is a fair coverage of all the history up to present regarding the shroud.  Using the most current technology, the outcome was most exciting.  Especially the comments that some type of light influence possibly created the image; since they cannot conclusively say how it was created.  For me, the Bible says that God is light, it is not a far step to believe that light to be the cause of the image.  It is, if anything, a help to the faith; although it should not become an image of idol worship.",1270339200,22,693,4.292307692307692
4655069,5,B005CXOGMS,"I Saw the ""The real Face of Jesus""  last night, it was very good. The History Channel dose a good balanced job of the History and research on the shroud. They showed the evidence that the shroud can be traced to 33 AD, they showed its connection to the Eastern Roman Empire and its connection to the knights templer. They show how the modern interest got started with Doctors Pea's photograph in the late 19th century, all the way up to space aged scientific research being down now; They cover all the theories and come to the stratling conclusion; One the Shroud is not a fake, Two they don't know how it was made; The best Theory is that it was caused by some low level radiation coming from the body in the shroud. There are only two areas I would contend with, they did not do enough on the debunking of the carbon 14 test in the 1980s, the research team dated repairs, not the shroud proper. The fibers in the shroud are of one type and the samples tested have two types of fibers. And they sped a little time on the Gnostics beliefs about the universe, and who cares?

I've also viewed a number of Shroud documentaries and have been to lectures by Shroud researchers. The information in this video is good, but the presentation is tedious and disorganized. Some points are presented two or more times, and there is always the after-TV-commercial summary, which we hear again and again. The history of the Shroud is presented in several separate segments; the dating controversy as well. Then there are these ridiculous references to Gnostic Christians as the ones repressed and branded as heretics by the early Church -- even though their understanding of the universe was supposedly congruent with what the Shroud manifests. (Actually, they were branded heretics because they viewed matter as evil, and for other problems not mentioned in the documentary).

4655076,5,B005CXOGMS,"This DVD documents a six year effort, by scientists and computer graphics experts, to extract a reasonable likeness of the man on the Shroud of Turin from the image imprinted on the cloth.  It wasn't an easy task.  For, the image on the shroud presented a number of serious obstacles which had to be overcome.  Paramount among them: extensive blood stains masked the face; the image was difficult to discern since it is imprinted on a woven cloth; lights and darks are reversed; and, to make matters worse, the image is distorted by having been wrapped about the mans head.  In order to recover the true image, or a reasonable likeness, these, and other, problems had to be addressed and overcome.  The following paragraphs present a cursory outline of how the effort was undertaken and how it proceeded, as shown in this DVD.

The first problem addressed was that of the blood stains.  Through analyses, it was determined that the blood stains were significantly different from other stains on the cloth.  This meant that they could be identified and then removed from the image using modern computer technology.  The image was, therefore, scanned into a computer and the blood stains removed.  The next problem addressed was that of the woven cloth.  This was handled in much the same way as the blood stains.  An application was written to remove the repetitive weave; and it disappeared from the image in the computer.

The next problem was that of the distortion caused by the shroud having been wrapped about the corpses head.  Simplistically: that problem was solved by wrapping a replica of the shrouds cloth around a model head of the appropriate size and determining where the features on the cloth fell on the model.  This data was then fed into the computer and corrections made to the computer image.  Finally, taking into account the images reversal of lights and darks, and applying some necessary artistry, a three dimensional face began to take shape.  It appeared to be that of a Middle-Eastern man in his thirties.  (As an aside to the subject of this video: There is also a side feature on this DVD.  The results of this effort also yielded a full length, three dimensional, view of the man on the Shroud, allowing viewers to see the full extent of his injuries.)

It has long been recognized that the image on the Shroud of Turin is not a true likeness of the face of the man who was wrapped in the shroud.  That is especially true if, in fact, this is the cloth which wrapped the body of Jesus Christ following his crucifixion.  For, it isn't the face of a young man from the Middle East; and Jesus certainly wasn't European.  And, just as surely, Jesus wouldnt have looked mysteriously God-like, as the man on the Shroud appears to do.  What, then, did the man on the Shroud actually look like at the time of his death?  This DVD attempts to answer that question.

The question now becomes: Could this actually be the face of Jesus, or a very close representation?  And, would the Apostles recognize him?  Unfortunately, we will never know for sure, but this may very-well be the closest well ever come in our lifetimes.",1459296000,5,3143,4.706959706959707

point of view.  The shroud is discussed by many different types of engineers that actually examined the cloth.  For an ancient cloth no modern

4655089,1,B005CXOGMS,"Ive been a very causal Shroud researcher since the late 1970s.  Sometimes between Christmas and Easter I have read a book or watched a video program or two about the Shroud.  This video is typical History Channel drivel.  There is nothing factual in it that I didn't already know.  I even recognized some of the video segments from other programs I have watched.

As for the purpose of this particular effort all I can say is that if you give a computer programmer enough numbers he can give you whatever output you want.  The program admits that the Shroud leaves out a lot of information, but this doesnt give anyone the right to supply what is missing.  By this programs own admission the face they produced is pure conjecture and that face isn't produced until the last 10 minutes of the program.  Therefore, can the program really serve any purpose?

For the record part of me wants to believe that the Shroud is authentic for the sake of having a 1st century Christian artifact to testify to the historical event that was the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  My faith doesnt need this artifact, but the historian in me wants it just the same.  But, I have trouble accepting the long-haired hippy-type in the Shrouds image as being Jesus Christ when you take into account I Corinthians 11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?",1422489600,2,1404,4.598393574297189

But the technology that was brought to bear in this investigation is the closest I've seen to pronouncing the shroud worthy of respect as what can very possibly be the actual burial cloth that wrapped the Christ.

The old argument that this was created by a monk using stencils back in the early centuries, 15th or 16th if I recall, is completely refuted by this new evidence. (no spoiler here). And the image itself and what was found to have appeared to have imprinted it in the very fiber of this material is extraordinary.

This first video explains why the ""experts"" were wrong when they claimed that this was a fake in the recent past and not the burial cloth of Christ.  Then watch ""The Real Face of Jesus"".  You will be astounded!  This is a true and well made program.  I was very impressed.  Even though this is the TRUE burial cloth of Jesus Christ, we are to worship Him and not the cloth that He was buried in.

Another couple of videos you need to watch are: ""In Search of the Real Mt. Sinai"" and ""The Exodus Revealed"".  These both show the REAL Mt. Sinai and its NOT the one in the Egyptian peninsula.  Nothing there matches with the Bible's description of what happened, where it happened, and what should be found at the REAL site.  Have you ever wondered why the maps in the back of your Bible have question marks on them for the locations of the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt?

NOW  you can see the REAL Mt. Sinai that matches perfectly with the Bible.  It is life changing!
Also look up Ron Wyatt on the Internet as he was the one who ""found"" the REAL Mt. Sinai and made a map by which the people
in the video ""In Search of the Real Mt. Sinai"" used to find it again and show the video footage of the breathtaking REAL Mt. Sinai.

4655108,4,B005CXOGMS,"The Real Face of Jesus shown of History Channel is a great example of how science and religion can come together to be able to answer one of worlds most controversial questions. How did Jesus really look like? Is there any proof of his resurrection? In this documentary I didn't only see the most accurate model of Jesuss face ever created but I also learned about the story of the Shroud of Turin and its possible significance in the story of Jesuss resurrection. I was personally astonished by the findings of the scientists and by the 3D instructions hidden within the 2D Shroud of Turin.

 Everyone recognized Jesuss face but ironically no one has ever really seen it. The documentary The Real Face of Jesus is a very interesting and informative piece of evidence which proves science and religion can work side by side to reveal one of the most commonly asked questions in Christianity, how did Jesus really look like. Throughout the story the most important piece of information available to the scientists was the Shroud of Turin. As the study of the shroud progressed not only Jesuss face was becoming more clear but the marks of his brutal crucifixion were visible all over his body. It was repeatedly stated in the documentary many people didn't want Jesuss real face revealed to the public for some reason which I personally don't understand.

 As I started watching the documentary I was anxious and I wanted to end it because I wanted to see Jesuss most accurate face to be ever constructed. Many times I thought about skipping to the end and coming back to watch the rest but I reminded myself to I must be patient. This documentary has finally explained to me the biggest phenomenal I never truly understood in my religion. The death and resurrection story of the founder of my religion. I chose this documentary because the moment I saw the title I knew I must get some answers. Repeatedly in the documentary were moments where I questioned the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin but as the plot progressed and was backed up with scientific proofs I believed. After watching this documentary I have made sure to put the Shroud of Turin on my must see list because I think its the closest I will get to meeting the person who was tortured and died for my sins.

 Furthermore, this documentary explains the possible events which took during the resurrection of Christ. The computer technologies were able to identify the only way the image could have been created on the Shroud with 3D properties, which would have been scanner light, which is radiated off in waves. The only way for the shroud to have its properties would have been if the body it was rapped around gave off light. I found this very interesting and surprisingly believable. I am surprised how easily this documentary won over my heart and faith. I am a very factual person who rarely believes in miracles unless presented with authentic proof. This documentary is what in my perspective proved the existence, crucifixion and resurrection of Christ in an hour. It doesnt stop here, it also gave me an insight into the history of my religion, a branch of christianity which I never heard of before, the Gnostics which was exiled and eliminated in the older times and a story of a piece of cloth which could have wrapped Jesuss body. And this is where my scientific and religious worldview collides.

 This documentary made me question several times do I know the world around me or do I think I know it. It made me question who I am and what do I stand for. On one side I believe I am a creature made out of carbon but the on the other side my soul cannot be a product of purely scientifically based findings. I am something more and this documentary made me realize it. I am made up of matter which exploded from starts but my soul was given to me by God who sacrificed his son for humanity. Just as I am obligated to believe in the resurrection of Christ after watching this documentary I am obligated to believe in the significance of the Shroud of Turin. You cannot believe in one if you don't believe in the other. This documentary is an amazing piece of work and definitely worth watching. It will make you frustrated, make you wander, hope and maybe even believe a little more in the miracle which occurred centuries ago. If I were to rate this documentary out of five starts I would give it a four",1386547200,,4386,4.599744245524296

That is at the end of Section 5, Hidden Data, so I skipped to Section 6, Distortions.  Its end has a piece on 3D, and I skipped to 7 Historical Data.  I had also decided to omit Section 9 with the artistic touches, but time ran out.

4655142,2,B005CXOGMS,"The science behind the shroud is fascinating, deep, and complex.  Unfortunately in this production, the emphasis was placed on the artistic efforts of the re-creationist, with references to the science seemingly added on for the sake of drama or glitz.
I understand it was about ""the real face,"" and not the shroud per se, still it felt like the more interesting story was Dr. Johnson's work, which was getting passed over in the DVD to spend more time with the re-creationist who ultimately doesn't add that much to the existing image.  Kind of like driving past the fireworks store to go to the box factory.
This history at least was done well, in terms of tracing our best guesses of the shroud's origins to present day.
Watching this on DVD was also a bit jarring as the same basic facts got repeated over and over again.  I understand this works for television so the viewer that missed the first 15 minutes can catch up, but it felt really tiresome on the DVD, and really wouldn't have been necessary in the production...there isn't a huge progression of steps made by the re-creationist to get from shroud to image.  There was also a really awkward tie in with Gnosticism which felt like an attempt to cash in on a passing cultural fad.
It's worth seeing the final animation, but maybe look for it on YouTube?  The ""real face"" is really quite disappointing after sitting through the repetitive build up, and beholding the stunning negative shroud images in comparison.  The re-creationist admits -toward the end- he has to take artistic liberties to fill in the features and it looks surprisingly amateur when the eyes open.
Perhaps the most disappointing is how it never explores the question about why Catholics hold it's not really important to know Christ's features.  Missed opportunity.",1318550400,6,1799,4.840390879478828

This program will blow you away.  For beleivers, it will serve as an (perhaps unnecessary) reinforcement.  For nonbelievers, the question will grow more intense: if not the real Shroud, then what?  It's possible that someone in the Middle Ages could have somehow faked the 3D image on the cloth, but not very plausible.  And if so, how so?  And if so, how do we account for the real fact that the Shroud can be dated by alternative, (perhaps) more accurate means to well before the 13th century?  The carbon dating of a tiny, often handled end piece cut from the cloth in 1978 could well have been faulty.  Many have tried to duplicate the Shroud, but none have been successful.

The evidence & logic presented here makes the idea of forgery completely implausible. The ""where"" & ""when"" of the question is, I believe, answered by this film. The ""how"" that these researchers provide is very credible. The ""who"", ""what"", & ""why"" remains a matter of personal belief or faith.

4655156,3,B005CXOGMS,"This latest Shroud of Turin documentary, first shown on television around Easter 2010, touches on many different issues in (and out of) the Shroud field.  On the whole, it's good at marshaling evidence for the Shroud's authenticity.  And the ostensible purpose of the documentary, to recreate the face of Jesus, seems fairly well accomplished, however flamboyantly or melodramatically.

But the show gets muddy and mystifying when it digresses into Gnostic speculation, as previous reader reviewers have mentioned.  And it gets really dubious toward the end, when it promotes supernatural doings in the empty tomb, though no reviewer has yet scrutinized that aspect.

So I'd like to focus closely now on those supernatural claims, which are the most important part of the program by far.  They may have sounded persuasive to many thousands of the show's millions of viewers.  But the claims can easily be refuted.  I'll do so here in the hope of protecting from superstition the few dozen people, or perhaps few hundred, who will ever read this review.  (By the way, I'm an agnostic and secular humanist, but have studied these questions in depth, and do sympathize with enlightened religion.)

The moment in question comes near the end, when Russ Breault, an enthusiastic Christian Shroud of Turin expert (and pop star on the lecture circuit), states the following: ""And John [the Gospel of John, 20:8] says, `And I saw and believed that he had risen.'""  Breault then continues, ""John and Peter ... believed that he [Jesus] had risen.  So the question is, what did they see that Mary didn't see?  And I believe that it has to do with the linen shroud....  The shroud is the first piece of evidence that indicated that something extraordinary had happened here, and certainly not that the body was stolen.  Now, if you saw the cloth wrapped up, balled up, and thrown into a corner somewhere, well, then sure, Okay, maybe the body was stolen.  But the way that the shroud was laid out, flat on the stone sepulcher, just the same way that it was on Friday when Jesus was placed in it, the strips of linen bound around the outside of the cloth - it was obvious something extraordinary had happened here, something beyond human reason.""  Such is Breault's confident argument for a supernatural resurrection of Jesus based on the shape and location of the shroud as found in the empty tomb.

Problems with Breault's presentation and interpretation include the following:

1. Breault misquotes the gospel passage in question in several ways.  For starters, John 20:8 contains no ""I,"" no ""he had risen,"" and no ""Peter"" as one who ""saw and believed.""  Please check the passage for yourselves.  Breault's loose treatment of it does not inspire confidence in his reliability.  He is reading too much into it.

2. Far more seriously, Breault then misrepresents the alternatives for the shape and location of the shroud when describing the empty tomb scene.  He first describes a natural alternative to a supernatural resurrection, but only in extreme form.  Seeing ""the [shroud] cloth ... balled up and thrown into a corner somewhere,"" he says, one could conclude that ""the body was stolen.""  But this alternative of his is a false one.  A body removal by human hands need not have entailed such extreme treatment of the shroud.  Body thieves could simply have drawn back the top layer of the shroud, lifted the body off the bottom layer, then exited the tomb with the body (now wrapped in some stronger material or ""body bag"").  That would not have resulted in much disturbance of the shroud's shape or location, and certainly not the ""balled up and thrown in a corner"" condition that Breault describes.  He has deliberately exaggerated the natural alternative here in order to dismiss it, thereby leaving only a supernatural explanation for the body's disappearance.  Moreover, a slight disturbance of the shroud by body thieves would surely not have prevented the superstitious followers of Jesus from believing that his body had disappeared via a supernatural resurrection.  Over the centuries, many Christian paintings of the empty tomb scene have even depicted the shroud, or other burial cloths, strewn out in bedraggled condition, sometimes half lying on the floor.  Yet those paintings were commissioned by Church authorities, who did not object to such depictions.  Similarly, Zefferelli's famous 1977 film Jesus of Nazareth shows the burial cloth/s in a disorderly state in the tomb, yet that film also suggested a supernatural resurrection.

3. Breault then says that the shroud was found ""laid out, flat....""  This condition, in contrast to the ""balled up and thrown in a corner"" one, would better support the scenario of a supernatural resurrection involving a sudden disappearance of the body from beneath the shroud, which then deflated and fell ""flat.""  But the Gospel of John says no such thing.  It only says that the burial linens (Greek ""othonia,"" which may indeed mean the single long shroud) were seen ""lying"" (Greek ""keimena"") in the tomb.  No shape or location of the ""othonia"" is described.  The gospel even uses that word ""keimena"" twice in this context without any modification.  Breault himself, echoing Christian theologians or resurrection apologists of times past, has added the word ""flat"" to the passage in order to support his supernatural explanation.  But if the shroud or burial linens had really been found lying flat and deflated, top half lying over the bottom half, the Gospel writers would, most probably, have mentioned such a remarkable sight.  They did not, neither in John nor in Luke.  The most reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that the shroud was not found lying flat (nor in the shape of an empty ""cocoon"" - a similar and even older Christian fantasy).

4. Breault also says that the shroud was seen ""on the stone sepulcher.""  This statement is again questionable.  In common parlance, a sepulcher is a tomb or burial chamber, not merely a stone body ledge inside that tomb.  And to repeat, the gospels say nothing about the location of the burial cloth/s (shroud) in the tomb. (John 20:7 does mention a smaller head cloth lying elsewhere in the tomb, but that's all.)

5. Breault next says that the shroud was seen with ""the strips bound around the outside of the cloth.""  But once again, the gospels do not support that claim.  The original Greek word ""othonia"" in the Gospel of John, which we translate into English as ""burial cloths,"" is grammatically plural, and yes, it could therefore mean more than one cloth (e.g. the shroud and a lesser strip).  But it need not mean that at all.  The word ""othonia"" could easily refer instead to the single very long (14-foot) shroud, simply perceived, because of its great length, as more than one cloth.  Moreover, even if a 3-inch wide ""side strip,"" previously cut from the side of the shroud itself, was also found there in the empty tomb on Sunday, it need not have been wound around the shroud and body on Friday as Breault claims.  The Gospels relate that the burial ceremony was rushed and had not been completed before the onset of the Sabbath on Friday.  The body still had to be anointed, for instance.  So any final touch of tying up the shroud around the body may not yet have been performed, if it was even intended.

6. In fact, this whole ""side strip"" or ""bound shroud"" claim is a controversial one in the Shroud of Turin field.  A few experts believe, with Breault and John Jackson (also featured in this program), that the side strip currently attached to the Shroud was actually used for binding up the Shroud around the body.  But most Shroud experts do not believe that.  And the evidence Jackson offers here for the shroud being ""bound"" with the strip is weak.  He says, for example, the ""legs - looks like they're being held together.""  But to me it seems that their close positioning could simply be due to their having been neatly placed that way by the people who entombed Jesus.  Or it could easily be due to Jesus' posture on the cross throughout the day, feet nailed together, and to rigor mortis having quickly set in there after his death, thus freezing his legs in that close-together position.  Jackson also claims that the arms seem ""held together"" by a cloth strip around the outside of the shroud.  But he exaggerates the closeness of the arms in his demonstration of their position.  Moreover, I must add that if any such strip of cloth had been wound around the shrouded body, thus tying it up, it would surely have pinched small folds in the shroud at several spots. We even see such mini-folds being formed during two simulations here, though they're ignored by the narrator and the participants.  Those folds would then have disrupted the image as it formed on the shroud.  Since the actual image on the Shroud of Turin is not so disrupted, but continuous, we can deduce that no such strip was bound around the shroud.  In sum, it seems we can actually refute that side strip and/or ""bound shroud"" hypothesis, or at least strongly doubt it.

7. Breault's final claim that a supernatural resurrection of Jesus occurred when the body was ""transformed into light, and gone,"" is likewise dubious.  The word ""light,"" for instance, seems questionable in this context.  Some impressive recent laboratory attempts to simulate the process that formed the image on the Shroud of Turin have involved the use of ultraviolet radiation - which is not visible.  So, if some kind of body radiation did actually form the image, it would not necessarily have been visible as ""light"" to any witnesses (had any witnesses been present, which, of course, they were not).  As for the claim that the body was then ""gone,"" a resurrection would surely serve no purpose unless Jesus showed himself as resurrected to his followers.  In the gospels he is depicted as doing just that, but those gospel accounts have been revealed by scholars to be literary fictions composed some decades after his crucifixion.  Moreover, if the purpose of a resurrection is to show yourself alive again to your followers, why not do so already inside the tomb?  Why not rise up supernaturally to a shining new life right then and there, greeting your followers immediately?  Why first perform a hocus-pocus act of disappearing, then later reappear somewhere else?  That seems very inconsistent with the purpose of a resurrection.  But that discrepancy of the missing body is perfectly consistent with a natural explanation for the empty tomb, an explanation involving the body of Jesus having been removed from the tomb by human hands (exactly whose is unimportant here).  In the years thereafter, his followers then added a few flowery ""resurrection appearances"" to their empty tomb accounts.

8. One last point might be added.  Several top Shroud of Turin experts believe that the phrase in John 20:8, ""he saw and believed,"" actually refers to the disciple seeing the ghostly image of Jesus on the shroud, which first inspired his belief in a resurrection of Jesus.  Russ Breault himself is on record elsewhere as sharing that belief, though he doesn't mention it in this program.  Now, that idea gets really interesting once we realize that many other top Shroud experts do not believe that the image was formed supernaturally (though the general Christian public does).  And so, if the image was instead formed by some spontaneous natural process, and if that image was indeed what first inspired the followers of Jesus with the notion of his resurrection, then, amazingly enough, we would have a perfectly natural and very understandable explanation for the origin of the Christian belief in a resurrection of Jesus.  That is a breathtaking prospect.",1276732800,6,11737,4.931262729124236

Predictably, they were quite excited and thirlled since it allowed them to see segments from the show the night before their scheduled visit.

I consider this to be my favorite Shroud documentary with ""In Pursuit of the Shroud"" in second place, although some of theories and evidence found in the latter have since been refuted.  Anyhow, I think one of the scenes from ""The Real Face of Jesus?"" which will stand out was Ray Downing's stunned reaction to seeing the considerable injuries and blood on the 3D recreation.

8466041,2,B005CXOGMS,"I'll pose the question in simple terms: Is the Shroud of Turin real or a fake? The answer is yes, it is a real medieval artifact possibly depicting Jesus Christ probably produced sometime in the 14th century. Is it an ancient shroud which wrapped the dead body of Jesus after his execution by crucifixion? The answer is, even if this was proved to be an ancient shroud, the likelihood that this linen wrapped Jesus' body is probably nil. But the shroud shows the image of a scourged and possibly crucified man; isn't this sufficient evidence this shows Jesus because this is the method by which he was executed? In the following paragraphs, I'll explain some of the problems with the documentary's intent to ""prove"" this was the shroud of Jesus.

First off, let's explore the first question: Is the shroud real or fake? Well, it depends upon the definition of ""fake"". I keep hearing in this documentary and others concerning this subject that the Shroud of Turin is either a ""fake"" or it's ""real"". A fake is an object which is meant to deceive people, implying the creators were trying to pull a ""fast one"". After everything I've heard of this artifact, there's nothing to tell me that someone in the Middle Ages decided they would create something to fool people for centuries into believing this was a contemporary image of Jesus Christ. The idea of creating fakes of something purporting to be something else is certainly not a new one, but it's not clear to me the intent was to create a deceiving object.

We have scant evidence for the Shroud's history dating before 1357 when it was first exhibited. This year is consistent with the carbon dating of 1988 which gave a time-frame for its creation as 1260 to 1390. More than likely, it was created probably circa 1300 to 1350 and eventually displayed. As the documentary describes, there is some evidence of a shroud of some kind with an image depicting Jesus dating back before the 14th century, but there's no definitive link between the Shroud of Turin and some of the stories concerning shrouds. As correctly pointed out in the documentary, the image of a face wasn't revealed until 1898 by photographer Secondo Pia. If this were a ""fake"" in the sense of trying to deceive, it wasn't a very good one since it took about 550 years for anyone to discover an image!

Could this be the shroud which wrapped Jesus' body? Wrapping a deceased person in a shroud was common practice in Ancient times, the Middle Ages and up to the present time in some traditions. If you consider the thousands upon thousands, perhaps millions of deceased people who were wrapped in shrouds and placed in ossuaries during the period 100 BCE to 100 CE (200 years), the likelihood this particular shroud is that of Jesus is astronomically minuscule. However, there are other problems, mainly a misunderstanding of crucifixion as the most brutal form of execution in ancient times.

Another interesting observation made by the players in the documentary is the scourging of the body. One of the commentators says the scourging is highly ""unusual"" because of its brutality. Actually, scourging was almost always a precursor to crucifixion in Roman practice. The condemned were scourged by flogging to subdue the poor victim into a helpless state of shock to prevent resistance. The brutality was intentional. Shortly thereafter, the condemned would carry the cross-beam to the place of execution, not the entire cross, while in a dazed state caused by scourging. So even in the remote chance this is possibly the image of a crucified man from ancient times, having been scourged would be expected. This wouldn't be unusual, although by modern standards, scourging followed by crucifixion is a terrifyingly horrible way to be executed.

The New Testament states Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus. Most scholars believe this scenario is probably apocryphal, i.e. did not happen. Why not, the gospel writers say it did? The trouble is, this was part of the point of crucifixion as execution. The humiliation and degradation of crucifixion was not only during the time of the execution itself which was painfully slow, but it was also humiliation after death. Bodies were left to rot on the uprights, often subject to the elements. As a way to deter would-be dissidents, particularly among slaves and lower classes, victims were denied burial. During extensive research, only one instance was ever found of a crucified body found in an ancient ossuary. The Joseph of Arimathea story was probably written to create a resurrection scenario. Sad to say, the episode of Jesus' body taken down from the cross and prepared for burial is probably a storytelling device rather than an historical event.

The main problem with this documentary is the filmmakers obviously desire to prove the shroud is the real image of Jesus. I don't think scholars believe the image is a ""fake"" just not a real image of Jesus from ancient times. Crucified people were almost never given the dignity of burial. In the remote possibly this is an image of a crucified man from ancient times, evidence he was scourged does not offer any further evidence that the image is that of Jesus. Thousands of people were crucified. Many more were buried in shrouds. According to this and other docs, there is blood on the shroud. Why not carbon date the blood? One thing it could be: a medieval image upon an ancient cloth. Is that not possible as well?",1494374400,,5475,4.856531049250536
