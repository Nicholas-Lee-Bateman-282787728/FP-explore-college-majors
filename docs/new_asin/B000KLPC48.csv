8158033,4,B000KLPC48,Unfortunately the picture shows some type of packaging and all I got was envelopes with the CD's. The information is very useful and helpful but I'm sure I could have bought this CD set used for much less instead of paying the Amazon premium.,1212364800,5,242,4.5227272727272725
8158034,4,B000KLPC48,"Mantak Chia comes across as a really helpful nice open person who is soft hearted toward people. So rather than create secretiveness and confussion he has authored this very easy to follow dvd set that serves as in introduction to some of the internal qigong practices. There is a lot of emphasis on the inner smile and that is healthful for everyone. The morning routine is pretty aweful if you have not done qigong before becuase there is a lot of stop and the routine does not flow. I was sad about that because it is the reason I bought the set. But, for that you can order Eight Pieces of Brocade dvd available at amazon by another instructor. Each dvd wastes a lot of minutes selling you on the resort he has created and on his other produts. Self promotion info is way too aggressive marketing for my tastes, but you can by pass that ad man stuff by having a dvd player that allows you to select from a menu on the dvd. The quality of the dvd is very good and the illustrations are so much fun. The animated inner organs just crack me up they are so delightful. Nice qigong info at an affordable price in a user friendly interface. Recommended. It would be 5 stars except for the morning routine dvd. You really need to buy his books, they are all very very good and the dvd's are a great compliment to them.",1188259200,22,1315,4.306451612903226
