8332289,3,B001P7ANIQ,"Patrick McManus, in a long-ago humor piece on black powder shooting, warned of the dangers of ""working up to sewer pipe too soon"".  This video tells you how to build a ""cannon"" out of sewer pipe, fortunately avoiding the black powder.

Fairly typical of Paladin Press material, ""B.A.D."" makes a bunch of claims that the contents of the video really do not match.  The ""Backyard Artillery Device"" described in the video is not so much artillery as a grown-up version of the tennis ball ""cannons"" every kid used to build (and hopefully, some still do).  Powered by a few drops of gasoline and oxygen from a welding tank, this gadget appears to do a pretty good job of throwing aluminum cans, tennis balls, and other ""projectiles"" some distance downrange.  And it appears to be sufficiently overbuilt that I would assume it's quite safe.  I wouldn't shoot one of these off anywhere near suburbia, but if you live out in the country and have no humorless neighbors....this could be the ultimate big boys' toy.

The creator does not appear to be terribly well-skilled in metalworking--he refers to having a certain amount of relatively simple work done by others (mind, if you're uncertain of your skills, this would most likely be a good idea anyway).  The instructions are laid out reasonably well, though once you see the ""cannon"" shown and described in detail you will most likely be able to figure out how to build your own without even watching the entire video.  It is worth sticking around for the end, however, as there is some footage of the gadget being fired which will give you a decent idea of what to expect, not to mention a few chuckles.

If you are looking for instructions on how to build a ""real"" cannon, look elsewhere.  But if you have the right sense of humor, like ""mostly harmless"" things that go boom, and are considering a project....you just might enjoy this one.  Just be careful and don't you go pointing one of these at anyone, ok?",1270598400,,1957,4.690058479532164
