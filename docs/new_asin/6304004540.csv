750538,1,6304004540,"I have seen all of James Clavell's literary works that have been turned into movies, ""Shogun,"" ""Tai-Pan,"" ""King Rat,"" and ""Noble House."" Out of all these, ""Tai-Pan"" was the worst. In fact, one person I spoke with doubted if it even made it to the silver screen and didn't go straight to video. If that did happen, I applaud the film makes for not wasting our time and cash on such an awful film. So much was cut out, key plot points such as the half-coins, and trying to condense such a work into 2 hours just is simply impossible. ""King Rat"" was excellent when it was done in 129 minutes, but ""Tai-Pan"" was much more complex and deserved at least a two part mini-series like ""Noble House,"" and ""Shogun"" got. Don't waste your money. If you really want to see this, then go to Blockbuster or your local library and rent it.",1019606400,,822,4.379084967320262
750539,1,6304004540,"I remember seeing the 12 or so hour miniseries of ""Shogun"" many years ago.  I loved it, read the book and loved it, so when I saw ""Tai Pan"", I figured it'd live up to the standard of Shogun.  I could not have been more wrong.  This is a meandering, confusing mess which seems to relish pointless violence against women.  I have never read the book, but I plan on doing so, simply so that I can figure out what the movie was attempting to convey.  There are very, very, very few movies I actually hate.  This undoubtedly was one of them.",1018742400,,536,4.205882352941177
750540,3,6304004540,"This movie is way too short for all of the grand characters, plot elements, and for that matter, historic spectacle that the film tries, but ultimately fails, to deliver.
A fictionalized account of the Opium Wars & the British acquisition of Hong-Kong in the 1840's, this adaptation of the James Clavell novel of the same name would have been much better as a one-week to two-week long mini-series.  Imagine ""Roots"", ""The Thorn Birds"" (which incidentally has Bryan Brown in it), or ""North & South"" condensed into two hours!  It just wouldn't work!  Check out the 2-hour version of Clavell's ""Shogun"" & compare it to the un-condensed mini-series.  You'll know what I'm talking about!  The result is characters who we should seriously care about....but don't, situations that we should be familiar with....but aren't.  If you're trying to take this movie seriously, the story can be downright confusing!
However, this movie is still worth watching, mostly because of the larger than life characterizations, the obviously politically-incorrect depictions of women & minorities (though I'm not a woman, I am of Chinese descent, so I can laugh at this whole thing!), & the incredibly bad dialogue!  Add to this, lots of sexual depravity depicted in the film's characters (including the protagonists, people we should root for!) & what have you got?  A movie that's so bad, it's actually fun to watch!
If you like bad movies like I do (and in this case, a big-budget historical spectacle with B-movie performances), this movie ranks right up there alongside the classic ""Cleopatra"" (1963, with Liz Taylor.)  The soundtrack music is great, the costumes & sets are lavish, & at least, it's not boring!  (There's lots of action & intrigue.)  Watch ""Tai-Pan""....for a good laugh!
(By the way, for you Hong-Kong kung-fu movie fans, yes, that is Chen Kwan Tai of Shaw Brothers/Iron Monkey fame, as the pirate named ""Wong"" who tries to rob Bryan Brown with a pistol, only to get slashed with a knife!  Hey, if he was the star, maybe he would have won!)",1013817600,3,2039,4.964705882352941
750541,1,6304004540,"Tai-Pan by James Clavell is a wonderfully masterful work of historic fiction that should have stayed that way; at least until someone with actual talent has a vision with this exciting tale.  I don't know who  thought that Daryl Duke could direct a movie, but whoever it was was sorely  wrong.  Every beautifully tense scene layed out by Clavell is mutilated  into the boringest and confusing piece of dog **** I have ever seen.  Do  your self a favor : forget this movie, read the book!",967766400,2,487,4.593023255813954
750542,3,6304004540,"This is James Clavell's wonderful story of the creation of Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the recording was a bitter disappointment. The first clue  was the fact that the movie is over two hours long and the amount of tape  use was 1/3 of the usual VCR tape. Sure enough, there was a note the the  movie was recorded in EP. Shame on Video Treasures and Anchor Bay  Distribution for a shoddy attempt at recording a wonderful novel. I was  wanting a copy to add to my collection of Nobel House and Shogun (both  Excellent Clavell stories) and was so disappointed to have such a poor  recording. That said, I must say that the movie itself does a fairly good  job of recreating the novel. It is probably worth the purchase price. I  just wish that they had made a better copy and not tried to cut costs to  the bone. Do yourself a favor - buy the book and the tape so that you can  immerse your self in the novel and use your imagination to create the  ""movie"" the way James Clavell intended.",966297600,2,984,4.316939890710382

750544,4,6304004540,"Tai-Pan is an excellent movie. The plot is great - the historical establishment of the British colony of Hong Kong, but from a very personal view. The characters were very well done, and Joan Chen was, as usual,  wonderful.  The movie is not an action-filled adventure, but rather it  moves along at a nice steady pace, and not too slow. I enjoyed this movie  very much, and recommend it for anyone who enjoys movies with an historical  base.",926467200,,442,4.615384615384615

750600,3,6304004540,"The best reason I can give to purchase this D.V.D. is that it is the only option available!!!  I am a big James Clavell fan & have read most all of his books, I do not rate the movie's made based on his book's, on the standard of having all of the information that was in the book that's not in the movie.  Rather I rate the movie's on how well they capture the essence of the book's.  I just got done purchasing "" Sho-Gun"", ""Tai- Pan"", "" Noble House"", & "" King Rat"" & I am very happy with every D.V.D. except "" Tai-Pan""!!!  I purchased these D.V.D.'s to replace my V.H.S. collection but I must keep my V.H.S. version of "" Tai-Pan"" because my V.H.S. has all 127 minutes of the movie & is equal if not superior in quality to the D.V.D. I just purchased that is missing much of the ending ...in fact my V.H.S. version ends with a modern day Hong Kong making it a great segue into "" Noble House""!!!  I am not a patient man so I purchased this D.V.D. despite all the reviews stating it was missing film footage & hoped the product had been updated since the reviews stating it was cut short & in poor quality!  That's on me!  I will have "" Tai-Pan"" still in my wish list waiting to see the restored version, rated R, & 127 Minutes in length!!!  It is obvious by the many reviews that even the full length version could have been longer...I agree.  I also feel that this in its full length version is a great movie & I don't understand why so much of the movie was lopped off!!!  It's not like they lopped off a minutes worth of pan out visual screen shot ...they lopped off very important dialogue, that gives the film a very important uplift emotionally for the viewer.  The way they butchered the ending makes the whole action adventure, & struggle's & strife of the main character empty & confusing with to many loose strings!!!  So I will hang on to my V.H.S. & hope that some future anniversary issue will be giving the proper treatment this great story deserves, complete with extras!!!",1503273600,4,1988,4.272

Several key scenes have been cut with a severe affect on the story continuity and completeness. The conflict between the two sons was hinted at and then excised altogether.  The final scene in the original movie which did so much to complete the story line and connect the series to the final chapter of the Struans in The Noble House was completely missing. The longer i write this piece, the more I can think of that is wrong with this POS. It's sad for me, being a great fan of the Clavell books.",1468800000,3,613,4.359649122807017

751215,1,6304004540,"Some films take so long to get made that by the time they finally reach the screen, the audience has completely lost interest or, in the case of Tai-Pan, quite possibly died of old age. MGM and director Michael Anderson had originally intended to bring James Clavell's epic saga to the screen in 1969 before their operating losses and a massive downturn in moviegoing that hit the whole industry hard led to the picture being postponed indefinitely. In the late 70s Steve McQueen signed up for the lead for a record $10m salary but when the producers were unable to come up with a second payment walked away with the $1m advance they'd paid him. In 1980 Roger Moore was lined up to replace him and even started growing a beard for the part only for that proposed version to sink without trace until, in the wake of Shogun's success, Dino De Laurentiis finally came up with a script that would satisfy the Chinese authorities (but no-one else) and made it with an almost heroically miscast Bryan Brown and Joan Chen in 1986. He shouldn't have bothered: it's awful. Not just ordinary awful but really irredeemably bloody awful, a real pig's ear of a picture that could and should have been much better, especially for an epic saga about the founding of Hong Kong and the trading dynasty that Clavell would return to in Noble House that's just crying out for the kind of unashamedly old fashioned epic screen treatment that the film's much more impressive poster seemed to promise. It's no surprise this unseaworthy vessel was such a massive flop (limping to only $4m on a $25m budget in the US) that it went straight to video in most countries and barely shifted any copies there either.

The constant censorship changes the Chinese government insisted on to allow filming (it was the first US picture to shoot there) and the nightmarish amount of red tape during the shoot didn't help, nor did heavy pre-release cutting (De Laurentiis also prepared a longer TV miniseries version that never seems to have seen the light of day), but John Briley and Stanley Mann's script is such a dreary and truncated mess that makes so little sense to anyone who hasn't read the novel that it's no great surprise that veteran TV director Daryl Duke couldn't inject any life into it. There's no excuse for the truly awful performances, though, with both Bryan Brown and Joan Chen sporting atrocious Groundskeeper Willie Scottish accents that make it impossible to keep a straight face when our hero utters lines like ""Tha Emparah ov Chynner haz nivva scene tha guns ov a Britisshhh man o'wurr!"" or ""Whun yew mekke dung ye'll whype yer ahhhssse wiv paypah"" while her romantic scenes, delivered in the pidgin-Scottish learned from her lover, become pure comedy. Even the Russian ambassador's accent hails not from Georgia, Russia, but Georgia, USA for some bizarre reason, making you wonder if the whole thing is a failed sendup.

The first quarter of an hour or so isn't too bad, but it doesn't take long for the colony of Hong Kong to be established and from then on it's just tiresome business rivalry between Brown and John Stanton's hammy mellerdrammer villain with the usual romantic complications as their children fall in love, none of which plays remotely convincingly or above the level of a cheap daytime soap opera. Even the climax during a typhoon that sees the two antagonists finally having their much-delayed fight to the death doesn't liven things up so flatly are the proceedings staged: you just get the feeling that everyone just wants to get through it all as quickly as they can so they can go home and forget about it, which at least puts them on the same plain as the audience.

Amazingly even the great Jack Cardiff's scope photography (cropped to fullframe on the PAL DVD releases) doesn't add much color or grandeur to proceedings after the opening sequences in China, with much of the film looking like a flat TV show that someone accidentally shot in widescreen, so Maurice Jarre's superb score is doubly welcome. It's something of a tradition that really bad films often have exceptionally good scores, and this is no exception, with Jarre seemingly scoring a much grander and more spectacular film that exists only in his head, even coming up with a gorgeous, unashamedly romantic and sweeping love theme that's one of the finest things he ever wrote. If only the film were worthy of it...

While PAL releases are poor fullframe transfers taken from old video masters, the US NTSC DVD from 20th Century Fox has a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer but no extras.",1333065600,19,4573,4.784810126582278

I am fascinated by the character Dirk Struan. I love his replies and reactions to anything that comes his way.  I loved May May's character, and got a kick out of her accent and replies to Struan. After thinking about his and May May's death, and when Culum takes over at the end, it likens to the death of Christ and then the beginning of Christianity in a way.  Because he had to leave it all to his heir, and seems like he was preparing for that.  He reconciled with his fate, and called it ""joss"".

Bryan Brown was fantastic, and so was Joan Chen.  I love the movie and the book.  It is a must read.  You cannot help to get emotionally involved.  I became curious about the author, James Clavell as soon as I got into the books.  I asked how does such a man know this wisdom about life and man?  How did he reconcile all this knowledge to such a ""fantastical"" form.  He does say in the beginning of his novel Gai Jin:  This novel is for you, whoever you are with deep appreciation--- for without you, the writer part of me would not exist...

In fact, even if the storyline is forced by the two-hour format to outrageously condense the novel's storyline, the characters are captured with extreme fidelity.  The overall result is a film that is good, solid entertainment if perhaps not a masterpiece.

Changes to the novel's storyline make this hard to follow, and all the condensing needed to reduce a major novel to under two hours of film left out much of the meat of the story.  Would be have been far better made into a mini-series, a la another Clavell novel, 'Shogun.'

Brian Brown did an excellent job breathing life into the title character, despite the limitations of the script.  His performance is one of the few bright spots of the film.

Bottom line, the film could have been much better.  But even with the myriad flaws, I still enjoyed watching this Clavell treasure come alive.",1215907200,2,751,4.559701492537314

Just as the book was not as easy to read, due to the heavy Scottish dialect in which it speaks, this movie seems more difficult to follow as well. There seems to be a rush to introduce the characters, who parts don't 'flesh out'. A lot of the book seems to be lost, as little explanation is given to some of the characters more bizarre behavior.

I did enjoy this movie, because I read the book first and could mentally fill in the gaps in the characters' stories. However, this movie does not compare well to the other books and their movie counterparts in this oriental series by the great writer, James Clavell.

As such, it necessarily leaves out a great deal of the detail and many of the sub-plots contained in the excellent novel.  This was unavoidable because the novel is intricate and complex.  I am not sure that even a mini-series would have successfully encompassed the scope of the novel.

With that caveat, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.  The acting is generally quite good, and the story, while truncated, is coherent and interesting.  This is the story of the birth of Hong Kong as an improbable British colony and outpost on Chinese soil.  It is further the story of the rivalry between two great British trading houses: Noble House, and Brock & Sons.  The latter conflict, which is more or less a bitter clan feud between two Scottish families, is well-told and interesting, and not too far off-track from the story told in the novel.

You can tell there had to be more because the movie jumped from place to place without much flow.  I would really like to see a version that I believe was originally a mini series.  I'm pretty sure I give it a 5 star rating then.  It had so much going for it much like Shogun.  I hope someone decides to restore the original as part of a set from Shogun to King Rat.

As NEWSWEEK dubbed it in its movie section, November 17, 1986, (the film had previously released on October 3rd, 1986), ""Clavell's shredded tapestry"".

Why would anyone want to reduce this sprawling, epic 590 page novel down to only a two hour's length film???  Well, somewhat easy to figure, it was released to the general public in movie theatres by the De Laurentis Entertainment Group not to cable as were the other two epic novels, SHOGUN and NOBLE HOUSE. Most audiences, therefore, cannot, would not, want to set through several hours of viewing in a movie theatre.

This magnificent epic novel of Hong Kong was only equaled or bettered by NOBLE HOUSE, a follow up book which carried the TAI-PAN story forward to a contemporary setting and ending.  With the action taking place on both land and sea, TAI-PAN is a dazzling read, but limited in span as only a couple hour motion picture. Main problem: it is very much abridged, not as Clavell wrote it, and it leaves out much of the story, thereby becoming disjointed in its limited telling.

So it's a bit of good and bad: Good that the DVD is now available, but less 'good' because of its brevity.  It is a film, however, still worth watching, and for those few who haven't read the book, probably none of this will matter much!

Bryan Brown was terrible as Dirk Straun (and I don't mean just the accent), can anyone who read the book picture Kyra Sedgwick as ""Hag"" Straun (not even close), Janine Turner is wasted as Shevaun (did she say three sentences in the whole movie?), and Captain Orlov is straight out of comic book central casting, just to name a few atrocities!

The telling of the story is incomprehensible, the viewer never picking up -- let alone understanding -- the interplay between the characters or the motivation behind their actions (not even close).  As with other Clavell novels, there is just too much going on behind the scenes to capture it all in a 120 minute movie.  I would love to see the story told as Tolkien's Lord of Rings trilogy was told, three - three hour movies.  Maybe someone can tempt Peter Jackson into tackling this as one of his major undertakings.

751502,3,6304004540,"Admittedly, this is much less of a movie than Tai-Pan is of a book. But the book is a giant among books, and the show is still a good show. Those who have read the book, rather than savaging it for its divergence from the book (which, in any case, would require a mini-series to do its layering and complexity justice, not a 2-hour show) should treat it as a kind of visual accompaniment to the story - good casting, good handling of some powerful scenes. Alright, they were much more powerful in the book, but it's not all the time that readers of a splendid book get the opportunity to see a capable visual incarnation that does justice to the characters, at least, if not to the plot. Maybe if the show had been titled ""Selected Scenes from Tai-Pan"" rather than ""Tai-Pan"" it would have been better received by purists.
What I'm trying to say is it did treat the subject material well, although obviously it couldn't pack everything which makes us love the book into just two hours. In an adaptation of a book, when you can recognise each character instantly before the character's name is mentioned it's always a good sign - where there's good casting, it's a sign that it's a sensitive adaptation, and this was the case with Tai-Pan. I thought Bryan Brown was very good as Dirk Struan; I'm not Scottish, so I couldn't tell that his accent was as fake as many others seem to think it.
I can see how those who haven't read the book would find it laughable, though, because due to the compression of the plot you don't really get to know the characters and understand their motivations from scratch. Some of Clavell's magnificent dialogue from the book might sound weird in the show, or lacking in punch, for those without a prior acquaintance of the book, because of this lack of emotional set-up. That's why I think it's best for those who have read the book, who already know the characters and can watch them fully-fledged, so to speak, as the show doesn't spend time introducing the audience to the characters.
Perhaps the reason that fans of James Clavell's books are so vociferous in their criticism of this show, sometimes, is because they are acclimatised to splendid, detailed and heartfelt adaptations of so many of his other books - the Shogun mini-series, the Noble House mini-series and the King Rat film. Why, Clavell fans are really so fortunate already when it comes to screen adaptations! :) If we lowered our expectations a little, we'd see that Tai-Pan, too, is not that bad a treatment of the book at all!",1083888000,45,2527,4.605321507760532
751503,2,6304004540,"Having read the book, I wanted to see the movie no matter how bad it was.  It was interesting to watch, but not because the story was captivating... The story was a little dry after reading the excellent book with all of its characters, scenes, plots and sub-plots.
I enjoyed watching to see what the writers would include and exclude.  How much of the book can you chop away and still get the general story across?  Well, quite a bit!  They butchered the daylights out of the story.  And, in order to make things work, they would often have the same events take place, but in a different sequence and by different people.
Because they chopped so much out, including sub-plots and complex character motivations, scenes that had a lot of internal conflict in the book were very shallow and meaningless in the movie.  Where Clavell would bring several sub-plots to a head in a ""scene"" of the book, the movie would only bring the one sub-plot that survived the cut.  It would then add something that wasn't in the book to make the scene more interesting... and to justify it's existence.  So it's worse than an abridged version of the book.  If you saw the movie first, you probably wondered what all the fuss was about the book.
I would LOVE to see a mini-series like Shogun...  Then we could see more and better developed characters, more of the sub-plots, more of the actual story!",1055462400,6,1381,4.5772357723577235
