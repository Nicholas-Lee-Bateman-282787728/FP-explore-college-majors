7321185,3,B0112HPSM4,"The film builds up the background with newspaper clippings during the opening. Downers Grove, a small town in Illinois, built its high school on sacred Indian ground and we know that is never good. Every year one senior dies before graduation. Curse or BS? The film centers on senior Chrissy  (Bella Heathcote) who believes she is the next one. She has been having strange dreams and feelings. Her mom (Helen Slater) leaves for a week with her boyfriend, leaving Chrissie and her brother David (Martin Spanjers) home alone with less than a week to go.

Chrissy manages to make a friend with Bobby (Lucas Till) a ""grease monkey"" and enemies with Chuck, a rival school quarterback (Kevin Zegers). Chrissy, feeling she is cursed, decides if she is going to go, she is going to do it ""walking tall."" It was then capped by a  bad ""B"" ending for a half decent film.

7321187,5,B0112HPSM4,"Good movie. What do these other reviewers expect?  No, it's not the ""Crying Game"" or some other hipster pretentious ""masterpiece"" like that... BUT most people who buy/rent this standard scary movie are not looking for an Academy Award review of every inch of the story line, cast, costume, directors, etc.  Most people like me just want to watch an effective entertaining scary movie.  And this is it.

I rented it on instant video, despite the terrible reviews... And I was shocked (pleasantly surprised) that this is actually a good movie... Way better than most of the scary movies I rent on here.

The story is good, moves right along pretty fast. The actors are just fine and effective. They draw you in, so you actually care what happens to the characters. I found myself ticked at some, and rooting for others.  And that never happens. I find a lot of movies these days to be just artsy-fartsy boring stuff that the elitist guild churns out so they can pat each other on the back... Or advance some political agenda.

So I found it refreshing and enjoyable to just watch a good old fashioned scary/thriller movie.  Very entertaining.  Good movie.  I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of entertainment.

(But if you are a snooty type who just likes to write reviews to hear yourself talk about how smart you are in every aspect of the movie industry, then just skip this one and save us all the trouble of having to wade through your uppity condescending 1 star ""I'm-an-intellectual"" reviews, when we're just looking for decent movie to watch.)

This is a good movie. Worth watching for most.",1441411200,5,1609,4.707142857142857
7321188,4,B0112HPSM4,"Great acting. Most of the horror movies on here seriously lack acting skills. This one doesn't. It's a love story gone wrong. It doesn't have a surprise ending, you see it coming, but it doesn't make it less enjoyable. Good looking cast, too.",1441324800,2,242,4.651162790697675
7321189,1,B0112HPSM4,"Pretty terrible teen soap opera/stalker drama masquerading as a horror movie to make it more commercial and draw in unsuspecting audiences.  The basic story concerns a teen girl who is nearly raped at a party, takes out the eye of her attacker who is a star college quarterback counting on being drafted--which obviously isn't going to happen now that he has one eye.  He stalks the girl, convinced they are in love and attacks her friends but the police won't do anything because his dad is an ex-cop.  It eventually culminates in a lot of violence at an ill-advised party at the stalked girl's house where one-eyed rape boy and his buddies drop buy for some payback despite the abundance of witnesses.

To get one thing out of the way--I live near Downer's Grove, Illinois--it looks nothing like the town in the movie (which was filmed in California).  There's also no curse that I've ever heard of so it might have been a better idea to pick a fictional location rather than a real one that bears no resemblance to what is in the film.

The Curse of Downer's Grove alternates between being ridiculous but apparently sincere and ludicrously overwrought.  Director Derick Martini's previous film was the ill-fated Chloe Grace Moretz vehicle Hick which was terrible but in much more entertaining ways.  One thing both films share, though, is a complete lack of authenticity that make the movies feel like they take place in some sort of alternate universe.  There's virtually nothing in The Curse of Downer's Grove that feels like real human behavior--a girl who is nearly raped and takes out someone's eye is likely going to the police if only to get her version of events on the record before his because a star quarterback who is assaulted, loses an eye and his future and has an ex-cop dad is probably going to go to the police--which also never happens.  In fact, even when the police do eventually get involved they never show the slightest interest in the attempted rape or the subsequent assault or why the young man accused of stalking has a bandage completely covering one of his eyes.

The Curse of Downer's Grove is a dud that isn't even honest about what it is--which is not a horror film.  One time enfant terrible Brett Easton Ellis (American Psycho) co-wrote the script and co-produced the movie, although what his exact contribution to this stinker was is anyone's guess but if this doesn't represent a career low even after The Canyons then I need to start actively avoiding anything with his name on it.",1441324800,,2522,4.745995423340961
7321190,3,B0112HPSM4,"Considering I only watched this for Kevin Zegers, thats basically all I got. Not disappointed, not impressed. But hey, Kevin Zegers.",1440374400,,132,5.333333333333333
7321191,2,B0112HPSM4,"Based on the book Downers Grove by Michael Hornburg, a film was announced in 2011 with names like Hayden Panettiere, Nikki Reed and Rebecca De Mornay attached to it, but sometime during the development process they all just left. After watching the movie myself it's clear why they did. Advertised as a horror pic, the film is actually better suited as a thriller on the Lifetime channel, because there's most certainly no horror elements in here, despite how it may seem.

The story revolves around a young girl named Chrissie, who's a senior at the local high school. Normally nearing the end of high school is a good thing, but not in a town where there's an apparent curse that sends one random senior to their death. Whether it's a suicide, a freak accident, or a murder, if the past several years is any indication, someone's gonna die. And Chrissie suspects it may be her.

That's generally what the official premise is, but the actual story is focused around Chrissie going to a party where she claws the eye out of her potential rapist and narrowly escapes with her life. The rest of the film is essentially just the one-eyed dude stalking and threatening Chrissie and the people around her until the last 20 minutes, where it suddenly turns into a home invasion flick out of nowhere.

Aside from the terrible plot hole-ridden script there are several other things wrong with this movie, like for instance all the guys look like they're pushing 30, especially the little brother who's supposed to be 15 (*rolls eyes*). And the editing is just horrendous, specifically when we get these random convoluted dream sequences that seem completely out of place. Then there are scenes with monotone inner monologue from the female lead that was like something out of a Twilight movie.

It's almost as if the studio wanted the flick to be one thing, while the director (and probably writers) wanted it to be another. This is most prevalent in scenes with violence, especially towards the end because it goes from a teen angst mystery to a bloody home invasion thriller. And not to mention there are just random scenes thrown in to fill the running time, like the antagonist leaving a dozen mutilated dogs on the front yard of the lead--WTF! For what reason!?? And where did he get all those damn dogs!? Who knows! Because after the lead chick screams and yells to call the cops it transitions to the next scene and we don't hear anything about it again.

Negative aside, the production values were decent and the acting was above average, except when it came to the choreography--that stuff was hilariously bad. The movie kept my interest for the most part and I dug the violence towards the end, despite how out of place it seemed.

Overall The Curse of Downers Grove is a Lifetime thriller masquerading as a horror film. It simply doesn't know what it wants to be and next to its terrible script, that's its biggest flaw. Unless you often watch Lifetime channel originals, I'd recommend skipping this mess.",1440288000,8,3008,4.752873563218391

7321215,5,B0112HPSM4,"If you go into it expecting it to be horror in the same sense as American Psycho, you will either be pleased or disappointed, depending on what you thought made American Psycho part of the horror genre. If you think American Psycho is a horror movie because it involves a lot of gore and death, The Curse of Downer's Grove won't quite fit the bill. If you focus on the characters' existential dread and their motivations, you might find this to be comparable. In fiction, I think we create monsters that are over the top in part because we want to overshadow what humans are capable of, even (or especially) people who go out of their ways to seem respectable. For me, The Curse of Downer's Grove was basically a morality tale about drugs and entitlement, and the protagonist's story line embodies the negative consequences of both. The backstory about her father makes me think of Ree from Winter's Bone, and a central problem for her is the way that people think they're entitled to her time and affection because of how they feel about her.",1472342400,2,1043,4.612903225806452

7321217,3,B0112HPSM4,"Ummmmm...Eh
It's not a terrible movie. I know that isn't a complement, but the whole underlying theme of, ""The Curse of Downers Grove"" is the curse obviously.
So one would think that whoever was in charge of casting, the director, or someone should have known that American Indians, especially those who lived anywhere in the continental United States.... well, they don't have facial hair like the hispanic, or whatever guy they chose to play the warrior with the spear, and red face paint.

They did put the ""built on an Indian burial ground"" thing, but other than that it was just a typical teen scare flick that was so-so and had the feel of a LMN movie or something.",1459296000,2,499,4.319148936170213
7321222,4,B0112HPSM4,"This was a whole lot better than I thought it would be. Not very scary in the traditional horror sense, but definitely had some tense moments. If you have never seen a Bret Easton Ellis movie, this might not be the best place to start. The description tries to sell this movie by saying ""from the same guy who wrote American Psycho!"" However, this is more like Ellis' other work like Less than Zero, Lunar Park, or Rules of Attraction, though not as good as those. What I'm trying to say is that though this movie has violence in it, it is not constant like American Psycho, instead it comes in spurts and the story itself plops the viewer right in the middle of a situation and pulls you before you really understand too much. I liked this flick, I would recommend it to fans of Bret Easton Ellis though not fans that are only familiar with American Psycho, and I don't regret the money spent to rent this movie.",1459123200,4,913,4.376470588235295

7321233,1,B0112HPSM4,"I should have considered that this was written by the American Psycho-author, then I would have expected immoral violence instead of the atmospheric mystery thriller the movie was advertised as. This movie is about a girl who is giving self-defense a bad name. We all agree/should agree that rape/trying to rape s.o. is a disgusting thing, but the main character in this situaton had about 100 alternative options but to claw the attacker's eye out and later shooting a lot of people - this movie has no mystery but a psychopathic girl maiming and killing her way through a silly, awful story and (spoiler alert) I am sorry to say this but I was relieved that she dies in the end after all the horrible excessive things she did and not even feeling sorry about it, and by the way making it harder for all victims who have to use (an adaptive dose of) self-defense.",1444953600,,864,4.580645161290323

8723446,3,B0112HPSM4,"First of all, i was disappointed because I expected this to be a horror movie. From the trailer, I thought it would be more about the curse and why or how it happened. That wasn't the case.
 The movie is about a girl who goes to a party and is almost raped by the local football hero. She fights him off by gouging out his eye, thus ruining his potential career. He decides to get revenge on her for what SHE did. Never gave a thought to what HE did. In fact, he thought he did no wrong.
 The worst part was, most everyone in town sided with him! Including the police! As a woman, I was in outraged awe at the blatant sexist trope, that this POS was the VICTIM!
 To make matters worse, the girl believed it, too! She spent most of the movie horrified that SHE""D done something wrong. Like the jerk's football career was more important than her nearly being raped!
 Okay, now that the rant's out of the way, on the other hand, there were three guys in this movie who were, for want of a better word, obsessed with this girl to varying degrees. They were utterly willing to kill and/or die for her. Why? I didn't see anything special or remarkable about her. Okay, she was pretty. But millions of girls are pretty. She had a bland, superficial personality, and nothing else going for her. I found it hard to believe she could incite this level of obsession from so many.
 If you're into YA over dramatic thrillers, you might like it. But I was disappointed that the movie wasn't actually about the curse.",1534118400,,1502,4.330960854092527
8723447,3,B0112HPSM4,"Chrissie and Tracy are graduating from Downers Grove High School. The school was built on sacred Native American ground and the local urban legend is that a senior class member dies each year before graduation as a result of the Indian curse. This is as far as that line of thought goes. The film is mostly about the conflict between Chrissie, her brother and friends versus some football players from a neighboring town. I'm not even sure it is a ""Horror Movie."" It is more of a ""revenge thriller.""

It is targeted at young adults and I'm sure I'd have liked it more if I were that age. Although it is well-paced, one really must suspend a lot of disbelief. The adults in town appear to have gone extinct. None of the teens ever use a telephone to call for help. And, there is a shot of the town water tower surrounded by foothills with a mountain range in the distance. There are no foothills in Illinois, although we do have mountains in the distance.
