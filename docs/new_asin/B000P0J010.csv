2807124,5,B000P0J010,"I used to just watch a movie and ride my exercise bike.  The better the action the more energized I would get.  This DVD made me realize that I could work so much harder and feel great about it.  It is great how you can pick the type of workout you want (hills, flats, intervals, etc.) or combine them all.  She poses situations that you can visualize to get your competitive juices going.  I even use it with my elliptical trainer for motivation.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good workout.",1214784000,4,508,4.351063829787234
2807125,4,B000P0J010,"This was a decent video. None of the spinning videos really measure up to my expectations but I do like the fact that this can be done with or with out a lot of talking.

2807126,5,B000P0J010,"I am a more advanced spinner, so it is hard to find dvd's that push me hard enough & keep me motivated. Boy, did this one do the trick. It is longer than most I have - it is 70 minutes if you do all the segments. Most of the other dvd's I have are only 30-40 minutes including warm-up & cool down. So it definitely pushes me to the limit more than the others. I also like the instructor. She is less canned and doesnt act so much like she is a robot reading a teleprompter. She has lots of energy & personality. I also like that the video occasionally simulates an actual outdoor ride. Like climbing a hill to catch a group of riders up ahead. Also a dog chasing you as a motivation to sprint. Anyway who cycles outdoors knows all too well the reality of dog chases. So I found this amusing. Great dvd - definitely worth getting!",1210809600,93,829,4.1234567901234565

The ability to select all or portions of this video, and to have words and music or only music, are all appreciated since they can be customized to my moods and available time.

Cool down exercises are just perfect --- sensible and productive.  At the first viewing, I actually got a little teary during the cool down part, since I'd successfully completed the routine, and the relief and stretching and beautiful music were just so rewarding!

Intense, fun, not too short. I have been Spinning for over 1 year now and have done classes in a club.  On the days I can't get to the club, I workout at home.

You can't do that with this video and get a good workout.  However, since the video is an hour long I do this video once a week to challenge myself.

Not only is the content poor, but there is nothing regarding proper form and safety. In several cases, the instructors body position wrong.

2807144,3,B000P0J010,"I am an amateur triathlete who performs cycling events in the middle of my age/gender division. I typically use Coach Troy's Spinervals workouts and bought Mindy's DVD seeking variety in the personality and approach of the cycling coach.

I cycle hard indoors Nov through Feb and find that Mindy's workout fits nicely with triathlon training DVDs about once every 10 days. I use it as an effort of 8 on a maximum of 10 (Coach Troy's levels). I get into the anaerobic zone about 5 or 6 times during this workout, usually for 1 or 2 minutes. The rest of the workout is mid to high aerobic, with low aerobic rest intervals.

Mindy creates scenarios to help motivate the various intensity levels. For example, she may ask you to pass and hold a lead against an elite cyclist. The scene cuts to a brief episode of passing a road biker, who cranks it up competitively.

I like that Mindy demonstrates good cycling stretches after the cool down. Other DVDs neglect stretching and I find my recovery and flexibility is much better if I follow her lead.

The music is lame. Coach Troy's Spinervals workouts usually include a menu option to cut out the prerecorded music track but preserve the coaching instructions. Mindy's production team somehow thought the reverse would be preferable, including an option to cut out the instructions but preserve the lame music. This workout could really blast if I was able to listen to some of my own collection of uptempo jams.

I am generally satisfied. The workout is a unique 60 min challenge..",1292889600,21,1528,4.7293233082706765

2807153,3,B000P0J010,"The backdrop is a beautiful scene on the ocean. The instructor gives pretty good tips and how-to's. She likes to say 'Yes?' Instead of OK. She is a wee bit cheesy but maybe that's a part of being a spinning instructor. The music is Casio-style with a weak beat. Don't buy the video for the music. She uses a few real life scenarios with footage to give you a visual and it's helpful but these scenes are only shown for a few seconds here and there. I work out to this video because I can't force myself to spin in the higher intensity ranges on my own - need to be pushed. It would be a perk if the music were akin to what you would get in a spinning class.
She is good at getting you to work hard. I don'the regret buying this video. Spinning videos are kinda at the caliber of what workout videos were in the 90's. The bar just isn't quite that high but hopefully in a few years we'll see some really good spinning videos out there for those of us who hate to wait in line reserve a spot on a bike at the gym.",1261612800,3,1011,4.00990099009901
2807154,3,B000P0J010,"If you have ever taken a spin class at your gym you are probably used to the loud music that 'gets you in the zone'.  If this is what motivates you...this is not the dvd for you.  This dvd is ok for most part, but I personally like the music to motivate the cadence not a imagining a dog is chasing you.

2807155,3,B000P0J010,"This is my first cycling video, and it is nothing special.  The instructor tries hard to be motivating, and the workout itself can be tailored for beginners to advanced.  The video can work with any model spin cycle, but the instructor leaves it up to the user to decide when and how much resistance to add/decrease.  On my highly motivated days I would strive to keep up with her, and on bad days I would take it easy and go at my own pace.  More often I would find myself unable to get motivated to push harder, and the video did not help me to advance to the next level.  I eventually quit using the video and starting following a workout printed from the Lemond website.",1253145600,2,674,4.317460317460317
2807156,5,B000P0J010,"I read all the reviews before buying this dvd and I was a little worried that I would not get a really good workout.  I was worried for nothing!  This is a great workout and it's impossible not to work up a good sweat if you put effort into it and know where the resistance knob is on your bike.  As an exercise instructor myself, I know that people have likes and dislikes when it comes to instructor personality.  I think Mindy is trying to make this dvd fun by including the videos of the people you are trying to pass and the dog that chases you.  A little diversion isn't a bad thing even if it is a little hokey.  Focus on the workout and you will get a good one.",1249344000,,669,4.03030303030303

2807158,2,B000P0J010,This product was boring.  I did it once and now it is sitting in my video basket collecting dust.  The delivery service was good though!,1239667200,,136,4.4
2807159,5,B000P0J010,"I purchased (1) Cycle Reebok: Foundations and Interval Training with Robert Sherman, (2) Mindy Mylrea's Super Cycle: The Best Ride in Town and (3) Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVD #12 Oregon at the same time. I have been very happy with the first two, and plan on selling the Oregon DVD shortly.

Robert Sherman's DVD is very focused on building strength and skill while maintaining control. He does have the intense, almost cheesy persona that others wrote about, but I find that I really like that. It helps me stay in his game, like he's always trying to hang on to you mentally. Robert talks a lot about staying internally focused, and makes it all about you and your experience. It's meditative in a way - he asks you to close your eyes, envision your body, stuff like that. My maximum heart rate is around 180, and with his workouts, I generally find myself in the 155-165 range, reaching 175 during the last set. He gives regular opportunities to recover and stretch.

Mindy Mylrea takes a different approach. Instead of the internal focus, she is very external - you are trying to catch up with a friend, pass a professional cycler and then run from a big dog. She keeps my heart range in the 165-175, with an occasion 180+. She keeps you running for longer intervals, and gives less recovery overall. She is very upbeat and smiley. I find both Mindy and Robert offer a likeable, valuable workout. Neither has great music, but I don't find myself noticing that very much.

Finally, I don't care much for the Oregon DVD. The music is classic and instrumental, though you could mute that and listen to your own stuff. The ride is pretty, but there's no real sense of hill climbing or speed. You completely have to make it up yourself. Also, sometimes you are sort of going uphill and then you switch to a different part of the road with no clear transition. I would rather spend my time watching DVD's of TV series I like than watch this while cycling.",1239321600,12,1951,4.584527220630372
2807160,1,B000P0J010,"After reading the reviews, I purchased this DVD in hopes that I can take it with me on business trips or use at my gym when I miss a spinning class.  But no way.  This is for beginners.  Below beginners.  I didn't even sweat and I pushed it.  Also the soundtrack/music during the workout is bad.  I don't even think it should be called music.  I find that music is an important factor in any workout and I just wanted to mute this workout.  So basically I get a better workout using the spinning techniques I've learned in classes and using my music.  It may be great for those beginners that have a nice staionary bike at home but for us spinning addicts PLEASE don't waste your money.",1236729600,3,686,4.296875
2807161,1,B000P0J010,"The ""best ride in town"" consists of an instructor (frequently out of breath) on a stationary bike set on a cliff over the ocean who tells you
to ""imagine"" that you are riding around town.  There are occasional momentary shots (just a few seconds long) of some scenes.  These are low res ... home video quality if that.  I have some cycling dvd's that are bike scenery, usually with other riders (what you would see if you were cycling that area).  Some have an instructor on an audio track to keep you motivated.  I have some ""spinning"" classes where an instructor guides you through a workout ... he/she is leading a class on spin bikes or trainers, but usually not riding himself.
I simply could not believe that someone would pass this off....if I can
""imagine"" a ride around town, what do I need a dvd for?",1235520000,2,810,4.482993197278912
2807162,5,B000P0J010,"I've been spinning in a studio for 10 plus years but recently gave up gym membership and bought a spinning bike for home use. This is the first DVD I purchased as a means of increasing my workout intensity. Boy did it ever. I've been using it at least 2x/week for 6 weeks now and have found myself working much harder (per my heart rate monitor) than before I was using it and much more on par with spinning classes.

The DVD is well segmented to give you the opportunity to create your own workout every time: a 6 minute warm up, a hill section of 3 hills (6min, 7min, 8min with appropriate recoveries), intervals (about 6 minutes), flat (about 5 min w/ sprints) and a final hill. I've done the full session once and it is intense (60 min)! Even slicing and dicing for my own 40 minute workout leaves me feeling well exercised and 'good' tired.

Mindy is friendly and instructional - not overly cheerleaderish or too basic in her explanations. Visually, the dvd doesn't get too boring - it's largely Mindy in a park overlooking the California Coast, but there are some nice cut aways to help you visualize the hill scenarios she describes in that part of the video. In general she uses enough but not too many visualization techniques to help you get through some of the longer parts of the video.

There are a few things I wish were different. In terms of usability, some instruction/guidance on heart rates in conjuction w/ her 4 zone approach (she uses a four zone system based on how you're feeling/level of effort)would be nice. Would also like her to encourage more water breaks - I don't think she drinks water once during the video.

Overall, a new workout favorite - highly recommend. And while I wrote this from an advanced spinner perspective, my sense is that this is simple enough and motivating enough for newer riders as well.",1235433600,11,1842,4.555891238670695
2807163,5,B000P0J010,"This workout is a lot of fun, and it's definitely challenging!  Mindy has a fun personality, and she keeps you working hard during the workout.  Some workouts are boring and make you watch the clock the entire time, but this is not one of them.

There are three segments in this workout: a hill segment (with three increasingly longer and more challenging hills), an interval segment, and a steady state/flat segment.  If you do all three segments and the warm-up and cool down, it comes to about 70 minutes total.  The cool down stretching is also excellent; she really takes the time to stretch out your legs and upper body.

I also liked how the first hill segment cut into clips of a dog chasing you and other cyclists that you are trying to catch up with; it was a fun way to break up the otherwise beautiful scenery.

This is also a serious calorie-torcher.  I'm about 5'4"" and weigh 115 pounds, and my HRM said I burned about 570 calories by doing the whole workout.  I definitely recommend this DVD!",1231891200,,1007,4.519337016574585
