8686358,4,B00P47Z72U,"On Christmas Eve, the prime ministers daughter (Christina Bellavia) is kidnapped, along with some of her friends. They are taken to an underground parking/office complex which is made secured. A team of SAS go into the facility to confront the bad guys, who are every bit as proficient as them. Tom Benedict Knight leads the SAS group. However the reason to watch the film is the dark comedy of sociopath Simon Phillips who holds people hostage, gives them hope, then a bullet.

There are grindhouse moments in the film with few slow scenes. The downfall of the film is the reason for the whole operation and the generic class warfare speeches spewed by Phillips toward the end.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars on the strength of Phillips' performance.",1414886400,,776,4.827067669172933
