A friend recommended this, so I watched the entire movie, but I would suggest giving this one a pass unless you are diehard fans of the stars and want to see them in their early films.",1481241600,,249,4.659090909090909

8526269,2,B0089BSM3E,"My father always talked about this hysterical turn Monty Woolley did as Santa, but couldn't remember anything about the film. I finally found the film after years of searching and was thrilled...until I watched it. The Santa bit isn't that funny, happens in the first five minutes, and the rest of the film, despite the cast? Eesh!",1432857600,3,331,4.824561403508772
