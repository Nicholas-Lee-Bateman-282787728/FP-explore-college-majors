5878395,1,B00DYAE2IY,"While this is a good set to have, it is TOO expensive.  Blurays are cheap to produce nowadays.  They can hold a minimum of 25GB.  I don't know why it cost $60 to own one series (aka 12 45 minutes episode + 1 Christmas special) while other TV series on bluray are cheaper by like ~$20.

Anyway, unless you really want series 1-4 in HD and have money to spare, then go for it.  Otherwise, just wait for a sale/deal cause then each series would be around $20.  And then get the Remote Sonic Screwdriver for ~$100. This would cost around ~$250.  With the spare $75 or so, you can make/commission/buy a nice wooden box or something.",1374019200,21,627,4.3076923076923075
5878396,5,B00DYAE2IY,"The screwdriver is the TV control remote that sells anywhere for 100.00usd. So in this set your getting something better than a prop and a great set on blu-ray. I do wish it was closer to 250.00usd, but oh well you pay for a good doctor.",1374019200,40,237,4.173913043478261
5878397,1,B00DYAE2IY,I would give up a twenty dollar prop if it meant having the specials as part of this set. At least attempt to make a set that has ALL of the episodes.,1374019200,17,150,3.71875
5878398,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Yeah...
Glad that I have a codefree BD Player at home. Can't wait to get the Box - there are only DVDs in Austria and they are expensive.
30 to 40 Euros for one DVD ?
Hopefully the Remote will work with my TV.",1374019200,5,209,3.772727272727273
5878399,1,B00DYAE2IY,"Once again, the USA get something from the BBC exclusive to them. I can't even begin to explain how annoyed me, and most the British fans (or you can even call us the ""original"" fans) are. I have nothing against America getting this stuff, But when they get it and we don't, or even if they get it before we do, this is bloody disgraceful, that's what it is! The BBC use our money, that's right the British tax payers money to produce merchandise that we can never get hold of! The BBC are constantly doing this, with them announcing pretty much all the merchandise these days in some other country, like the complete 7th series. The box art and details and release date have all been announced in the US, but god forbid if the English is to get all this information first! We still haven't got it!

Now, i only want series 1-4 on blu ray. I don't want anything else. And if the BBC keep them exclusive to the US never to be officially sold here, then i am complaining big time. Same is if they release this box set over here, but keep those blu-ray seasons exclusive to this box set. Just don't even go there BBC. Just don't.

Another reason i give this box set a 1/5 is because of the price. It is not worth that much, and considering i only want some of it, i am not going to pay 250 ($314) for some repeats and a remote i already have.

Not happy at all.",1374019200,31,1358,4.175572519083969

5878403,1,B00DYAE2IY,$200 a season? I find it hard to drop $50 a season. Doctor Who has to be the most overpriced show on the planet.  Even Out of Print imports cost less.  Boycott this type of consumer treatment.  I've picked up 3 seasons at less than $20 each on sale.  There is absolutely no reason for any season to be over $40.  A reasonable price on sale would be $30 for blu ray.  This is worse than Batman 3 seasons for $250.,1457568000,2,412,4.0246913580246915

This collection was way too limited in it's distribution, in my opinion.
Also, the Blu-ray cases are some of the flimsiest I have seen to date.
The extras are only a plus if you are a true Whovian collector. However, I was able to sell them on E-bay and this reduced the final cost considerably.",1427328000,,400,4.493150684931507
5878421,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Woah. That's all I have to say. Buying all of the seasons separately would have cost more than the $350 I paid for this set, PLUS I got the Sonic Screwdriver remote and the art prints. Honestly, a steal considering the amount of content. The first 7 series, all of the David Tennant specials, and loads of extras on the discs. Prequel mini-sodes, Confidential episodes, deleted scenes, plus Eccleston's stunningly underrated season on Bluray (I'm not even sure you can get that on the format outside of this set). Even after watching the entire series on Netflix, this set had hours of new content I hadn't seen before, or had only seen in low resolution on YouTube.
I'm glad I got it when I did, as it's since become VERY expensive to own.",1424822400,,740,4.571428571428571

As far as the set is concerned. From most of the other reviews the HD transfer on series 1-4 is not very good. These series were not shot in HD and not shot on film so this is to be expected. I don't have the discs in hand so can not confirm that the later series are region locked. The BBC site does say they are region free.

See here for a full review of the previous Blu-ray release. It's my understanding they are using the same transfers.

5878436,5,B00DYAE2IY,I was so undecided on which Doctor Who collection to order . The Matt Smith collection is a very good choice for fans who like his Doctor the best of all which does include me . But ! I wanted the entire series 1-7 in Blu-ray so the final choice came down this set Doctor Who :series 1-7 Limited Edition Blu-ray Gift Set . I had purchased the entire series as it came out (1-7) over those years . My grand sons wanted those I had for a Christmas present so I was left without them for awhile and as I said was really pondering (pun) which way to replace them (lucky me) . I might still order the Matt Smith version ? Anyway can't wait to re-watch the entire series in Blu-ray when it arrives tomorrow . What a great value for the entire series 1-7 .,1413331200,,749,4.0675675675675675

If you got your hands on this set, awesome!
If you didn't the separate series are still good, you just miss out on the screwdriver/remote weirdness and some magnets and postcard sized pictures.

5878447,4,B00DYAE2IY,"I haven't watched the discs yet, but it seem to include everything.
The Sonic Screwdriver Universal Remote has its problems.  It would have been better if it was designed to open at the bottom.  BTW, once you put the batteries in, you can't get the bottom one out.  It's stick in there forever.  It's also hard to use as a remove.  I've programmed it, but you must remember to hold it with the ""laces"" up.  And sometimes it misinterprets moves.  It often mistakes ""tap left"" for ""tap top"".  So if it's one control mode or quiet control mode you mustn't just wave it around.  Keep it on FX mode.  It more fun as a toy than as a remote.",1408579200,,634,4.2521008403361344
5878448,5,B00DYAE2IY,"I should start by saying that I did not get mine here though this may well be its place of origin. I got this from my uncle form my birthday some time ago and I was very pleased with it. To start, the remastered (or whatever) versions of series 1-4 looked incredible. I already had series 5-7, but it was nice to get extra copies for when someone in my family leaves them out of their cases and they get ruined (which is really inevitable for me).
Now, for everyone complaining about the price I'll say that buying every season normally at $20-$40 a pop (adding up to roughly $215) means that you're actually saving money because the set, plus the Sonic is already what your paying then you get all the extra stuff.
And on the subject of the Sonic, its awesome, but not at good as the 10th Doctor model. I say that mainly because with the 10th Doctor model I can turn off any tv I want at any time",1408060800,,897,4.190751445086705

Big problem in logic I see with the weeping angels is why nobody tries to break stone.  They can't be killed means they can't be broken either?  Seeing how the tardis can be destroyed, time and the universe can be destroyed, the time lords can be killed, etc. the weeping angels are apparently as indestructive as time and the universe itself.  At least in two episodes not include ""blink"" they were shown looking at each other and yet don't die.  Keep it straight Moffat.

Anyway, the show is amazing and to have the seasons on bluray that weren't previously released on bluray is so nice.  I love the way it looks and it's a joy rewatching again and again.  I definitely recommend this to anyone that likes the show if you're able to get a decent price for it.",1397865600,,513,4.141414141414141

5878468,5,B00DYAE2IY,"I first watched Doctor Who in late 2012 and spent most of 2013 fueling my fandom, which was aided by my new Netflix subscription. But it's incomplete and I wanted to catch up on Series 7 before the 50th anniversary and Matt Smith's last episode and it's cool actually owning all of the episodes. Plus, I learned a lot of interesting facts by watching the extras like audio commentaries, Doctor Who Confidential and other behind-the-scenes stuff.

This is my first TV show that I've purchased on Blu-Ray (I've previously bought DVDs, plus a few concert Blu-Rays). It's really cool. The clarity is incredible, including the earlier seasons where they weren't yet shooting in HD but were doing better than SD.

The sonic screwdriver remote is cool but, to be honest, I only used it once and isn't something I would've purchased... It mostly sits in the box. I would've preferred that they leave it out and drop the price by about $100.

I am a bit disappointed in the packaging... The glued-on graphics keep falling off and just seems unnecessarily large for its contents. I can't bring myself to throw it out but I don't want to leave my discs in there because I want the discs to the accessible and the box is just a nuisance.

But you don't buy Blu-Rays for the packaging and that's why I still gave this five stars.",1395532800,4,1316,4.611111111111111

5878473,5,B00DYAE2IY,"If you're as big of a Doctor Who fan as I am, you need to get this box set. It is absolutely the best deal you will find, considering many DVD box sets (let alone BluRay) cost around $300 for the show alone. This one includes the very nifty 11th Doctor's Sonic universal remote, which normally costs $99 on its own.

The universal remote itself is very cool, but is a bit difficult to use in a practical situation. Maybe it just takes some practice - I'm not sure. It was very easy to set up and program, and the sounds it makes are cool, but I found it difficult to actually perform the gestures that you want in order for it to perform the right function (i.e. change the channel, volume, etc). Also it comes with a nice little display case that will look nice in the center of your coffee table.

The box set itself is excellent. BluRays of every single episode from Seasons 1 through 7, including all the specials. The video quality is of course fantastic, and the sound is all remastered to Dolby 5.1.

I added up the cost of all 7 seasons plus the sonic screwdriver remote, and it's about $537. All of the 9th and 10th doctors stuff would be on regular DVD though, and it doesn't account for the art cards, comic book and never before released on DVD specials.",1389484800,3,743,4.276595744680851

5878514,4,B00DYAE2IY,"Just got mine a few days ago.  There are pros & cons.  Here goes:

THE PACKAGING:  Big and bulky.  The 9 BluRay cases just sit atop the right side of the sonic display case - no slots for them to slide in and out of. To the left of the 9 cases is a square, empty plastic cube (likely there to keep the cases from sliding to and fro).  For the price, they could have utilised that space with a mini TARDIS, or some such thing.  Just sayin'...  The three Doctor illustration cards & the comic are nice additions, but for the most part useless.

THE 9 BLU CASES:  Before opening the package, I was thrilled beyond words to see that the discs were packaged in space saving standard BluRay cases.  Gone are the shelf-hogging digipacks.  Yay!  Then I opened them.  *Very* sorry to report they're customary crap U.S. eco-cases.  The 4-disc cases are the solid, but super-thin ones.  The 3-disc cases and the single-disc case are the kind with the cut-outs.  Naturally, these will have to be replaced if You want to keep the artwork inserts intact, so the price of replacement cases should be figured in.

THE SONIC:  A beautiful, sturdy replica (despite being made in China).  The wire twist ties that secure it in its display case are seemingly made of some sort of barbed steel wire.  Sadly I hurt a couple of fingers & destroyed the display case trying to get the thing out.  Then one needs the patience of a saint, a supermini (eyeglass size) Phillips head screwdriver & and a good deal of time to get the batteries in.  I can only imagine a PhD will be required to master programming it as a remote.  I haven't gone there.  I just wave it around and play.  Biggest disappointment is that the clamps around the light sensor don't open & close like 11's real one.  Oh well - what can one expect for a mere $300?  It's a cute (co$tly) toy, but In all honesty I'd have preferred a smaller package, without the sonic, and for $100 less - but that's just me.

As the box itself says - at the heart of the set are the episodes themselves:

PQ: No complaints thus far with the PQ.  As of this writing, I watched two Smith episodes & one Eccleston.  The Smiths looked magnificent.  Of course, I thought the previous Blu's looked good too, but I'm not good at discerning between 1080i and 1080p.  I'll assume all episodes from ""Planet Of The Dead"" on will look similarly good, as they've all been shot in HD.
The Eccleston episode I watched was a tad better looking than it's DVD version.  As these are 570i resolution upconverted, I'd guess this is as good as they're ever gonna look.  I'll also assume all eps from ""Rose"" through ""The Next Doctor"" will look similar.

SOUND:  Here's a disappointment.  The previous versions mostly had menus with significantly louder audio than the actual episodes.  This has not been corrected.  One still has to turn the volume down to about ""3"" for the menus, and back up for the episodes.  Then there is the episode audio itself.  I don't know DTS-HD from Dolby Digital, but I DO know that to hear the dialogue, the volume has to be up quite high...then whenever music or a sound effect come in, the loudness nearly blows You off the chair.  This not a sound encoding problem but, rather it's that the audio is 5-channel only.  There is no 2-channel audio option.  I'd imagine on a surround system (which I don't own), this sounds ""correct"".  But through the two stereo TV speakers, it obviously defaults to two channels heavier on effects & music then on dialogue.  It's a common problem in discs nowadays.  Don't the studios realize that not everyone (even those who own them) ALWAYS watches discs through a surround system?  A 2-channel audio option is a must, especially on pricey BluRay's!

CONTENT:  Like many, I feel for the sake of completion, ALL of the Smith episodes should have been present here - IE: including ""Day Of The Doctor"" & ""Time Of The Doctor"" + all of their associated extras (""Night Of The Doctor"", ""The Last Day"", ""The Five(ish) Doctors"", & the theatrical intros to the 50th).  I'll also add that the eleven ""Doctors Revisited"" specials would have been a nice addition too.  They should've waited a few months and done it right, but clearly this set was rushed to market to cash in on the 4th quatrer/Christmas shopping so, sadly, it's incomplete.

It may sound as though I'm giving the set a thumbs-down.  I'm not.  Overall, compared to the price of individual Blu (even DVD) sets, this is an AMAZING bargain.  The packaging could've been a bit nicer, the discs could've used 2-channel audio, and the content could've been more complete.  Otherwise, for any TV, sci-fi, or general Blu collector (and especially for Whovians) this set is pure nirvana.",1388275200,8,4704,4.570743405275779
5878515,5,B00DYAE2IY,"If you are a fan of The Doctor, then this is the set for you. This is like the TARDIS version of the holy grail if you mind me saying. You get the entire series 1-7 plus The Christmas Specials & The David Tennant specials & a bonus disc of some goodies..but wait there's more ! You also get the 11th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver remote control which you can use as a remote or make the actual sounds of the sonic screwdriver itself. This item by itself is worth almost $100.00 so really it's like almost getting it for free with the set. Is there anymore you ask ? Say no more ! You also get a collectible comic book and 3 lithographs of the 3 Doctors.  All 7 series are on blu ray with a beautful picture and sound. Each disc has commentaries and awesome special features.

Now also if you are not a Doctor Who fan and you are interested in the show and you've been hearing your friends tell you to watch it, this is the perfect set to get you started considering the next series ( series 8) doesn't start til September and that's when the new Doctor starts....this would be the perfect time to get started on watching this show.

So to recap...this is a great set and makes a great gift as well. So pick it up and get ready to have the best time you will ever have watching a tv show. You'll never be able to watch just one episode !",1388275200,,1333,4.138996138996139

the Christmas carol episode for one, which is odd since other Blu-ray copies are just fine.

the extra content is pretty cool too.
I was able to get an 11th doctor sonic screwdriver universal remote. so if you don't have one, this is a good way to get it.
the price may seem a bit high, but if you do the math, it's quite cheap.

note: the 11th doctor sonic screwdriver universal remote comes in a glue sealed package (not re-sealable) so if you were hoping to try it out then put it as a display, and keep the packaging or something along those lines, you may not want to use this one. the one that comes in this boxset might best be kept unopened and just displayed",1388188800,3,875,4.147058823529412

Can anyone tell me why all the episodes in the complete Doctor Who Blu-ray Gift set (with sonic screedriver) are about 2 minutes longer than the individual release of the rprevious DVD or Blu-ray copies? The previous copies had edited versions? The exist edited versiosn? I have never watched Doctor Who on TV and bougth season 1 on DVD, the Complete David Tannat years set and season 5 and 6 on blu-ray. I did a quick compare between the versiosn and all the episodes in the complete set are longer than the previous idividual releae (yes even the Christamas special and even longuer than the blu-ray releases).

I can'y verify for season 7 because I haven't bought it seperately, but I wager it is the same, Just for longer episodes I'm glad that I bought the pricey complete set. Now I'm worried that the complete season 8 or 50th anniversary doctor Who on bly-ray will be edited versions.

Does anyone know the explanation for the different length of the episodes.

Verify for yourself and pass the word to all Doctor Who fan... longer episodes in complete set.

Thank you",1386374400,,1081,4.668421052631579

5878544,3,B00DYAE2IY,"I really enjoy Doctor Who. And I was excited for this product, because heck it's a chance to catch up on all the episodes I've missed before the 50th. Only when it got here, did I start feeling really swindled, not by amazon, but by BBC. First off on the back of the blu-rays it cleary states ""May not be in HD"". While BBC had claimed that the entire series had been up-resed to 1080p. This is simply not the case. Seasons 1-7 look pretty much like they do on Instant Video or Netflix. Now this may have been cool if it was just like hey they're on less discs! Cause you know Dual-Layered Blu-Rays, they can hold up to 50 gigs right? Well each season has anywhere from 4-5 discs. Not to mention the poor quality of the actual UI. I've never had any complaints about UI in movies, because well typically they just work. Pretty simple, right? BBC managed to bugger this up as well. It's hard to tell what you've clicked on as the item you have selected instead of getting brighter, becomes clear, so you'll think you've scrolled over to one item when really you're on the other. Also surprisingly enough all the Blu-Ray players I've tried don't remember where you've left off unlike the rest of my Blu-Rays. The last and probably most disappointing part of the package was the Sonic Screwdriver itself. There's no button on it. It's a pain in the arse to set up (although it does take AAA batteries instead of those weird little ones, so kudos for that), and the gestures are finnicky at best. I find it MIND-BLOWING that they could have so easily added a button that you could press and then do gestures so as to have better accuracy and not accidently pick up gestures you didn't mean to make.

All in all, this product is simply a blunder on BBC's part. It felt more like a quick cash grab then an honest try at fan service.",1385856000,9,1825,4.367647058823529
5878545,5,B00DYAE2IY,I have only been a fan of this series for about a year now but it is one of my favorites. Once I heard about this set I kept it in my wish list to ensure I remembered to order it. Despite the art cards missing from my first set Amazon took care of me and had a new set overnighted free of charge. The second set had all the items listed. Very happy with set and the quality of each series. Would recommend for any true Doctor Who fan.,1385683200,2,434,3.8333333333333335
5878546,5,B00DYAE2IY,"When I first ordered this, it came a day earlier than anticipated. With a glad heart, I rushed home to open it and gaze with joy on the prize I had received. As I started to look through the cases though, I was shocked to see that it contained seasons 1,2,3,4,5,4,5,..... Yes, they had substituted seasons 6&7 with another copy of seasons 4&5.

After fuming and ranting for a while, calm came over me as I remembered that I could exchange it for a set with all of the correct items. So, I went online, printed the forms and sent it back. The very next day I received word that my NEW set had shipped and that they had confirmation with UPS that my return had been shipped.

2 days later, I had a complete box set in hand. Excellent condition and very quickly done. So far I am on season 5 and have found no flaws worth noting. Thank you BBC for producing this and thanks to Amazon for their quick response.",1385596800,,906,4.23121387283237
5878547,4,B00DYAE2IY,"I just received this today.  I have not watched any of the disks yet, so I will try to remember to update this when I am done.

First off, packaging.  I was pleased with the packaging.  It is nothing super impressive (for a ""limited edition Giftset"") which is kind of a bummer, but I can let that slide since I don't have anywhere to display this anyways.  Still, having the option of a fancy looking box to display would be nice with a three hundred dollar price tag.  I think a nice T.A.R.D.I.S. box would have been supremely epic and something every whovian would be proud to put on their shelf.

The disks are stacked neatly, but lose in the box, held in place by the sonic screwdriver and a clear plastic box that contained nothing.  It is possible that the box could have been a little better designed to not require additional (wasteful and ecologically unfriendly) packaging.  I don't really see a reason for that to affect the score, however.

The sonic screwdriver is packaged inside it's display case and held in place with the beefiest wire ties I have ever seen.  Seriously, these suckers took a tool to unwind and remove.  I was a little worried that I might damage the plastic display stand, but my fears were assuaged.  YMMV

The wire ties, though industrial in strength, were both plastic coated for protection, but also sleeved in rubber where they contacted the screwdriver, so it was very well protected.  I am quite impressed with the care taken to ensure that the thing was safe.

Underneath the disks, sonic screwdriver, clear plastic filler box and a cardboard filler behind the screwdriver is where the flat paper products were.  They were perfectly save and sound.  The comic was in excellent condition, as were the photographs of 9, 10 and 11 inside their envelope.

The disks:
The disks included in this set are basically just repackaged copies of the individual disks you can purchase separately, which is a little bit of a downer.  When I buy a set that is a ""Limited Edition Giftset"" I sort of expect something that feels, I don't know, special.  Once I have placed these disks on my shelf there will be nothing differentiating them from what I would have gotten had I just purchased each series separately.  I know this is a minor thing, but as a fan of the series and a pretty huge geek, I would really love to have received at least alternative artwork to show off.

Series 1-3 and both ""bonus"" disks are packed in the somewhat cheap and flimsy feeling ""recycle logo"" bluray cases.  For the ""Limited Edition"" it seems like they could have at least put the disks in nicer boxes instead of just grabbing inventory off the shelf.

Series 4-7 are all in nice, thick, non-cheap feeling disk cases.  Still not quite ""limited edition"" but I certainly nothing I could complain about.

I had no broken disk cases and all disks arrived securely in their case.  I physically inspected each disk (particularly the ones with Karen's picture on them) and they are in perfect condition, though bluray disks are substantially durable, so this is no surprise.

The sonic screwdriver:
The sonic screwdriver is substantial.  I've been wanting to get myself Smith's screwdriver for some time, but have always found myself holding off because I wanted one that had some real weight to it.  This definitely fits that bill.

A majority of the screwdriver's exterior is metal with just the emitter tip, handle shroud, and button being plastic.  The grip is a stiff, but not unpleasant rubber molded to appear as leather.  The detail of the stitching was a nice touch.

The remote did not include batteries.  I don't know if this is standard in the UK, but generally in the U.S. batteries, at least cheap  ones, as included with most remote controls.  This is honestly a non-issue for me since there were exactly two AAA cells in the drawer waiting for me.

My only real complaint (if you can call it that) regarding the screwdriver is that it does not extend.  For the most part I can completely understand why, but it would have been nice to be able to flick the thing up in FX mode and extend the tip and get a really awesome cosplay moment going.

I do feel the need to also point out that the sounds in FX mode are not really accurate to the show, in fact, I don't think any of the sounds actually sound like Smith's screwdriver...  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Ultimately I have zero regrets on my purchase.  I've not done the math on what everything would cost separately, but I suspect it weighs in favor of this set.

I would definitely advise any whovian who does not already have the disks or the remote that this is a solid purchase.  I would not advise anyone who owns the disks already to buy this set.  Just complete your existing set and buy the remote if you want it.  The pictures of 9, 10 and 11 plus the comic are nice, but I don't think they make or break this set.

I do have to knock off a star for the lack of ""limited edition"" feel to this Limited Edition.",1385424000,8,4985,4.540965207631874
5878548,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Dr. Who is amazing....

But why did they not shape this box to be a TARDIS?  Just seems like such a waste of an opportunity.  It's not like they don't sell a Tardis shape EVERYTHING ELSE out there.  Tea Infusers, Toothbrush Holders, USB Hubs, Mini-fridge, Jenga, etc...But not this???

Silly.",1385337600,8,292,4.76
5878549,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Its a great set for the value, I like the new slimmer cases and presentation overall.  Though I think they could have made some better use of the empty space that was leftover.  There's an empty plastic cube that would have fit one of those replica Time Lord psychic containers perfectly for instance, or maybe a random figure from the titan line, rather than just the empty plastic.  I haven't had time to watch all the disks to verify their improvement, especially the newly remastered ones, but from what I have watched so far it is a pretty crisp picture and clear sound.
For the universal remote, while I haven't taken the time to program and learn all the functions yet I did at least spend a few minutes with the demo and FX modes and they respond well to gestures, it only seems to get a bit confused when you quickly follow up one gesture with a sharp jerk in the opposite direction.  The only thing is I wish they had the option to choose which screwdriver was represented in the set, since ThinkGeek has the 9th/10th screwdriver with the same functionality, but I'm pretty sure theirs is exclusive to their site, so that's probably why.
As for the issues some people have with the overall price, based on that most of the elements can be found currently elsewhere for varying prices, I suppose it's just a matter of preference if you'd prefer to get everything here, or assemble your own collection.  I admit it is a tad pricey based on what people's budget may be, but honestly I would have only preferred if it was about $50 cheaper than the current $300 tag, so it wasn't too big a deal for me to cut a little elsewhere to make up the difference.
And since some people are reporting issues with some of their shipments (missing seasons, damaged cases, etc.) I can say the the only oddity I experienced was that the set itself was packaged upside down in relation to the box art, which is no big deal since all I had to do was repackage it as I was examining everything upon arrival.
So there you have it, if you are looking for a good set for yourself or gift set for a fan, I would recommend it, or you can always wait and pick and choose from the seasons you want, as they'll more than likely start selling them individually in this format at some point.

5878553,3,B00DYAE2IY,"For Series 5-7 and most of the specials actually shot using HD cameras, it is what you expect - excellence.  Great picture quality and audio quality.

Where it becomes less impressive is Series 1-4.  Recorded on PAL SD video (576i) we all knew ahead of time that 1-4 series would only be upscaled, but that doesn't mean it had to be bad.  After all, Farscape was mastered to PAL 576 and the Blu-ray upscale went very well.  The big difference here is the upscale method used.  Farscape benefited from a quality upscale that looked significantly better than the DVD in every scenario.  Unfortunately, BBC decided to use a rather poor quality upscale algorithm for the Doctor that introduces many unwanted artifacts.

I don't want to be unfair.  Generally speaking, some of the stationary shots and closeups look better than the DVD... it's just everything else that reminds me that it is SD, when the halos and aliasing stand out or a bad key during effects shots. This upscale is just simply not as good as Farscape, which is really unfortunate. If you've got a clean SD source of Series 1-4 that is free of artifacts, then you might just want to stick with those if you have a good upscaler or upscale technique to use.

On the list of pros, the DTS-HD MA track for Series 1-4 is more dynamic than the regular Dolby Digital track. There are times where the lossless track shines compared to the old lossy tracks, but unless you've got a fairly robust home audio system, you may not notice.  If you crave the highest quality audio, then this is probably your only reason to purchase this set... until Series 1-4 are released individually.

As for the Sonic Screwdriver remote, I'm not going to review it.  It is going to sit in its plastic case and never be used, maybe I'll frame it and put it on the wall.

Honestly, I can't say that this was worth the money - and we used a big gift card to offset the cost!  We bought it because we only owned Series 6 on Blu-ray and we were waiting for something like this to come along.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't worth the wait.  I can only hope that BBC does new upscales of 1-4 in the future.

UPDATE:  See some screenshots from series 1.  Notice the baked-in edge enhancement, it's not very pretty.  Not the worst thing you'll ever see, but certainly not as good as it could have been.  [...]",1384992000,59,2339,4.492890995260663

5878558,5,B00DYAE2IY,"My son introduced me to the Doctor Who series and I became hooked on them.  When I ordered Season 1 and 4 on DVD, the quality of the discs and video transfers, especially on season 1, were so poor I had to return them.  I consigned myself to just streaming the episodes, rather than purchasing the DVDs.

When I first heard about this limited series Edition Blu-ray Giftset, I was initially skeptical. I pay good money for my purchases and I want the product to be in the best condition possible.  Having been burned previously, I was not too keen on taking any risks.  Yet, the idea of having a replica of a ""sonic screwdriver"", which is really a remote control unit, along with all 7 seasons, changed my mind.

When I received the box set, it was in great shape.  I saw no outward damage to the contents within.  As I opened each season's contents, I found 2 or 3 discs in total that were loose, but none were scratched like my previous orders.  I watched the episodes on each disc and was blown away by the incredible quality and detail of the video transfers.  Season 1's episodes were just as clear as season 7's episodes.  The 5.1 audio was outstanding as well.  I also appreciate the inclusion of all the Christmas Specials, deleted scenes, and various other features/concerts.

I plan on giving my son the ""sonic screwdriver"" the next time he comes to visit, but I am keeping the Blu-ray discs for myself.  If you are a Doctor Who fan, this is a great addition to your video library.",1384646400,11,1491,4.453874538745388

I wanted to start buying the seasons but they weren't in BLU-RAY at that time (1-4). So I didn't wasted my money in it. It all changed when I saw this box set. I had the urge to buy this in a heartbeat. So far the season look pretty awesome to me and love all the goodies that are in it.,1384128000,4,388,3.9240506329113924
5878563,5,B00DYAE2IY,"As a Day One U.S. owner of this set who pre-ordered it the very moment Amazon alerted me as to its release, allow me to clarify the details surrounding the U.S. set.  First and foremost, all seven seasons (that would be ""series"" to my fellow Whovians across the pond) have been remastered in 1080p and ALL seven seasons have had their audio track remixed in DTS-HD MA 5.1.  BOTH features are VERY important, especially to those of us here in the U.S.  and I'll explain why...

First, lets get the resolution out of the way.  The 1080i resolution, though very clean, is a little soft compared to its 1080p counterpart and the remastering to 1080p, when compared side by-side is quite noticeable.

Now, the audio is another issue entirely and one of some controversy for consumers in the U.S., at least. Although all of the prior Blu-ray releases claimed to be in DTS-HD 5.1., the truth is that they were and the weren't.  Normally, the specifications on the back of the box indicate that the audio track is either DTS HD-MA or DTS HD-HR.  The prior BD releases never did this, listing only a description on the back of ""DTS HD 5.1.""  I believe BBC did this on purpose as to confuse the consumer (the same way some of their DW releases simply have a resolution listed as ""1080"" with no ""i"") because ALL of the prior releases had a DTS HD-HR audio track.  This intentional misleading labeling of the audio codec on the consumer packaging is, if not commonplace, certainly not unheard of, either.

If you don't know what the difference is, it's very simple:  DTS HD-MA (Master Audio) is an uncompressed, higher bit-rate audio codec as compared to the lossy/compressed DTS HD-HR (High Resolution) and though very good (and certainly a step above DTS 5.1) it is not a ""true"" HD codec.  It is similar to the Dolby Digital Plus codec featured on some Blu-rays and many titles streaming on Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. More information regarding the different audio codecs can be found here:

[...]

Now, honestly, my personal experience with both DTS-HD HR and Dolby Digital Plus has been generally very positive and even though both are compressed/lossy codecs, I really can't tell a difference between their more desirable lossless counterparts (DTS HD-MA, Dolby TrueHD, respectively).  The reality is that these audio codecs are pretty meaningless unless you are using a modern home theater setup with HDMI input capability and the ability to decode these newer modern codecs.  If you are just connected directly to you your HDTV, your BD player or TV is going to decode the multichannel audio track and convert it to a stereo track for your television anyway.

The real issue with the DTS HD-HR audio codec in regards to the prior DW BD releases isn't the codec so much as it is the horrific job that they did mastering it to begin with.  Simply put, the DTS HD-HR audio tracks from all of the prior releases is incredibly flawed and ALL of them suffer from the same issues of drop-outs and loss of audio on some equipment that that the DTS HD-MA audio tracks on several of the discs of the Star Trek: The Next Generation  Remastered Season One did when it was initially released.  The difference with the TNG releases and the DW releases, however, was that the problem was so widespread that CBS was immediately aware of the flaw and immediately sought to rectify it by issuing a press release about it and replacing the faulty discs to consumers who requested them.

With the DW sets, however, my research indicates that the problem was isolated to just occurring with some equipment and athough if you do a Google search on the subject, you'll certainly find complaints about this, it wasn't enough of an issue for BBC Home Video to do anything about it.

I personally discovered it because I encountered the issue myself and despite my best efforts to isolate and rectify the problem by updating the firmware on my Onkyo receiver and PS3, the problem persisted.  My workaround solution was to change the output on the PS3 from Bitstream to Linear PCM for these discs which worked for everything EXCEPT the Tennant Specials set which is such an absolute mess that there are parts of episodes where there aren't just dropouts but sections where there is no dialogue, just the score in the background.  Also, this issue is not isolated to folks with contemporary home theater setups.  It should be noted that I have over 300 BD titles and I have only encountered this issue on the original BBC DW releases, so no, it's not me or my equipment, it's the discs. Folks playing these discs directly to their TV also have encountered this issue (if you look at treviews for the Tennant Specials right here on Amazon, you'll see it pop up)..

I am pleased to report that this new remastered DTS HD-MA tracks on ALL of these discs has resolved the problem.  I have tested every single disc and have encountered no problems.

Also, for folks concerned that seasons five through seven are just the same discs that were in the prior releases just repackaged, aside from the obvious technical changes I've discussed, the trailers are all new featuring shows such as ""Orphan Black"" and the background music on the menu screens has changed, as well.  Those are minor details but they are an immediate indication that these are NOT the same releases as their predecessors despite the identical artwork on the cases and disc labels (although, the new disc labels DO indicate the 1080p resolution and the DTS HD-MA track).

For myself, the biggest concern I had was what seasons one through four would look like.  I signed up to be on BBC's Consumer Panel about a year ago and every now and then they send me surveys about new products and what I would like to see.  They sent me a survey about the possibility of a DW boxed set and one of the questions they asked at the end was what I would like to see.  My biggest request was that they include a 1080p set of the Eccleston/Tennant years.

I explained that although I was aware that the show was originally filmed in 570i, even the 570i resolution upconverted to 1080p would be far superior to the  480 lines of resolution that US consumers are forced to suffer with on DVD. Netflix streaming has the the 570 resolution versions available and the difference is so dramatic that I don't even bother watching my DVD sets.

So, with much trepidation I fired up Season One, Disc One and to my surprise the resolution is far better than I ever could have imagined.  As I noted, as far as I knew, the first four seasons were actually filmed in 570 resolution but the more research I've done, inidcates that the original negatives were 35mm, which has a resolution much higher than the 1080p of the Blu-ray format and capabilities of contemporary HDTVs (4K notwithstanding).  After watching 'Rose' all the way through I don't believe that these epsiodes have been upconverted to 1080p (As opposed to the ""Farscape"" Blu-ray set which is obviously upconverted, and poorly).  The quality is just too good.  They appear to be, as advertised, remastered from their original high-definition source negatives.

That being said, I've also come to believe that the prior BD releases were simply transfers of the 1080i original broadcasts prints... which would of course explain the 1080i resolution of the discs and the lossy DTS HD-HR audio tracks.

As a consumer, it really bothers me that BBC Home Video produced those discs using that process which is just incredibly cheap but then at the same time, the retail price on those sets are by far the highest of any television BD release and didn't budge for a long time.  Complete boxed sets of seasons five, six and seven have consistently retailed for USD $75.00 for 14 episodes per season (including the Christmas Specials).  That's an average of USD $5.36 per episode which is far greater than even the most expensive genre titles (TNG, approx. USD $2.30 per episode, Battlestar Galactica, approximately USD $3.00 per episode but even that's gone down to as low as USD $1.80).  The bottom-line is that it was bad enough that they charged 100% - 150% above the premium price that the genre demands in the marketplace, but to release such an inferior and cheaply made product is just offensive.

This boxed set rectifies all of those issues.  As noted, all of the episodes (as far as I can tell) as advertised, have truly been remastered from their original high definition sources, both in audio and video.  At USD $299.99, this set may seem pricey but considering the fact that it comes with the 11th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver Remote Control (which retails between USD $100 - $120), the set is beyond a bargain coming in at USD $2.00 per episode, not including the bonus disc.

My only complaint with the set is that it lacks the two animated features ('The Infinite Quest' and 'Dreamland') and it would have been super cool (although I know that I'm dreaming with this)  had they made the set truly complete by including certificates for the BD releases of the 50th Anniversary Special ""The Day of the Doctor"" and the upcoming 2013 Christmas Special... but that's just me being greedy.  I'm always hesitant to give any product a 5-Star Rating but if any set warrants it, this would be the one.",1384041600,27,9272,4.716676999380037
5878564,3,B00DYAE2IY,"I was quite excited to receive my set this week so I could spend the weekend on a Doctor Who binge. Alas, for some reason, the discs will not play on my Blu-ray player.

I managed to get them to play on my PS-3, but it's not very useful to me if they can't play on a standard Blu-ray player.

On top of that, the packaging was slightly damaged.

5878573,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Quite simply put, this set is amazing.  While $300 may seem like a high price for this set, the Sonic Screwdriver remote on it's own is $100.  When you take that out, you're averaging just $25 per set, which, when considering the price for the individual seasons on DVD, is an amazing bargin.

And, yes this release has Series 1-7 and the Complete Specials (the five specials that marked the end of David Tennant's run as the Tenth Doctor).  And if you're hesitant to get this release because you already have the previous releases of the 5-7 Series and/or the Complete Specials on Blu Ray, this set has new versions of those sets with full 1080p transfers (as opposed to the 1080i of the original Blu Rays).  And the video quality of all of these discs is amazing.  I was actually a bit shocked as to how good the upconversions on Series 1-4 are.  They obviously took great care to make those first four series looked as perfect as they could on Blu Ray.  And all bonus features from the DVD releases are included.

As for the bonus disc, the two specials included, which originally aired on BBC America, are nothing to write home about.  But the inclusion of the complete ""Doctor Who at the Proms"" with DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound makes the bonus disc a must have, in my opinion.",1383782400,82,1279,4.4978354978354975
5878574,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Ok, my order from amazon arrived this afternoon. I was pretty excited to see how series 1-4, originally in SD, now upconverted to HD 1080p would look. I watched half of Ep 1, Rose on Blu ray, then on the original DVD release. It did look better, close ups look the best, detail in faces and hair is much better. Far away shots, not as impressive. I noticed that the small squares you get in the back grounds on the DVDs are gone on the Blu rays. Series 2 looks better then then series 1. Sharper, more HD looking. Once you get to series 3 & 4, the new remastered Blu rays really look pretty amazing for being from SD master. I think the extra 100 or so lines of SD pal resolution really helped bring these new Blu rays to life. Close up and far away shots on series 3 & 4 look pretty great. Series 3 & 4 look the best of the original 4 SD releases.

The sound, now 5.1, packs a lot more punch, on all series 1-7 now. Series 5 -7 were already on Blu ray, but now they are in 1080p and in 5.1. Series 5-7 now have fewer disc per series compared to the original Blu ray releases. I read that 1080p takes up less space, I hope that's correct.

The last Blu-ray Disc, the new special features disc is ok, It contains the Brit's list Doctor Who Ultimate list of lists, the best of the Christmas specials, & the full 90 minute Doctor Who at the Proms in 5.1 surround. I was hoping for more new stuff, but I am ok with what we got.

The box it came in is pretty big. I don't think I'll be storing the Blu rays and remote in it. Just the comic and doctor print.

The only thing missing, which is in the David Tennant box set is the 2 animated cartoons. If I find them, I'll update my review.

The remote is really cool, it's pretty heavy, about the weight of the sonic screw driver that is available.

Overall I'm very happy with with this box set. My main reason for buying I it was the remote and to get series 1-4 in HD on Blu ray and I'm pretty pleased with the results.

Update:10-13-13, I am getting a replacement box set shipped. My comic was never cut at the bottom, I was ok with that, I was just going to cut it myself, but, today I took off the outer description cardboard that covers the back and bottom and my box has one torn corner, a good 2"" in and another 2"" rip in the bottom of the box.

I already own Series 1-5 on DVD and Series 6 On Blu-Ray. Unfortunately I purchased Series 1-4 on eBay and the cases are just in terrible shape even though they were new. I was never satisfied with them, and ultimately i'd rather own the series entirely on Blu-Ray instead of having a mixed collection. I also already owned the Sonic Screwdriver remote, so overall I was investing a lot of money on doubles, but it's worth it.

It was going to cost me $100 to own Series 7 and the David Tennant specials on Blu-Ray, so for 200 more I got the entire series on Blu-Ray, plus an awesome comic book and some little art pieces. I'm going to be selling the screwdriver to recoup some costs because I simply don't need it.

Sure, it's mostly novel but the reviews dropping this sets overall score because it ""forces"" you to buy a ""toy"" are absurd.

This set is still a deal at $300 if you DIDN'T include the remote considering most places sell the individual series sets for $50-80 each. The addition of 1-4 being available on BR and all the bonuses for roughly $43 a season AND you get the remote anyway?

5878583,5,B00DYAE2IY,"I haven't seen this box set but do own the Tennant specials and subsequent series on Blu-ray. At this point, I just want to make a few remarks about image quality.

I had often wondered why the early reboot series were not in available in Blu-ray. Some web research led me to the answer. Doctor Who Series 1-4, with exception of the last two specials, were shot in Standard Definition (SD). SD PAL (Europe) is 576 scan lines as opposed to SD NTSC (US) 480 scan lines. When mastered for DVD some resolution was lost, not a whole lot overall, but some. Blu-ray Disc (BD) has more than enough room for that full SD PAL to shine. It will *never* be full 1080 HD but these will look as good as they ever will!

The current Series 5-7 on BD look and sound *fantastic*. So, allons-y! This is the set to get.

Web rumors indicated Series 1-4 will receive separate BD releases in 2014. Till then -- Geronimo!

5878584,3,B00DYAE2IY,"While I would enjoy the prospect of having all 7 seasons of Doctor Who on Bluray, and the box-art looks equally appealing, the biggest allure it has is that it is all the seasons, which won't be relevant as soon as season 8 starts. Furthermore, this box-set of 7 seasons costs more than what I bought my PS3 for. In other terms, in the case of the Smallville series boxset, it was 200.00 odd dollars when it came out. It had more seasons and, while it may have been less vocal, a larger fan base. Ultimately, while it would be nice to have all seven seasons, (kinda), the price makes it look bigger than it actually is. My advise is to wait until the price drops (which it undoubtedly will in a few years) and if you still care enough to pay the cost, then go for it.

I am going to be doing an analysis of the 7 seasons on my YouTube channel [...]Took on Sunday, September 8th 2013.",1378339200,4,883,4.194117647058824

5878586,5,B00DYAE2IY,"Opener: If you ask me, I coudn't wait for this set to be released & have the 1st 4 series' in HD, well upconverted HD, but whatever. I love this series as much as I enjoy Star Trek & I'm a guy who enjoys his Star Trek. Pretty much I'm a Trekkie & a Whovian, have been for several years. I was stoked for this release, hope they'll release the series in separate releases like the Friends season sets on blu-ray & the DVD series sets of Power Rangers.

Content review: Now, if you want entertainment at its best, you've come to the right place. Most of Matt Smith's, all of David Tennant's, & some of Chris Eccelston's episodes are truly great & will keep you entertained for hours.

Remastering work: It's too bad they didn't shoot the episodes from series' 1-4 on film, or an equivalent for proper HD remastering, but like 'The Next Doctor' episode of the David Tennant specials that looked ok & that episode was upconverted, so you don't have to worry much. I'm hopeful that they'll release the upconverted HD versions of the episodes on iTunes &/or Netflix so people who can't afford this set, will be able watch them that way. I expected the SD produced episodes & such on the discs to look close to the episodes of Sherlock in HD. They look good, they've also remixed the audio for series 2, which I've heard that people have complained about, that the music overlapped the speech to the point where you can barely hear the speech, so much so that it was spoofed on the British comedy show 'Dead Ringers,' so they probably took that into account when remastering the show. The picture isn't 'Star Trek TNG' Blu-Ray level, but it's alright. The episodes of series 1-4 look decent, but not overly fantastic, but there is a level of remastering there, to a degree. Whether, or not it's exactly 1080p HD, is a question, but they were shot at 576i, so they're definitely above 480p, so it has that, but it also looks nice, so don't think it's crap. You'd definitely have to take a lot of things into account when thinking about buying this set, like me, who didn't have the DVDs & thought this was a good bargain for all included.
Price: I consider the price fair. $299-$314 for around 3 Doctor's worth of tenure, spread over 7 series' on almost 40 discs, which has episodes, shorts, & other extras from the DVDs, which I'm questioning if the mini-sodes were upconverted too, for series' 1-4's mini-sodes, & an 11th Doctor sonic screwdriver universal remote, which I understand, goes for nearly $100 on its own. As I've read someone type into a review for this set & am repeating cause it's true, each individual series from 1-4 & 7 on DVD, is going for the insanely high prices of $40-$60 & that's just the DVD versions. I could easily understand a new release & on blu-ray, but on DVD!?! Really Amazon!?! Well, at least it's not as bad as BBC America's site. They're selling it for nearly $100, at least for series 2, but I digress.

Final thoughts, for now: As far as I can tell, as it says on this page, it has all the shorts, the Doctor Who Confidential episodes from the DVD releases, & most importantly, the episodes from series 1-4, at least. I was kind of hoping they'd release the Dreamland CGI episode from 2009 and The Infinite Quest animated episode, on these too, since there's a bonus disc, or since Blu-Ray discs hold more info than DVDs, they could slot those episodes where they belong, continuity-wise, in between the episodes they take place in, but I guess I was just hoping for something impossible, or at least very unlikely to happen. As I was hoping that since Dreamland hasn't been released anywhere, not even iTunes of all places, or the David Tennant Specials blu-rays in HD, they could've released it for the 1st time anywhere in HD on blu-ray & give us fans &/or collectors extra incentive to buy this set, but I guess BBC was not smart enough to realize the opportunity they had here, but I guess not..
Final Thoughts: It's a pretty good set release of this show. Solid for a collection release before The Day Of The Doctor on November 23. I have no complaints, as I mainly bought this set to get the episodes on disc format, since the DVD season sets are so expensive, so I recommend this set: 1, for people who didn't buy the series sets yet & 2, if you, like me, hate the series 5 & 6, maybe 7 set releases, if it's like those, & want the discs in regular, great blu-ray cases with multiple disc trays, so there's that. Otherwise, I don't think it's going to appeal to you very much.

Not much else to say, so thanks for reading, if you did.

Oh, & P.S. for anyone living in the U.K. thinking this is unfair that we get this before you, you people have gotten the Regeneration box set & we didn't, so this is ours & we'll enjoy having a leg up over you, so don't spoil it.

The episodes in series 1-4 were originally shot at the UK's standard definition of the time, 576i, while everything from Planet of the Dead onwards was shot at 1080i.  All are being converted up to 1080p for this gift set.  Also included in the set is an Eleventh Doctor Sonic Screwdriver Remote Control for TVs and other home media equipment. That alone is $100.00.  The on-disc contents should be identical to those for the previously-released complete season sets (apart from the definition increase, of course). Each season will come in its own case, with an outer box to contain them all in.  The set may also contain a few other little souvenir nick-knacks.

5878592,2,B00DYAE2IY,"I'd bought series 1 on DVD, and 5 - 7 on Blu-Ray.  I've read series 1-7 will be released individually on Blu-Ray and that made me recall the first time the show was hyped up as being filmed natively in HD.  Hint - it wasn't series 1 that got the HD treatment:

""Planet of the Dead"" (2009) was the first to be filmed in HD (1080P) so if preceding stories/series are put on blu-ray, they're being upscaled and it is impossible to add detail to upscaled motion raster images.

But who needs a silly plastic prop?  Doctor Who?  Apart from that level of writing that's in the professionally produced program, maybe I could write for it too.  Timey-wime, spacey-wacey, humany-wumany - dang, there's most of Tennant's era and half of Matt Smith's already summed up.  But I really don't need a sonic screwdriver prop as a remote control just to justify adding $75 or more to the price.  Maybe $50, but based on the cost of other electronicy-wectwonicawwy toys based on the show and those are amazingly expensive, $75 for a $10 remote with $65 of overpriced branding just comes across as a desperate turn-off.

I think I'll pass on this set, but when series 1 comes out I'll keep a close eye on reviews.",1374537600,10,1194,4.511627906976744
5878593,3,B00DYAE2IY,"I have to say the design & look of this box set is extremely attractive. The BBC previously released a wonderfully designed 23 disc box set of series 1 - 4 with a beautifully illustrated glossy episode guide & a plethora of extras for the European market in 2009 but it is only available in DVD format which got me thinking as to why. On further investigation it appears the first four series were quite a low budget affair, in fact we would have to wait almost five years for the series to be actually filmed in true HD. Remember the series re-launched in 2005 but Blu-ray didn't become widely available until 2009 & HD television is still relatively new. What was to follow as the re-launch gathered momentum & technology improved was we were able to enjoy bigger budget productions leading to better special effects that obviously lend themselves far more to a Blu-ray release as the source tapes are of the quality you would expect. I also think it is a bit cheeky including the sonic remote to bump up the price because the new 10th Doctor remote which, unlike the one included with this box set, is an accurate screen prop replica (i.e. it extends) so will definitely become the sonic of choice. I personally believe the transference of ""Series 1-4"" & the best part of ""The Complete Specials"" to Blu-ray will do nothing much to enhance your viewing enjoyment because you can't really dramatically improve on what wasn't there to begin with. I am a lifelong fan of Doctor Who & am more than happy with my ""Complete Series"" collection on DVD. If you own a pretty decent Blu-ray set up it upscales them for you anyway. Also be warned there are a whole host of well documented problems with ""The Complete Specials"" transference to Blu-ray the first time around & reading the reviews of the UK version of this release none of these issues have been addressed. I have also read several reviews that ""Series 1-4"" have problems with them running slower in 1080p. If you already own any of the earlier series on DVD I would stick with them & only consider releases on Blu-ray from ""Series 5"" & beyond, saving yourself a few bucks into the bargain. It's also worth remembering we are talking a BBC television series here & not a huge Hollywood blockbuster with a multi-million dollar budget ... what Auntie Beeb manage to do with the money available to them is nothing short of miraculous.

2. Despite some of the reviews, they are NOT region B only, they are NO REGION (Panasonic and Sony player owners beware, other brand players are fine)
