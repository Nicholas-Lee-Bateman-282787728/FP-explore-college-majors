7721405,3,B01DPLS7I2,"For some reason this was the first season that I never got to see when first released. There are a few good episodes such as ""Private Butthead"" and ""Triangle"" but there are also hints as to why the show was to end a year later. The writing is just not as good as it was in the earlier seasons. The episode about Kevin learing to parallel park is basically a carbon copy of the first one where he had trouble learning Math, ""The Lost Weekend"" borrows a bit too much from Tom Cruise's ""Risky Business"" and the one about the teacher MIss Shaw is basically a ""Dead Poets Society"" remake.  What's worse, as Kevin grows older, his (usually terrific) parents seem to be progressively dumbing down. I suppose I'll go ahead and purchase Season 6 when it comes out just to complete my Wonder Years set but I can't say I'm too hopeful about it. Overall, Season 5 is OK but nothing more.",1466121600,,875,4.368098159509202
7721406,5,B01DPLS7I2,"Unfortunately ""The Wonder Years"" in Season Five was in the middle of its final three-year ratings slide, dropping out of the Top 30 for the first time ever.  As true fans who stuck with the show know, this was no reflection on its exceptionally high quality, which never wavered.  It really had more to do with the limited attention spans of general TV viewers faced with even the slightest demands placed upon them.  This was a series that required the viewer to become invested, to at least a reasonable degree, in the characters and their interrelationships. There were no formulaic set-up lines and comic zingers aimed at a lowest-common-denominator audience.  This series was grounded in realism, albeit as viewed through the lens of one character's memory going back twenty years to his youth.  But due to the natures of the characters and the way they behaved and interacted with each other in realistic situations, humorous moments abounded, but so did dramatic and emotionally moving ones in approximately equal measure, such being life.  David Schwimmer, a fan of the show from the beginning and an actor appearing in four highly memorable episodes in Seasons Four and Five, posited during the course of his very insightful forty-minute interview (a DVD-set extra) that the show's essence was ""learning about how life worked...[and about] the joy and pain of living and growing up...[it's] consistently funny and consistently moving.""

Season Five (1991-92) looked back at Kevin Arnold's (Fred Savage) life as a 15/16-year-old in 1971-72, a tenth-grader (sophomore) in his first year at his middle-class suburban public high school.  (So it obviously wasn't in my state where we had four years of high school, freshman through senior years.)  The vicissitudes of one's social/romantic life are perceived as all-important at that age and provide ample fodder for both humor and emotional moments (some of the ""joy and pain"" Schwimmer was talking about).  Also associated with this age are the practicalities of finance (the need to have a part-time or summer job) and mobility (the need to acquire one's driver's license at 16, in most states).  Excellent episodes were crafted for these latter two occurrences.  The crisis of the first day of high school may have been exaggerated in Kevin's mind twenty years later (he still recalls the nightmare that day was shrouded in), but the unsettling experience of having a teacher inexplicably seeming to have it in for a student (Kevin in this case) is the type of injustice that I, and I'm sure many others, went through at some point during those years.

As it was throughout the entirety of the series, Vietnam remained a terrible backdrop to people's lives.  Without injecting a ""spoiler,"" I'll just say that Kevin's older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) and his big, goofy pal David ""Wart"" Wartshafter (Scott Menville), by dint of being 18-year-old males in 1972, entered into contact with the military bureaucracy.

Once their sister Karen (Olivia d'Abo) went off to college in Season Four, she ceased being a regular presence on the show; and this season she only appears in three of the 24 episodes.  But these appearances are huge in terms of story arc and impact on the family.  I'll again side-step spoilers, but it's well known that there is a resolution to her situation with her live-in lover Michael (the aforementioned David Schwimmer).

This season finds Kevin with a mix of old and new friends.  One new pal, Chuck Coleman (Andrew Mark Berman), is beset with nearly constant nervous tics that seem borderline pathological, representing a rare instance of ""The Wonder Years"" appearing to be going for laughs in an uncharacteristically facile, unearned way.  Super-academically-motivated best friend Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano), after a semester of private school his family could no longer afford, is back with the guys.  And then, of course, there's Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) and the inevitable reigniting of Kevin's and her long-simmering feelings for each other, making the Season Five finale a must-watch.

Those who abandoned ""The Wonder Years"" before or during Season Five really missed out on some of the best network series television ever.  And there is one more season still to come for the rest of us to enjoy on DVD.",1465430400,5,4304,5.091038406827881

It's interesting to see how they grew up in the late 60's/early 70's. I have all 5 seasons and I cant wait until season 6 is released. Great interviews as well",1464134400,,321,4.366666666666666
7721410,5,B01DPLS7I2,"The Wonder Years: Season Five continues the story of Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) growing up in the late 1960s. This season, Kevin enters McKinley High School, tries out for the soccer team, works part time at a hardware store, and gets his drivers license. He and Winnie (Danica McKellar) are dating other people. Best pal Paul (Josh Saviano) spends an unforgettable evening with a coed, and brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) has a girlfriend who might like Kevin more. Kevins parents, Norma (Alley Mills) and Jack (Dan Lauria), have to deal with an accidental mooning by Kevin, a neighborhood Christmas party with unanticipated disappointments, Waynes plans to quit school and enlist in the military, and a disastrous birthday dinner with Karen (Olivia dAbo) and her live-in boyfriend, whom she plans to marry.

In the episode Day One, Kevins status as cool guy in junior high completely evaporates as he awkwardly makes the transition to senior high. His teacher has pegged him as a troublemaker, and an annoying kid, Stuart (Adam Sneller), is the only person who wants to be his friend. In Hardware Store, Kevin must decide whether to quit the hardware store to work in the mall, where lots of girls hang out. Kodachrome finds Kevins popular English teacher deciding to grade in a non-traditional manner and getting in trouble with the schools administration. While his parents are away in The Lost Weekend, Kevins friends convince him to let them come over, but their misbehavior escalates quickly and turns the house into a disaster area. Broken Hearts and Burgers, the final episode of the season, chronicles the up-and-down relationship between Kevin and Winnie, as misunderstandings lead to hurt feelings.

The 4-disc DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the 1991-1992 season. Bonus extras include a walk-through of the sets with writer/producer Mark B. Perry; a feature about the women in Kevins life; and reminiscences by Olivia dAbo and David Schwimmer, who played Karens boyfriend, Michael. Also featured are close to three dozen songs as they were heard on the original broadcasts. Artists include Frankie Avalon, Joan Baez, Bread, James Brown, The Byrds, Canned Heat, The Archies, Joni Mitchell, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Linda Ronstadt, Sly & The Family Stone, Sonny & Cher, and The Turtles.",1463961600,4,2303,5.1550802139037435
7721411,5,B01DPLS7I2,Fred Savage was on 'Little Monsters' with Howey Mandel. Howey was in Howey Do- It. Fred's REAL brother was on Little Monsters.,1461456000,2,126,4.7727272727272725
7721412,5,B01DPLS7I2,"There are a lot of similarities in plotlines to the earlier seasons. Though I still got a lot of enjoyment watching these episodes, some of Kevin's new girlfriends were really cute. For a 16 year old, he looked more like a 13 year old. He even grew taller than Wayne, I especially enjoyed the 'Triangle' episode, seeing Kevin making out with Wayne's girlfriend who was 20. And Paul Pfeiffer's nose got really huge. There were only 2 episodes featuring Winnie, that was disappointing. And only 3 with Karen, some of the better episodes. The only real disappointment with this set are the new interviews, you know, I really got tired hearing Fred Savage, you know, every 5 seconds in the first few seasons, then Jason Hervey, you know in season 4, but now both Olivia d'Abo and David Schwimmer, you know, it was just too much..
