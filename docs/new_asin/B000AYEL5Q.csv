2397437,5,B000AYEL5Q,"If you own the NFL Films Superbowl I-III collection, you don't need to buy this item. I was disappointed. I thought it would have been produced by the Dallas Cowboys NOT NFL Films. I thought it would have included a recap of each of the Cowboys' seasons and then the Superbowl highlights. It does show all the 5 Superbowl highlight films produced by NFL Films but not a recap of each Cowboy season, only a recap of the NFL for each of those years. It is nice though to have all 5 Superbowl highlight films in one package. IF you don't already own the superbowl collection produced by NFL Films for all 30 superbowls, this is a great collection to own if your a Cowboy fan like myself.",1131408000,65,684,4.3515625

2397467,2,B000AYEL5Q,"Good Super Bowl highlights, but I want the story of the Cowboys Championship seasons, not a highlight film of the whole league.

2397472,5,B000AYEL5Q,"Absolutely love this product. Reminds me of the days before Romo, when there was just Aikman, Irvin, and Emmitt on the field going up and down the field on their opponents. Miss those days! This product is great! It came in on the estimated delivery time and in good condition!",1389830400,,277,4.56

2397475,2,B000AYEL5Q,"For people who are not well-versed in Cowboys history, I would imagine this recollection of the 5 Superbowl victories would be enlightening.  It provided nothing noteworthy for this lifetime Cowboy fan.  All the footage and sidebar stories were simply a review of things this average fan already knew.  This video trip down memory lane didn't quite know what it wanted to be.  I was disappointed in the lack of Superbowl footage.  The stories these videos tried to tell were also incomplete.....trying to fit stories in with highlights to cover 5 Superbowl seasons was two much to fit comfortably within two dvd's.

I would have rather seen more details and more Superbowl coverage one season separately than to try to squeeze them all into this compilation.",1376179200,,758,5.024
2397476,3,B000AYEL5Q,"I have only gone through 2 DVDs, but most of the things I keep seeing are about the entire league and not specifically focused on the Cowboys. Little disappointed.",1369440000,,163,4.655172413793103
2397477,4,B000AYEL5Q,I can't wait to give this to my dad for Father's Day. He's is a big Cowboys fan and will enjoy this. It was a more economical option than the other DVD set I wanted to get for him. The product was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner.,1368403200,,251,3.9411764705882355
2397485,5,B000AYEL5Q,A good collection of the five superbowls that the Dallas Cowboys have won.  These are repeats of the shows by NFL films.,1359158400,,120,4.454545454545454
2397486,5,B000AYEL5Q,Excellent product. Very good quality. Would recommend to anyone. If you like similiar items like this is the one for you!!,1359072000,,122,4.857142857142857
2397487,4,B000AYEL5Q,Good quality DVD but not the showstopper that expected.  Maybe more commentary or background stories would have made it a touchdown.,1358812800,,132,5.285714285714286
2397488,1,B000AYEL5Q,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

2397489,4,B000AYEL5Q,I was so young when I saw the boys in the 90's superbowls and I wanted to go back and watch the games over gain. This set was perfect for that and it really does a nice job of laying out the season and the  game highlights. It is really cool to see the images that I vaguely remember from my youth. How bout them Cowboys?! Emmitt Smith is still the man,1322092800,,352,3.888888888888889
2397490,5,B000AYEL5Q,I bought this for my dad who is the biggest cowboys fan right after me. He jumped up when. He opened the wrapping.,1294876800,,114,4.0
2397491,5,B000AYEL5Q,"This is a DVD which covers the 5 NFL championships of perhaps the NFL's most storied franchise:  the Dallas Cowboys.  It discusses their Superbowl victories in 1971, 1977, 1992, 1993 & 1995.  Each Superbowl time capsule is broken down into 2 segments.  The first is an overview of the entire season from a fan's perspective.  There is a discussion of the trends of the league, the rising stars, teams on their way up & the teams that thought they were contenders only to find out they were actually pretenders.

The second segment covers the Superbowl itself & reveals all of the overriding factors which led the Cowboys to victory.  Whether it be the Dallas running game which powered the '71 Cowboys or the relentless defense of the '77 & '92 teams, all relevant aspects of the games are discussed.  Not surprisingly, the sound, picture and production value of the time capsules get much improved when we get to the '92 season.

The special features on Disc #1 have bit pieces on Duane Thomas, Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach & the two venerable Dallas safeties, Cliff ""crash"" Harris and Charlie Waters.  On Disc #2 the special features cover Jimmy Johnson, Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith & Larry Brown.

The promo for this DVD is a bit mis-leading as it says ""NFL Super Bowl Collection - Dallas Cowboys by Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith.""  In fact, the only time we hear from Aikman is during the bit pieces on Irvin & Smith, and the only time we hear from Smith is during his own biographical piece.  So, those who believe these 2 will be the hosts of the dual DVDs are apt to be disappointed.

Also, of the personas covered, Larry Brown is a big-time reach.  Granted, the Cowboy faithful are thankful for his performance during Super Bowl XXX.  However, he was otherwise a marginal player @ best.  After that year, the Raiders signed him to a contract that was silly-big & his career promptly fizzled out.  There are a great many bigger names in the Cowboy pantheon whom they could have done a bio on instead of Brown (Tom Landry, Tony Dorsett & Troy Aikman, to name a few!).  Oh, well.  At LEAST they didn't do a bio on Jerry Jones.  It's his arrogance,  ineptitude & meddling that have impeded the franchise ever since he drove Jimmy out of town!

If you are a Cowboys fan, then this DVD set belongs in your collection.  If you're not a Cowboys fan, then you're most likely not reading this review in the 1st place.  Hence, IF you've read all of what I have to say, then most likely you will enjoy having this DVD!  NFL historian Steve Sabol has put together a great many works from the NFL archives. This one can be added to the list of his accomplishments.",1238803200,7,2651,4.540084388185654

8080755,4,B000AYEL5Q,"As a die hard Dallas Cowboys Fan I liked this 2 Disc box set but I didn't love it. They break down every Superbowl season Dallas won into two parts: what was going on around the league during that season, and then the actual Superbowl game between Dallas and the opponent. This is a great refresher in Cowboys History however there isn't a tremendous amount of game footage from the Superbowl games and the special features aren't very good at all. I would have liked to see more actual game footage, more special interviews with the stars, players, and coaches, and also a lot of what they show they repeat throughout the whole program but nevertheless its a good addition to any fans collection.",1446940800,2,697,4.629032258064516
