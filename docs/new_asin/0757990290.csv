174829,5,0757990290,"I have been a fan of Rush and by inclusion each member of the band.  After watching these videos I really gained a new found respect for this man who has turned percussion into an art form unlike other drummers before him.  I know that that is high praise indeed but after watching two videos of his I know now a little bit more about the music of Rush and the mind of a master of his craft.  If you are a true drummer, watch this video.  He as much to teach, to all of us, musician and fan alike.",1373932800,,497,3.94
174830,3,0757990290,"I gave this to a boss as a christmas gift. He has the setup where you can play drums while watching tv and they are digital drums. I thought when the description said, ""you can play along and learn some of the hits"" that he would enjoy it with his setup, but I guess its more of a watching type DVD",1370822400,,298,3.901639344262295

174832,5,0757990290,"This video shows Neil Peart (by Rush) playing and explaining his work process on the drums in Test For Echo CD (by Rush). A great drummer, a great video for drummers, a real class. Don't loose it!",1296604800,,196,4.324324324324325
174833,5,0757990290,"This is truly a great video to watch as a drummer, musician, or rush fan. I think the title says a lot when it says featuring music from ""Test for Echo"" so realize that the video is addressing this production as a work in progress -and rating it a 1 thinking otherwise is kind of silly.

Neil takes you through his kit, his set ups, his philosophies, and a few stories from his past. He comes across as quite a humble gentleman (also in burning for buddy) which makes the lengthy video very enjoyable.

I think that an intermediate drummer can even learn a few tips on how to approach Rush songs and I especially enjoyed his warm-up routine. Found it quite inspirational and a very enjoyable video that I have watched from time to time over the past few years, and I never get board of it. It is always nice to watch a true master as their work, to hear them reflect on it is a bonus.",1289347200,,884,4.224852071005917
174834,5,0757990290,"Excellent DVD!! great video coverage and angles. I you admire Neil Peart's work this DVD will not disappoint. You will not find this kind of
complete coverage of Neil playing and examples. DVD comes with sheet music for Test for Echo Album in 2 booklets in the DVD case.

174835,5,0757990290,"I have always been a fan of Neil since I started playing drums sometime in the mid-90's when I was in 3rd grade. I have the VHS version of this video, but it has still been watched at least five times a year since I got this for Christmas when it first came out. A man of great talent and humor, and almost makes the things he does look easy. Fan or not, this is a must buy for all drummers. One thing I recently noticed while watching this the most recent time was at the photo montage at the end of the second video was a picture that kind of depressed me; it appeared to be a shot of Neil from behind sitting in a stadium setting with who I could only assume to be his late wife and daughter...very sad",1231977600,,705,3.971830985915493

I'm from Brazil and I like to play the drum a lot...
For me, Neil Peart is a legend!!!
This DVD is good very much, he is good for to increase the creativity and to discovery of the new sounds.
I recommend for all drummers!

174837,5,0757990290,This is a great DVD. Very interesting and the production is top notch. Listening to a master musician discuss his craft is a rare treat and an absolute inspiration. If you were to learn the songs he plays on the DVD your drumming will improve greatly. Thanks for a great DVD to all involved. I am having a great time learning from it.,1219536000,,334,4.317460317460317
174838,5,0757990290,"I was anxiously awaiting this DVD as I knew it would appeal to my technical drumming soul.  And boy did it ever.  Caveat:  I would suggest that if you are a Neal Peart fan and not a drummer, and I know that there are a helluva a lot of you out there, that you may want to stick to reading his outstanding books, as this might be a bit much.  If you are a Neal fan and a drummer, well rock the f*** on, you'll love this.

The level of technical content, teaching, preaching, whatever you would want to call it (for me, it's preaching, and hey, Hallelujah) in this DVD is very high and might not appeal to the casual air drumming Neal fan.  I'm just saying that it might be a bit tedious for you.  That said, (even though you should buy it for a once or twice through diversion), it's worth the bits between the outstanding slow motion drumming where we find Mr. Peart, as always, affable, honest, focused, and with a fervor to share with everyone what he gets out of life, and drumming, with us all.

I loved it and if you are a drummer with hours (years) under your belt behind the kit, you will too.",1167782400,2,1100,4.15566037735849
174839,3,0757990290,"I found it a great idea to break down Neil Peart's drumming on a whole Rush album, but honestly I can't agree with the album choice for this project: ""Test for echo""? Come on, give me a break. I mean, I guess ""Moving pictures"" would have made a much proper choice, just to name one.

So, if you're looking for a DVD to actually show you *how* Neil does what HE does on some of the finest Rush tracks, let me suggest you ""Rush: Legendary Drum Licks"", pefrormed by Jamie Borden (Hal Leonard Corporation).

There you'll find an extremely accurate breakdown of  Spirit of radio, Freewill, YYZ, Red barchetta, Limelight, Tom Sawyer, New world man, and Subdivisions.

Besides, the DVD in question is a whole lot cheaper.",1145923200,6,714,4.5984251968503935
174840,5,0757990290,"Unless you are a drummer, amature or pro, you are not going to really enjoy this disk.  However, if you are, you are in for a real treat.  Neil delves into how he goes about working on a new Rush album.  He especially examins the insperation for the various rythms that he uses and their sources.  He also passes on a lot of tips on playing and how a drummer should approach writting orginal music.  This disk is both entertaining and informative for the any drummer regardless of experiance.

Enjoy!",1133049600,7,500,4.5
174841,5,0757990290,"The only mild issue I have with this DVD is that Neil can be a bit dry when explaining things.  That said, I've been listening to Rush since about '76, and Neil is one of the three primary influences on my playing (Bruford and Weckl are the others).  I was amused to see a review stating this playing was on the level of a ""second or third year student,"" or something to that effect.  Clearly, this is an example of *dramatic* wishful thinking.  Peart's playing is unique; there just ain't no one quite like him.

There's a good form to the structure of the DVD, which seems to mirror the process in how Rush write their material.  There are no weak elements to this production, except as I noted above (my opinion, folks).  What I haven't seen mentioned are comments on the accompanying text.  Each song has the percussion part written out for you to follow as well, and if you're familiar enough with Neil's playing, it's pretty fun to try and follow the music while watching the video.  :)

DEFINITELY a worthwhile investment for any musician, and a must-have for every drummer, no matter what style you play.  The techniques Neil has developed in his 30-year tenure with the band are nothing short of phenomenal.  His set is comfortable and appropriate to the music, and his style is the epitome of confident.  Nice to see he can still inspire after a career longer than many of his fans have been alive...",1117670400,7,1410,4.5476190476190474
174842,5,0757990290,"I am a huge Rush fan, owning every album to date, and this instructional video was simply outstanding.  Not only do you learn the beats from Test for Echo right from 'Pratt' himself, but you learn crucial info about the role and power a drummer has.  I have to admit, many parts, such as the assembly of his enormous drum kit, was a bit, well, pointless to many non-Rush fans who are merely seeking chops, but as a fan, I was captivated by his explanations and drum theory.

If your a Rush or Neil Peart fan whatsoever, consider buying this gem.  If not, best to choose another, such as Steve Smith.",1116979200,4,599,4.36936936936937
174843,5,0757990290,"I am not a drummer, but I am a pretty big Rush fan and a fan of Neil's books so I decided to check out this drumming video.  It definitely does not disappoint!  Neil gives demonstrations from all of the songs on the album Test For Echo, one of my favorite Rush albums and their peak cd from the 90's.  There is a lot of talking and technical terms, which is not as important to me because I play guitar, but to a drummer this might be a great video to learn from, if you are willing to listen.  A lot of it seems to be very advanced, and if you do not have a disposisition that favors Rush's technical prowess and Neil's perfectionist attitude toward drums, you might not like this.

About 2 or 3 songs from Test For Echo are not very good, but the rest are awesome.  You won't like listening to the song itself, but Neil's drumming is so mesmerizing that you can just focus on that and ignore the rest of the song.  All of the drumming demonstrations are extremely good, and at times seem quite unbelievable.  The reviewer who said that Neil was at the 2nd grade level is out of his mind.  Just rent this video, and be taken aback.  I honestly hope that non Rush fans will give this one a try, because it is quite worth it.",1109203200,4,1224,4.148305084745763
174844,5,0757990290,"This is another great example of Neil Peart. This DVD is an insight as to a great playing style and technique. Anyone who has anything off color to say about this DVD is just unkind and really did not watch the essence of this DVD. If you wish to watch Neil playing Drum solos he does one on every live album as well as on the DVD live from Rio. He also performs a drum solo at every live show. I feel that he has grown through the years and his playing style has advanced to another level. As with any progress things change. Neil shows maturity, control, insight as well as technique and most importantly whats on his mind. This is a side of Neil I have wanted to see for a long time. I feel that he has inspired many young people to pick up the sticks as well as some older players to expand. I say that unless you can do a better job of playing or writing the key is to sit and listen to what one of the best all time drummers has to say. I believe that Neil has once again outdone himself with an outstanding DVD masterpiece with modesty and humility. I applaud you Neil.",1108944000,4,1076,4.080188679245283
174845,1,0757990290,"Have to agree with the disappointed review. I was hoping to see more Neil and the Rush drumming that made him famous. This shows him talk about someone who changed his drum style. It was interesting to here him talk and it shows how much of a perfectionist he is. I still see him as one of the best in the world and can understand him wanting to explore other styles and continue to improve. I just wished he could have included more of the ""old stuff"". I found that Ian Paice of Deep Purple
has a good DVD for drummers. More live footage.",1102636800,3,539,4.1923076923076925
174846,5,0757990290,"Neil is absolutely the best!  This DVD only proves it even more.  Unlike one (in particular) who reviewed this DVD claiming to be a Rush fan (see ""disappointed""), I find Neil to be very expressive and not stagnating.  I also must find fault in the afore mentioned review, by saying that not everyone (probably very few real Rush fans) shares the same dislike for Test For Echo. I would dare say a vast majority LOVE the album.

As for ""No Thanks"" (Kissimmee,Florida)...  Arrogance is such a bad thing! Unlike what many Narrow-Minded individuals may think, passion is not something that others can rightly judge and to do so is a demonstration in ignorance (""...Quick to judge, quick to answer - Slow to understand"").  Neil only shows a gracious humility toward his astronomical abilities, and shows that he is only interested in expanding his skills through study, practice, and always striving for a higher level!",1102550400,5,914,4.902597402597403
174847,3,0757990290,"This is a good DVD to learn from if you are a drummer. For the first time, Rush fans get an inside look into the techniques behind one of the great rock drummers of our time. It will inspire you as a musician.",1092268800,6,209,3.883720930232558
174848,5,0757990290,"A drummer analyzing a drummer....
I have been playing over 17 years now, playing from Hard Rock to Jazz to classical drums and percussions.
Everything that I see and learn in this DVD has been thought to me at the Conservatory of music of Quebec in Montreal.
What I gain with this DVD is the concept of  The tools in the tool box  witch is one of the most important thing in playing drums and percussion. Every drummers went threw this moment of  heye !,I can put some colors in this partition !  or when we accidentally go of beat, you want to make it up to your fellow musician by doing something different so it sound good at the end.
I agree with Mr. Peart , when he say's , I never practice, I only play , or we (drummers) get in a world of our own when we play alone  and it is really there, alone, that the magic come out sometime. That trick that sound good as you play alone IS a tool for your toolbox.
This DVD IS the perfect tool for every drummer from beginner to professional whether you agree or not.
Every drummer knows that: we all are eternal student and there are always those sequences that happen out of nowhere and we never did before! Trust me, after 17 years of playing, its still happening to me! ..... And I'm teaching basic rudiments to kids that are starting !
Conclusion : this DVD is absolutely priceless and a must, to understand in a  normal  language what you should know about drumming. We, drummers , are not making noise we create the basic, the foundation , of what is going to be called a melody or just simply a song.
Regard ,

174849,5,0757990290,"One of the best instructional videos ever made. Neil has gotten better with time, aged like fine wine. Too many people that think they know Neil are stuck in the past. The songs on Test For Echo are more simple in general than Rush's earlier stuff, and in true Neil Peart fashion, the Professor shows how he spent painstaking hours coming up with just the right parts to compliment the songs, as he has never failed to do. The old drum parts were complex because the songs themselves had that quality, and so he always played accordingly with taste to suit the music. If he played with speed and power and fury on Test For Echo, it would sound out of place and dare I say it, overplayed, and Neil has never played anything out of place. This DVD is definitely worth buying, and this IS coming from a REAL fan speaking the truth. If you're disappointed by this DVD, you must be disappointed with Rush in general.",1086220800,4,911,4.428571428571429
174850,2,0757990290,"I remember the first time I watched The Grace Under Pressure Tour Video which also was my first time that I saw Rush live. Neil Peart was already my hero back then, with the intelligent and progressive playing and perfect writing that I heard from the Rush recordings, but I can not explain how shocking it was for me to see him play live with such energy, power and passion which not only shook the drum-kit, the ground and the concert hall but my mind as well. Those images changed my drumming style and my whole concept of musical understanding. I've been a Peart fanatic ever since and I always will be...

This DVD was supposed to be everything I've been waiting for...Being a professional drummer and a hard-core Peart fan for about 15 years, knowing every fill in every song (like many of you out there reading this review) I could not wait to watch ""A work in progress"".

Unlike many reviewers here I was totally disappointed. What I found was a person who in his own search of a new self, lost many qualities which made him what he is. In this DVD what you are going to see is a different Peart, who aside from changing his grip changed his powerful and passionate style. The intelligent playing and perfect song-writing are still there but the power and passion and energy are unfortunately not. Altough the process that he went through and the wish for self-improvement should be appreciated, I can't help but ask ""if it ain't broke why fix it?"".

After all Neil Peart is certainly not a drumming hero for playing in orbital motions, or a circular set-up or because of Freddy Grueber. He surely is not as technical as Dave Weckl or Dennis Chambers and he will never be at least not in the Jazz and Fusion Department. However when it comes to power, passion, and creating the pulse of rock, the aforementioned names could not even come close to Neil. Neil is a unique drummer creating incredible drum-parts, incorporating different percussions into rock drumming, signature rhtyms and fills, and most important of all he does all this with incredible power and passion which comes straight from the heart.

I guess that he also wasn't after all too pleased with the new direction that he took, as when he came back after his long break, he came back much more like the old Neal while keeping the newly gained qualities at a reasonable level.

I would have liked to see the ""Real"" Professor playing classics like The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, The Enemy within, etc.. instead of this stuff. At least this was what I hoped or NEEDED to see.",1082419200,12,2564,4.601750547045952
174851,5,0757990290,"Prehaps one of the best drummers in the world today and all you have to do to learn some of his licks is pop in the DVD.
I've played drums for 14 years now and I would attribute probably 70% of my licks and style to this man so as you can see I had to have this when it came out.
This DVD not only contains the songs from the Test For Echo album and how to play it but how Neil came to be the drummer he is today.  He talks about the mechanics behind the new style that he has implamented into his playing that he learned from Freddy Gruber and explanes why they work for him and how they could work for you.  Neil also disects the songs and goes over the hard fills.
The only draw back to this video is that he dose not play the fills slower him self but slows down the film.  This is not anything to be concerned about though.  The DVD also contains a preformance only feature that lets you view his playing the whole Test For Echo album.
So if you are a drummer buy this.",1068508800,14,974,3.904040404040404
174852,4,0757990290,"All things considered, ""Test for Echo"" was the perfect album for Neil to do an instructional video all, especially for beginning drummers; he tones down the amount of fills and pure techincal playing to focus on the songs as a whole, as well as his own pulse, or groove.  (Although the Rush fan in me definitely wishes he did a video like this for all his albums).  As he breaks down each song, one can realize how much goes into even the most basic level of drumming. As a side note, it helped me to appreciate ""Test for Echo"" to a much greater degree, particularily deceptively simple songs like ""Half the World"" and ""Carve Away the Stone"".  Equally worthy to Rush live videos like ""A show of Hands"" and ""Grace Under Pressure""...",1059782400,5,731,4.5227272727272725
174853,5,0757990290,"Words cannot describe the pure magic that Neil's drumming is. This is the closest you will ever get to see him, and even if I do not agree with his ""circular motion"" technique, I did learn a ton of things that helped me in my drumming, and most importantly, in my drive and vision as a musician and a human being.
Neil is truly an enlightened one, and getting the chance to see and hear such a reclusive person open up a little bit is worth the 3 pints of blood you'll need to sell to buy this DVD.",1059350400,6,498,4.040404040404041

It has been awhile since I've listened to any rock and when I learned of the latest album, I quickly began to surf the web. Long and behold, I found ""A Work In Progress"".
This DVD was exciting!  To see and hear Neil discuss drumming was great and it really shows his intelligence in how he described the various phases of his contributions to the band.  Neil speaks well and has a good vocabulary.  Not common for some rock drummers.  I have played every Rush song on the the drums except for the latest album.  I now feel closer to this amazing counterpart of music.  Having Neil in my home to watch at random is a good honor to my collection of DVD's.

But, there is much more on the DVD.  First, even if you are not interested in the technical stuff, there is a ""performance only"" track on the DVD, so it is basically watching a video of all of the TFE songs, with great close-ups and angles on Neil.
The other option is to watch all of the videos and after each one Neil explains the drum parts, etc.  I am kind of lost with this stuff, but it is nice to hear Neil speak, as he is not accesbile very much in other forums (i.e. interviews, etc.).
There is also stuff in the beginning of the DVD about how Neil became interested in drumming, how he met Rush, etc.
The only thing I was dissapointed about is that it would be cool to see this same thing with albums I like more (i.e. A Farewell to Kings, Moving Pictures, Presto, Signals, Vapor Trails, etc.)",1041638400,35,960,4.172972972972973

Mr. Peart goes into to so much detail on his drumming most of it step by step.  I just finished reading ""Ghost Rider"" and now after watching the DVD, I realize that my respect for this man continues to grow more and more.  Please purchase this DVD.

174858,5,0757990290,This is a must have for drummers or fans. This DVD is like getting a private lesson from the professor. Neil starts with his style & how he changed after 30 years with the fine tutelage of Professor Freddy Gruber. Neil changed his style from match to traditional grip & found he had more control & fluidity. Neil plays each song then breaks it down by part & gives explanation of technique. There is also slow motion to help with the understanding of the parts. The accompanying book with the DVD lays out the key parts of the song.,1021852800,19,532,4.383838383838384

Neil as I expected is an excellent teacher and does a wonderful job explaining each song in beautiful detail and example.  Every song from Test For Echo is played by Neil and afterwards he explains the major parts of the song and explains the what and whys of why he did what he was trying to accomplish through his drum parts.  Neil plays the drums to backing tracks sans drums and he is just such a master at the art of drumming.  The majority of the video takes place inside a studio, but he is shown out in nature, rowing a boat, walking through snow in snowshoes and is even shown on a back porch demonstrating how he warms up on a practice pad.  Nature is used to explain his new techinique by speaking in terms of roundness.  His drum study with drum guru Fred Gruber is gone over in great detail and Neil talks of how a new approach of drumming was taken on.  A definite must have!",1020470400,52,1046,4.301020408163265

I have really enjoyed the depth that this goes into. Neil shares some insightful information into the construction of the songs beyond just the percussion arrangements. The interludes of philosophical discussion are interesting too. The accessibility that will come with the DVD format will only make this more fun. Guess I gotta' buy it!",1019779200,3,544,4.7368421052631575

I can play all of the Rush drum pieces, and must say that the drumwork included on this video is not vintage Neil. The Test For Echo album is documented throughout, and Neil plays along with all of that album's songs, and nothing else. Although insight on Neil's creation of drum parts is interesting, I feel this video could have been edited to fit on one tape. It is rather slow paced, and is geared more towards a drum novice. Neil switched to traditional grip for most of this album, and I don't understand why. His playing is less impressive on this album than any before it. On the Test For Echo tour, Neil used match grip for all of the previous Rush songs, and it was much more powerful, and active. I am not arguing against traditional grip, but just feel that Neil is much more proficient at using match grip. If it isn't broke, why fix it? Instead of A Work In Progress, I'd rather see Neil at the top of his game, using match grip, on a collection of more active drum pieces than this album includes, and a few drum solo pieces which Neil is especially gifted.",1014422400,6,1153,4.293577981651376

Since then, outside of buying the albums (funny how we still call them ""albums"") and getting the tour books at the concerts, info on Rush was hard to come by.  'A Work in Progress' is such a valuable treasure to a fan like me I can't put it in words.  There have been two things in my life I have purchased - both $60 bucks - that have been the best investments I have ever made:  a radio-flyer wagon I bought for my son and this 2-tape set.  Thank you, Neil, for sharing a little piece of your world with us.  This actually made me appreciate 'Test for Echo' a whole lot more.",989971200,18,767,4.08
174864,5,0757990290,"This video is EVERYTHING you're hoping it will be.  Neil describes in minute detail the philosophy underlying his style of playing-  he communicates verbally with the same rapid fire clarity and sincerity that  is so evident in his playing.  This is a priceless instructional video not  just for drummers, but for any professional engaged in perfecting his/her  own work in progress.  Inspiring, affirming, exhilirating.. spectacular  sequences of him in the studio- just what you'd imagine, but clearer,  steadier-  the camera is as curious as you are.  This video is the medium  you've been waiting for to communicate to others why you've loved Rush for  so long, and why you admired Neil as a musician, philosopher, and Zen  master.",962841600,24,735,5.11864406779661
174865,5,0757990290,"This video turned out to be better than I could have imagined.  Neil Peart's discussion of percussion techniques, including his transition from match style to traditional style drumming, is awe inspiring. This video is  a must have for any drummer or fan of Neil Peart.",959126400,10,269,4.955555555555556
174866,5,0757990290,"What can I say?  Three hours of Neil Peart playing drums and lecturing on the fine art of percussion. Shows Neil playing every song on the Test for Echo Album.  Detailed explainations of various drumming methods and  concepts are also included, along with a poster and a music book for all  songs. You need to buy this now!",945388800,20,323,4.517241379310345
174867,5,0757990290,"Outstanding! While I am a musician, I am not a percussionist. Regardless, Neil's presentation here is worthy of the price it takes to find it. He is extremely informative, clear, direct, and leads the viewer on a line which  is easy to follow. I am impressed with his abilities as philosopher and  perpetual student of the world as much as I am with his musical talent.  Neil, fine job!",945043200,7,386,4.565217391304348
174868,5,0757990290,"A huge fan of virtuoso musicians, I had no choice but to buy Neil Peart's ""A Work In Progress"".  This video is awesome, and Neil Peart is a genius on drums.  I myself am not a drummer, but I love watching guys like  Neil....people who have mastered their instrument.  If you like Neil's  playing style, check out Dream Theater, anything by Steve Vai or Joe  Satriani and Yngwie Malmsteen.  Excellent!",940032000,7,400,4.628571428571429

Great instructional video!  True, it is for a slightly older work, but many of the riffs are still in use, and are broken down to make them easier to understand, practice, and play along.  The historical significance of some of the riffs are discussed which adds to the overall value of the experience.",1466121600,,479,6.587301587301587

7795439,5,0757990290,This DVD is amazing.  Neil is a true master at his craft.  Not just some guy that used to have long hair that bangs on the skins but a true master and composer.  I don't know if you could find anyone out there that is as devoted to his craft as Neil is to his....I've always been a fan since I was a kid and I will be until the day I die.,1396224000,,338,3.6027397260273974
7795440,4,0757990290,"It is very interesting video, mainly for Rush fans, despite it is for a no so famous Test for Echo Album. It loses a star due to the absense of portuguese  or even spanish captions.",1385683200,,181,4.171428571428572
7795441,5,0757990290,"As I said, this video is a Master Class, NOT a ""Method"" DVD. There are no licks or beats. Rather, Mr Peart plays a number of Rush songs and explains his drum set-up and playing methods and compositional techniques. The DVD is also over 3 & 1/2 hours long!!! Not a one sitting experience. Just watching half of this video has me COMPLETELY re-thinking the arrangement of my drum kit.

BTW - The red envelope people have this for rent. WELL worth the time! :D",1379462400,,457,4.376470588235295
