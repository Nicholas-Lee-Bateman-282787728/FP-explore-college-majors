8717232,4,B00XZZMY2E,"The picture quality is absolutely fantastic. It's a great set that sounds and looks perfect. However this Blu-ray loses a star for a real lack of features. I purchased the set for less than $25 and that's a great price for a season of a show with bonus episodes, but I wouldn't recommend paying more than that because that's all you really great. Good set, would have been better with more features, try to get it on sale.",1502236800,,422,4.423076923076923

8717237,5,B00XZZMY2E,"One of the best slice of life anime out there.  My only real complaint about this set is, the Ura-On! shorts aren't here (that also goes for the season 2 sets).  That's a very minor complaint, since they don't really add anything, but it would have been nice to have them.  This is just a fantastic anime, either way, though.",1488412800,,325,4.383333333333334
