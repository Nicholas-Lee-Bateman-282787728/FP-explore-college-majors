7986110,5,B00008OSEA,Absolut classic. In the vein of Elvira and Mystery Theatre 3000. Not PC by a long shot.,1479772800,,87,4.176470588235294
7986111,1,B00008OSEA,Horrible movie! Didn't make it pass ten minutes. Nothing like kung pow.,1417305600,,71,5.0
7986112,5,B00008OSEA,"One of Troma Films' better movies!! If you can't find a hardcopy or don't want to pay over $100 for one, this is the way to go, or go Trims Films and get a digital download for $1.99. Not sure if the Troma digital download can be played on the Kindle.",1341619200,,251,3.9411764705882355
7986113,5,B00008OSEA,"I have seen this movie before, but I read a review (and I think it may have been here) that suggested Woody Allens' ""What's Up Tiger Lilly"" was a better example of this film genre. WRONG! Woody Allens' film is a James Bond knockoff, which means no real martial arts action, just halting, no contact, 1950s hollywood fight choreography. It is silly, but moves so slowly that its ""humor/time"" ratio is much lower than this film.

I don't really want to rip ""What's Up Tiger Lilly"", but I regard my purchase of it (in place of this film) to be a mistake.",1117497600,,551,4.401960784313726
7986114,5,B00008OSEA,"I first watched this movie on cable several years ago with my brother and have waited for it to be on DVD. Like the other reviews - this is an old kung fu movie dubbed not like most kung fu movies- where all is supposed to be serious but this time in the Troma tradition for the fun of it. If you watch it you too will chant ""Tuna Melt Tuna Melt"" or ""Unganda no Ugaanda"" . The perverted little brother, the lead actress' foul mouthed mother, Elvis, fish face woman, the farts when wrestling and of course the burping woman who hums. This movie is one of the few where I fell off the couch laughing so hard. This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. Too good.",1097625600,8,661,4.092307692307692
7986115,4,B00008OSEA,"THIS Film IS rated - even though the amazon description above says it is not...and it is definetly R!  I bought this, thinking mild sex and fart jokes (ala Kung Pow humor) but was surprised to find so many obscenities and overt sexual references.  I'm not a prude, but I'd hoped to share this with my preteens...NO WAY!  It IS hilarious, however, so if you don't have young kids around, ENJOY!",1088726400,6,393,4.507042253521127
7986116,5,B00008OSEA,"This movie is absolutely hilarious.  Dubbed over [] flicks are always entertaining but this is just absurd.  Many many fart and sex jokes thrown in and (perversions aside) the script makes completely no sense.  Fortunately, this happens to work for this movie.  A must have for anyone who loves little unknown gems of movies.",1060560000,5,325,4.962962962962963
7986117,5,B00008OSEA,"This movie has it all! Kung fu fights, wisecracking ugly guys, and an Elvis impersonator. Basically, these guys took an old 70's kung fu flick and dubbed over all the dialogue. Hilarity ensues as our hero tries to beat up the ugly guys and get the girl. If you liked that movie, ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" then you will love this one.",1051833600,5,335,4.333333333333333
