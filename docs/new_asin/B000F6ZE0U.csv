8118202,5,B000F6ZE0U,"Contrary to what Nancy opined in her review of this video, Dr. Stott is absolutely factual.  In a letter to John Adams dated 4/11/1823, Thomas Jefferson expressed his belief in God, rejection of the Holy Trinity, and his disbelief in the Virgin Birth, comparing it to a myth of the birth of Minerva from the brain of Jupiter.  He believes in the person and teachings of Jesus Christ, but not that he was ""fully God and fully man.""  I have completed 2 of the Lectures and look forward to the rest.",1451088000,,496,4.428571428571429
8118203,5,B000F6ZE0U,I've seen 1 & 2 so far and I love how John Stott doesn't speculate but is so learned and articulates it in a way that is understandable. I highly recommend it!,1402617600,,159,4.0
8118204,5,B000F6ZE0U,"There are many sides to any story, many times the known truth get lost in the lost in the search for the desired truth or perceived truth.  This learned gentleman  presents the facts as they are known and substantiated by factual evidences. Of course one must be willing to accept what is presented or their is not use in listening.",1391817600,,332,4.516666666666667
8118205,5,B000F6ZE0U,"This is a 2 part series as far as I know... a nice compliment to the Bible's teachings. I may have some biases to this movie because I love to learn as much as I can about Christ, yet, this movie is one to hit some of the highlights to know some of the most intriguing facts that a condensed movie may offer with limited time.",1379462400,,326,3.9545454545454546
8118206,3,B000F6ZE0U,"I did not have much problem with his lecture until he got to Thomas Jefferson.  I knew that what he was saying about Jefferson was not true in relation to the so called ""Jefferson Bible"" which does not exist.  Jefferson took the passages from the Bible regarding the life of Jesus and incorporated them into a pamphlet to help the Indians at that time have a gradual introduction to Christianity.  It made me question if what other information he was presenting was factual.",1377561600,,474,4.686746987951807
8118207,5,B000F6ZE0U,"Listen to this lecture and you will learn so much about how the ""organized church"" - good or bad - has understood and presented Christ the Savior to the world. Each perspective is presented with its strengths and weaknesses. You will know whether each view of Him is Biblically accurate or not. Most all of these ideas of who Christ is are still present in the world in some way or in some areas. This is worth knowing.",1372550400,2,419,4.384615384615385
8118208,5,B000F6ZE0U,"One of the greatest evangelical Bible teachers & most prolific Christian authors of our time, Rev. Dr. John Stott presents a stirring defense of the historical Jesus and a wealth of insight on the impact Christ has made in people's lives. For over half a century, John Stott has been an ambassador for Christ and has authored a number of books including christian classics ""Basic Christianity"" and ""The Cross of Christ"".

This series of four lectures by Dr. Stott was recorded at the London Lectures in Contemporary Christianity. In the whole series, he provides a lasting legacy as he presents the Jesus of the New Testament and of church history. The four lectures contained in the series are:

Lecture 1: The Original Jesus - Dr. Stott shows from the pages of Scripture the uniqueness of Jesus and how He is the center of history. He unfolds how the New Testament, in all of its parts with diverse but complementary perspectives, joins in a chorus of witness and praise to Jesus Christ as Savior of the world and the Lord of history.

The lecture outline is as follows :

1. The Four Gospels
2. Jesus and Paul
3. The Letters of Paul
4. Three Jewish Authors

The lecture reaffirms that the New Testament, with its rich diversity of authors, background and emphasis, shows a remarkable consistency in its picture of Jesus.

Lecture 2: The Ecclesiastical Jesus - Over the centuries the church has grown in its appreciation of the fullness of the person and work of Jesus. In this two-part lecture, Dr. Stott shows the glory of Christ and what He means for us and our world. He shows from history how the church has explored the reality of Christ from many directions. Apostle Paul wrote of false teachers who proclaimed 'another Jesus', and in every generation the Church has portrayed him differently, with varying degrees of accuracy. Can we avoid the opposite extremes of accommodation and irrelevance? He discusses the following interpretations, affirming their strengths and challenging their limitations:

1. Christ the Complete Fulfillment
2. Christ the Unique God-man
3. Christ the Perfect Monk
4. Christ the Feudal Debtor
5. Christ the Heavenly Bridegroom
6. Christ the Gracious Saviour
7. Christ the Humanitarian Teacher
8. Christ the Social Liberator
9. Christ the Jewish Messiah
10. Christ the Global Lord

Lecture 3: The Influential Jesus - In this two-part lecture, Dr. Stott provides a rapid bird's eye view of the remarkable effects that Jesus has had on some of the greatest followers and change agents in all history. He shows how Jesus has been the motivator, inspiration, source of strength, model and goal for diverse heroic efforts. He selects nine Christians across the ages and shows how Jesus influenced their lives. Included among them are:

* The Ministry of Compassion -- Father Damien
* The Love for Children -- Thomas Bernardo
* Zeal for the Honor of Christ's Name -- Henry Martyn
* The Missionary Spirit -- Roland Allen

Lecture 4: The Eternal Jesus - The original Jesus is also our contemporary. In this final lecture, a two-part presentation, Dr. Stott expounds on the comprehensive and compelling vision of Jesus Christ the living Lord as set forth through the eight visions of the Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation. He begins with guidance on principles of interpretation to be used in approaching this amazing final book of the Christian New Testament. He then treats each of the eight visions providing a valuable overview to the entire Book of Revelation, climaxing with chapters 21-22 with Christ's coming as the Bridegroom to claim His bride and the new heaven and the new earth. This lecture looks at the many ways he is presented in the Book of Revelation and asks how we should respond to him today.

The lecture series sets forth the beauty and uniqueness of Jesus in a most memorable way to believers. These videos make a superb church group study on the most important subject of all - Jesus Christ. All the four lectures of the series are available separately on individual DVDs as well as on a single DVD set.",1214524800,,4057,4.8652173913043475
