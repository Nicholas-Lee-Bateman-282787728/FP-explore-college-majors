7269048,4,B00YTSH2WS,"I really enjoy this movie.  Potential viewers should keep in mind that this movie is not for everyone, or for casual horror movie fans looking for a scare.  It has a late 70's early 80's low-budget foreign drive-in aesthetic, and contains a lot of winks and salutes to the greats of the Italian giallo genre.  The plot is supposed to be ridiculous, the dialogue is supposed to be stilted and absurd, the gore is supposed to be copious.

It's not perfect, but as a nod to the vanishingly small fan base of particular types of largely forgotten and no longer produced movies, it's a pretty great way to spend a couple hours.  Knocked off one star because I cannot stand Paz De La Huerta, but everyone else is magnificent and she's not too prevalent.",1442793600,2,747,4.544776119402985
7269049,1,B00YTSH2WS,"I can't give lower than ZERO stars.  There goes money and time down the drain.  No point to the movie.  No plot.  Bad acting taken to an entirely new LOW level of stupid.  Worse than bad porn, even with the boob shots.  Got 3/4 of the way through and began nodding off.  Do not waste your time on this garbage.  You want to watch this type of movie done right?  Watch Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.",1442448000,2,400,4.226666666666667

7269052,5,B00YTSH2WS,The greatest Italian Giallo thriller made in Canada. The movie is both spoof and perfect replication of the '70s era genre. Amazingly entertaining with just the right amount of Udo Keir.,1441497600,5,186,5.032258064516129
7269053,5,B00YTSH2WS,"An absolute blast! It's a hilarious spot on homage to the Giallo, showcasing the ridiculousness of a genre at it's most outrageous.",1434153600,9,131,5.0

7269067,4,B00YTSH2WS,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in 2015. A good satire of Italian horror very funny and so many red herrings through out. Has all the elements of a good horror movie Blood,Gore and Boobs.  Astron 6s best movie to date.",1457308800,3,226,4.255813953488372

7269069,1,B00YTSH2WS,"One wonders if the guys who made this understand what makes Giallo movies entertaining.
This isn't a genre that needs to be made funny, they're already borderline ridiculous. There's no need for extra cheese. You don't need to ham it up.
There was about enough good material for a ten minute skit not a 90+ minute film.

The proof is in the pudding, this was on eBay five minutes after I finished it.",1456531200,,400,4.47945205479452
7269070,5,B00YTSH2WS,"If you're into older Italian horror, and giallo films, then this would be a fun movie to watch. I had a blast watching it. The gore scenes were very well done.",1452297600,,159,4.161290322580645
7269071,5,B00YTSH2WS,"My husband and I first encountered Astron-6 with Manborg, and were so pumped about this. Know that this movie is deeply funny, and you probably won't be able to appreciate it if you've never see the esoteric, stylized old Italian movies this is sending up.

If you have, though, and if you're ready to appreciate some hilarious and amazing artistry, this movie is (quite frankly) one of the best things ever.",1451952000,,408,4.746478873239437
7269072,5,B00YTSH2WS,"IMO, this film is the best so far from Astron-6. As a fan of the types of films referenced within here, it's fun to see how they slip them in. If you love Fulchi and love to laugh, get this!",1451347200,,190,3.775
7269073,5,B00YTSH2WS,Astron 6 is amazing.  I hope they keep doing more movies.,1451347200,,57,4.181818181818182
7269084,5,B00YTSH2WS,"PLOT...
Rey Ciso was once the greatest editor the world had ever seen. Since a horrific accident left him with four wooden fingers on his right hand, hes had to resort to cutting pulp films and trash pictures. When the lead actors from the film hes been editing turn up murdered at the studio, Rey is fingered as the number one suspect. The bodies continue to pile up in this absurdist giallo-thriller as Rey struggles to prove his innocence and learn the sinister truth lurking behind the scenes.

Astron-6 never fail to entertain with their unusual yet brilliant ideas, these filmmakers really know their genres and love the old VHS classic era of movies, Fathers day is a fantastic over the top violent horror movie, Manborg is also a great cheesy throw back to 80's sci-fi and the editor takes us back to the good old 70's, its a Dario Argento style thriller/slasher movie with a great story and a fantastic cast, the movie really does take you back and looks and feels spot on with the details even down to the dubbed voice acting, there is plenty of classic bloody gory violence all done on a great looking budget and practical effects too, there's ample female nudity and the soundtrack score is awesome! The cast is great, all the usual Astron-6 faces are there as well as some great appearances from other stars like Udo Kier (Mother of tears, Blade) Paz de la Huerta (Nurse 3D) Laurence R. Harvey (The human centipede 2 and 3) if your a big lover of the 70's slasher horror thrillers this is a must see, its charming, funny, gory, erotic and one of the best movie releases of 2015

7269085,5,B00YTSH2WS,"Step right up ladies and gents, we've got a great one here! This is a blend of old school  giallo with Argento gore and cinematography,and inspired indie storyline and filmmaking by the wizards at ASTRON 6..............how could you lose?  While others may find some guffaws with this production, I'd sit back and enjoy the ride, there's plenty to applaud here, with Udo Kier, Laurence R. Harvey, Paz De La Huerta, and the usual suspects from Astron 6. A real treat for fans of Italian films past, and an enjoyable pic for anyone in the mood for something a bit different.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1447804800,,593,4.794117647058823
7269086,3,B00YTSH2WS,"I love all of the Astron-6 efforts, but while I applaud the work that went into this movie I'm left feeling that this is the least entertaining entry in the team's history. To be sure the film looks great and the actors do a great job with the material, but really the gimmick of spoofing Giallo is better suited to a short-film than a feature and it starts to wear really thin by the third act. The problem is that the film is stuck halfway between satire and farce never quite succeeding at either. You see elements of the Astron-6 comedic sensibility showcased in Father's Day, but the jokes are too subtle and intermittent to make it a comedy yet when they do pop up they are too over the top to allow you to take the film seriously. I certainly enjoyed the references to the classic Giallo films and if you're a fan of those films then you will get a kick out of getting those references, but its a bit of slog for that limited payoff since the rest of the narrative is as muddled as that of many of the films that The Editor is lovingly poking fun at.

I do highly recommend the ""making of"" documentary included in the extras. It's worth the price of the disc just for that as you get to see just how difficult it was for the guys to produce a film of this caliber on such a limited budget. So if you love Astron-6 or are a true fan of Italian genre-cinema of the 70s and 80s then its worth a purchase. I'm afraid that everyone outside of those two categories would be left disappointed and scratching their heads.",1444867200,3,1520,4.259515570934256
7269087,5,B00YTSH2WS,"Fans of the Golden Age of Italian horror will find utter glee and cry from laughter at this brilliant Canadian spoof. The filmmakers and actors definitely did their work on this film, which hilariously nods at all the greats - Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci and the not-so-great Umberto Lenzi. From the moment you see the opening credits, you have a good idea of what you're getting into: the all-caps sanserif fonts, the odd camera zooms, the oh-so-obvious dubbing, blood-spattered murder scenes, horrible film props, and the eyes - from big, brown eyes to glowing blind eyes. Oh, the eyes! Look for nods at The Beyond, Suspiria, The Cat O' Nine Tails, and even Nightmare City in this gem.
While this film has a nod to the earlier Giallo and Italian horror films, this storyline has a brilliant blend-in of the films that deal in the Supernatural that, along with Zombi films, dominated the Italian horror circuit in the late 70s and early 80s.
Also keep an eye out for references in the background: The mock Giallo posters in the Editor's room are priceless. One had me in tears.
If nothing I've referenced means anything to you, this film probably isn't the one for you. Those who consider themselves die-hard horror fans should first check out the Mario Bava collection on Amazon Prime Instant, and also rent some Lucio Fulci films before truly enjoying this masterpiece.

Italian horror has just been begging to be spoofed for way too long. It's great to finally see this done in such a brilliantly hilarious way.

I'm going to watch it again. What a hoot.",1444348800,5,1569,4.764705882352941

7269090,5,B00YTSH2WS,"This film is awesome! If you ever liked any Lucio Fulci films or Giallo style in general you will enjoy the hell out of this movie. SO many nods to other films, bad dubbing, stupid over the top dialogue, etc. And Carpenter Brut does music for this film, which is awesome 70's//80's feel electronic french horror synthwave (Yeah I don't know how else to describe this genre).",1443398400,2,374,4.597014925373134
7269091,1,B00YTSH2WS,I hated it. A friend of mine likes to watch cheap made movies. I would have given it 0 stars.,1443139200,,93,3.7
7269092,5,B00YTSH2WS,"Seriously, the most entertained I have been in a LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGG time!! I bought this purely based on the fact that it is a Scream/Shout Factory release and I am thoroughly pleased w/ all their releases. TI went into this knowing NOTHING about it and NOT reading too far into customer reviews, & it HIGHLY exceeded my expectations. Here's the facts you need to know going into this in order to truly LOVE the film:
1: This is a STRAIGHT UP homage to 1970's Italian Slasher Horror, literally, it looks as if it was made then(minus the exceptional clarity)
2: The music is synthy and retro all the way
3: The timeline seems to be 1970's
4: when I say a STRAIGHT UP homage I mean EVERYTHING 70's INCLUDING: poorly dubbed dialogue, weird cuts, abrupt zoom-in's/zoom outs but most importantly RIDICULOUS dialogue
5: It is HILARIOUS w/out actually making jokes, the puns are in the bad dialogue
6: Plenty of neon lights, nudity, mustaches and gore to keep your eyes fully entertained
7: The final fact, DO NOT go into this movie expecting a lot and you will be in very pleased

I think this stands as the funniest Horror film I have EVER seen. I was laughing so hard I had to rewind it several times and I hate interrupting the film. It was so utterly ridiculous w/ lines like ""Here let me light that for you, OH! I almost forgot I don't have any fingers left on this hand"" said in such a casual friendly voice, I was dying. There was actually a few scenes that genuinely scared me too, like the main character noticing the eyes in his bedroom. Good old-fashioned spookiness. A++ to the filmakers for making such a PERFECT love note to the Italian Horror films of the 70's, it basically out-genre's the genre. I have been recommending this to so many friends!",1443052800,6,1756,4.539432176656152
7269093,3,B00YTSH2WS,"Good imitation of Gaillo - but goes ""over the top"" in some of the characterizations which ruins what could have been a great satire - it makes the film get tiring to watch about 1/3 to 1/2 way through.  Unfortunate.",1442793600,,215,4.375
8719156,5,B00YTSH2WS,Aston 6 killer film not non stop gore.. yet enough for most all horror fans.  This is there Gallo film and they did it well.,1520208000,,124,3.96
8719157,5,B00YTSH2WS,"The crew from Astron-6 create another film that I love to revisit. As a big fan of 1970s/1980s Argento and Fulci film, The Editor was just something I was just bound to love. Its a great homage/ spoof of those great Italian films I love. The Editor might be my favorite Astron-6 release so far, even though I love Father's Day and Manborg.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next.

The Scream Factory Blu Ray looks and sounds great.  The cover art is fantastic for this film. As always the Scream Factory release as a good amount of entertaining extras.",1504224000,,562,4.384615384615385

8719159,4,B00YTSH2WS,"As a lover of movies directed by men like Argento, Fulci, and Bava, I found it impossible not to enjoy the absurd lunacy of The Editor.
I never expected to see a tongue-in-cheek homage to good old fashioned Italian horror. This had all of the over the top art house qualities one would expect from Argento combined with plenty of gore and gratuitous sex like what you'd find with either Bava or Fulci...and all of it tied together with the most ridiculously convoluted story.
This is a horror comedy of a different variety.
There's even a book entitled 'The Three Mothers' seen near the end of the movie, adding icing to the cake of this homage to Italian horror masters.",1485820800,,671,4.6

8719164,3,B00YTSH2WS,"Visually looks like a giallo film and they did everything they could to make it feel like one from the soundtrack to the bad dubbing and dialogue. The problem is there isn't really much of a plot and it's more of a vignette of scenes that somewhat relate to each other.
