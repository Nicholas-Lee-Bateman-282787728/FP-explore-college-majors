7990610,5,B00009EIQK,"I had watch many Garcia Marquez Movies and I have been very disappointed.
This IS THE ONLY ONE THET I REALLY LIKE. Salma Hayek as La Willa IS EXCELLENT AND
Marisa Paredes is really good too. a bit long but very, very recommended.",1398211200,,229,4.348837209302325
7990611,5,B00009EIQK,"I found this to be a wonderful movie. I have over 200 Latin movies from all over thw world and enjoyed this story very much. I did not think it was too long or slow paced. I have telenovelas that run almost 40 hours, so this was quick movie for me! I'm having a movie night with friends to watch this again.",1212192000,3,307,3.967741935483871
7990612,2,B00009EIQK,"Notice to all insomniacs: watch this film.  You will be cured!!!  Seriously, the pace is extremely slow.  My wife and I both appreciate slow paced films, especially foreign movies, that gradually reveal sublteties that most other movies do not.  While the slow pace of this film produces some rewards, the length of the film (nearly 2 hrs) was not worth the meager rewards of this adaptation of Gabriel-Garcia Marquez's book.",1115251200,3,425,5.0285714285714285
