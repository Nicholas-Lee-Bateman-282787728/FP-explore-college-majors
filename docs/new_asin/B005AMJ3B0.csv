4641211,5,B005AMJ3B0,"Great movies of Vincent Price doing Edgar Allan Poe stories. Five films on two DVDs, in two different cases. The DVDs come in a cool box as seen in the picture, great purchase.",1335139200,15,176,4.363636363636363
4641212,4,B005AMJ3B0,"This budget-priced Box set is a great way to pick up 5 Vincent Price films:
The Pit & The Pendulum
The Raven
Tales of Terror
Masque of the Red Death
Madhouse (which features stock footage from several past Vincent Prive films- including The Haunted Palace, The Pit and the Pendulum, Tales of Terror, The Raven, Scream and Scream Again, and House of Usher!).

The packaging is a nice box, with the front serving as the lid, lifting up to hold 2 DVD cases. One contains ToT, Raven, and Pit, while the second has Madhouse and Masque. The discs are single-sided luckily and not annoying flipper discs. The films themselves are chosen from a central menu, and when selected the film starts. There is no scene selection menus, however you can skip scenes like on their original MGM DVDs by simply clicking next or back on your remote.

Strangely, the DVDs contained in the box are now extremely expensive from amazon sellers on the pages they're available individually. Avoid those rip-offs, get this set.

Also I recommend the MGM Midnite Movies DVDs, specifically the ones involving Price.
I view this set as a basic starter kit / jumping on point for a Vincent Price collection.",1331510400,58,1175,4.75
4641213,4,B005AMJ3B0,"I took a chance when I ordered this DVD box set, but it was worth the gamble. All five of these Vincent Price films are reproduced with the utmost care. The colors are bright, the pictures sharp, and the sound excellent. Movies released in widescreen are in that format here.

The downside to this set is that it is totally no-frills. No commentary, no original trailers of the movies, etc. But what I consider to be the biggest shortfall of this set is that none of the movies are divided into chapters. This gives the viewer two choices: either watch the film in one sitting; or fast-forward through the movie later to try to find the place where the viewer stopped watching the film.

The upside to the set is that you get some Vincent Price horror classics that are pricey in other DVD offerings (such as MGM's ""Midnite Movies"" double feature series). In this set are four of the great Vincent Price/Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films: The Pit and the Pendulum (1961); The Raven (1962); Tales of Terror (1963); and The Masque of the Red Death(1964). The fifth film in the set is Madhouse from 1974. Madhouse is basically a slasher movie with a lot of gory scenes, unlike the more restrained Poe films.

Some cool things about this set are that the DVDs come in a nice gift box made of heavy cardboard. The graphics on the box lid are somewhat three dimensional. The flames behind Price seem to glow and an old house appears from the darkness when the box is held under a bright light.  The DVDs inside the box are in two quality plastic DVD cases with colorful graphics and information about each film. So if you are looking for a nice collection of some of Price's best later films, this is a good affordable place to start.",1328486400,123,1729,4.496815286624204

4641245,5,B005AMJ3B0,"Nice collection of great movies. For the price, you really cannot beat it. It comes in a nice cardboard case, two separate DVD cases inside. The video quality is fairly decent, for what you pay at least. All in all it is definitely worth the purchase, especially for Price fans.",1413849600,,278,4.58
4641246,5,B005AMJ3B0,"This set has a very nice price right now for 5 good movies at 10 dollars. Individually, these movies probably cost about that price whether it be alone or in two pack. Some may cost more. The quality in my opinion is great and with the cinema setting of today's LED televisions it looks even better in my opinion.

Vincent Price is awesome in all of these films, 3 of the movies are on DVD 1 which has its own case. Pit and Pendulum is a pretty dark story loosely based from the Edgar Allan Poe poem. Tales of Terror is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and tells 3 different stories (Morella, Black Cat, and The Case of M. Valdemar) in about 80-90 minutes. Morella is another dark story with romantic elements. The Black Cat is kind of like a black comedy but more suspense/thriller, with Peter Lorre stealing the show. The story is dark, but humorous at times. The last is the Case of M. Valdemar which I cared the least for. Still, I did enjoy it and it was a pretty dark story. The last of the films on this DVD is The Raven which features horror great Boris Karloff. This one is very campy, and yet I smiled the whole way throughout. Peter Lorre and Vincent Price have awesome chemistry as they did in The Black Cat. The beginning is interesting. Once Lorre enters the scene, it just gets better and better. This one is the least dark, but the most fun. Karloff dueling it out with Price is fun to watch. This is like two of the best sitting around a fire telling stories. Also, unlike the rest of the DVDs, I think anyone can watch The Raven. Great way to end DVD one.

The last 2 are on DVD 2 which is in its own case. I have yet to watch these but they include The Masque of Red Death and Madhouse. I already feel satisfied with my purchase because I received 3 good movies, and I'm sure at least Masque of Red Death will be no different. Another great thing about these classic movies is the run time. No one movie will run over an hour and a half. The movies are usually anywhere from 80 to 90 minutes.

In closing, this set is a steal if you like dark movies, black comedy, Edgar Allan Poe, or classic horror/suspense.",1412899200,,2123,4.237037037037037
4641247,3,B005AMJ3B0,it was OK,1411430400,,9,2.3333333333333335
4641248,5,B005AMJ3B0,"I respond to my comments when they have merrit...  So here I have rated each move on quality.  The outfit that made this DVD set is a no-name recording mill which is reflected in the mid-range to plain terrible quality of the collection overall.  The set is watchable but you have a lot of challenges to overlook if you buy this set so be warned.  I'm happy to have purchased this set because the bikini machine and girl bomb series was comedy work I did not know Vincent Price did.

UPDATE... This is more of a Vincent Price sampler set.

The video quality of this set is all over the place.  In some cases the color, clearity and audio are very good.  Other movies shock and house on Haunted Hill in particular are just plain awful.  This is NOT a Vincent Price set for serious collectors who want to get a jump start on getting quality vincent print movies.  This set is great for someone new to vincent price who is making up their mind if Vincent Price is a worthy addition to their horror collection.  This set gives viewers a sample taste of Vincent Price alas imperfect but at a value price.

Quality in this set is all over the place.

Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machines is good quality video and audio, the actual story is 1950's 1960's hikey and weird but nice rainy day retro deversion movie.

Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs is likewise lite fare with more comedy than horror overtones.  Video and audio quality is good.

Tales of Terror video and audio quality both not great but easily watchable.

Masque Of The Red Death audio and video quality was acceptable.

Madhouse was weird and funny with good audio and video quality.

The Abombminable Doctor Phibes was great video and audio quality.

Scream and Scream again was a weak plot but acceptable video and audio quality.

From A Whisper To A Scream ok video and audio quality not great

Theatre of Blood weird funny not in wide screen format

Last Man on Earth, ok quality but I have seen far better prints with better video and audio.

Shock bad print, loaded with image artifacts, gouges in the print in a few places, bad audio useless print.

House on Haunted Hill another tiny screen ugly print was not worth watching, a butchered copy.

Mooch goes to Hollywood, I could film a better movie in a subway toilet.

The Bat just a bat movie in a bad format

This is an awesome and cost effective way to jump start your Vincent proce DVD collection.  Vincent Price was the embodiment of creepy horror movies for a generation of baby boomer kids. First Vincent Price had a voice that simply creeped out the average person just hearing him speak.  Also Vincent Price had the tall lanky body and wild hair that just made you think he was just a few vital pints short of a full tank.  One can have all the physical characteristics of a great horror film actor and still do a bad job.  Vincent Price however had a masters touch and bringing the pure horror out of the most common situations.  Vincent Price could beand too often was  placed in the banal sets using the  cheapest props and yet time and time again he could bring out the most gut wrenching horror hidden inside.

Vincent Price knew the one thing so many horror film actors don't seem to know.  Vincent Price knew the best way to get to his audience.  Vincent Prioce knew you could frighten an audience to death if in his performance he could give onlookers tools needed to scare themselves.  Vincent Price overcame cheap props and cheezy sets by getting inside the heads of his audience and planting the seeds of pure unmitigated fright.  Vincent Price can often be seen tending to the seeds of horror he plants throughout his pictures.  As the plot unfolds Vincent Price has given you the all that is needed to scare yourself silly if you have any imgination at all.  Vincent Price scares his audience because; for Vincent price fright was an intimate affair between yourself and him.  Vincent Price frightened people because; his horror often revealed the pains of the human condition and how they can drive men to do insane evil and horrible things.  If any man look too closely and too honestly at himself he will find in his darkest recesses the twisted creatures brought to life by Vincent Price.

Vincent Price in life brough to us an impressive body of work some of it as a normal dude.  However Vincent Price will rightly be remembered as the man who brought horror to life in ways often up close and personal.  Vincent Price is one of the masters of early horror which makes this set a must have at this bargain price.",1410739200,,4558,4.515892420537897
4641249,4,B005AMJ3B0,"I give it four stars only because I can't exactly say ""I love it!"" Watching Vincent Price in these old ""monster"" movies brings back good old memories of watching them on Chller Feature in Columbus, OH on Friday nights with friends or with my brother. We were a whole lost more fearful when we watched them on our old black and white set late at night then we are now, but I still watch Vincent Price fondly.

Price is a good actor. I've always enjoyed the way he speaks; almost Shakespearian. Maybe he's had that training---I don't know.

The movies are in decent shape and are kind of predictable, but still pretty good for being as old as they are. If you enjoyed Vincent Price in the old days, you will enjoy this box set of five movies today. Very nostalgic!",1410220800,,762,4.397163120567376

Growing up we had a box set of 3 movies, (the Raven, Pit and the Pendulum, and Fall of the House of Usher).  I used to love watching them.  I found this set and it had the Raven, (I already had Pit and Usher), plus it had a few more.  The quality is decent considering how old the films were.",1403481600,,365,4.027777777777778
4641262,3,B005AMJ3B0,"The only impressive thing about these movies is the sets, lighting, costumes, color, and quality of actual film itself. They are kind of ""Hammer Horror"" which I think is the greatest in that regard.  That's the good part.  But you know, I had forgotten what a cheeseball Vincent Price is until I bought these five movies and watched them.  Some people may really love Vincent Price, but I think his performances are silly.",1403136000,,422,4.7534246575342465
4641263,5,B005AMJ3B0,"Why Vinnie has yet to get the Blu ray boxed set treatment is beyond me and I am tired of waiting so I threw down $12 and hoped for the best with this and I got it. Watching DVDs in wide-screen on a new BD player is a perfectly acceptable experience when the original aspect ratio is applied on the disc. These discs run at a steady 4.0Mbps (lows of 3 and highs of 8 in between) on all the movies which works out to a 360p resolution that is then progressive scanned to 720p and the result is an excellent overall image. ""The Raven"" is my favorite Vinnie movie (even tho Peter Lorre steals the show) and is a classic in my opinion. ""Masque"" is creepy, Gothic and Vinnie is at his evil best in this one. ""Pit"" I would give a 3 out of 5; it would be a 4 if not for John Kerr's stuffy, plodding performance. ""Terror"" has some enthusiastic fans, I am not one, it's OK. ""Madhouse"" is a bore and utterly predictable. Overall if you are a Vinnie fan this set has 2 of his very best, 1 very good, 1 ok, and just 1 throwaway all transferred well from excellent prints in widescreen and all for $12 with Prime. I will be first in line to get these movies when they come out on BD but until then I am happy to watch this nice set.",1402358400,,1218,4.016460905349795

4641282,5,B005AMJ3B0,"Vincent Price was always one of my favorite actors whether it was in film noir playing heavies, or the later horror films he became known for (which is when I actually discovered him).  He always leant a sense of wry humor to whatever he did and no matter how bad he was, he was just so likeable.  It was not uncommon to find one rooting for the bad guy.

This collection has many of the best, especially from the Roger Corman American International years.  ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" are two films made to scare and they still deliver.  I still think of the the scene in which Madeline Usher's bloody hand is seen and it has been..umm ..well..decades since I saw it at a drive-in.  Even better is the Nicolas Roeg filmed and Corman directed, ""The Masque of the Red Death,""  generally regarded as arguably (and I feel there is no argument) best of the Poe Series. A seamless interweaving of the Poe short story of the same name and another Poe story, Hop Frog with Jane Asher and Hazel Court and with a dash of devil worship gives the audience a thoroughly and very effective thriller. I showed it to my English class after reading both stories and the students were very appreciative and engrossed.

The most enjoyable is The Raven.  A tongue-in-cheek rendition of the Poe poem.  The poem itself is there for name only, but the cast is magnificent.  Price, joined by Peter Lorre, and  Boris Karloff as rival wizards, the beautiful Hazel Court as the not so lost Lenore, and a young Jack Nicholson combine to make this comedy one that can especially be enjoyed on a dark stormy night with the lights out.

I may also add that the picture quality of each DVD is impeccable.  This is a purchase well worth the ""Price.""",1382745600,,1753,4.471698113207547
4641283,5,B005AMJ3B0,"I originally purchased this for just one of the Price movies, the ""Pit and the Pendulum."" Three of the five I had never seen before. For any fan of the Vincent Price/Roger Corman collaboration, this is a must-have collection. All 5 movies are winners. If you want a lot of fluff, a lot of extras, you won't find it. But if you want 5 great movies (for their genera) well mastered onto DVD, this is absolutely great.",1381276800,5,415,4.402597402597403

4641286,5,B005AMJ3B0,"When I was a kid, my dad got me hooked on horror movies.  I've always liked Vincent Price because even though he often plays a dark character he always seems to add a touch of ""tongue in cheek"" to his performance.",1366934400,,213,4.195121951219512
4641287,5,B005AMJ3B0,"Never will there be another Vincent Price or anything close! He was a true Original and a very skilled master at what he did in horror films!  I always found him to be so riveting in his portrayals and rightly so! His look and manner coupled with his fine acting abilities made him truly a genius of the horror genre! This set has the great Edgar Allen Poe's ""Pit and the Pendulum"" which was always one of my favorite stories to read or watch on the screen.  This along with the other four good Vincent Price horror flicks makes this a set worth owning.  The Price is a bargain for so much Mr. Price, hahahahaha!  Really if you like older horror movies this is worth the Price both literally and figuratively.",1364688000,,709,4.3893129770992365

4641293,3,B005AMJ3B0,"The quality of the films were quite good.  But about halfway through ""Pit..."" the images stopped and leapt a bit then, after that the sound/dialogue syncing was out of whack.  No mark on the DVD itself so assume it was an encoding error.  Review would have been higher if not for that, as it's a good accumulation of his films.

8463460,3,B005AMJ3B0,"These films took me back to my childhood, when we went to big spooky theatres to see these and maybe say them again on late-night TV.  They are really fun, but viewed as an adult, it is clear that they range from pretty bad to reasonably good. There are some surprise appearances, such as young Jack Nicholson and Jane Asher, which are surprising and amusing.

Several seem to be roughly based on Tales of Poe, but they mix up the stories and present them with snippets of comedy that detract from the gothic atmosphere that makes Poe so memorable.  Perhaps the best one is Pit and the Pendulum, which had many details I found quite chilling, such as the very last image.  Then there is the mask of the Red Death and Madhouse, both of which evoke some atmosphere and mystery, but appear thrown together in a rather slapdash manner.  The others are, well, just plain awful, with their dueling magicians and stories of the macabre.
