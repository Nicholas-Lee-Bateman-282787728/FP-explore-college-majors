3675431,5,B001KZOUXW,"It is the fastest delivery I ever had on August 23, 2016.  I'm straight and I have couple of gay friends but not like this video.  At first I thought this story about between Father and son (Don looks so young) on the front of DVD picture. I read it, so I rent it from Netflix. To my amazing; it took me very surprised about their love, persistence, faithful and care for each other was very powerful. Ages does not matter and it is true for 35-year romance and big gaps age!  Don was a wonderful artist and I wish he could teach me, lol.  So is Chris's a great novel writer.  They lived on the very top of hill near L.A (nice scene).  The couple on beaches and on film sets in what will seem to most like a charmed lifestyle, and again the beautiful house!  It is powerful to watch with their lifestyle, friends, party, love and grow together until Chris' end (due to age).  I rent four times because it is so powerful story. I loved the film and it is WOW.  I wish I had a bed in the corner and look out the sky for full moon; loved it!",1472083200,,1038,4.049019607843137

3675495,5,B001KZOUXW,"...an amazing story of the lives of two very interesting men that managed to maintain what for all logical reasoning was an impossible relationship both due to their age differences AND societys moral rules at the time. Christopher Isherwood's ability to be a ""spouse"" AND a mentor at the same time speaks highly of him regardless of the distractions imposed by society at the time. Don Bachardy's devotion to his spouse over the years....given the sizable age difference, was admirable and inspirational. This is a must read book if you know anything about either man and have an interest in all things old Hollywood.",1426118400,,618,4.951923076923077
3675496,4,B001KZOUXW,"The other reviewers gave great overviews of this film/documentary.  I won't bother to further elaborate on what they said.  I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  Out, Proud and Living Without Fear sums up Chris & Don's relationship (yes, even the at-first glance icky age difference, whcih, honestly, fades as the years roll past).  I was crying at the end where Don shows the drawings he did of Chris as he died.

I was struck by how honest their relationship was.  It matured and it thrived as time went on. Don is shown maturing into his own man, with his own successful pursuits away from Chris.  Yet, even as Don matured his relationship with Chris remained strong, even with the ups and downs ALL relationships go through.  Not many relationships endure these things.

A very positive documentary.",1425600000,,805,4.9037037037037035

3675511,4,B001KZOUXW,I thought the documentary was well done. I would have liked a little less of Don and additional professional comment about Chris. I loved the colored home movies they must have taken of each other in the 1950's. That really made the story come alive. I also liked when Don painted live nude models as he talked about he and Chris. Don and Chris appear to have had a storied life for two openly gay men mid-20th Century. Well worth the time to watch,1416960000,,448,4.345238095238095

Something wrong with that, that's just my opinion but I'll stick by it. How about someone who is your emotional, intellectual equal? Or at least near your same DECADE?!

I've always enjoyed the writing of Chris Isherwood and his ability to recreate eras and exceptional personalities. Don's paintings and portraits are alive and pulsating on the paper, I love the way he can capture the essence of the model and his color sense is explosive. This is an exceptional video because this is an exceptional story.sweet, romantic, with a few drops of vinegar !",1406419200,,515,5.070588235294117

3675533,5,B001KZOUXW,"On a technical level this documentary might not be five stars, but it deserves the high rating for the importance of the subject for gay history.  Not only is Christopher Isherwood simply an important writer, but his relation ship with Don Bachardy was unique for its time and lasted a lifetime.  There is an amazing amount of clear home movie footage of the pair traveling about the globe, hobnobbing with celebrities and living life in Los Angeles.  This home movie footage compliments Don Bachardy telling stories of his life with Isherwood as well as contrasts with his life at the time of the making of the documentary.  Fun talking heads include Liza Minnelli and Leslie Caron.  Michael York reads from Isherwood's diaries to impart Isherwood's point of view of the relationship.  The pace is leisurely, but the content is excellent.",1393804800,,839,4.957142857142857
3675534,5,B001KZOUXW,"This film not only touched us emotionally, but it is a permanent document to have so all can see that love still can exist in a society that scorns gay love.  These two men loved each other in many different ways.  As Don B. was narrating, you could tell not only that he was speaking truth, but he was speaking love.  My partner and I have been together for 25 years this Friday and we were so impressed with this beautiful story. The final scene broke our hearts and we related to this on so many levels. The film had professional editing and scenes with Tennessee Williams, Liza Minnelli, and other famous writers and actors were so revealing how it really was, that it is a rare time piece that we are proud to own.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has experienced love, gay or straight.  Thank you.

I don't know how it's done because the older person not only has much more experience in life as a whole but that leaves the younger one wanting to hopefully learn from the older OR do it on his own..and that's exactly what happened in this movie,..Don was wanting for more, while Christopher had seen it all.. but Don was there till the end for Christopher....I also loved the fact of the ""home movies"" used throughout the film, made it much more real for me..and they had allot of footage to choose form...I Loved the film and will now read the Isherwood books

3675548,5,B001KZOUXW,"Really enjoyed seeing the lasting relationship despite their trials.  I can understand that there must have been raised eyebrows concerning the difference in the ages.  But it seems that Chris and Don both got something out of their relationship and, I guess, that's the important thing.",1330732800,,287,5.217391304347826
3675549,5,B001KZOUXW,"I loved watching this documentary. What struck me as interesting is how two men with a difference of thirty years got along so well to the very end. Chris Isherwood who was first photographed in his twenties looked beautiful as a man. Don Bachardi who was old enough to be his father got along well sexually with this younger man. The older man Don was a painter and Chris Isherwood was a writer. Their relationship complemented each other. I recall in this movie how they never had pets. But that fact was unimportant in that both seemed like pets to each other. Expressing and reciprocating kindness. I may eventually purchase this documentary just as an inspiration for my own artistic goals. Don't expect to be titillated by any sexual behaviors. There is none. But if you want to be inspired, then the purchase of this movie might be worth it.",1330128000,,848,4.66

3675554,3,B001KZOUXW,"Chris & Don: A Love Story ($29.99; Zeitgeist) is a sweet-natured look at the 30+ years romance between writer Christopher Isherwood and artist Don Bachardy. Not being Scandanavian, I found the idea of a 48 year old man meeting and falling for a 16 year old boy disconcerting to say the least. But my embarrassed ""this-can't-be-right"" initial reaction gave way ultimately as Isherwood waited two years before actually dating Bachardy (while sleeping with the kid's older but not quite as adorable brother, mind you) and then stayed together happily in love for the next three decades till Isherwood's death. Even some of Isherwood's liberal friends felt uncomfortable about the 19 or 20 year old lad (who looked about 16 even then) shacking up with Isherwood and let him know it. But an enduring romance can answer all sorts of cynical, suspicious questions. Still, the copious home movies show Bachardy bouncing around like an adorable puppy dog, forcing you to not simply brush past the issue of their age gap but deal with it squarely. The movie gains weight as they remain loyal and Isherwood encourages Bachardy's genuine talent as a painter. And the movie benefits very nicely from a wise choice to make use of one of their endearments: the two men often wrote notes to each other with Isherwood symbolized as a plodding old horse and Bachardy as a sweet little cat. Their illustrations come to life in animated segments that somehow capture the heart of this romance with a light touch. The back and forth between the horse and the cat as two best friends would make an adorable picture book if some smart publisher would just step in with an offer.

3675555,5,B001KZOUXW,"Through the story of Chris and Don, we witness the evolution of a gay consciousness from the innuendos of 1930's Berlin to the out of the closet and proud way of life.  Don't be misled by the earlier reviews, its quite obvious in the film that the two never engaged in anything until Don was of the current age of consent (remember, homosexuality itself was illegal, so the issue of consent was out of the question).  I think this is the perfect response to anyone who would say gays don't love each other, these two did.",1243468800,,521,4.416666666666667
3675556,4,B001KZOUXW,"This documentary recounts the long, intimate relationship between author  Christopher Isherwood (Berlin Stories ... which became I Am a Camera ... which became Cabaret) and the portrait artist Don Bachardy. Isherwood has been dead for over 20 years, so the documentary consists primarily of an extended one-sided interview with Bachardy (we hear his thoughts but not his interrogator's questions) as he knocks about an enviable Southern California beach house full of tasteful mementos of his life with Isherwood, reads Isherwood's diaries (voice-over provided by Michael York), and sketches a smattering of nude youths. Bachardy's speaking voice is strangely accented and somewhat affected, and is full of ""ums"" and ""uhs."" While Bachardy has charm and the details of his story are interesting, I found myself getting increasingly relieved whenever the film shifted to archival footage.

While the film will possibly appeal to a broad-minded general audience, it will be of special interest, I think, to gay men (and possibly lesbian) viewers. For one thing, the film shows the way homosexuals in days past had to define their relationships for themselves. Before gay marriage (with its implied monogamy) became a cause celebre, men like Chris and Don needed to consciously craft their own understanding of what they expected of one another. Don speaks frankly about both being taken to Hollywood parties openly as Isherwood's partner/date (and enduring homophobic comments from Joseph Cotton) and about his interest in seeing men outside their relationship. Yet somehow their relationship with one another was primary and mutually fulfilling. It is also interesting from the perspective of the thirty year difference in their ages (Don was barely legal when they started their relationship). As in classical man/boy relationships, there was an element of mentor and protege. Isherwood wisely encouraged Don to pursue drawing and painting, rather than writing, and their relationship does not seem to have suffered from competitiveness. It was gratifying to see that Don had a sense of himself, one Isherwood encouraged, and that Don was no mere boy toy or trophy wife. Thirdly, this film is likely to interest gay men because of the sense it gives of how much has and hasn't changed for gays since the early 1950s.

The filmmakers have done a good job of augmenting Don's story with archival footage and interview clips from people like Leslie Caron and James White. They also seemed to have a realistic sense of their subjects' standing on the world stage (they acknowledge that Isherwood was a good though not a major 20th century writer). During the course of this film we get to see a number of portraits Bachardy did of Isherwood, including some of the many he drew during Isherwood's final days. The filmmakers show but do not assess the quality of Don's work. The earlier portraits seem to have been mostly charcoal sketches or black and white watercolors (many of which were stunning); these were followed by minimalist, gestural drawings employing thick brush strokes (impactful when they hit the mark); and his current paintings are in the bright colors of the Fauves (which struck me as erratic and infantile). If he's an artist in decline, he doesn't seem to notice or mind. In the end, it is his life that's his greatest creation and it is an honor to hear him tell his story without complaint or apology.",1238976000,,3419,5.134649910233393
3675557,5,B001KZOUXW,"If anyone ever listened to his own drummer-- even though he was born in Great Britain and far away from the likes of Thoreau who made the phrase famous-- Christopher Isherwood certainly lived life by his own rules. Born of an upper class British family in 1904, he went against his mother's wishes that he become a don by deliberately flunking out of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He then went to Berlin in 1930 where sexual freedom was in abundance before the rise of Hitler. Isherwood came to the U. S. in 1939, settled in Santa Monica and became lovers with Don Bachardy, 30 years his junior, whom he met with the latter was perhaps 16-- according to Barchardy's remembrance in this documentary-- and the two settled into a very public relationship that lasted 30 years until Isherwood's death in 1986. ""Chris and Don: A Love Story"" is a brilliant documentary of that relationship. Much of the hour and a half long film is told by Bachardy who is now in his 70's. There is also archival footage of Isherwood, commentary by Liza Minelli-- who looks like a million dollars-- and Leslie Caron with voice over by Michael York.

The first thing you notice is that Bachardy speaks exactly like Isherwood. It is obvious that Isherwood in many ways molded the younger man in his own image. This unorthodox relationship seems to have worked on every level as Isherwood became a fatgher figure, mentor and lover to the younger Bachardy, sending him to art school where he was able to become an artist in his own right rather than just Isherwood's young lover. Bachardy talks about the time in 1963-64, that he describes as rocky, when he considered leaving Isherwood. He had argued tdhat since Isherwood had had sexual freedom and the opportunity to meet other people and have other lovers before he met Bachardy, that he should have the same privilege. In a particularly sweet gesture, Isherwood had decided that the two lovers should not have an animal since some of the affection that they might have for each other would be given to the animal, so the two men because horse (Isherwood) and cat (Bachardy). When Barchardy went out cruising, Isherwood always wanted to know, upon the younger man's return if he had caught a mouse. During this difficult period of their relationship, Isherwood wrote what I believe is his best novel, A SINGLE MAN. It covers one day in the life of a college professor whose lover has just died. It was Isherwood's way of imagining what his life would be like should Barchardy leave him.

Bachardy also talks about life after Isherwood, recounting in a particularly moving sequence how he sketched his lover during his final illness and even afer he had died, and discusses his life as an artist as well. (By the way, everyone should live in a house as beautiful as their cottage in Santa Monica.) The DVD has a lot of extras: too much commentary by the actress Gloria Stuart, Bachardy on same sex marriage, Bachardy on his art collection, home movies of Christopher and Don in Mexico, on the set of ""War and Peace"" (1955) and ""The Rose Tattoo"" (1956) with footage of Tennessee Williams being casual as well.

This is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a very long time.",1238716800,,3211,4.699822380106572
3675558,4,B001KZOUXW,"""Chris & Don: A Love Story"" (Zeitgeist Films) is a portrait of the 34 year relationship of British writer Christopher Isherwood and portrait artist Don Bachardy (30 years Isherwood's junior).  This film, one of the best of 2008 (and one that would surely have been mentioned on my ""ten best"" list had it only played in a theatre in Tallahassee), is an important and inspiring document of a courageous, openly gay love story, perhaps the most blatant and visible of the last century after Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.
  Directors Guido Santi and Tina Mascara have culled an impressive amount of archival footage of these singular artists, including scenes with W. H. Auden, Tennessee Williams, Igor Stravinsky, and mixed them with interviews and comments from Leslie Caron, James White, Gloria Stuart and John Boorman.  The wisest move made by these filmmakers, one which elevates and imbues this work with genuine legitimacy, was to focus their camera on Bachardy and to have excerpts from Isherwood's diaries read by actor Michael York.
  They met on a California beach in 1952 when Bachardy was 16.  Isherwood was the celebrated author of The Berlin Stories (not yet famous as the source of ""Cabaret"", or the author of ""A Single Man"" and ""Christopher and His Kind"").  Their relationship didn't coalesce for a few years, but once it did, the two became inseparable.  Bachardy is brutally candid about the relationship, how they were viewed by friends and family; but more importantly, how they interacted with one another, the stresses and strains of coming from different countries, classes and generations.
  Bachardy, forever youthful in appearance, details a brief period when he insisted the relationship be ""open"" to provide him an opportunity to sew his wild oats.  Still, with a thirty year age gap, Isherwood often seems a benign cross between Humbert Humbert and Svengali.
  ""Chris & Don"" is a treasure for those well acquainted with the work of both men.  However, for those unfamiliar, this 90 minute film will both illuminate and entertain.",1235779200,,2061,5.074183976261128

In 1952, Don Barchardy meets author and Hollywood celebrity Christopher Isherwood on a beach in Santa Monica, and a relationship is born. What's remarkable, among many remarkable things in this story, is that Chris was 30 years older than Don, who was just coming out of his adolescence. They lived together, for over 30 years, unreservedly and openly as a couple, amidst the rampant homophobia and discrimination that existed, even in ""liberal"" California.

The life wanders through the current life of Don as his reminiscences about his great love, the life of Chris before meeting Don (with particular emphasis on Chris' time in Berlin, which eventually spawned ""Cabaret"") and their life together. The filmmakers framed the story beautifully with animals; that being, Chris and Don referred to themselves in the context of animal personas, Chris being an old horse, Don an affectionate cat, and they sprinkle delightful animation throughout the movie. The effect is charming, and adds a poignant punctuation mark at the end.

Perhaps the most moving part of the entire story occurs at the end, as Don recounts Chris' last days, and his endless drawing of his love. The pictures haunt, the sadness looms. It's then you get the sense of the realness of their relationship, how real all relationships are (despite conservative groups' attempts to thwart them), and the depth of what they meant to each other.

Don's honesty drives this movie. He holds nothing back as he recounts his life, as well as the life of Chris. You have to admire someone for opening his heart so much to a camera crew; I doubt many of us would be willing to have such clarity. In a way, it really brings us closer to Chris, as I am sure was Don's intent in making this documentary.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. Watching it in the theater with a rapt audience was powerful, watching at home, privately, is even more powerful.",1235779200,,2002,4.893805309734513
3675560,5,B001KZOUXW,"On February 14, 1953, Don Bachardy (18) meets his brother's lover Christopher Isherwood (48) on a beach in California and, unbeknownst to both parties, is locked in for life--a life that would enlarge into creative soars for a portrait artist yet to know his calling and an established author awaiting his eternal subject. Yet ""Chris and Don: A Love Story"" is not simply about the ungovernable urge to create the life of art that only an artist can know where often the object is art itself; it is more humbly about two lovers' bonedeep adamancy to preserve as much of life as one can in a durable yet aesthetic medium. Here, the intended substance is neither the piece drawn nor the word written but the protraction of human essence by embalming it in text, in sketch. The documentary, much like its own subjects, is the act of reinforcing memory with creative proofs-- the body of evidence, which, in the process of its production, inspires more memories than any paper or celluloid can hold. A sketch of a gnarled Chris, haggard with cancer, opens the smell of the author, the smell of the ink-then in the charcoal-now, and the taste of that morning on this morning that you, as spectator, have just been made privy to. It is a story of an artist drawing an author while the author writes his muse into immortality all at once. But symbiosis can sometimes be brutal.

Amid this Edenic coalescence breathes the quiet defiance of a ritual-weary, mid-aged Chris Isherwood against heteronorms that are predictably ageist in creed. What could have been (and was) perceived as Isherwood's Humbert Humbertish captivity of the sun-sinewed boy-Lolita is now cited as one of the primary prompters in the gay liberation canon. Yet Humbert Humbertish it all was in many ways as dangerously young Don, calling himself ""an unconscious impersonator,"" willingly and star-struckly serves as Chris' substrate, replicating his accent, his Cheshire mannerism, his sparse diction. Eclipsed by Chris' deserved fame and proportionate clout, Don confesses, ""I wanted people to like me for who I really was but I wasn't sure myself who I was. The only thing I knew that I was good at was drawing people..."" And draw he did, and with it came the irrepressible desire to break free from the only lover he had known. Chris' enabling of Don's art pushes the latter to gauge the cost of unequal sexual experience with his seasoned, three-decade-distant partner; in short, he goes out. Plumbs the sea. All Chris wants is for young Don to come home at the end of the day after his shenanigans. Which he does in the late 60s. (Sometimes).

But Don does return for good and draws Chris and Chris only in the last few days of his life, chronicling the coming of his death piecemeal in a preemptively elegiac set of sketches. Chris Isherwood bares his all, his full, bleak nakedness in sacred singularity with his scribe. For Don's furious fingers, each tender stroke is a prayer for bonus time. Chris dies; Don spends the day drawing his corpse lest memory alone betray. These last images of depleted youth are so deeply lyrical that one can't but wonder if the body's shriveling in the embarrassment of age is beauty itself and unto its own. They reveal the kind of lovely grotesqueness that only death can boast. Guido Santi and Tina Mascara juxtapose them against a lithe-yet-withered Don feverishly working out at the gym. The story--the text--closes with the artist in his solitary atelier where all that is left are drawers of pictures and shelves of books in poetic arrest, all the company a man has shored for a night to allay ""the foul rag and boneshop of the heart.""

8316662,4,B001KZOUXW,"I was a little hesitant to watching this even though I recall critics praising it.  Thought it might be dull and boring, but it actually wasn't.  It did drag in places, but then it would jump to an interesting scene that makes you think.  This is a documentary about this love relationship that endures over thirty years and only ends because one of them passed away.  It is a love relationship between two men, but to be honest it could have been about a male-female couple and I wouldn't have noticed.  What may shock some, if they're not stunned that it's two men, is the age difference.  I'll admit I was a little judgmental initially when I heard their age difference is 30 years at the start of the documentary.  While I don't really have an issue with age differences such as 10-15 years.  Even 20 is alright.  But 30?  Getting into some serious generational gaps.  I wasn't offended, just judgmental thinking as I'm watching the film, ""Oh right.  Come on.  We know why they're with each other.""  But then as I watched it I realized, ""I guess they really are in love.  And it goes deeper than their ages.""  Although it did seem as if they had some obstacles that were age related.  Things such as the older one is a successful writer and respected by many including famous stars in Hollywood, even though I never heard of him before watching this documentary.  And the younger one is kind of ignored by those that admire the older writer.  It's as if he's trying to fit in or measure up.  I did love the old vintage footage of Los Angeles and them as a couple when they were younger and through the years.  I loved the narration.  It's narrated by the young guy in the duo who is an old man in the documentary.  I don't know how they had so much footage from the older days when they were together.  Wish that was mentioned at some point.  This is also taken primarily from the point of view from the younger one since he's still alive, but the older one was a writer so there are notes and voice overs to give his point of view.

Interesting documentaty overall and about love relationships that keep going on through time, even though they seemed to hit a low point in the connection at some point temporarily both wanting to split.  They do split only to end up back together again not long afterwards.  That's actually a Twin Flame relationship which has the age difference, similar natures and personalities, a wider age gap, and they stay in love even during the time they're temporarily apart.  Good documentary.",1490918400,,2526,4.49010989010989
