Some  movies are better than others, but  overall  it is a mistake to buy them, unless  they say digitally  remastered.... If they  are going to sell  those  they need to digitize  the movies.  It's  just an example what they  will sell  to get  your $$$$.",1423958400,,358,4.296875
8279976,1,B001AWUKX4,"I was so happy when I came across this set.  All my favorite classic movies.....wrong.  The quality is so bad on every movie, the sound fades completely out for up to 10 minutes at a time, and when it comes back, you can hardly hear it.  I would not recommend this set to anyone.  This is a perfect example of ""Too good to be true.""",1242604800,9,332,4.061538461538461
