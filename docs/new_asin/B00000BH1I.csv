7905839,4,B00000BH1I,I had this on VHS for my daughter 25 years ago and she loved it! I am now buying it on DVD for her daughter...lol,1516147200,,113,3.56
7905840,4,B00000BH1I,"Incredibly entertaining for babies and toddlers, in spite of its age and low production budget. This is not the kind of video you can hardly wait to watch - but it is both educational and entertaining for the very young. I bought this because my kids, at ages 10 and 13, were asking to see it again. My oldest even remembers it - WELL. It's kind of frightening. Even though we watched it nearly a hundred times when they were younger, I had no trouble watching it again years later. Filled with bright colors and instrumental music, the baby set loves it. Would have given it five stars if they'd put it (PLEASE) on DVD!",1409270400,,620,4.4
7905841,2,B00000BH1I,"When my fussy little sister was an infant, my parents would put the VHS of this in and have her watch it to calm her down (this would be 1990). I still remembered the tunes, so I bought this thinking my son would enjoy it just as much.

Turns out he didn't, and this was never watched again. I had thought perhaps the DVD copy would look nicer or something, but it did not. Except this time the songs and shapes seemed very dated, old, unpleasant, and repeating in parts.

There are so many good DVDs for infants out there. I would pass on this, as the graphics are pretty laughable now with the technology that exists.",1387324800,,619,4.282051282051282
7905842,5,B00000BH1I,"I'm reviewing this 12 years after I owned it.  Why?  Because my 12-year-old son just ASKED ME ABOUT IT.  He actually remembers watching it as a baby.  He didn't remember the title, but he remembers the images, some of the actions, and the music.

We tried Baby Genius (YUK), Baby Einstein (meh) and So Smart (which, actually, was a big hit).  I have two boys, and both of them dissed the popular videos in favor of Infantastic Lullabyes.  I'm not a big fan of TV, and even at ages 9 and 12, they are limited to one half-hour video per day.  But this was the one video they watched over and over and over again.  Only once a day, of course, but every day for MONTHS.

Yes, it's awful for an adult.  But for a baby/toddler, it's fascinating.  Enough that they might remember it as teens.  Definitely recommended!",1380240000,,810,4.391891891891892
7905843,5,B00000BH1I,"I would never, ever normally advocate TV watching for infants, but I have to admit that this movie saved my life! Upon telling friend that I could not get anything done because my baby would not nap and was always fussy, this friend promptly brought me this lovely movie. It was perfect. Just flat pictures- shapes that a baby can see- soothing music and bright colors. Anyone over the age of 2 would find it extremely boring which is, I am sure, what makes it perfect for infants and toddlers. One viewing of this video was enough time for me to help my older children with their math lesson or for me to take a much-needed break.",1255564800,,631,4.401709401709402
7905844,5,B00000BH1I,"We were given a copy of this video 7 years ago when we were expecting our first child. The first time I saw it, I was very disappointed. I thought the graphics were unsophisticated and the music, likewise.  Shows how much I knew!  Clearly, I had no idea what young children would respond to. All 3 of my kids have absolutely LOVED this video. I can't recommend it highly enough.  If you don't have little ones, give this as a gift to some expectant parents.",975369600,,457,4.352941176470588
7905845,5,B00000BH1I,"Our daughter received this from a friend who entertained her now eleven year old son with it years ago.  My husband tells me 3 times a week to call and thank her again!!  Our 4-month old is captivated and every time she watches it, something new makes her giggle, laugh and interact.  I'm ordering volume two today!",969926400,,315,4.491228070175438
