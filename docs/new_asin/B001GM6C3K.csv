3615749,5,B001GM6C3K,"I had been trying to see this ""rock-umentary for several years. It had only been available on VHS and the only copy I could find was a used one for over $100....finally on DVD !!!
This is a really charming insight into a Man who has been My absolute idol forever.
Not always perfectly flattering to Himself but always honest, this will give You a peek into Elton John's life.
A definate must have for EJ fans !",1252800000,,410,4.269230769230769
3615750,3,B001GM6C3K,"""Tantrums and Tiaras' is a behind the scenes 'personal' documentary about a year in the life of Elton John, filmed by his partner David Furnish.
While intriguing in concept, and following in the footsteps of the other behind the scenes documentaries, this one suffers from too MUCH personal connection.  Yes David is a talented videographer.  But his partner status with Elton diminishes his ability to be objective.  There are no insightful behind the scenes moments.  There are a few 'outbursts' (the opening moment is the biggest one in the film) and a few moments of Sir Elton actually opening up.  They do however, seem far beyond actually candid.  With David behind the lens and Elton in front of it, the film seems more like a therapy session (and there actually is a therapist scene included).  This is a watered down view of a once hedonistic rock star, now enjoying the simple life.  Is it enjoyable to see Elton 'behind the curtain'? Yes.  Is it real/objective? Highly doubtful.",1251072000,4,989,4.874251497005988
3615751,5,B001GM6C3K,"This is the best dvd about Elton John. It's very upclose and personal, and you can see the true Elton John through the madness of his tours.
I thought the quality of the sound and picture was great.  This is an awsome dvd and definetly worth the price!",1243209600,,252,4.25
3615752,4,B001GM6C3K,"For anyone who enjoyed this documentary on VHS, it's nice to finally enjoy it on DVD.  Some of the deleted scenes are interesting (nice to see Elton being funny).  The original VHS showed a portion of his concert in Rio in 1995, but this DVD doesn't feature any of it; too bad.  Other than that, this is a unique ""warts-and-all"" documentary that takes a good look into Elton John's life on the road and at home.",1230595200,3,411,4.381578947368421
3615753,3,B001GM6C3K,"I had the original VCR recording in my collection and decided to upgrade to the DVD.  As the previous reviewer said, one would expect an improved quality.  The extras are nice.

A prominent person in this recording is no longer with Elton - Bob Halley, who frequently steals the scenes with his wit and unending patience for Elton's tantrums.  His mysterious ""firing"" and the subsequent lawsuit against him is just odd based on the relationship Bob and Elton seem to have shared for 30 years, a warmth clearly in evidence in this DVD.  I was hoping they would comment on it in the extras, but it's just another Elton oddity, probably never to be solved.  (I bet they were trying to figure out how to edit Bob out prior to the new release!)

Elton fans who never got the original, go for it.  But if you're looking for improved quality or new insight, it's not here.",1230249600,4,865,4.5
3615754,5,B001GM6C3K,"A very good CD and video.
Amazon was GREAT in getting the item to me in a short period of time.",1229817600,,95,3.5714285714285716
3615755,5,B001GM6C3K,"This dvd is incredible.  Thank you Elton and David for letting your fans into your world.  I loved seeing Elton be so vulnerable and real.  It makes me appreciate him even more!  I love the honesty of it all.  And the humor.
The commentary part was very interesting, so much has changed since it first aired 13 years ago.",1227657600,,321,4.372881355932203
3615756,3,B001GM6C3K,"Tantrums and Tiaras gives us a look inside the personal life of Elton John during 1995's Made In England Tour. Shot on video by his partner of then two years David Furnish the viewer gets a warts and all look at John's daily life on the road.

Beginning with the video shoot for the single,Believe, and covering the European album promotion tour the film moves into the stars interaction with family and friends. There is a touching scene with his grandmother that is not to be missed and a hilarious rant about flower arranging. The film then covers the Academy Awards and ends with concert footage of the American and South American legs of the tour.

This is one of the most honest portrayals of a star that I have seen. The commentary recorded 13 years later is just as informative as the film and offers a good retrospective on the couples busy schedeule and their relationship. Extras include some deleted scenes.

See it if you are a fan.",1225411200,16,945,4.579881656804734
3615787,1,B001GM6C3K,"This was ridiculous.  Elton should be very embarrassed that he allowed this to be distributed.  It does nothing but makes him look like a spoiled brat, out of touch with reality and more.",1448668800,,187,4.636363636363637

3615791,4,B001GM6C3K,"Well made personal back room dynamic film.  Elton seems to have not filtered the content so sometimes not as flattering as he might like, that is why I rented it.",1434499200,,162,4.4

3615796,5,B001GM6C3K,"I purchased because the price had come down by 70% and I wanted the DVD version of the VHS copy I already had.  Glad I purchased this, because the DVD had some bonus features that were not on the VHS version,  There are some bonus material that is marked for Adults only, so DO NOT let you small children see that section, or you are going to have some explaining to do!",1402876800,,370,4.125

3615808,5,B001GM6C3K,Nice to see a personal side of Elton John.  I really enjoyed it alot!!  A nice keepsake for all Elton John fans!,1394409600,,112,4.045454545454546

3615810,5,B001GM6C3K,This documentary takes you on tour and into the private homes of Elton - its fascinating and fun!  Highly recommend!,1390953600,,116,4.8
3615811,5,B001GM6C3K,Of all the autodocs I've seen I feel like this one shows the real person.  I find Elton to be endearing.  I'm more of a fan of his than I was before.  I wish it was a longer documentary or rather I'd like to see an update as this one was shot... 10? years ago.,1390521600,,260,3.690909090909091
3615812,5,B001GM6C3K,"This all-access documentary has shown me the high level of respect due both to Elton and his partner, David Furnish (who directed this), for the very openness with which this was filmed and subsequently edited to provide an unflinching portrayal of the amazing and entertaining Elton John.  His talents are not in discussion here.  The slice of his life and times swirling around him in the mid 90's when this was filmed was not easy as we can easily see but whose life is that works that hard to give as much as he has?  Enjoy!",1389398400,,528,4.479166666666667
3615813,2,B001GM6C3K,"We are huge fans of Elton John and were soooo looking forward to this ""honest, personal, behind the scenes"" footage.  What we got was basically an amateur collection of ""home video"" type clips.
Sure, as other reviewers note... There are personal moments eg. With his Gran, for like 2 minutes, some short footage with his mum which was somewhat insightful.
Much of the video is shot in one of his homes while he wears his robe, which gives the viewer the impression of a personal look into his life.
The video only covers a certain time frame - particularly because his husband David is the one taking the video.
Very little about his great music history and his other trials and tribulations suffered while climbing his ladder of mega fame.
Would have loved footage on how he writes, composes, produces his songs, how they came to be, that sort of thing that bios are made of.
All in all it was an okay passing of approx. 1 hr, but for us it lacked all of the things we really longed for and truthfully left us feeling that Elton John is a spoiled, hormonal, temperamental, nasty individual  that has incredibly low self-image and esteem that he personally voices endlessly throughout the DVD.......poor baby .....should have chosen another career if its such a problem!",1371945600,,1270,4.716216216216216
3615814,5,B001GM6C3K,"Truly enjoy EJ's work, but did not know what to expect behind the scenes.  I certainly appreciate the honesty in what was presented, and while there are ""Diva"" moments they are acknowledged and not hidden like 99.9% of the other movies of this type.  Great movie about the life of a true rock legend.  Great to see he actually cares if he wins awards, and not indifferent about them.",1370649600,,383,4.521739130434782
3615815,5,B001GM6C3K,nice two in one --- very good the Tantrum and Terias made me cry and laugh I love anything Elton John,1367539200,,101,3.857142857142857
3615816,5,B001GM6C3K,if you are an Elton john fan this is a great purchase for you. it is a very well done documentary showing some of the private side of a very public man,1362873600,,151,3.75
3615834,4,B001GM6C3K,Good dvd that shows in the life of a 40 year old Elton. Not about music really just life on the Made in England tour. Decent if you're a fan.,1362441600,,141,3.7333333333333334
3615835,1,B001GM6C3K,"I have always wondered why anyone would be interested in the day to day events of any performer much less one as utterly disgusting as Elton John.
First, the guy would most likely be playing piano at some English pub if it weren't for Bernie Taupin, the writer of virtually everything that one associates Mr (Mrs?)John with. I don't know nor care about the financial arrangements between the two but I do know that without the songwriting ability of Mr. Taupin nobody other than Elton's bathhouse friends would know anything about the creature.
And don't get me wrong. I am not a fan of Mr. Taupin's music. Everything I have heard issued from the well worn lips of Elton John is a bit ""wussy"" for my taste. Too many people seem to enjoy the pap though so I will not disparage Mr. Taupin's work simply because I am not a fan of his music's style.
Regardless, why would anyone care much less pay for anything having to do with informing people of the day to day events in any performers life, much less a life as perverse as that of Elton John?
I didn't care for Elton John nor Mr. Taupin's music well before this walking plague came out of the closet and when it became fashionable enough for him to open that closet door I still didn't care for his music. As for the day to day happenings in this creatures life, I just simply fail to see why anyone would be interested.
If someone simply feels the need to spend their money for something this trivial may I suggest that instead they donate that money to charitable causes shortchanged by the incredible hogging of medical research donations directed toward AIDS ""awareness"" and treatment. If there were ever an avoidable illness, AIDS has got to top the list right up there with smoking related lung cancer. Mr. John seems happy to revel in his perverse sexual practices and if anyone really believes the creature is now a ""one man's man"", I have a bridge for sale that I can offer you for a true bargain.
I now await the availabilty of the telling of the day to day events in the life of Jerry Sandusky, another pervert who I am certain exhibits the occasional tantrum.
People that buy this stuff really need to re-examine their priorities. Though I am completely unaware of the financial arrangements concerning this item as far as what Elton John's ""take"" is for the sale of this garbage but folks, I assure you that the creature doesn't need the money and that one can find better things to do with the money it costs to purchase this crap. If there is a less deserving man of further wealth and fame than Elton John I am very hard pressed to figure out just who it might be.",1339718400,,2630,4.46985446985447
3615836,4,B001GM6C3K,"There are some clips of Elton in concert, making of his Believe video (parts of it), Elton receiving an award for Can You Feel The Love Tonight, and candid interviews of Elton. There are also clips of Elton shopping for clothes, taking pictures, cursing and trying clothes in addition to interviews of his mother and family pictures. It's a good DVD to get, and there are special features.",1308960000,2,389,4.735294117647059
3615837,2,B001GM6C3K,"But this DVD is a little boring.  It was done by his husband, David and is amatuer quality and just not that good.  I did like the segments with his Mother, though.",1305158400,2,164,4.09375
3615838,5,B001GM6C3K,"A perfect footage of Sir Elton's life, mostly very funny, sometimes a bit sad, but always very sincere.  The story features Elton's house, travelling habbits, tracking his charts position, composing a great song (what's it name?) and lots of other stuff.  It's obviously superfar from being boring.
Highly recommended for Elton's fans and everybody else.",1300060800,2,354,5.418181818181818

3615840,5,B001GM6C3K,"This movie was made in the 90's and I just saw it in 2010. It still holds up well as a story that should be told. The curiosity of how does a super famous person live day-to-day is exposed. Who could have guessed he insisted upon his wardrobe being handled like that - something a normal 8-5 person will never experience?
He is intensely driven to perform; while simultaneously behaving as if he only wants to go sit on the sofa and play video games and eat junk food. A compelling dichotomy. It is also gratifying to realize that he is with the same spouse today. That is saying something about character.",1281830400,,606,4.419642857142857
3615841,5,B001GM6C3K,"He is a true one of a kind. You get to see him at his ""DIVA"" best. It's funny and also sad. His life seems to be one of the boy who never really grew up emotionally. One example of this...jumping on a plane alone while on vaction without explantion only to return a few days later with the excuse;""A woman looked at him sideways"" while taking a tennis leson. Just when you are laughing and having a good time it's over.",1267660800,,419,4.121951219512195
