8363895,5,B002CCQZKS,"I got this collection for my mother. She was in her early 90's at the time and showing signs of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Her communication skills had greatly diminished. Once I started playing the Chaplin collection, she lost 30 years and had a smile on her face and I could see her taking in every moment. She was excited. One of my few great memories of a horrid disease process.",1393459200,,390,4.507042253521127
8363896,5,B002CCQZKS,"Although a lot of the movies are grainy and sometimes the music doesn't match the action, (upbeat drivel just to fill time), I have found Chaplains antics, mimes, choreography, original scripts and musical compositions as sound took over the silent movies to be, well, genius.  Very wrong to not allow him to return to states in the 50s, his work is of such high quality, our loss. He took on Hitler and Mussolini in such an artful creative way and was so far ahead of his contemporaries in brain dead Hollywood.  One has to buy many of these collections to see all his work, so many overlap.  But it is easy to see why the devotees of the silent era at that time were so disappointed when sound enhanced movies moved the silent movies to the side of the road-like special effects today taking the place of thoughtful dialogue. When I observe the silent movie, it allows for peaceful concentration on the action and I have to hand it to the ""little fellow"": he stood his ground, did not give up, and had a real appreciation for the female form.",1380240000,,1044,4.484210526315789
8363897,4,B002CCQZKS,"Here's a wonderful sampling of those classic Charlie Chaplin films featuring the Little Tramp character that made him famous in the early days of Hollywood. The quality is pretty good on this affordable DVD collection. And the variety is great, offering 36 shorts in one fat package.",1360368000,,283,5.042553191489362
