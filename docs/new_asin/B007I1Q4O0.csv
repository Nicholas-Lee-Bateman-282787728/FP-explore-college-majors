8517159,5,B007I1Q4O0,"This was a great series of episodes that not only allows you and your kids to learn, but Ms. Frizzle really takes you on an adventure and allows kids to use their imagination and learn everywhere she takes them. What I loved about these episodes as well as the books I have read with my kids is that Ms. Frizzle allows kids to know that learning can be fun and can be found in so many places in the world around them. Learning does not just happen in the classroom, which is so important for them to learn and for parents to support and nurture. I have a six year old and she still loves Ms. Frizzle and this DVD Set just sweetens the stories that we read together even more and makes Ms. Frizzle come to life outside of the pages of the book!

8517161,5,B007I1Q4O0,My two boys (ages 2 and 5) love this video series more than most of the Disney/Pixar DVDs we have in the video case - which says a lot.  Any Magic School Bus video (and we have several) is very entertaining to them. Love them all!,1379376000,,230,4.0

8517163,5,B007I1Q4O0,We all love the Magic School Bus. It is educational and keeps the attention of many different age groups.  The children even wanted to watch it in both laugues.,1370131200,,160,4.517241379310345
8517164,5,B007I1Q4O0,"Don't hesitate, just buy them. I was worried that they would be old school and not worth the $... but I thought I'd give it a go. They are really good- our 6 yr old loves them. I use them to coincide with his homeschool lessons and they make my life easier. We have the books too, so he can use those for book reports. Lots of info in both.",1369612800,,340,3.8714285714285714

8517166,5,B007I1Q4O0,I recently purchased this video for my 5yr. old grandson.  He is curious about the ocean and the animals that live in it.  He is familiar with Magic School Bus from watching the program on his mother's computer.  I thought this video would be fun and instructive for him.  It is a hit!,1348531200,,285,4.320754716981132
