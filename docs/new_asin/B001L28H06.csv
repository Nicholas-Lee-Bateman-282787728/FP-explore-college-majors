3677537,5,B001L28H06,The movie started out a bit slow but developed into a great martial art movie. There are lot of very good techniques from basic to advanced shown.,1277596800,,146,4.444444444444445
3677538,3,B001L28H06,"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Liu, Lau Kar leung, & Shaw Bros.  This release by Tokyo Shock is a great print, but the audio is a patch job & the movie isn't close to being a classic.  If you are confused by the dialogue in the subtitles and watch it in English dub, be forewarned that this is an unmastered and incomplete original dubbing, inserting Cantonese in the holes.

Yes, its got some good moral lessons of humility & it has good to decent fight choreography & performances, but the conflicts between characters doesn't make sense.  Cases of miscommunication and confusion are hardly plausible and therefore the conflict seems manufactured.  The story picks up after 45 minutes, but then another unrealistic confrontation drags it back down.",1276905600,4,744,4.826771653543307

Liu, Chia-Hui(Gordon Liu), Wang, Lung-Wei(Johnny Wang) and Hui, Ying-Hung(Kara Hui) at their finest. A little lesson on the do's and don't(s) of the Chinese Lion dance ritual as well. I haven't seen many Lau Kar-Leung(AKA Liu Chia-Liang in some movies) I haven't liked. Lau and his crew stand out among the Shaw Bros. movies from what I see. Got more on my list of possibilities(Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Invincible Pole Fighter, ???). Already own some of the other titles from Lau and Co.",1271808000,,587,4.70873786407767
3677540,4,B001L28H06,"After making a couple of successful kung-fu comedies like ""Return to the 36th Chamber"" & ""My Young Auntie,"" Boss Shaw wanted Lau Kar-Leung (Liu Chia-Liang) to make one more comedy before allowing Lau Sifu to make his dream project ""The Invincible Pole Fighters"".  So in 1981 we get ""Martial Club"", which isn't one of Lau Sifu's best, which means it's still WAY ahead of the average fu movie.  The first half has comedy that gets a little old after a bit, but it comes alive in the second half when it gets down to the fu & the ethics of martial arts.

Great performances by Gordon Liu, Robert Mak, Kara Hui, Ching Chu & good non-fighting performances by Ku Feng & Wilson Tong, but this film belongs to Johnny Wang Lung-Wei in one of his few (if not only) heroic roles.  The climatic end fight in the ""Zig-Zag Alley"" is unbelievable, I watched that fight four times in a row.  Tokyo Shock did a great job here with the transfer; widescreen, restored, a few special features.  This DVD contains all three audio tracks (Mandarin, Cantonese & English), however, the voices used in the English dub suck and does a disservice to the acting, while the subtitles are remastered & easy to read.  Well, watch it any way you want, it's definitely worth it.",1251504000,,1245,4.556053811659193
3677541,5,B001L28H06,"Tokyo Shock has done a great job with the other five Shaw Bros. films they have released thus far (as well as their release of ""7 Grand Masters""). I really hope they KEEP 'EM COMING, because the video and audio quality on ""Martial Club"" and the aforementioned DVDs have been superb. This DVD features anamorphic widescreen, english, cantonese and mandarin audio, and english and slates subtitles.
  As for the movie itself, it stars Gordon Liu, easily one of the most entertaining and charismatic kung fu film stars EVER, as Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung. If you enjoy Kung Fu flicks, you will enjoy this movie! Do you really need a long plot summary?
  Here's hoping that Tokyo Shock and the other companies producing QUALITY RELEASES of classic Kung Fu Films IN WIDESECREEN with the ORIGINAL AUDIO TRACK and ENGLISH SUBTITLES will continue.

Two rival schools...well...rival with each other. Then a 3rd school makes an entrance and tries to start some real trouble. The first 2 schools top students are good friends (it's the masters who don't like each other) and their antics threaten to really bring things crashing down. Then Lung Wei shows up and thing get really messy.

Its a good movie plain and simple. Not the best in its class but quality.",1394928000,,560,4.656565656565657
3677567,4,B001L28H06,"LKL's movies often don't quite live up to their potential, and this is a perfect example. The spectacular lion-dance opening, with narration from The Man Himself, lets you know you're in for something ambitious, but to have been a success, MARTIAL CLUB needed a rewrite or two. The episodic nature of the story gives the feel of watching a big-budget TV show (and what an awesome show it would have been!) edited into a feature-length film. ""Young Wong Fei-Hung,"" perhaps.

Gordon is himself, enjoyable as a youthful, mischievous Fei-Hung, and Kara Hui does what she usually does - ALMOST shines and steals the show before the movie reins her in. Hm...at least that's how I always feel when I see one of her films: She seems to be somehow held back from going into full-blown leading lady mode.

To me, the high point of the movie is Wang Lung-Wei's portrayal of a Northern kung-fu master, visiting a Southern instructor who intends to manipulate him into eliminating some rivals. Lung-Wei is a heavy, of course - when is he not?- but in a pleasant twist, he's not a bad guy in this movie! A tough guy, sure, and an antagonist for much of the movie, but by the end, we see he's honorable, reasonable, and even likeable. It's hard not to like him as soon as he says ""Cantonese are weird.""

The movies flaws are largely overshadowed by an awesome (in the traditional sense) final fight between Lung-Wei and Gordon Liu. Not to give too much away, but it's more of a match than a fight, and, refreshingly, no-one's life is on the line.

LKL's love of martial arts is at the heart of his movie, as well as his favorite theme of mutual respect between different schools/styles. I think with a tighter script, this could have been THE classic LKL film, even more than 36TH CHAMBER, 8 DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER or MY YOUNG AUNTIE. As it is, it's still very entertaining - an engaging, friendly movie from LKL.",1379894400,,1896,4.600591715976331

3677570,5,B001L28H06,"I have most of the Shaw Brothers, Golden Harvest, Orion, and more recently, Lionsgate martial arts videos.  Martial Club has one of the best fight scenes (the alley scene) I've seen.  On a technical basis, it's great.  Leg work, fist work.  It's all there in the Gordon Liu tradition.  I have watched the movie over 3 times so far, and still love it.  So, without giving out too much of a ""spoiler"", it's also the first time I've seen a certain well-known kung fu actor portrayed as a ""good guy"" (well, at least borderline ""good guy"")  ... see it for yourself.

3677571,4,B001L28H06,"This movie is about rivalry between two martial art group, resulting from a yearly Lion Dancing competition.

I would recommend that all fake Lion Dancing group out there watch this movie to get a basic rules of Lion Dancing.  Just as in this movie where there is confrontation and fights between the two group because one group did not know or obey basic rules of Lion Dancing, there are the same conflict out there in the real world because a wannabe Lion Dancing group did not obey basic rules of Lion Dancing.

I have seen conflict between two groups 30 years ago because one group did not know basic rules of Lion Dancing.  And the same group that did not know the Lion Dancing rules 30 years ago meet another group 15 years later, who did not know Lion Dancing rules, and had a conflict with this group because the ignorant of the new Lion Dancing group, forgeting that they once did not know the Lion Dancing rule themself.  And the group that does not know the rule of Lion Dancing think that the other Lion Dancing group is causing trouble. I am pretty sure it happens more often than that but that was the only two  observed.

After watching this movie you should be able to grasp basic Lion Dancing rules, if you are observant, so you don't have conflict with real Lion Dancing group.  Of course I would still know you are a fake, as Lion Dancing rules and rituals are much more complicated than in this movie, but at least you will know enough about basic rules of engagement between two Lion Dancing Group not to get into conflict with other experience Lion Dancing group out there.

Any martial art group (or ""Martial Club"" as this movie title), social organizations & associations can buy a Lion Head, drums & equipments and bang the drum & swing the Lion Head aroud. But it does not mean you know what you are doing. Read my review on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZPIBTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin [Blu-ray</a>] for an example.

If you want details about the movie, other reviews about this DVD will give you a good perspective of what the movie is about.

I am writting this review to point out the value of this movie to fake & wannabe Lion Dancing group out there.

As it does not matter if you sucker all the layman out there into believing that you are the real thing.  But learn the basic rules of engagement so you don't cause trouble.",1307923200,5,2475,4.7546728971962615
3677572,4,B001L28H06,"I finally purchased Martial Club, a fun movie starring Gordon Liu, Robert Mak, Kara Hui, and Hsiao Ho as students at three martial clubs. Gordon Liu plays a young Wong Fei Hung, student at the Hung Gar School along with his classmate played by Hsiao Ho. Their friend, played by Robert Mak, goes to a school that specialises in the ""Northern Kick"". He is Wong Fei Hung's rival engaging in a bit friendly competition over whose style is better. Mak along with his feisty sister played by Kara Hui (who seems to have a bit of a crush on Wong Fei Hung) can't seem to keep out of trouble.

In fact, trouble ensues when a third school, ran by a devious master and his son, stirs up trouble during a lion dance. A hilarious set up against Mak's character is probably one of the best scenes I've seen in a movie, and there is an awesome fight at the end in a narrow hallway that is one of the most unforgettable fighting sequences in a martial arts movie, ever.

It's a cute movie and nobody dies. Lessons are learned the hard way. The moral of the story being, fighting fair and following the rules of martial arts.

Highly recommended.",1304467200,8,1129,4.392344497607655
3677573,4,B001L28H06,"Gordon Liu and Kara Hui are both so watchable, your eyeballs can't help but drift toward them whenever they're on screen. They both star in 1981's MARTIAL CLUB, a film directed by the great Lau Kar-leung who, during the film's opening moments, enumerates the various courtesies which must be extended when two lions engage in a ceremonious dance. For example, a lion does not lift a leg to another lion, nor does it sniff the other lion's bottom, and so on. The lion, Lau Kar-leung lectures, fosters noble attributes universally admired by martial artists, and so the lion has come to represent the spirit of martial arts. This means that, plenty of times, martial arts schools will perform a lion dance.

MARTIAL CLUB kicks things off with an extended lion dance which escalates into a brawl between two martial arts schools, and the central plot eventually feeds off this heated rivalry. But first we meet the three main participants, the Wuben school's playful Wong Fei-hung (Gordon Liu, reprising the popular folk hero from CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS) and the brash Wang Yin-lin and his tomboy sister Wang Chu-Ying (Kara Hui), both of whom belong to the Tianshou martial arts club. But Wuben and Tianshou aren't the clubs steeped in rivalry. Nope, the feud lies between the Tianshou and Zheng schools, with the Zheng school being administered by a scumbag father & son duo. And their ultimate vengeance takes the shape of an unsuspecting but formidable master from Northern China.

Steeped in martial arts, Lau Kar-leung knowledgeably informs us not only of lion dance protocol but also of the encompassing umbrella of etiquettes amongst martial arts schools. Lau Kar-leung has always had a jones for inserting comic bits into his films, and it's either that you have a taste for them, or not. Several stabs at levity in MARTIAL CLUB made me laugh, other attempts fizzled. Yin-lin and Wong Fei-hung's clowning gets them into all sorts of scrapes. They frequently engage in friendly competition to see who has the stronger kung fu, and part of their fun involves their - on the sly - paying off various opponents to throw fights to them. There's also a goofy gag involving Yin-lin and Wong Fei-hung's repositioning of their belt knots to indicate that they're masters (except that they're not masters), and I think we all suspected from jump that this was gonna bite them in the fanny. As I mentioned, Lau Kar-leung's sense of humor, you can take it or leave it.

But there comes a time when you shove aside the silly and get down to brass tacks. Ultimately, it's always about the kung fu. One highlight is a sprawling all hands on deck donnybrook staged at a Chinese opera theater, and the director (or whoever) does a great job of choreographing the movements of so many participants on screen. There are neat moments in which Mai Te-lo (Wang Yin-lin) demonstrates his hard Qi Gong and Gordon Liu his leg stances. I also enjoyed the sequence in which Gordon Liu and Kara Hui ""accept"" the gifts bestowed by the rival school, and this leads to an absolutely stunning showdown between Gordon Liu and Johnny Wang Lung-wei who very effectively plays the northern master. This friendly climactic duel takes place in a zigzagging series of ever narrowing alleys, and the two combatants find themselves forced to adapt to various styles as the space around them grows more and more confined. It's truly brilliant stuff, and is alone worth the price of admission.",1283731200,,3457,4.865874363327674
8316928,5,B001L28H06,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  I love kung-fu movies with lion dances.  This particular one was impressive and had moves that I haven't seen before.  The lion dance in this movie is of the south-east kind in China, and what's nice is that they explain the rules of the dance of what is not acceptable behavior among lions.  Lion dances represent each kung-fu school's abilities and personalities.  It's meant to be a peaceful way for kung-fu schools to develop friendships, but it can also be used to challenge an adversary.  Inappropriate behaviors include smelling another lion's butt, and provoking it means to provoke a fight.  A second no-no is blinking at another lion while in close proximity, which is a sign of disrespect.  A third rule is that you cannot raise your foot while approaching another lion as it means you are prepared for a fight.  To win a lion dance, the lion must reach and eat the green prize, often a large cabbage wrapped in red ribbons.

The story here is two schools go at it and each one wants to show off their kung-fu skills.  One school (good) is more peaceful and wants to find a resolution to prevent conflict.  The other school (bad) is much more aggressive and cares not for respect, and they even brought in a third party for support.  However, the third party from Beijing (north) is actually not an aggressive individual and believes in fairness among the martial arts world.  His goal is to learn from the best school in the south east and wants the challenge to experience the best.  A third school that tries to work out a peaceful resolution among everyone gets involved because the master's son is the best friend of the son of the other good school.  Due to constant misunderstandings, everyone fights everyone, but the good must work hard to prevail.",1522108800,,1814,4.693037974683544

I like how intimate it is; even though there are three kung fu schools and a ton of extras (and a couple of brawls, of course), it's mostly just about four students and four masters. I'm not sure Kara Hui has ever been better or more interesting, even in _My Young Auntie_, a movie built entirely around her. I loved Johnny Wang in this, as well. I'm so used to him being among Shaw Brothers' most reliable villains that it's refreshing to see him play...well, a character who sides with the villains, but not really a villain himself; a man of honor and dignity. It adds a lot to the final fight between him and Liu, which is already great because of the unusual setting: an alley that gets narrower and narrower as the combatants progress along it, until there's no room for them NOT to touch each other, but they're still fighting. This is very high on my list on this first viewing, and I suspect that after a few more watches it'll turn my longstanding, thought-to-be-unassailable SB Top Four into a Top Five.",1495756800,,1138,4.44976076555024

That said, the only reason I can't give it a 5 in this category is because there were some kind of ""odd"" flaws in the story...  I know some of these flicks can be a bit jumpy, but there were 2 scenes that hit me pretty hard as ""what in the world""...  so...  it's not so much in acting or performance...  as someone just left stuff out of the script...

Again though...  This movie has amazing fight scenes...  One of the best ones in the Amazon list for classic late 70's / early 80's Kung-Fu...  and quite frankly...  this could rival even some modern movies pretty hardcore with the choreography...
