2621982,5,B000GY75JE,"Please put Farscape out on Blu-ray as soon as possible.  This is by far my favorite show of all time, most critics call it the most inventive science fiction series ever made.  The fans of this show are dying to get this release, the forums for this show are still active now and it hasn't even been on television in YEARS!  We're all waiting impatiently so hurry!",1232409600,3,364,4.402985074626866

2622118,3,B000GY75JE,"Farscape is amazing. But these Blu-Rays are not Widescreen and don't look better than an DVD played on a TV with upscaling. Actually, from what I heard that is actually what these Blu-Rays are; they don't have the original footage from which to generate HD or widescreen versions from. These disks are supposedly distributed with algorithmically upressed footage, not actual higher resolution footage. You can not buy modern looking footage of Farscape, no one has it. This version was not what I hoped it would be, as I already have the DVDs, which on a modern smart TV look just as good.

These disks do play on Region A PS4, even though Australian copy.",1513900800,3,656,4.754385964912281

2622121,5,B000GY75JE,"So... you like Guardians of the Galaxy, but wish there was a lot more? Then may I recommend Farscape?

Made by the Jim Henson company, this show ran for 4 seasons on the SciFi network, and was followed up with a mini series to tie up loose plotlines. You'll find several familiar characters.

John Crichton is an astronaut who got pulled into a wormhole into the far side of the galaxy. None of the other characters take him very seriously because he makes a lot of pop cultural references none of them understand. Sounds a bit like Peter Quill / Star Lord. He also develops a powerful ability no one else understands. Both of them also wear long trenchcoats and use twin pistols.

Officer Aeryn Sun is an alien who looks human - raised from birth to be a soldier. She and Crichton have a will they / won't they unresolved sexual tension thing going on. Gammora, anyone? Bonus - she's also hated by her former comrades (Nebula).

Ka D'Argo is a warrior who is pushes others away because of his violent past. His wife and child were killed and he seeks revenge. Drax, perhaps?

Rigel the XVI is the deposed ruler of an alien race who is insulting, greedy, and a thief. Granted, he's not furry or the product of science experiments, but he's small in size and has a lot in common with Rocket.

Zhaan is a plant based being who is the most spiritual of the group, but also can be surprisingly violent. She can say a lot more than ""I am Groot,"" but still...also, she's blue and bald like Nebula.

Oh, and they're all escaped criminals being hunted by an insane military commander. Two of them in fact - the first, Crais, starts out like Ronan, but ends up becoming an ally like Yondu. The second, Scorpius, is pure manipulative evil with his own agenda - much like Thanos.

There's no really good match for some of the other characters like Chiana or Pilot, but if you want to see a show with the same humor, drama, and action as Guardians of the Galaxy, I highly recommend Farscape. It is easily in my top 5 scifi shows of all time.",1511395200,3,2029,4.406417112299465

2622123,5,B000GY75JE,"I got the Australian version of this (the one that says on the box it includes ""The Peacekeeper Wars"").  You need a region-free Bluray player if, like me, you're in the US. I got this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q5M9VPM/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Even with the purchase of the region-free Bluray player, the whole package costs less than you'd pay for the US version of the ""Farscape"" series Bluray discs, and you get ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" as a bonus.

And having an all-region Bluray player could turn out to be more generally beneficial. I've noticed the UK Blurays for ""Battlestar Galactica"" (complete series) are also significantly less expensive on Amazon than the US versions. Maybe it's a trend.",1510012800,2,734,5.535714285714286

It's a great series, and having all the discs together makes it easier on the fandom heart when reaching the end of each season. Being able to just swap discs and continue the journey is far less stressful than wondering if you ever bought the next season.

If you like sci-fi, and/or the Muppets, this is a series you will love!! [or, if you never caught all the references from Vala and Mitchell in SG1]",1483920000,,579,4.5576923076923075

Do not buy the Blu-Ray until they find the original masters. Blu-Ray is not off the master footage but from secondary source material. Hopefully someone will ""locate"" the master proofs and scan to a newer Blu-Ray series in a few years. Then again they should not have even scanned a Blu-Ray if the original Farscape master copy footage was not available.

The last season was in HD, and moved into Wide-screen, and looks better. This Collection, unfortunately, does NOT include ""the Peacekeeper Wars"" (which wasn't released in Blu-Ray anyway). I was still reasonably happy.",1391558400,,406,5.2615384615384615
2622533,5,B000GY75JE,"Thought Id say this right off the bat: while it says it is The Complete Series, it does not include The Peacekeeper Wars, due to the fact it is licensed by another company.

This is my favorite TV show of all time, so feel free to read my review with some slight skepticism.  Its a show that I unfortunately did not see while it was being aired, although I do remember seeing the commercials  and its probably a good thing, considering some of the season ending cliffhangers, I probably would have had a heart attack.

Im not about to get into any real spoilers with this review, but Farscape follows the exploits of John Crichton after he is shot through a wormhole while performing an experiment into another part of the universe. Its innovative, unique, and a bit zany at times, but 100% full of heart. It really shines in the development of the main characters of the show and how their relationships develop over time. Its a real shame that it was cancelled after 4 years. It certainly had real potential to do great things with a 5th season (an extended Peacekeeper Wars) and maybe even a 6th (the Nebaris plan?). I cant see what they wrote in the comics as being what they had planned for the series.

On to the package itself:

Video: Episodes are presented in their original aspect ratios (4:3 for Seasons 1-3 and 1:78:1 for Season 4). Since the original 35mm the show was filmed on is apparently missing, the discs are upscales using the PAL masters. That means that unfortunately the show isn't going to look as good as we would like it.
Verdict:  If you don't have a large TV (or use a projector), its probably not worth upgrading from your DVDs. I have a previous DVD release and I can barely tell the difference on a 40 screen. However, I have also had the opportunity to view it on a 110 screen and yes, I can tell the difference and it does look better.

Audio:  The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix is phenomenal.
Verdict: You need to have a good sound system to get that benefit. If you are just using the TVs speakers, well, all I can say is you are missing out.

Extras: Plenty of them, but I honestly haven't watched them

Overall, I would recommend this for purchase, although if you have no intention of watching it on a big screen with quality speakers, it probably makes sense to save a few bucks and get the DVD box set.",1391212800,,2350,4.416666666666667

Not much long after that a little robot sticks a needle in his leg so he and all the others can now understand one another, I thought that was a brilliant idea to be able to speak our common knowledge instead of these actors having to speak a different language and we would have to rely on reading the captions to see what they are saying. There will be one or many of the charters in the series that brings you to like them and see what is next  aniline. As far as a science fiction series, I wish it had run longer.

The stories are so well written that you actually feel for the darn puppets. They come alive from the good writing, voice acting, puppeteering, great acting from the human cast members and directing.

It takes a while for the characters to be developed but once you reach season 2, the main story arc takes off and you are in for one hell of a ride. The writers constantly push the envelope of storytelling and they hit more than miss. Ben Browder and Claudia Black do a great job in this series.

There was a weirdness in the worlds and characters of this show that became addictive for many of us. It was filled with humor and tragedy, heroism and cowardice, wisdom and stupidity, joy and pathos.
When you find yourself deeply moved by what a giant puppet is going through (knowing it is being controlled by half a dozen puppeteers)--well, you know you're watching something very special.
The Peacekeeper Wars miniseries is very satisfying. I only wish the producers had been afforded the chance to tell that part of the story over an entire fifth season as they had planned.

Yes on one level it is ""muppets in space"" but when it was made CGI was primitive and very very expensive. On many other levels it is people out of their element working together despite their differences and making the best of a bad situation. The characters are all flawed.

I've been eyeing this via my wish list, for over two years. Patience finally paid off, as I scooped this up a couple of weeks ago for $54.99!!! Beautiful transfers. This is really a treat. One of the best Science Fiction shows of the bygone 'Sci-Fi' channel era. The show took amazing effort to produce, and the Blu transfer it shows it in all of the right ways.

Do yourself a favor and buy this damn set. Share it with anyone you know.
Watch it in a series of double features with the 2005+ seasons of Doctor Who, and daydream of a crossover. These shows would compliment each other well. If you're a Whovian who's never seen Farscape, get to it. It's right up your alley.",1382745600,,827,4.267515923566879

The concept is an astronaut in the near future came up with a concept that world increase space travel. While testing his theory, radiation hit his space (which looked like a mini shuttle) forming a wormhole which the astronaut was sucked into. When he came out the other end he was in the middle of a space and was brought aboad the main ship  out of desperation. When the astronaut helped get the main ship out of danger he essentially decided to join with the handful of verious types of aliens on the ship trying to stay one step ahead of another ship who's captain blamed the guy from earth for his brothers death.

Take into account the fantastic storyline, and great acting (most of the time) coupled with properly villainous villains, and this show takes you on a thrill ride of fantastic sci fi!

This is not Star Trek, but a little more like Star Wars in the fact that the Universe is filled with wild quirky aliens, many that actually look more like aliens and not just all humans in wierd outfits. The premise of Farscape is that Moya, a living star craft is herself a prisoner of the Peacekeepers and has broken free of her collar with her cargo turned crew, all prisoners seeking their own freedom aboard her. It is into this crazy mismash that Astronaut John Crichton has fallen after accidently gone through a wormhole that has dumped him into this wild section of space. To top it off, he has collided with another craft and becomes another fugitive on the run as he seeks his way home. It is trial and error as he finds himself fighting to escape the Peacekeepers as well as seeking acceptance from the prisoners he has fallen among, a slow and torturous process of trial and error. In the end, when he manages to get home, he finds that Earth has become as alien as the Space he has left.
What is odd, is that While Star Trek was supposedly an orderly meeting of aliens in peace and war, Farscape is more like what one might actually find out there, where rhyme and reason aren't exactly center stage. Cultures here are truly wierd and the aliens here are wild and funny or dangerous in their own way. A truly different view of Sci-Fi.",1376006400,2,1425,4.422053231939164

All of the aliens are humanoids, with weird make-up and appendages ala Star Trek, or else Muppets, and they look like Muppets.  There is no suspension of belief.  The sets are lame, and the overall production values are low.  Also, can we put the American flag on the correct arm of Chrichton?  I would say it's an Australian error, but lots of Americans make the same error.  Anyway, details like that are so distracting.  This show is for children, who get excited about Muppets.

The vision of Rockne S O'Bannon and the ability of The Jim Henson Company to bring to life his imagination is an alignment of stars that will not likely be repeated in the near future.

The science fiction is imaginative, well acted, and the characters are believable.  The bad guys are really bad and well portrayed.  It is always interesting to see how the ""good guys"" in spite of their differences, eventually come together to overcome the bad guys.  The living ship is a very interesting idea which has been used before but it is different here and works well.  I look forward to seeing all of the episodes.",1373068800,,573,4.3584905660377355

If you are  fan you will get a kick out of it. If you are not, then why not try something new? I only wish that they had adjusted the episodes aspect ratio to letter box, they look squished onto the screen. Also to get that full experience you need to get The Peacekeeper Wars Mini that wraps up the story, but is not part of the set because of distribution.

This is good Science Fiction. The entire cast and crew did some exceptional work. Work they can justifiably be proud of. It is absolute disgrace that the Sci-Fi Channel chose to shut them down before they had completed their story. The producers said they got to finish their story, sort of, with the followup mini series Farscape The Peace Keeper Wars. I've yet to view this program, so I can't say how well they were allowed to tie up all the loose ends. Interviews with the cast indicated that the actors were pleased that they got to return and at least try to give their loyal fans a proper ending to the story. I hope they were successful. It seems to me as if a program is doomed from the start if it gives it's audience an exceptionally good performance in writing, acting, directing, and producing. All these factors are necessary for good programming. All theses factors are very expensive. The networks would rather not be out that expense. They have found out they can put out a brainless piece of fluff, call it a ""reality show"" and still draw enough of an audience to make a profit. That is truly sad. If this trend continues, I'm afraid producers will just quit trying to give us good programming and we will be left with nothing but fluff.  Wake Up TV Audiences! Refuse to watch that fluff!

It's hard to point out one ""special"" thing in this series but I have got to say, it begins and ends with Moya and Pilot. A living ship. How more fantastic can you get. Oh, I also love the DRD's. Would love to have a couple around just the help with housework.

The stories are well written, filled with a good mix of action, drama, suspense, and comedy.

Don't forget to also purchase ""Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars"" as that was a made for TV movie that wrapped up the series. This was made a couple of years after the Sci-Fi Channel broke their contract with the Jim Henson Company and FAILED to carry on the Show for another season.

2622941,5,B000GY75JE,"Sci Fi fans; If you haven't seen Farscape you're missing a great experience for a great price. Farscape is huge folks! Its so unique and totally unlike anything else I've ever seen I was just blown away by it. I discovered Farscape by chance mid season 2 and fell so in love with it I immediately bought the series and The Peacekeeper Wars so I could watch all the episodes in their entirety in order. Farscape is a serial and needs to be watched in order, but it has more stand alone episodes than B5 which I also own. What a magnificent job Jim Hensen Productions did too! Visually, Farscape is gorgeous. The special effects are top notch. The puppetry is unlike anything I have ever seen. Pilot is a particularly beautiful and believable character. The cast rocks! Aside from Ben Browder and Kent McCord I think the entire cast is Austalian. Talk about talent! I can't say enough about the great players in Farscape, stars and supporting cast alike. Browder plays John Crichton,an astronaut who finds himself lost in the universe after the ship he's piloting gets swallowed by a wormhole. He,s rescued, after a fashion, by escaped prisoners on a living, sentient ship, and persued by bad guys. Farscape is heavy on relationships. Crichton's relationships with his shipmates as well as their relationships with each other, and how those relationships born in necessity and mistrust mature into love. Very beautiful and uplifting. Also important is Crichton's relationships to the bad guys: Crais and Scorpius. Crais starts out hating Crichton, who he blames the death of his brother on, but later comes to admire him. Scorpius is a heavy in a class of his own. He's very sinister but not exactly evil. He just does whatever he thinks is necessary to accomplish his goals which surprisingly have nothing to do with selfish ambition. He, too, admires Crichton in an odd fashion and at times protects Crichton from other bad guys. Much of Farscape is very funny - ""a comedy masquerading as a space drama"" - as one person described it, and sometimes Farscape will make you cry. I shed many tears watching Farscape. This brings me to the writing. Farscape seems like the writers wrote the parts and developed the characters for the actors themselves. The synergy is that good. Special effects and puppets and action are great, but nothing makes a series as worthwhile as a great plot, cast and crew. Farscape has the very best! If you buy this series you might as well get The Peacekeeper Wars. Like the original Star Trek, the studio pointy-heads didn't know a good thing when it was in front of them so they cancelled Farscape after its 4th season, but sci-fi fans everywhere raised such a fuss they were able to prod the muckity mucks into springing for The Peacekeeper Wars which puts a period fairly nicely on Farscape.

2622975,4,B000GY75JE,"About the product:

I love Farscape and I was thrilled when I could finally get my hands on the Blu-ray version. The first two seasons have a 4:3 screen format (most 'modern' TVs have a 16:9 screen format). That's the way the series was recorded originally but one would expect they would have change that for the Blu-ray version. Not a deal breaker, but a bit of a disappointment. On the good side, you get all the chapters with great visual and audio quality, English subtitles included (only English).

About the extras:
- You get some good audio commentaries from Ben Browder, other cast members,producers and director.
- Deleted scenes for every season. Unless you are a die-hard fan like me, they won't make a big difference, but if you are, you know that anything new or not seen before is totally welcomed.
- Behind-the-scenes-specials, now these are really good. You get interviews with Brian Henson, almost the entire cast, and David Kemper. You even get his ""wrap speech"" from when the series was over.
- Farscape Undressed, another behind-the-scenes-special that is hard to get by.
- Blooper Reel, always funny!
- Featurettes and Listen In with the music composer that is insighful and gives you a deeper understanding on the audio effects and what a big part of the series the music was. (I actually have the theme of season one as my alarm tone on my phone, if you've seen the series, you know that the music was innovative).
-Documentaries and Tv promos and other stuff.

About the purchase:
It all went great. The box that holds the discs came with a tiny tear on the bottom, nothing major. The box comes with a metallic finish and it looks aesthetic and is perfect for such a series. It arrived two weeks before the due date and almost 3 weeks after I order it. (I had it shipped outside the U.S.) There is no shipment tracking and no direct contact from the seller but it wasn't necessary.

If you don't know about the series, but enjoy sci-fi, I suggest you give it a try. This is the story of a group of renegades who travel through space - and time - in seach for their individual version of ""home"". John Crichton and Aeryn Sun are the main characters and the romantic couple that supports the story. However, you will find yourself surrounded by different characters, sometimes loveable, mere affable, borderline ridiculous or mean, that are easy to relate to because no matter how far in the Universe they come from, each one tells a story that hits close to home for most of us.

Finally, the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I know they could have make it a lot better considering how many faithful fans they have around the globe.",1364428800,,2674,4.585774058577406

It is a great story and so entertaining. It was a visually stunning series with excellent actors combined with life like muppet figures. The aliens are so visually exciting. The plot was so different than any other science fiction show I have ever seen. It is a must see. The DVDs were excellent quality and arrived quickly.,1364083200,,491,4.52808988764045

Quality of the episodes got remarkably better by season 2 and season 3 has some episodes that are just amazing.  I'm about to finish the last of season 4 and will feel the same frustration that I guess the loyal fans felt when it was canceled.  I enjoyed the whole series and ordered the final movie that is supposed to provide a limited ""closure"" to the series.

John Cryton's quirky charactor sucks you in. Too bad it was cancelled early. It seems that the syfy channel has really gone down hill and doesn't have much left in scifi. What they are left with is wrestling and those stupid unreal ghost hunter shows. They have cancelled wonderful shows like Alphas and Sanctuary.

When I started watching them, the distinctive theme song lured in two people that had never seen the show before that have become new fans and are now enjoying it with me. The Henson characters made this show really different from  all the others on the Sci-Fi list of greats like Star Trek and Star Gate (which are still two of my favorites) and they added a delightful element to the Farscape story. The compact box that houses the containers for the individual episodes is perfect for me too since storage ""space"" is not my friend.

The video quality of the shows is absolutely beautiful on this DVD collection and it is a pleasure to watch.  I have no complaints whatsoever about this item and it is a wonderful addition to my DVD library.  I recommend this item to anyone who ever watched ""Farscape"" on television, and I also recommend it to anyone who never even saw it as it was one of the best original sci-fi series ever conceived, not only for its original concepts and stories, but for the excellent development of the characters in this series.  This is a must-have for anyone who loves science fiction!",1361750400,,866,4.354037267080745
2623117,5,B000GY75JE,"Using a mixture of both episodic and overarching narratives, and throw in tired Science Fiction formulas that are given a new spin, plus some of the best Jim Henson creatures ever produced and that's what you have with Farscape. At its core, it's a story about one man's journey as he struggles to adapt to a new universe and must eventually decide between his origins and his new life, and it's explored upon often increasing tension and the drama. While it is quite operatic, it never fails to give itself a break from the drama with quite a few jokey episodes and some that are even horror movie homages.

This is Farscape best feature, as it never stays predictable and isn't afraid to try new things, all the while taking responsibility for actions characters have taken in the past, and unlike most other television shows, Farscape never forgets what it has established, and the consequences stick. This is a rare treat for anyone looking for something a little smarter, and a lot more respectful of you as a viewer who can handle real storytelling and character development that sticks. This isn't the same old case file TV bullshit.

However, the first season is a little unbalanced and is mostly used as a means to establish itself, but you must absolutely stick with it. No matter what happens, keep watching! You won't regret it. There's so much more I could say, but this series must be experienced whether it's the Blu Ray or the DVD collection.",1361750400,,1458,4.713725490196079

For reasons I can not fathom there are not enough women who are hard core GOOD (read NOT blood n' guts scare 'um) Science Fiction.  But I loved the series and am glad to own the DVDs. The bonus features were fairly interesting but, if you also bought the Peacekeepers movie, a bit redundant.",1361232000,,484,4.404494382022472
2623126,5,B000GY75JE,"First off, Farscape is a great series.  I don't know why I didn't start watching it sooner, but I continue to be impressed with how well written and thought out it is - it seems like they pick up on and address the little details that other sci-fi series have passed over.  Also, the work by Jim Henson's creature shop really helps to augment the reality of the show.  Yes, most of the aliens are still roughly human-shaped, but you get more non-human shaped aliens than with many other shows.

As for the set itself, I wish all box sets were set up this way - no fussy too-tight sleeves to worry about ripping and/or getting your disks scratched up, and all the disks for one season in a single box the same size as a normal DVD.  Yes, they must have compressed the episodes some to fit four on one disk, but I haven't noticed any kind of poor quality as a result.  Maybe someone with a more discerning eye could tell, but for the price and the presentation I'm not going to worry about it.

For anyone who was wondering, these do seem to be the same recording that is available for streaming through Amazon.  I did start to watch the series that way with my prime membership, but these came up on Gold Box and didn't cost an arm and a leg, so I decided to buy it.  I haven't checked out a lot of the special features yet other than the deleted scenes, but I'm sure I will get to those once I finish off the series and am pining for more.

One word of caution though - I did watch the commentary for one Season 2 episode, and since it was recorded after both the series and The Peacekeeper Wars were finished, it was hugely spoilerific for the rest of the series.  That's not a problem if you like to be spoiled, or if you've already watched everything once, but the warning should be out there.",1361232000,,1796,4.237536656891495
2623137,5,B000GY75JE,"I have watched this series when it was on Sci-Fi Channel(now Syfy Channel), ever since its inception and I always knew it to be a  fantastic series.  What Jim Henson's company did with movies like the Muppets franchise and then the fantastic movie ""The Dark Crystal"", I knew this series would turn out great!!!!!!!!!  Again, anyone who loves science fiction should purchase this TV series and watch it to their hearts content.  Also, if you are a fan of Stargate SG-1, you will also enjoy this series as 2 of the stars of Farscape went on to further their careers in TV as stars of this series as well",1361145600,,601,4.486238532110092
2623138,2,B000GY75JE,"I've enjoyed FarScape thoroughly through the years it was playing, so I decided to share this series with a good friend.  We sat down to watch it, and the lack of quality was evident immediately -- and this on BluRay!  I'm afraid to think of what it was like on DVD!  (Heard the DVD version doesn't have subtitles.  The BR version's subtitles are ... clumsy, with typos, oversized print in the way of the image...  If this wasn't coming from Amazon, I'd have accused it of being a well-packaged bootleg!

I've returned it and strongly recommend that you save yourself the annoyance.  The show was awesome. These reproductions are horrible.  The quality was FAR better when it was airing originally, on CRT TV!

Yes, the quality ruins it.  It's hard to enjoy it when it's coming off out of focus and pixelating, when subtitles have misspelled words, etc.  Shame they couldn't even manage to transfer it to disk properly.  For the price, I'm sure they could.",1361059200,3,956,4.692771084337349
2623139,2,B000GY75JE,"I love the Hensons work and I love sci-fi shows, so I thought Farscape would be a slam dunk. However, the show just feels amateurish. The acting is at times cringe-worthy, even worse than the old Star Treks. However, what really undermines the show for me is the pacing. Especially during the first season, it's really slow. The pacing and editing drag the story down rather than give it energy. I found myself getting distracted while watching the show.

The dialogue is pretty straightforward - with a few exceptions, nothing memorable or witty. D'argo is like a Klingon, but without the rich cultural layers and energy. Zhaan is sometimes interesting, sometimes boring. Crichton is a bit too much the ""all-American"" with goofy references to pop culture. Aeryn Sun's character had potential as a former soldier adjusting to life amongst the crew. But so far I haven't fallen in love with any of the characters. There's no Data or Worf from TNG.

That said, I have to admit the special effects are pretty good. The show uses muppets and makeups to create a much more bizarre world than anything found in Star Trek.

I tried Farscape because of all of the positive reviews. I watched 2 seasons but I just don't have enough time in my life to give it a chance when there's little room for hope based on what I've seen so far.",1360972800,4,1324,4.64957264957265

2623170,5,B000GY75JE,"This is one of the greatest sci-fi series ever.  One January 1, Netflix stopped showing the series.  It does not show in repeats anywhere, so it was time to go hunting.  Amazon.com is the place to hunt for things, so here I am.  The price was excellent, the quality of the blu-ray was fabulous, and I am thrilled I was able to get this.",1359590400,2,336,4.203125
2623171,5,B000GY75JE,"I love Farscape.  I've watched BSG, Babylon 5, all the Star Treks, Earth 2, Firefly, Doctor Who, and pretty much any other Sci-Fi show I can get my hands on.  Farscape is my favorite.  The variety of characters, the weirdness of aliens and alien worlds, the lack of absolute reliance on CGI, the branching storylines... all of it.  The acting is exceptional, the Henson studios outdid themselves on the puppets, and the writing is very good.  Every episode serves a purpose... not just to progress the plot, but to teach you something new about the universe or the character.

Go watch it.  Watch it now.",1359504000,3,604,4.695238095238095

2623174,5,B000GY75JE,"This was a great show on the Sci-Fi channel, and I watched it whenever I was able to.  The characters and their idiosyncrasies, plus the action and dialogue, not to mention the occasional sardonic humor, made for a lot of entertaining moments.",1359244800,,243,4.785714285714286

2623176,5,B000GY75JE,"Absolutely love the Farscape series and I very much enjoyed this blu-ray set. The quality is great (although for it's age it's not going to impress anyone that just finished watching Avatar but it's still better than the DVD version) and there are a lot of great behind the scenes features as well as commentaries.

If you like the Farscape series you will love this set. And it's very reasonable price tag!",1359158400,,407,4.652777777777778

2623199,5,B000GY75JE,The packaging is quality.  The show starts off slow.  In fact S1 and 2 are downright painful at times.  But by the end of S2 you're in for a great ride.,1359072000,,152,3.838709677419355
2623200,5,B000GY75JE,"If you're a Farscape fan, here's your chance to re-watch episodes whenever you want. If you aren't familiar with Farscape, give it a try and you will probably like it. The joint US-Australian effort gives a unique take on Sci-Fi, while the writing and acting provide a fun and light-hearted experience that I find endearing. My only complaint is that the ""geniuses"" running the Sci-Fi Network decided to cancel this series after only 4 seasons. As with Firefly and the original Star Trek, corporate ignorance of quality TV cost the network what would have been profits and good will, if they had let Farscape finish its story arc.",1358812800,,630,4.842592592592593
2623201,5,B000GY75JE,"This turned out to be one of my favorite scy-fi series. I am primarily a Star Trek fan, but my sister suggested I watch these, and I fell in love. The characters interact so well together, that you will forget you are watching a TV show. Even the puppet characters come to amazing life. The chemistry with all the characters is amazing and I love the story lines. Highly recommend this series to everyone!",1358812800,,405,4.486486486486487
2623202,5,B000GY75JE,"I originally resisted watching this show because of three things: 1) muppets; 2) my cable provider (looking at you comcast) was constantly moving the sci fi channel in and out of my cable plan; and 3) really crazy prices and limited availability for video/dvds to catch up after items 1 and 2 resloved themselves. Finally a good friend shared her DVDs with me and we ended up marathoning the series over 2 weekends. I just couldn't stop watching and I will be eternally grateful to her. I only regreat that I missed out on this incredibly awesomely written, performed and realized show for any length of time.

Do NOT let the fact that puppets are major characters keep you from watching. Once the show really finds its footing, which happens at about episode 17 in season 1 (with flashes of what is to come in episodes 7 and 9), you will not even notice that the characters are puppets, you will only see them as additional cast members.

The writing, the production values and the superb acting (Claudia Black, Ben Browder in particular is amazing as John Creighton and if this wasn't a genre show he would have had Emmys) all combine to make this a journey worth taking and well worth the now very reasonable price of admission.

Make sure that you also buy Peacekeeper Wars (a separate DVD due to IP rights issues) because the season 4 finale cliff hanger will have you throwing things at your TV if you don't have it on hand to continue the story immediately.

ABOUT THE BLU-RAYS IN PARTICULAR: I own both the regular DVDs and the Blu-Rays. Blu-Ray is well worth the upgrade and very pretty on a 1080p HD display. Picture quality and sound are awesome. Great extras too. Note that the series aspect ratio doesn't change until S4 so you have the small/old school picture until then.",1358726400,4,1786,4.6069182389937104
2623203,5,B000GY75JE,"Waited for years to buy this complete set.

Price was excellent too!",1358640000,,154,4.7407407407407405
2623204,4,B000GY75JE,"You seriously get everything a Farscape fan would ever want! It's truly fabulous. My one complaint is that the actually dvd's are held so tightly in the case that I am afraid just removing it might cause accidental damage. But aside from that, it's a fantastic product. It ain't no pile of dren! XD",1358640000,,298,4.537037037037037

Tried 3 different TV's, thru a playstation, thru DVD player, checked all settings on DVD, TV's and players ...could not get it.  Aside from that aggrivation, the show is awesome!  Me and my husband loved them, but you have to watch The Peacekeeper Wars to get an ending.",1358640000,,330,4.466666666666667
2623206,4,B000GY75JE,"This should have included the last series ""movie"" that was made to conclude the series.  You had to purchase it also so it is NOT the complete series as the movie was not like a movie that hit the theaters, it was just a longer show !!",1358553600,,235,4.0

2623242,5,B000GY75JE,Each season is in its own slim dvd case and there is a fifth case just for special features.  It provides easy access and takes up very little room.  The only thing missing is the Peacekeeper Wars.,1358380800,,197,4.297297297297297
2623243,5,B000GY75JE,"I liked finally owning the entire series at a reasonable price.  They used to be sold individually for a lot per disc.  This is a great price for a great show in a great set.  Jim Henson meets star trek meets Indiana Jones.  One of SciFi channels earlier and entirely original shows and still one of their best alongside star gate and Battlestar Galactica.  Only draw back in the blur ay set is the black bars on the side, so if you want it to fill the screen you might want to buy the DVD version.",1358294400,,498,4.145833333333333

2623247,5,B000GY75JE,All of the positive reviews are correct! This is a wonderful series that looks great (even on plain ol' DVD)! Ive made it into season 2 and cant get enough of these characters. Fans of good sifi/fantasy tv will indeed enjoy this. I picked the complete seseries up before Christmas for under $30.00 (very much worth it).,1358208000,,319,4.614035087719298
2623248,5,B000GY75JE,"Even my husband is enjoying the series. It was so disappointing when the series went off the air years ago. I never saw it in reruns, so the opportunity to get the entire series is a real treat. I enjoy science fiction and when there is humor as well as social implications it adds to the whole enjoyment.",1357948800,,305,4.275862068965517

Was *supposed* to be the complete SERIES...however, the last episode on the last disk of the SERIES ends with...""to be continued"".  Turns out the rest of the SERIES is on a separate set called, ""Farscape, the Peacekeeper Wars"".  Why wasn't this part of the COMPLETE SERIES set?  They could have at LEAST said you needed these other disks to COMPLETE the story.  NOT nice!!!!

ALSO...why the FRELL wasn't this put out with subtitles available for us Hard of Hearing people?",1356912000,,523,4.820224719101123

If you are a fan of Jim Hensen and his creature creations and love good sci-fi stories, well done FX and humorous, creative acting/writing, then this is the series for you. This set gives you 88 episodes and many extras - enjoy!",1356739200,,549,4.445544554455446

When orginally shown there were big gaps and a lack of information about when the new programs would air.

Now Farscape the plot outline of Farscape is a group of people on the run from big bad government/ruling body in space in a ship and they are hiding out in the uncharted territories. Later on running from them because of information Crichton has.  It kind of sounds like the outline of Firefly.  Except instead of wormhole information its information on how the Reavers came to be but information nonetheless.  I started watching the series again on Netflix after I just got finished watching Firefly and I did see the similarities.  Firefly is a super creative fresh great show I'm just saying that the greatest SciFi show of all time may have influenced it a tad...or a good chunk.

Love both and watch both and its not a SHOW IS RIP OFF DONT WATCH!!!  Again its a just sayin kind of thing.  I have watched this show from the first season and am doing it again!

2623409,5,B000GY75JE,"I now own the complete series of Farscape (twice over) but having watched them while they were still on the Sci-Fi channel I have noticed one thing, there are two episodes missing: one where Moya picks up another alien who ends up attaching himself to Moya while they are close to a Sun that makes all of them act a little more odd than normally (due to the Sunlight) Where Zhaan spends the whole episode on the deck ""sun bathing"", and Crichton has to cut the guy out of Moya because compared to everyone else his eye sight is bad.
and the other episode that is missing is where Grazer(sp) actaully boots Scorpius to the curb. You see bits and pieces of this one in the other epiosdes in season 4 in the preview where it reminds you what has happen previously, but the episode itself is not there.

the complete series is good, and was ended all too soon. some of the shows are PG13, other not so much but the show was meant for adult to begin with.
having those two episodes missing does not mess with the story line, i was just wondering why they are gone, even when you google the episode list neither one is there.",1351814400,2,1118,4.298578199052133

The only thing disapointing about the set is the movie Peacekeeper Wars is not included.  It was a movie filmed to tie the series up with a bow, so to speak, and a thank you to the faithful followers of the television series. Other than that, I think it is a great set and well worth the money.",1350950400,,426,4.120481927710843

Good transfer, excellent sound and if you have never seen it a great series put together by Henson the creator of the muppets so some great creature effects for the time. Well worth the purchase.",1349222400,,368,4.411764705882353
2623463,5,B000GY75JE,"I never watched Farscape when it was on tv. I did watch some online and to be honest I was right there with the first episode until he got aboard the ship and saw that one of the main characters was a muppet! And that plastic looking nose on Dargo really put me off.

I stuck it out though and finished watching and to my surprise the show was quite good. The muppet (Dominar Rygel XVI ) actually turned out to be a great character with a lot of personality. This show had it all and it's a shame it got cancelled early, though I feel more fulfilled with it than some other great shows that met the same fate (Firefly).

The set makes a great addition to my library and I'm happy I purchased it. The price is reasonable, though throwing in the Peace Keeper Wars would have made it even better. I would recommend this set to any scifi fan out there. It is truly unique and I doubt there will ever be anything like it again.",1348790400,,922,4.145251396648045

The commentaries included are very funny. I wish this show had not been cancelled but it happens to the best of them sometimes. I cannot bring back the show but I can bust out this dvd boxset and it hits the spot!",1348617600,,497,4.413043478260869
2623465,2,B000GY75JE,"The box set is packaged well and the DVDs are in good condition.  I am into the third season and have not found any problems so far with the audio or video.  However, Farscape is not what the introduction wants you to believe it to be.  If you are a fan of Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis, Babylon 5 or Star Trek (all of which I own and watch) and think that Farscape is similar to them and are using them for a comparison, you will be greatly disappointed if you buy this series.  Farscape does not have a well-organized story line.  There are some good actors, and better animators, but the story line is poor at best and the scripts rely heavily on sexual interaction of the characters to carry the show.  It just gets boring and will not keep you riveted and cheering for more and is definitely not something that I would let children watch.  How it lasted four years is beyond reason.

A human astronaut named Crichton gets sucked into a wormhole and ends up in a strange galaxy with even stranger aliens.  He is taken aboard a prisoner transfer vessel that is a living space ship with a soul and thrown together with prisoner that, according to them, did not commit the crimes they were accused of.  The show goes on from there to their being chased by a Rogue Starship Commander intent on getting revenge on Crichton for killing his brother.

They pick up another brilliant, ruthless, lunatic alien half-breed that wants what he believes is the knowledge of wormhole technology stored in Crichton's brain.  Running from one unknown point in space to another and fighting bounty hunters, a wizard and Peacekeeper Solders, they flee for their lives in search of their home planets where they hope to find peace again and resume normal living.  (Gee! They track us all over the galaxy in an effort to kill us but they will not go after us on our home worlds!  Duh.)

Their living ship is constantly suffering from everything from parasites; to being bombarded by pursuing ships; to giving birth to another space ship that is designed to be an attack vessel and other things that create crisis time 24-7.  The show goes from one crisis to another and each worse (in every way) than the one before with the worst decision-making by its crew that is possible for humans or aliens with the intelligence to go into outer space.

I bought the series because I have loved Sci-Fi all of my life and because of Claudia Black and Ben Browder who starred in the latter years of Stargate SG-1. I made the assumption that it would be similar to the Stargate programs because of Claudia Black and Ben Browder's participation.  I was wrong.  Claudia's Character allows for her to display far more of her acting skills than in SG-1 and Ben Browder's Character is played about the same as his Character in SG-1 but other than these two the series bears no resemblance to Stargate.

All-in-all, if I had known what the show Farscape was about before I made the purchase, I would have spent the money on Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda starring Kevin Sorbo, Lisa Ryder, Michael Ironside and Lexa Doig who was also in the latter years of SG-1.  Andromeda is Far, Far better than Farscape in story line, script writing and acting. Others have said that they love Farside but personally I have found it to be a waste of time and money. I am giving it two stars because it is packaged well and the disks are in excellent condition.",1348272000,6,3409,4.564860426929393

2623526,5,B000GY75JE,"I was a bit skeptical about this show never having seen it but had to order the blu ray set for the discounted Gold Box price because something told me that I would not regret this. Maybe it was the years of watching Star Trek, X-Files, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Fringe, Stargate and hundreds of sci-fi movies, that had made me think this was a good one to own and watch for the first time. I don't really know what it was that motivated me but I finally broke down and have now watched 2 seasons on blu ray. Visually, the colors and the sharpness of the blu ray are stunning and extremely pleasing to the eye. I sort of expected that since blu-ray frequently has an effect like this. What was not expected is the show itself. I warmed up to the show after 2 - 3 episodes and it has been an unexpectedly wonderful experience. The special effects are way better than expected, the stories are new and fresh along with the characters that are imaginative and lively. If you are a sci-fi fan of any kind, you need to watch this series. It belongs right in there in the Hall of Fame with those I listed above that I had already watched previously. The bar was set pretty high when I started watching this show and the bar has in some cases been raised even higher. Don't hesitate with this one - both the show and the blu-ray presentation are highly recommended !!",1343606400,3,1363,4.328125

2623528,5,B000GY75JE,"Charming, engaging, compelling, funny, thrilling, and to be sure, very different.  The acting is superb, plot fantastic, psychological thriller full of great twists and turns.  Cinematography is excellent, a true work of art.  The show is poetic, just has an insatiable, intoxicating stellar love romance.  It's light hearted, yet very intense, great redemption theme, and it's frothing full of passion.  Amazing characters, very impressionable, memorable, really utterly creative.  It's loaded with humanity, so very raw, which makes the characters, though out of this world, so easy to relate with-they boast exceptional character development!  The music is unusual, it's catchy.  This show has my heart as simply being the best science fiction series I've seen.  A memorable, brilliant story, very peculiar and odd, but ridiculously lovable.  (Note-if anyone is wondering, this is definitely not a show for children-some content is not appropriate.)  This series takes you on a magnificent journey through corridor's of adventure.  It's gripping, touching, deeply imaginative, highly sophisticated, and really cool.  Strange, extraordinary, wildly fun and entertaining, loved it.  Only criticism is that I wish it had been less crude in some places as some scenes just weren't necessary.  To be sure, a few of the scenes were down right disgusting.  The story and the cast made it quite fantastic enough, really didn't need the injection of the crude stuff.  Also, it had from my point of view an overly emphasized sexual theme, though not sexually graphic, it was just a little bit over the top, really added nothing to the story as a whole.  Lastly, it would of been nice to of had The Peacekeeper Wars included in the blu ray set, but not a big deal.  In closing, the cast was truly inspiring, full of wonderful talent-they were absolutely terrific.  It was an outstanding masterpiece, very riveting, exemplary, enjoyed it, brilliant extraordinary series.  Other shows recommended, all great, though nothing even remotely like Farscape, and nothing at all alike: Fringe, Revolution, Falling Skies, Sanctuary, Warehouse 13, Castle, Continuum, NCIS, Person of Interest, and of course,  the very fun fun Stargate SG-1 :-)",1343174400,,2224,5.367052023121388

2623530,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape--Some people love it, some people hate it. I told my brother about it and he just couldn't get past the puppet actors. As for me, I absolutely love it.  I'm a big fan of star trek the original series and the next generation. I'm a big fan of doctor who and stargate and I love science fiction as a whole. But every sci-fi show I have ever seen can only hold 2nd place to farscape in my heart. I loved this show. It is the ultimate space opera. This show has really raised the bar for me when it comes to science fiction. There are two things this show has accomplished which I still find unmatched even today. 1st, it has created the greatest romance I have ever seen on television (I could literally feel the chemistry and attraction between Aeryn Sun and John Crichton). 2nd it has created the best villain I have ever seen in science fiction-- that is, Scorpious. I mean this guy is a villainous mastermind that I loved to hate and yet respected for all his sheer genius and baddassery.

If people can stick with it and accept its ambitious imagination, then I'm sure that they'll love it. Its unfortunate that Farscape was a cable show and therefore was viewed by a smaller audience. I suspect if it had been on one of the major broadcasting stations, well then its cancellation would have turned out to be a very different story.

Bottom line, if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan, then you should do yourself a favor and look into this often overlooked treasure. Cheers :)",1341878400,2,1488,4.463235294117647

This was a strange space sifi series that was underrated and way ahead of its time... Maybe a little too far ahead...  I'm a little disappointed with this particular collection product... The folks that put these DVDs together have a couple of the series out of sync on the Season III Disc and the collection is not subtitled.... No closed captions... What's up with that... I'm deaf and rely on subtitles to keep from constantly turning the volume up during close personal scenes and scrambling to turn it down during action scenes.  I watched this series when it originally came out back in the day and had forgotten how you love to hate each character... Antiheros all with Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) the exception... Strange but entertaining... Regardless my disappointment with this particular purchase...  Amazon and it's dealers are great.. Fast shipping.. Great prices....,1339545600,2,982,5.125

2623575,5,B000GY75JE,"First of all, a distressing number of people are complaining about the first 3 seasons being full screen (1.33:1 aspect ratio). Assuming that's the way they were originally shot and framed (which I'm assuming is the case), the only way to get widescreen (1.78:1 aspect ratio) would be to crop off a significant portion of the image or stretch it out unnaturally. Both of which are terrible options, and can be done on most TVs anyways.

A couple complaints. There's no subtitles. Turning the closed captions option on works for my TV, but I can't do that on my laptop. It would also be nice if there were some sort of listing guide for the commentaries.

There also appears to be only 8 commentaries for season 3, instead of the advertised 9. Making 30 commentaries total, rather than the advertised 31. Unless I'm counting wrong somehow.

2623576,5,B000GY75JE,"FARSCAPE is one of the great SF shows, and its first contribution was the amazing visuals: in one of the early episodes, there is some kind of wild blue flowers in the otherwise ordinary vegetation, and the addition of that decidedly alien species is enough to give an exotic flavour one doesn't usually get on outdoors shots in SF TV shows. This seems like a mere detail, but it is typical of the great touches FARSCAPE abounds with: Pilot, the... pilot - what else? - of the living ship Moya, is some sort of giant humanoid shellfish and doesn't look at all like some cleverly made up human. To sum it up, this show is fun to watch. This is the show that pushed the envelope BABYLON 5 had started to work on: computer FX for TV shows. It's a second wave, the technology has evolved and the general look is superb.

But that would not be enough if the story didn't follow. For four seasons, the show went from crazy ideas to crazy ideas, building on them, evolving, altering the relationships among the main characters, pushing them and coming up with genuine surprises, great humour and gripping story lines. The characters were interesting, and often the bad guys were the exciting ones, and the weirdest characters got the nicest human moments. You never quite knew where the show would go next.

The Blu-Ray format plays quite well to all these strengths, the box set itself is tight and compact, 20 disks, with many bonuses I haven't explored yet. I only have one regret: for - as I understand it - rights reasons, the concluding TV movie, THE PEACEKEEPER WARS isn't included. Hopefully, it will be released in BR too so that this great show can be seen in its entirety. It is easily available on DVD, though.

The picture quality is fine (the format is 1.33 at first, haven't checked the last disks, yet), the disks are, beyond region A, at least also region B compatible, I can vouch for it. Langage is restricted to English (with a few alien languages, mind you) with English subtitles available.

Lots of fun to be had, my recommandation.",1338508800,,2048,4.587431693989071

This brings me to my complaint, and the reason I only give four stars out of five: A&E decided not to include one word of subtitles with this series! How can you possibly enjoy the commentaries without being able to put the dialogue up on the screen?

Then even more insulting, a stupid message at the start of each DVD, written by A&E Scarrans, saying that ""the commentaries do not represent the opinions of A&E Affiliates, as none of us have any opinions worth a bucket of spit"".

Farscape is ""all of the above"" - and like no series ever seen before or after it graced broadcast cable.  In this, it's third re-lease (this time onto the High Definition Blu-ray format) it has never looked better. This release remastered from the highest quality PAL source material and up-converted to 1080p, and while it isn't as sharp as a native HD source, it is quite likely the best that this series will ever get.

The only thing missing, which would have made this series collection complete, is the inclusion of the mini-series ""Peacekeaper Wars"", which wraps up all of the various storylines and brings a sense of completion for the characters.

When I saw both series up on the Amazon Deal of the Day, I grabbed the Blu-ray version and could not be more happy that we waited to watch until now!

It seems like they replaced all the CGI scenes with updated graphics and they look amazing. The sound was remastered into DTS and sounds very full and lifelike.  The only con with the sound is that the music on the menu is still Mono.  If they were redoing it all, why not that small part too? Oh well, not a big deal.

The acting is horrible; from me, that's saying alot, cuz usually I can find ONE actor in the group who might be worth watching...Not with this group. The only bone I can throw them is that the writing and direction far exceeds in the terrible compared to the acting. Center a story around a worm-hole Earthling trying to get home...then give him no real desire to do so? Crap. Utter crap.
The poorly prostheticed pig nosed ""warrior"" is a joke. NO true depth of character and his line delivery is that of a scholar, not a escaped convict. I purchased the entire series but have only made it to a multi- planed slipstream episode where the group has some unbelievable contrived bonding dinner at the end that made me sick.

2623761,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape is a truly unique show. Though it has some similarities to other science fiction series, it has a very different perspective and tone. At first, it didn't appeal to me. A while back, I watched the first two episodes, and they didn't grab me. After seeing numerous rave reviews, though, and a great price on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance, and I'm glad I did.

The series starts a little slow. The first two seasons mainly consist of standalone episodes, though there are the occasional multi-parters. Little by little, though, the longterm plotlines emerge, the characters grow, and the relationships carry more weight. By the end of the first season, I felt invested in the characters. By the end of the second, I was hopelessly hooked.

And then came the third. Season three is, in my opinion, one of the best seasons of any show (of any genre) I've ever seen. It matches or surpasses the best of The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Babylon 5. By employing a brilliant plot device, the crew is divided, and much of the season alternates between the two groups. The set-up is fantastic, the execution is flawless, and it builds to a tremendous climax.

Farscape has some of the best special effects, and certainly the best make-up and costuming, of any show, and it all looks great on these DVDs. There are tons of great extras, too. I always appreciate when it's clear that care has been taken to give fans a great product. They really did a wonderful job putting this together.

The show also does an amazing job in terms of story continuity. Babylon 5 famously planned its five seasons, but (also famously) hit some bumps and had a few minor dead-ends, even though it ultimately achieved its goal. I don't think Farscape had its full plot planned out for the series, but the seasons, especially the third and fourth, have strong narrative arcs, and you don't get any of those ""never-mentioned-before"" characters or easy outs that plague poorly-written shows. The consistency helps Farscape's bizarre universe feel more real.

It should be noted that this box set does not really contain the entire series. For the conclusion, you do need to get the Peacekeeper Wars. I recommend getting that well before you finish the fourth season. You won't want to wait after watching the incredible final episodes here to move on to that set.",1326067200,4,2382,4.785888077858881
2623762,4,B000GY75JE,"UPDATE: When I wrote this review, I was under the mistaken impression that the DVD version included commentary tracks for ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"" and ""They've Got a Secret"". I've since confirmed that this is not the case.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

It is important to note that most of the reviews here are for the DVD version. The DVD version of this collection contains commentary tracks for many of the episodes, but these appear to have been left out of the Blu-ray version. Given the immense storage capacity of Blu-ray discs, the omission of 2-4 50-minute audio tracks per-disc is unacceptable. If you, like me, enjoy the audio commentary tracks, then you're better off buying the DVD version. If you don't care about them, however, then the improved video quality of the Blu-ray discs is well worth the extra money.",1326067200,28,821,4.857142857142857

2623766,5,B000GY75JE,"I recently picked up the bluray release of Farscape and just last night finished the final episode of season four.  What is my opinion?

Stunning!

It's a show that is SO good that it could only be rivaled by the shame I feel for not checking it out sooner.  I have always known about Farscape, I caught parts of episodes from time to time but it was just so different from what I was into at the time that it didn't hook me, plus the opening music theme really didn't help.  I heard other web friends talking about how good it was and decided to give it another look, but waited for the bluray release.  The blurays look amazing, and they are packed with extras, and the art box looks very handsome on the prominent shelf on which it now rests.

As for the show, it was a joy.  I can now see a lot of what made this show great in subsequent shows that I enjoyed like the Battlestar Galactica re-imagining.  With Farscape it all comes down to character development (my favorite thing), and the interesting ways that the characters manage to worm or weasel their way out of the traps and unusual situations that they find themselves in.  It's a BIG adventure, with lots of great new faces from the Australian casting, beautiful sets, and some truly impressive creations from the Jim Henson Company.  If you can look past its minor flaws and inconsistencies (and they are usually minor) the character moments are VERY rewarding, especially in season 3.

Immediately after I finished the show I went on to Amazon and bought the sequel mini-series ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" to see what happens next, and will be checking out the continuations of the show in other formats.  I hope you don't wait like I did and check this show out today!!!",1325462400,15,1732,4.512820512820513

The HD quality is great as well as the audio. I have seen the complete broadcast but haven't watched the entire series since I received this, but it is nice to have a complete series and not feel you've missed anything.
I must add, Get this and don't neglect to buy 'The Peacekeeper Wars'. It's not a part of this package. It is a necessary end to to a series that was cut short.",1324166400,3,738,4.641221374045801

So I was sorry to see that they didn't covert it to high definition and simply put it on blu-ray.

2623791,3,B000GY75JE,"I view my videos on a 106"" projection screen from an Epson 6500UB projector, at 16:9 aspect ration and I prefer a widescreen format.  This product comes at 4:3 for what was available in the original format and supports only 16:9 in the menu displays.  The HD resolution in comparison for 4:3 format is something in the order of the 576i PAL version.  The crisp focus in the characters faces look good but the motion lacks a great deal.  I typically refer a 1080p resolution to a widescreen and if this product came in this resolution as resident and did not require me to strech the image I would've given another star.  I would say that the overall image is better than the upscaled DVD Peacekeeper Wars and I do recomend this video to anyone whom is a fan of Farscape.
After investigating further I have discovered that the first three seasons are in 4:3 format and the forth season is widescreen.  Also, the original film was unavailable to convert to 1080P so an up conversion was done from 576i and a great deal of artifacts created in low resolution motion sequences.  If you pay the $109 or less for this set I would still recomend it.  Don't buy from Best Buy, you'll pay an additional amount than was available at release.",1321747200,4,1231,4.513513513513513
2623792,3,B000GY75JE,"Very happy they finally released Farscape on Blu-Ray but was extremely disappointed to learn Farscape: The Complete Series does NOT include The Peacekeeper Wars, the mini-series that concluded the series after Sci-Fi cancelled it's regular broadcast. That'd be like Battlestar: Galactica the complete Blu-Ray set not including the miniseries that started it all. It's just rubbish and clearly an attempt to solicit more money once The Peacekeeper Wars is separately released on Blu-Ray. If I were you I'd wait until they release Farscape: The Truly Really Complete Series on Blu-Ray. I would have had I known they were gypping me.",1321315200,6,630,5.31
2623793,4,B000GY75JE,"""Farscape"" came at a good time providing a bridgeduring a key time when most science fiction on TV was ""Star Trek"" or nothing else (""Babylon 5"" excepted) and it brought a much needed dollop of humor, fascinating storylines and great characterizations. It's true that the series presents a hodge podge of ideas that were successful in other shows from ""Star Trek"" to ""The X-Files"" but what was great as with all things that are an amalgamation of other ideas from other shows was how it was put together.

""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is, well, somewhat incomplete. While it includes all four seasons it doesn't include the mini-series ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" due to licensing issues with Lion's Gate (which released that title)so you'll need to keep your DVD set for that until the latter is released on Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray presentation for ""Farscape"" suffers a bit from the fact that it was produced prior to studios thinking of high definition. The show was shot on film but the visual effects were done in digital standard definition, that wouldn't be a problem but the show was assembled in standard video as well and the 35mm source prints  are nowhere to be found.

Having said that the New Video used a number of digital techniques to enhance the SD picture and bring it into the high def realm pretty effectively.

Be aware however that ""Incubator"" has the dialogue slightly out of synch with the picture on the Blu-ray.

Subtitles ARE on the Blu-ray release.

If you adjust your expectations that this ISN'T going to look as good as, say, ""Battlestar: Galatica"" on Blu-ray or even the original ""Star Trek"", you'll enjoy this set. Should you buy it? That depends on how picky you're going to be about teh image quality here but this does look marginally better than previous editions.

As a result we have a Blu-ray presentation that isn't in 1080 instead A&E and New Video the distributors here had to go to the best source possible the PAL video (which has higher resolution than U.S. NTSC)thus while this isn't in high definition it DOES look slightly better than the the regular DVD's in particular because the higher bit rate for Blu-ray allows the show more ""breathing"" room. The show looks soft but there's no way around that. Detail is better than the 2009 DVD's but the compression artifacts that were problematic for the DVD set released in 2009 aren't as problematic here. Likewise, this is a huge upgrade over the ""Starburst"" editions of the series put out a couple of years back.

The audio is a big upgrade with a lossless 5.1 presentation that is quite powerful and well done.

The special features from the previous 2009 set have been carried over for this set with one new high def featurette included looking back on the show. We get mulitple commentary tracks for a number of episodes (with the first season getting the most).

Summary: -video quality: Is soft but with better detail than most of the DVDs I've seen of the show because the producers used the higher resolution PAL video masters. The encoding and use of compression here is an improvement as well helping the picture quality. It's a marginal upgrade in image quality though.

Audio: Sounds brilliant with a nice, immersive 5.1 lossless mix.

Special Features: All of the special features from the 2009 A&E/New Video release are included with one new high def special featurette.

There are 31 commentary tracks. We also get deleted scenes and TV spots.

The first season of ""Farscape"" is a bit uneven but the show finds its footing by the second season and was positively on fire once Scorpious was introduced as a character.

I'd still recommend this as long as you adjust your expectations on the video quality of the series particularly if you can get it at a good price.

Farscape: The Complete Series Blu-ray, Video Quality
  3.0 of 5

Farscape is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of A&E with AVC encoded 1080p transfers in 1.33:1 for the series' first three seasons and 1.78:1 for the last season.  Farscape was filmed in Australia and presented there in the PAL standard. The series' creators are insisting that the 35mm prints are nowhere to be found, plus the visual effects were created in SD (meaning they'd have to be recreated for a true HD master), so this is an upconversion which unfortunately does not look great a lot of the time. I'd actually rank the 1.33:1 seasons at somewhere between a 2.5 and 3.0 and the fourth season moderately higher at between a 3.0 and 3.5, for an average score of 3.0. The image is frequently fuzzy, with less than appealing color and some very spotty contrast. The series is often quite dark, regularly taking place within Moya's labyrinthine confines, and crush is rampant throughout these sequences. Things have at least a moderate improvement in the final season of the series, though even at a wider aspect ratio, the image is still distressingly soft a lot of the time, with little of the pop that one would hope for with a series of this relatively recent vintage and one which boasts such an impressive production design and sometimes staggering visual effects. In fact it's the visual effects that probably come off best in the series, with the animated sequences of Moya or other interstellar sequences achieving a modicum of clarity and precision which the rest of this presentation lacks.",1320537600,22,1594,4.888888888888889
2623795,5,B000GY75JE,"Action, imagination, exciting story lines, excellent sets & effects, phenomenal puppetry and much more.  I saw approximately 50% of the

is so much material ! [68+ hours in all, excluding bonus features and directors' cuts]  Also, I am 100% delighted at the speedy, great
service and sensational value I received when I purchased the brand new series from ""nice_things"" at Amazon.

A worth while addition to your entertainment collection, especially if you appreciate the bizzare.",1318118400,3,414,5.1940298507462686
2623797,5,B000GY75JE,"I love this show. Farscape is a big mix of a lot of the things a science fiction fan like me love to see. You get the visceral stuff like cool sets and special effects that move from neat to full on spectacle. You get the science stuff like explanations and effects of alien physiology and various advanced and imaginative technologies. You get the story driven stuff with scripts going from drama to action to comedy (sometimes all in one episode), dealing with complexities of alien cultures and governments, to straight up space opera type fair complete with villains in black and scary monsters to fight. There is a reason why Farscape was considered by critics and viewers alike to be one of the best science fiction television shows ever made.

You have a modern day Earthling astronaut who is the main character in the series. His is a fish out of water kind of story as he is thrust into this alien part of the galaxy by a wormhole with absolutely no clue regarding his new surroundings. This isn't your normal fish out of water character. This is an intelligent, wise cracking fish who not only takes his new challenges with relative stride, but also with a note of sarcasm. The supporting cast is just as interesting... and  interestingly enough all escaped convicts. There is the human female looking plant organism of mediation and empathy (convicted of murder). There is the aggressive tentacle-headed alien with a warrior's rage (also convicted of murder, but is innocent). A blue pixie-like skinned party girl who plays thief and spy at times (convicted of non-conformity). A froggish-like alien with a superiority complex (imprisoned after a coup against him). And last, but certainly not least the tough as nails female Peacekeeper soldier who is a strictly by the book type (ironically on the run for being socially exposed to said convicts). This is a taste of the interesting developments based on characters alone.

The series has varying story arcs much like what you have seen on Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5 and other such shows. What seems to be the main premise of the show slowly morphs into something else. This is done in a way flows smooth and feels organic. What surprises they do pop up on you make sense and aren't just to shake things up. Most episodes have a good mix of the things I mentioned earlier, but sometimes they go off on tangents. Especially on the third season. One example is an episode done entirely animated and ran like an old Warner Brothers cartoon. Even in the odd episodes the show is pretty good.

So good characters and good stories are nice, but science fiction for many lives of dies by the visuals. This is where Farscape shines. Sets are intricate and the CGI scenes are dynamic. Special effects can be found all over the place from laser blasts to animatronics to computer generated space battles. As a matter of fact Farscape has the distinction of being the television series with more special effects on average per episode than any other science fiction show to date. So you want flash and style in your substance? We got you covered.

This highly anticipated Blu-Ray release is going to be hot, but there are caveats. The big one is the high definition picture. Technically it can be called high definition because it's going to be more than 480p in resolution. However not by much. You see the original 35mm film used to film the episodes are pretty much lost so there is no remastering of the source material. Even if they had the original film the CG effects weren't done on that resolution so remastering would have been difficult. Best they can do is use the European PAL video master tapes, which should be at 576p resolution. While this isn't truly high definition it is the best these shows have ever looked, and the end result even has Brian Henson's approval on it.

One other caveat regarding the Blu-Ray set. It will all of the episodes of the series, but not everything. The final mini-series, which Brian Henson refers to as episodes 4:23-4:26, is owned by Lionsgate and will not be in this Blu-Ray collection. That means if you want the complete series you will still need to get an additional title in the future. Small price to pay if you ask me. There hasn't been any mention of upgrading the 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 channel track, but I will update if anything new is announced.

This Blu-Ray set will have 20 disks covering all 88 episodes (minus the mini-series of course) plus all of the previous extras from the Starburst Edition DVDs and previous full series release. There will also be some new extras never before available. Here is a breakdown:

Episode Commentaries - 29 episodes have commentaries covering the spectrum of all the major cast and crew throughout. These are the original commentaries from the DVD collections.

Memories of Moya: An Epic Journey Explored - New documentary exclusive to the Blu-Ray releases chronicling retrospective interviews from cast and crew.

Farscape Undressed - This was a one hour behind the scenes feature shown on the Sci-Fi Channel to help prime new viewers for the third season. This feature wasn't released on the Starburst or DVD sets before it (it is in the new DVD series collection though) and is a much welcome addition.

In the Beginning: A Look Back with Brian Henson - A very informative interview with Brian Henson that was made in 2004. It runs about a half and hour and was on the Starburst release and up.

Making of a Space Opera - A 22 minute documentary on the making of the series. Not quite as informative as Brian's interview, but makes a good promotional piece for the series.

Season 3: A Look Back with Executive Producer David Kemper - Basically David's take on season three and how the show has matured so far.

Farscape: The Story So Far - This is a 22 minute catch up feature for people to get familiar with Farscape up to the fourth season. This featurette was in previous collections.

Inside Farscape: Villains - 15 minutes of interviews with the actors who make up the major villains Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), Crais (Lani Tupu), and Commandant Grayza (Rebecca Riggs). Cool to see Wayne out of makeup.

Inside Farscape: Special Effects - Animal Logic was the visual effects company that worked on Farscape. This feature shows before and after images of various effect pieces along with a commentary explaining what you see.

Inside Farscape: Save Farscape - Pretty inspiring piece on the efforts by fans and crew to revive the show enough for it get a proper send off.

Deleted Scenes - There have been 90 minutes of deleted scenes previously released, and we are getting them all.

Farscape in the Raw: Director's Cut Scenes -  Compares the final scenes with the director's print. Keep in mind these scenes are without special effects, music, or sometimes even proper dubbing.

Alternate Version of the Season 2 Premiere

Listening In with Composer Guy Gross - Focuses on Guy and the process he goes through composing the music for the series. You get to watch him at work pretty much while he gives a commentary on what he does.

Behind the Scenes Interviews - I am thinking this may be the interviews from the previous collections from actors Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Gigi Edgley and Wayne Pygram.

Zhaan Forever - A more in depth interview with Virginia Hey. Runs about ten minutes.

On the Last Day: Wrap Speech from David Kemper - A goodbye speech from David to the crew. Recommended viewing once you finish watching the series.

Production and Design Galleries - archival photo galleries, character concepts, promo photos, design gallery screen shots, rough drafts, and concept slide shows.

Original TV promos and trailers

It looks like a number of little extras from the Starburst collection won't be included like the Alien Encounters, Cool Farscape Facts, Farscape Chronicles and even maybe the early make-up tests will be omitted as well. Still if you have to leave something out these are probably the least sought after.

Farscape is a sci-fi TV series that ranks right up there with the best of them. Every fan of the genre should get familiar with this show, and this release is a great way to see it.",1316649600,27,8195,4.759520451339915

2623799,2,B000GY75JE,"Did you ever try to lip-read a Jim Henson puppet speaking with a British accent?

The only reason I give it as many as 2 stars is that it is a great show.  I enjoyed it when it was first broadcast because I still had some hearing left and there were closed captions on the broadcasts.  Without closed captions, it is a waste of my time.

On the box and each of the 5 DVD holders, the closed caption logo is displayed.  The Amazon description and the NewMedia (distributor) website description both clearly state that closed captioning is included.  I played several of the discs on various players and computers, to determine if it were a problem with my equipment.  Closed captions are NOT available.

Then I noticed that it was an A&E TV production. I have run into the same false information on their other videos.  They also heavily censor when they actually do provide closed captioning on other shows.

Also, the aspect ration is 4:3, not 16:9.",1315612800,10,950,4.568047337278107
2623800,5,B000GY75JE,"Ifound this set to very high quality,and the episodes to be exactly as i remember them and the price is worth every penny! thank you amazon",1315440000,,139,4.384615384615385
2623811,5,B000GY75JE,"""Farscape"" is a legend already, so I won't write about the series because... there's simply no room and no point about it.  It's an excellent show, and if you're reading this note because you're contemplating the purchase of the whole series, by all means, buy it.  Nobody regrets buying ""Farscape"".

However, let a little caveat be known.

First, these shows come from the A&E run of the series, not from the Sci-Fi (now Sy-Fy) channel.  They're not in wide-screen because they were filmed for televisions before the arrival of the wider ratio screens, so don't expect anything other than the squarish, traditional format.  Be aware that the image quality (when viewed in a computer monitor) may not be the best, or offer the sharpest resolution.  Then, there's the absence of any type of captions or subtitles or language tracks.  Finally, there are spots in some episodes in which the sound seems to have problems (like a subtle drop in volume).  These are very small objections, and with regards to the sound, something found probably three or four times in all the DVDs (and there are about five or six per season), so, in the larger scheme of things, should not deter anyone from purchasing this set.

There are good things in the purchase of this set.  First and foremost, the episodes seem to be in their best length (for instance, episode ""Human Reactions"" from season 1 includes a scene that apparently was cut off when broadcast in the US, when Ben wakes up and Aeryn is planning the strategy for the day).  Then, the discs include bonus commentary tracks (my favorites are those with Claudia Black and Ben Browder, or Claudia Black alone), and also deleted scenes for a number of episodes.  Finally, in addition to the four seasons, there's a set of two discs with further interviews, documentaries and behind-the-scenes shorts about the series...  Remember, not just one DVD, but two, and that includes a documentary titled ""Farscape Undressed.""

Regarding the show, all I can say is that I saw a couple of episodes of ""Farscape"" back in the nineties, and even caught the season four finale (by accident), and could not believe my eyes...  As a television series, this one goes beyond science fiction and it's better described as a kind of ensamble piece set somewhere in the universe.  The energy, ingenuity and creativity evident in every single episode are intellectually stimulating and refreshing, and show how the producers actually believe that their audience is intelligent and observant.  The best thing about it is that it's aged well.  Nowhere could anyone see anything anachronic (however cute, like the huge computer monitors in ""The X-Files""), and that keeps ""Farscape"" fresh for all viewers, experienced and novices alike.  Besides, where else can one find the irreverent, yet subtle humor that abounds in all the dialogues and situations in ""Farscape""?

Go ahead, buy this collection now.  However, if you really want to have close-captioning and different language tracks (I won't argue about the sound or the image quality, as they may occur because of my own hardware), wait and invest in a more expensive set, probably the famous ""Starburst"" collection.  Otherwise, this set will give you a lot of ""Farscape"" bang for your buck.",1315267200,2,3261,4.9650092081031305

From the very first episode onward, it's pretty obvious that ""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is no ordinary sci-fi series -- the characters are outlaws, the ship is alive, and distant galaxies are full of Muppets. Fortunately, it's not just unusual but brilliant -- full of irreverent humor, strange alien species, heart-pounding action and eerie sci-fi.

Astronaut John Crichton is planning to slingshot his experimental craft, Farscape One, as a one-small-step into interstellar exploration. Instead, he gets thrown through a wormhole, and ends up drifting in a firefight between a vast living prison ship called Moya and the hypermilitaristic Peacekeepers. Obviously, he wants to go home, but isn't sure how.

So he begins a journey with a gang of escaped criminals -- the priestess Zhaan, the bombastic warrior D'Argo, deposed dominar Rygel, and the prickly, surly ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun. They gain a few new members of their crew (including Moya's weaponized baby and the seductive, rebellious Chiana), but also lose some valued friends and allies along the way.

As the series unfolds, the Moya crew encounter countless alien planets, where they deal with bizarre problems, individuals (mad scientists, vengeful Peacekeepers, and Ancients), and alien life-forms (shapeshifting space bugs!). And they must constantly dodge the Peacekeeper Forces, and later the cruel Scarrans -- including the Sebacean/Scarran Scorpius. The Scarrans want the wormhole secrets locked inside Crichton's head, and ancient beings are even more determined to keep his knowledge secret....

""Farscape: The Complete Series"" smashes apart the space opera mold, and puts it back together in its own style -- flying Muppets, an alien pilot grafted into Moya, squeaking insectile robots, Leviathans, and blue-skinned telepathic plant people. Yeah, it DOES sound cheesy -- but instead the Farscapeverse just ends up feeling colorful, diverse and sometimes horrifically dark. And fortunately, its promise is fulfilled by brilliant writing.

The series has lots of overarcing storylines twined with clever, intricate one-off episodes and solid personal subplots (mostly involving romance and revenge -- though thankfully it rarely gets soapy). And the dialogue is beyond awesome -- it's crammed with snappy dialogue, pop culture references (""How Batman was that!""), and alien slang words (""frelling"" and ""mivonks"" among others). Every episode has loads of clever, irreverent and wonderfully quotable lines (""I'm not fast enough, I am not alien enough, and you know what, there are people in the universe who don't like me!"").

And the cast is simply brilliant, especially since their characters evolve gradually through the series, revealing tragedies and hopes in the process. Ben Browder is great as the ""alien"" one, a seemingly ditzy astronaut with plenty of brains and sweet kookiness; Claudia Black's Aeryn makes a great love interest for him, as a hardnosed, disdainful ubersoldier who changes into a strong, passionate woman. Virginia Hey, Gigi Edgley, and Anthony Simcoe all give stellar performances as well -- and while Rygel and Pilot are technically played by Muppets, they are gloriously three-dimensional and expressive.

One thing to note: ""Farscape: The Complete Series"" ends on a massive cliffhanger because the Sci Fi Channel unexpectedly cancelled it, and ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" (the conclusive ending) apparently won't be included, since the rights belong to two different companies.

Apparently this will have a lot of extras, which are probably just the ones from the original release. But it also apparently will have a new retrospective called ""Farscape: A Look Back.""

""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is a cult sci-fi series that deserves to be watched again and again, especially with the new extras. Too bad the final miniseries isn't here.",1311379200,,4060,5.440381558028617
2623831,5,B000GY75JE,"I remember sitting down to watch the first episode of this series. I was living in England then and it was on at ""teatime"" 6pm on BBC 2 so I told my husband dinner would be late that night and fed the then,very young children early. It was amazing and I was hooked from episode one and I never looked back. When it was cancelled I was so sad that we were left hanging and the husband, now also a devoted fan was also gutted. By then we were living in America and when we heard rumblings of a mini series to finish off a story we were very happy and the concluding peacekeeper wars were bitter sweet but very satisfying in concluding the storyline.

2623833,5,B000GY75JE,"When this series was canceled it enforced my opinion on how far the TV producers have lost touch with the viewer base. This was a wonderfully done series. the special effects was awsume, the acting was beyond reproach. The producers even saw fit to cancel the series on a cliff hanger (REALLY)??? I think that many loved shows that many watched were canceled before their time. I think that if there was any justice for the creators / writers / actors, the TV producers would get to see all the raised fists of all the mad fans they repetedly disapoint

2623836,4,B000GY75JE,"As a fan of Claudia Black, I was excited to learn that she was a key member on Farscape. I never saw this show while it was on the air, but as it was listed in many Top 10 lists for best Sci-Fi shows, I decided it was time to check it out.

John Crichton goes into space to create an experiment, only to be sucked through a wormhole and deposited elsewhere in the galaxy. What he finds there is a living prison ship transporting prisoners who may not be guilty, captured by Peacekeepers who may not be concerned with peace. Here is where his adventure begins. As he attempts to find his way home, he meets many aliens and makes a handful of powerful enemies who will stop at nothing to catch him and extricate the knowledge that he manages to acquire along the way.

I have always loved stories about the development of a hard-hearted character who becomes more human (think Seven of Nine from Star Trek, Cara from Sword of Truth, Grianne Ohmsford from the Shannara series, etc) so I was all too happy to watch the journey of Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun as she is forced to reconsider the solider's life she has always known when she gets stuck with Crichton and the prisoners.

The show has a lot of characters, some better than others. Pilot, who has a symbiotic relationship with the living ship, Moya, has one of the more interesting, if less often touched upon back stories. If there was one thing I could have wished for on the show, it would be more about him. (Which is difficult since he cannot really go anywhere since he is actually attached to the ship itself.) Rygel and Chiana were two of my least favorite characters. They barely developed over the course of the show and were mostly just annoying and selfish (Rygel was a former dictator who was deposed by his cousin and only cares about money and material objects while Chiana is an escaped Nubari that had the potential for an interesting storyline with the her brother is leading but instead spends her time obsessing over sex).

I'm not sure that I would list this as my favorite sci-fi show but I certainly did enjoy it and wished for the series to go on for longer.",1308614400,,2132,4.445012787723785
2623837,1,B000GY75JE,"the first season was entertaining. but as it grew close to the end of that season what started showing was that ben browder was putting himself in a selfish position of stealing the show, and NOT in a good way.

it became evident that this show was ALL about ben browder. he is in every aspect. his wise-ass remarks get very annoying after awhile. his wise-ass commentaries also become annoying. he seems to go from talking as a normal person would be to within a word jump to yelling. there is no in-between. normal or yell.

the settings are fine, the film quality is fine BUT the sound of some of the actors, especially some of the woman such as gigi edgely is most difficult to hear. it appears that many have no ability to voice-project very well, nor have they any great ability to enunciate (sp). i would venture a guess that 30% what comes out of her mouth is undecipherable or intelligible. VERY VERY annoying.

then the 'babes'; most are well within the 'tits n ass' mode. claudia black and virginia (?) seem to be the only ones who wear clothes without showing large amounts of flesh. of course this will play well to the juvenile factor.

the other annoying aspect is the constant 'swearing', albeit in words not considered as swearing in the english language...the use words ad frell...'frell you', what the 'frell' are you doing. this gets around the censors but the intent comes right across.

and some stuff just makes litle sense, is there some Macy's store out in space? every episode has then decked out in new clothes.

the creativity is iffy, space creatures that look like preying mantis, rats, hyenas, bugs galore, all are earth-centric. there is a lot that has been apparently ripped off from other movies; bar scenes, creatures, scenerios.

by mid-way into the third season this just gets painful to watch...primarily from the antics of Browsder. of all the annoyances he is by far the winner.",1308614400,8,1918,4.690476190476191
2623838,4,B000GY75JE,"This show is very original and clever. I got it for a steal price as a Gold Box deal, which was great. It's fun and goofy while still having a serious side. I love watching it, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for something totally out there and different. When I am, this is the perfect fix. Now for why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the characters are flat out annoying at times, particularly D'Argo and Zhaan. They aren't always annoying though, and the show is still fun regardless. If you really like sci-fi/fantasy and are into stuff that is pretty out there, you'll probably like this. It's somewhat of an acquired taste for most, and people who don't like sci-fi/fantasy will likely think it's stupid. But it is a great show, and if you like sci-fi/fantasy, you should give it a chance.

One important point about this set though. Like Firefly, you have to watch the movie (for Firefly it's Serenity, and for Farscape it's Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars) for conclusion, but it does not come in the set. I wish it did, but it doesn't. So be prepared to buy the movie separately too if you are buying this set as they need each other to be complete.",1308441600,2,1165,4.4186046511627906

2623840,5,B000GY75JE,One of my wifes favorite scifi shows ever. Finally came down to an affordable price for us to purchase. We both loved the action and humor of this show.,1307836800,,152,4.275862068965517
2623871,5,B000GY75JE,"I'm what you could call a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of sci-fi fan. I tend to like my science fiction on the more human-oriented and realistic side, without a lot of cheesy ""Lost In Space""-style fake goofy aliens and over-reliance on the easy out of deus ex machina to overcome bad scriptwriting. To me, good sci-fi can't just be about spaceships and aliens, it must also be able to stand on its own as quality television or cinema. In other words, a movie or television program doesn't get an automatic free pass from me for bad scriptwriting, bad acting, and lack of character development just because it's got cool-looking spaceships and other special effects. (I made a rare exception for ""Avatar"" simply because its visuals were so stunningly far ahead of its time.) Precious few science fiction television series have met my standards, the remake of ""Battlestar Galactica"" and the brilliant and criminally short-lived ""Firefly"" being prime exceptions.

So, when an acquaintance recommended ""Farscape"" to me a few months back, I went and researched it on the internet. I was not impressed by what I read. This series, at a cursory glance, had all the elements of cheap sci-fi - gaudy aliens, strained and dubious overall plotline (""Astronaut falls into wormhole and ends up with a bunch of wacky aliens. Hilarity ensues!""), and cheesy-looking aliens that at first glance looked like they were straight out of a bad comic book. Oh, and Muppets. Muppets? Really? The whole thing looked like typical Sy-Fy badly-produced nonsense (I'm a firm believer that Sy-Fy has done far more harm than good to the reputation of science fiction, and that they should be ashamed of themselves for it). However, since I have streaming Netflix, I figured I'd give ""Farscape"" a try. And was I ever pleasantly surprised! I've been addicted from the start.

The series starts off a little unevenly, as many series do. That's not surprising, since every show has to establish its identity, and the actors need time to develop their characters and the way they relate to each other. This is especially true of shows with ensemble casts, where the pilot episodes try to cram in a lot of introductory material into a short time. Knowing this, I was forgiving of the first few episodes' clunkiness. Within a few episodes, though, ""Farscape"" hit its stride and never looked back.

""Farscape"" has many of the elements I detest in cheesy sci-fi, the wacky aliens and reliance on deus ex machina being prime examples, but in this case, it simply does not matter. This show is so imaginative, so well-plotted and so much fun that the elements that normally would make me raise my judgmental skeptical eyebrow actually contribute to the overall enjoyment of the series. There is an overarching storyline that unfolds over the course of the series, but each episode also contains its own individual story. I don't know what the producers and scriptwriters were smoking when they conceived the individual episodes, but they're all fun and in many cases howlingly funny - as in Season 3's 16th episode, ""Revenging Angel"". That episode is sheer brilliance in its blending of serious themes with hysterically funny animation paying tribute to Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner. You just don't expect the kind of episodes that ""Farscape"" so consistently delivers.

Now to the Muppets. There are several used throughout the course of the series, but there are two regulars - the huge tentacled Pilot, who is symbiotically fused with the living spaceship Moya, and Rygel, a former ""Dominar"" over hundreds of billions in another star system. Rygel is the more facially expressive of the two, and gets the better lines, but Pilot is the one who (to me) seems like more of a real living being. I'm not fond of Rygel; his role in the series is to be the equivalent of Dr. Zachary Smith in the old ""Lost In Space"" series. In other words, he's vainglorious, egotistical and selfish, often intended to be comic relief. Like Dr. Smith, Rygel is filled with greed and delusions of grandeur, a petty being who often double-crosses the crew when he thinks it's to his benefit to do so. However, like Smith, in the long run he's reluctantly on the rest of the crew's side because, after all, they're all in it together. When I was a child I never liked the Doctor Smith character, and thought he was more of an annoying distraction than anything else. I feel the same way about Rygel. Pilot, on the other hand, is a very sympathetic and likable character, and also represents a major achievement for Jim Henson's Creature Workshop.

The main bad guy, Scorpius, is an all-time great sci-fi villain. Brilliantly brought to life by Wayne Pygram, this complex character is both frighteningly sinister and funny in the extreme. The scriptwriters take special care to poke mocking fun at Scorpius - metaphorically ""pantsing"" him at will throughout the series - but even so, you never forget who and what he is.

The rest of the regular cast all have their own unique personalities that add megatons of flavor to the show. The best shows have ensemble casts with no one real overpowering star, and the cast here demonstrates that admirably. My one worry was that the character who the show nominally revolves around, American astronaut John Crichton, was at first very stiffly and badly portrayed by actor Ben Browder in the first two or three episodes. At first he was a very bland, stiff and boring human amongst a crew of far more interesting and exotic aliens. However, Browder soon found his character's voice, and he ended up being just as entertaining as Zhaan, D'Argo, Chiana and the rest.

As far as the physical box set itself is concerned, it has its pluses and minuses. The plus is that the collection is smaller in size than I expected, due to the fact that the individual regular-sized DVD cases that make up the set each hold six discs (with the exception of the ""extras"" disc, which hold just two discs). Imagine five regular DVD cases on your shelf, and that's how big the set is. This is contrast to my huge ""Battlestar Galactica"" box set, where individual DVDs are stored in their own slimline plastic DVD cases. I prefer the ""Farscape"" set's smaller form factor. The minus is that while the outer box is attractive, it is made of almost paper-thin cardboard and thus is susceptible to damage over time. ""Battlestar Galactica"" did their outer box right - it is thick and sturdy.

In summary, science fiction doesn't get much more entertaining than this. If you like quality sci-fi that puts a big ol' grin on your face, you should definitely get this set.

I've never really forgiven SyFy for not allowing a fifth and final season, so though I relented to watch BSG, I pretty much boycott that channel. What was special about ""Farscape?"" Just about everything. It looked different than just about every scifi series that came before it, it had an amazing story arc that culminated in season three, which contains some of the best episodic storytelling ever shown on television, it had some of the most memorable characters ever created, particularly in John Crichton and Aeryn Sun...I could go on. The show made me laugh, made me cry, broke my heart, made me crazy with its cliffhanger season endings, made me clap, made me talk to the television...I agree with other reviewers who mention that season one was slow and erratic, but trust me, when ""Farscape"" hooks you, you will be hooked for life. I try to watch the whole series every summer, once reruns start. It's like hooking up with old friends. Glad to see the whole series available in one package.

We have a Panasonic TC-P65S2 HDTV setup with the P65S2 and the Pansonic 3D BD player. There was no subtitles available and the CC did not show. I subsequently tried several of my DVD and BD players, guess what, no CC. When I played the Farscape DVD on my computer there it was, CC was displayed in its glory. Apparently CC does not work on the HDTV equipment. I posted this to let people who want CC or subtitles know about the experience I had. I still love Farscape but watching on Computer for CC is a pain.

UPDATE:  There is CC on this box set.

2623879,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape Complete Series

I had watched Farscape since the first episode on Sci-Fi in 1999. I watched every episode for its 4 seasons and bought the Peacekeeper Wars conclusion. This boxed set is the complete series, and the special effects/costumes/sets are just as I remembered it back in the day. The only quirk is that seasons 1-3 are still in 4:3 format, and I kind of wish they'd make all 4 seasons presented in 16:9 or widescreen.

Season 1 starts off like a cheap Sci-Fi presentation but they're trying to get the story started really quickly. The characters aren't as developed initially but the greatest aspect of Farscape is how well the writers nit together the story. When I first watched it on TV, the stories didn't all quite mesh together as it is broadcast on a weekly basis so you sometimes forget what happened a year ago. But the characters make subtle hints at previous actions and the repercussions of these actions in future episodes. John Crichton's costumes change after Season 1, but the aliens always have extravagant and colorful ensembles.

For those that watched Stargate SG-1 Season 10, you'll recognize a few of the main Farscape characters namely Ben Browder and Claudia Black whom are rather underrated in my opinion. As a fan of Farscape, watching all 4 seasons on DVD brings back a lot of fond memories as the series had excellent writing, good dialogue, and cool special effects.

THE CONTAINER--

Of course, for me, this part of owning the 'Series' is wonderful because all 4 SEASONS are neatly stored in ONE BOX; thus, the 'scattering' of DVDs, (and their respective containers-- five of them), is kept to a minimum.

Indeed, my husband loves this Series so much, he's quite happy to tuck the DVDs in their proper place when finished watching... without me having to tell him to do so. I never thought I'd see the day, *lol*.

Alas, the downside is that the box, itself, is made out of paper not plastic. So you have the usual short-shelf life of most tuck boxes. They really should have put this in either a much sturdier paper box, or used an even better plastic container that would last forever.
__________________________________________________________________

WHAT YOU GET--

There are a total of 88-episodes on 24 discs divided into four containers. Also included is a 'fifth container' of 'Special Features', (2 discs)... giving a total of 68-hours-worth of Farscape bliss.

It runs anywhere from around $4-used to $10-new here at Amazon.

It's kind of an aggravation that the 'PEACEKEEPER WARS' wasn't included in what the marketers called, 'THE COMPLETE SERIES' as such an obvious oversight, (or cleaver marketing?), renders the word 'Complete' utterly invalid. And totally messes up my ONE BOX storage mania, *lol*.

Alas, whatcha gonna do? That's the way it was packaged.

So... if you want to give 'Farscape: The Complete Series' as a GIFT, it's not really complete without giving the ending to the Series: 'Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars' as well, (2 discs, 3-hours, including a 30-minute 'Making Of' documentary).

2623918,5,B000GY75JE,"One of the best sci-fi series I have ever seen.  Amazing and memorable characters, outside the box even for scifi plot lines, great story progression...",1301529600,,152,5.08
2623919,5,B000GY75JE,"This is a great buy for fans of the series. I bought this set over a year ago and have since watched the set about 5 times through. Fans will be happy with the extras: deleted scenes, commentary from both the actors and the writers, ""the making of Farscape"", and the set even includes two discs dedicated to just the extras. Special features such as these can be found on almost every disc and true Farscape fans will definitely enjoy them. If you are a fan of the show who hates watching in syndication and would like to catch up or even a fan who has seen all of the episodes but just wants to watch them again and again, this is for you. One thing I wish there was more of was actors commentary, but even so the extras make it all worth while.",1301011200,,746,4.151724137931034

This great psy-fi show goes where none others do.  It is exciting, it is cerebral, makes you think, makes you empathize with the plight of weirdos, getting pretty ""out there"" at times towards the end.  I cannot say enough good stuff about this series.",1300924800,,519,4.988372093023256

I am just prolonging the inevitable by waiting to watch the final episodes.  Making it even sadder is the fact that the ""final"" season was ended expecting a 5th season that never happened.  That being said, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I wish I could have purchased on Blu-Ray but the quality is satisfactory on regular DVD upconverted on a Blu-Ray machine.  If you are a sci-fi fan and are looking for something different you must give Farscape a chance.",1300924800,,623,4.526785714285714

It is really different than what you normally see in sifi. Instead of just throwing some makeup on people they use puppets, and can explore some radical ideas like living ships as a mainstay of the show. Maybe it is a little 5th element meets startrek or something but hard to describe but super cleaver.",1300752000,,475,4.654761904761905

Although it was only 4 seasons long, the story will stick with you for the rest of your life. The characters are some of the most well written and the actors are top notch. Although the acting in the first few episodes in season 1 are a little hokey, you can tell by mid-season, they all started to feel more comfortable with their characters and their co-stars. By the end of the series, you feel like you are and have always been a part of their lives. Be sure to also get the Peacekeeper Wars, the finally to the series.

I would highly reccommend this box set and series to anyone who loves adventure, action, and romance. The story line behind this show is just amazing! It is positively THE BEST SHOW EVER CREATED IN HISTORY!!!!!",1298937600,,478,4.443181818181818
2623957,5,B000GY75JE,"I started watching this show on Netflix streaming.  It was too good.  I sneakily bought this set plus the mini series ""movie"".  Then, I told my husband and we watched it every night after he came home from work, which was 1:40am.  He needs mellow down time so we like to watch good shows that will last awhile.  So far this is my absolute favorite and it was made the best of all by the makers being smart and ending the whole show with The Peacemaker Wars.  The perfect ending.
  When you buy this and watch it from beginning it is like sitting down with the best book.  And, in a way I can compare it to Harry Potter in that when one book ends there is another.  In this case there are in essence 4 and an ending.  It is funny, smart, not perfect yet the photography and the 'muppets' are incredible.  There's also drama and a lot of ecxitement and adventure.  Best of all for we women who love a great love story, there is that as well.  Their imagination is absolutely incredible.
  If you are like me in that I love art and how things are done as well as a great story, the commentaries and other such bonus's are a lot of fun.  I heard repeats of what my husband would ask, asked by the actors and laughed about.  They show how they do some things and for those of you who love to hear about the stars, you learn about them on a personal level.  I find it interesting because of the contrast between the stars and who they played.  There are some really great actors on that show.
  So, yes, I highly recomend this set.  If my husband says, ""Hey, we can watch that again next year"", which he did, that's a confirmation.  He doesn't do that!
  Buy this and the Peace Keeper Wars and you'll be set for a lot of fun nights or days.  Oh, and the best bonus parts are on the DVD's with the episodes though you get an extra one in a seperate case.  Hmm...I should go watch that now.  Until now, I had forgotten about it.  There is just so much that you get, I still have plenty to watch and enjoy.  And next year, we'll watch it again.",1298937600,,2035,4.127877237851663

I never got a chance to watch it all the way through and I always caught random episodes but I knew the show was of great quality due to those episodes.  So when I saw it go on sale here at Amazon for 50 on a daily deal I snagged it fast.  The complete series for 50.  5 whole seasons when an individual season is generally at least 15 to 20 bucks by itself.  Needless to say I am enjoying the show from start to finish.  My only complaint is...no subtitles.  I love my subtitles and it's very frustrating to not have them in this dvd but unfortunately that's not uncommon for TV to DVD.  Anyway, highly recommend.  Thanks A&E for snagging the rights and selling cheap.",1296864000,,750,4.3
2623987,4,B000GY75JE,"I'm a bit embarrassed that like this series as much as I do.  I know the die-hard fans don't like hearing this, but Farscape is rarely more than the sum of its parts... yet it has such lovely parts.  It's basically a space opera that flouts all the laws of science (be it physics, biology, or chemistry) and shows us stories we've seen before.  What makes it worth watching, then?  For starters, the costumes, makeup, and puppetry are beautiful, which is to be expected from anything with the Henson name attached to it.  The acting is a cut above most space operas (with great chemistry to boot) probably because insanely good Australian actors cost the same as mediocre American actors.  Virginia Hey and Wayne Pygram are especially good in this regard.  (Dear God, is Wayne Pygram ever good. Rabid fans are quite right in claiming that Scorpius is one of the best sci-fi villains ever.)  The stories are mostly formulaic, but the characterizations are original enough to surprise even a savvy and/or jaded viewer (D'Argo's disappointing reunion with his son and Scorpius' origin story are notable examples.)  Like a lot of post-Babylon 5 sci-fi series, Farscape carefully cultivates a story arc that takes root after a first season full of mostly unremarkable episodic stories.  It's not until the end of the second season that one realizes that the writers had a plan from the get-go.  The advantage of watching the series on DVD is that everything unfolds much faster than it did when it aired as a weekly series, and it's easy to backtrack for clues you missed on the first viewing.

If Farscape were just a pretty but predictable space opera with a tighter than normal arc, that would be enough, but it's also funny as hell.  I wasn't really wowed by Ben Browder as a dramatic lead, but he's great as a comic actor.  In fact, the best Farscape episodes are the ones that forsake drama for sheer lunacy (Crackers Don't Matter, Scratch 'n' Sniff) or gross bodily functions (Coup by Clam).  Bad puns also figure largely in the Farscape universe, and the general insanity is quite fitting in a series where drinking urine and indulging in erotic asphyxiation crop up more often than ""Tea-Earl-Grey-Hot"" and pious sermons on non-intervention in primitive cultures.

So why should you buy this DVD set instead of just watching everything on Netflix?  The extras, of course.  The audio commentary is consistently entertaining, thanks mostly to Ben Browder, and the actor interviews reveal a cast that put a lot of thought into what could easily have been merely stock characters.  Virginia Hey's explanation of her abrupt departure due to health problems is especially interesting, as is the surprisingly entertaining commentary for the undisputed *worst* episode of the series.  It's all well worth the purchase price.  And if you're willing to drop 70-odd bucks on the complete series, I'd also recommend spending just a bit more on the capstone miniseries The Peacekeeper Wars.  It neatly ties up all the loose ends left by the series' abrupt cancellation after the fourth season, and it's easy to see where it might have been expanded into a fifth season.",1296604800,2,3159,4.898496240601504
2623988,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape: The Complete Series is a ""must own"" series.  The first season is not as strong as the 2nd-4th.  So be patient.  The payoff if worth it.  Compared to other genre series (Lost, BSG), this focuses on a tighter cast with a tighter story.  It is space opera at its finest.  It is smart, exciting, funny, and sexy.  For those of us who grew up on Star Wars and the Muppets, but are now adults, this is the next logical step.  The only drawback about this collection is that it does not include the finale mini-series.",1296345600,,521,4.354166666666667

2623990,5,B000GY75JE,This is without a doubt one of the best tv series of all time. It is a shame that its life was dependent on reality tv drone ratings and the stunted vision of SyFy bureaucrats.

2624027,3,B000GY75JE,"I'll be reviewing the shows and not the DVD box set.  I'm not a person who cares about extras, but I do care about the quality of the show I'm purchasing.  When there are deals I'll purchase at low prices and try things out.  Gold deal was out on this so i purchased for $40.

There are shows/movies that you could pull the characters out and drop them into any genre.  They're quality and complex characters that you care for.  The writing is something that you don't care if it's sci fi, fantasy, or just a regular old law firm, you are genuinely interested in the plot.  It's realistic in interactions and very easy to suspend disbelief although the need to suspend happens very infrequently.

Then there are shows where the ""super powers"" are the story.  It's about the science or the fact that someone can shoot fireballs out their nose or tap dance out of trouble at will.  Belief needs to be suspended constantly because the world magically falls into place and people interact based on a script and not because that's who the character is.

Farscape falls into the second category except I'm not sure there's any actual science involved.  Aliens are aliens because they all talk like Capt Kirk in a choppy slow manner.  Person to Person interaction is extremely unrealistic with sudden bursts of rage over minor issues and calm reasonableness when a normal person would say ""hey, this is BS"".  I was left, with a lot of the plots, stating ""what?  why would they even go there/do that/think that???""  They're aliens but it feels more like bad writing than the behavior is taking place due to being aliens.

I'm in season one and currently there's no crew member I care for.  The aliens mock Criton's (human character)intelligence and yet sub-consciously act like he's the leader.  It's also clear that he's far more able to adapting than they are despite the mocking.  Ironically he comes across as someone completely NOT intelligent enough to problem solve complex issues and perfectly fits their stereo type except he some how manages to fix xyz converter/issue every time.  he's the glue.

There's a slight love tension... well... the fact that there is jealousy and a kiss (so far) INDICATES there's supposed to be some kind of tension.  Except if the show didn't show you, you'd NEVER guess that it was supposed to exist.  Honestly I would have thought two other characters were a much better fit.

If you've ever played D&D you have the start of a campaign.  You're sitting across from each other and you know you're all supposed to group up so you can get on with the questing.  The introduction phase tends to be... weak.  As a player you know what you're going to do and most players will therefore go ""hi.  I'm prince blah blah from yadda yadda.  I wield a sword and like chickens.  We should group up for the night to eat chickens where we'll then fight a monster and bond and then find out we're all going the same direction so might as well stick together even though we would have no matter what""  This is very much what farscape feels like for the entire first season so far and I'm close to the last discs.

Firefly had humor and charm
Star Trek attempted deep conversations and provided a mirror of sorts from our society and the future.
Battlestar Galactica (new) provided quality effects with Drama for those who enjoy it.
Dr Who... bad effects and yet I'm always fascinated by the doctors and the companions and the silly adventures they go on.  This one is simply an acquired taste and likely fits a number of critiques I give farscape, except I really enjoy the Dr... likely due to character developing and characters I actually like (ignoring Donna who others found awesome but I hated so very very much because she yelled)

Farscape:  I, personally, get out of it a show to kill time.  I enjoy the look of the ship.  It's a living ship and I find the concept interesting although the story lines around it are swiss cheesy.  There are a few characters that if they'd become 3D instead of a simple 2D they would have been extremely interesting.  I think the show, so far, is really about the untapped potential.  Those who enjoy the show likely fill in those blanks and holes and create the rich environment themselves.  I feel like the writers squander MANY opportunities to do this themselves.

My wife's main complaint is there there isn't a single character she cares about.

Currently there's a crazy blue girl on the ship and I'm hoping she adds some spice and sticks around, but we'll see.

It's a Jim Hensen production and as such it has muppets.  I have no issues and I think they did a pretty good job in that aspect.  Others may feel that the special effects are weak.

In summary:

This isn't a show I'd recommend, but it's fun to mock and a show to kill time on.  I'll likely update after I'm into season 2 to see if anything changes.  if it doesn't I'm very unlikely to continue into season 3.

***EDIT 3.09.11***

So, I wrapped up the remaining box set.

My critique about character inconsistencies remain.  Characters continued to act because ""the writer says so"" instead of because that's who they are.  I know there are fans out there, but I can't get over this deficiency.  I think it dead lesson somewhat over the seasons but still popped up from time to time.

The universe is pretty darn cool and I still maintain that people who like this see the potential of what it could be and likely gloss over character.  I have a hard time understanding that myself, but that's me.  I like strong character development.

Season two, I thought, was much like season 1.  That said the show became more polished in season three.  I believe it was the musical score that helped emit emotion and excitement because the acting and character development stayed the same.  Also, they stopped yelling so much.  I'm not a big fan of yelling as a form of communication and it's something I notice.  My wife grew up in an environment where yelling was common for all communication and didn't notice it.  I did, and it's greatly reduced after season 2.

When the end happened, if it had happened in season 1 or 2 I would have been cheering my heart out.  As it was I still clapped and said ""YES!!!"" but felt a little guilty (it ended on a less than positive note that was obviously meant to be a cliff hanger).  I take this as a sign that despite it's flaws the show had grown on me.  There were even parts where I was concerned about the characters.  Then there were other parts where clearly the writers were on acid and frankly I enjoyed those episodes as something completely different.  Cat girl looks hot in medieval outfits and Zen Master girl makes a weird man.

Apart from the universe that was created, which I felt had some imagination to it, I enjoyed the fact the story progressed so they weren't always ""lost in spaaaaaaace"".  Some of the progression was whacky, but it was progression.

Overall I wouldn't bump my star rating from the three stars, but I definitely place it strongly at three now instead of the 2.5 I might have gone for season one.  Tastes are all finicky.  Ultimately if you want a colorful galaxy that's interesting and can ignore the inability of the writers to keep a character in character I think you'll find this more entertaining than I did.  If strong believable characters are important for you and you prefer them to be consistent, this might drive you batty like it did me.  Luckily I bought on sale and I'm okay with the $ for show amount.  I may even return to the show some day to see if my perception of it has changed.",1295481600,9,7597,4.55580192165558

I would recommend this set to any fan of the series, or a fan a science fiction. So ""starburst"" away and have fun.",1294790400,,592,3.9008264462809916

2624092,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape is seven years gone now, but still easily my favorite show.  Following modern day astronaut John Crichton as he's thrust into an entirely alien world, and desperately tries to find a way home is great TV.  Yes, the show was made by Henson Studios -- but don't let the name throw you off.  Sure, there are some animatronic creatures.  But these aren't your parents' muppets.  They are fully integrated characters that would just as soon kill you as listen to you.  All of the characters in Farscape are wonderfully developed -- including the crew's LIVING spacecraft (how's that for different?).  Farscape has something for everyone: action, drama, romance and comedy.  Plenty of comedy.

The entire series is presented here (though it was sadly cancelled a year short of it's projected finale) in great form, with ample extras and commentaries.  Just order it already-- it's easily worth twice what they're asking.  And grab the Peacekeeper Wars while you're at it.  It's the mini-series that came out a year later and tied up the loose ends.",1294358400,,1051,4.942857142857143
2624093,5,B000GY75JE,"SHORT OVERVIEW:
FarScape is about a misfit group of (mostly) former prisoners who run away with a (living) spaceship. It's about survival, not about a grand mission of peace or exploration.

In the premiere, Earth astronaut John Crichton gets inadvertently shot through a wormhole to another galaxy, where he promptly has a run-in (quite literally) with the military heavies in that corner of the universe, the Peacekeepers. He ends up on a former Peacekeeper prison ship with some of its escaped prisoners and a reluctant ex-Peacekeeper, Aeryn Sun (only there because she's considered contaminated by alien contact and thus sentenced to death by the Peacekeepers), who becomes John's (also rather reluctant) love interest while staying awesomely badass.

John wants to get back to Earth and tries to figure out wormhole technology to do so, the escaped prisoners and the former prison ship want to go to their respective home planets or at least stay out of the Peacekeepers' clutches, and one or another of the Peacekeeper commanders is deeply committed to capturing John for various reasons throughout the series. John gets beaten up a lot (not just by Aeryn), all of the main characters develop and change over the course of the series, and no plot premise is too crazy to explore in depth or at least get a nod from the writers.

It's got action/adventure - thefts, cons, conflicts, derring-do, daring escapes, and the occasional bit of time travel with consequences - plus drama, comedy, tragedy, and a love story for the ages - in space.

Among other things, FarScape is notable for having (compared to other SF shows) a lot of women fans, possibly because of the significant number of strong female characters who move the plot along and kick ass. It's a TV show that - despite occasional glitches and the constraints imposed by a limited (especially compared to LA- and Vancouver-produced SF shows) budget and an intense shooting schedule - is amazing.

WHAT THE BOX SET DOES AND DOESN'T HAVE:
- The box set does *not* include the post-season 4 miniseries The Peacekeeper Wars, as the rights to the miniseries are owned by a different company than the 4 seasons of the show. So The Peacekeeper Wars - which was created to wrap up some of the storylines of the first 4 seasons after FarScape was abruptly cancelled before its 5th season - will need to be a separate DVD purchase.
- Only season 4 of the show was shot in widescreen, so season 1-3 are fullscreen mode only, sorry.
- I own the starburst edition, not the current A&E boxset release, but have watched both. The A&E version has additional extras/featurettes, though the same number (I believe) of audio commentaries. I'm not a serious audiophile or videotransfer/bitrate expert, but to me the A&E discs looked and sounded very good.
- The A&E boxset includes *closed captions* (accessible from your *TV* menu, not your DVD (player) menu, if your TV has that option) but not subtitles, while the old starburst edition offers *subtitles* (accessible from your DVD menu).

COMPARING FARSCAPE WITH SOME OTHER WELL-KNOWN SF SERIES:
Like Firefly, FarScape has a strong ensemble cast. Who all get to shine at various points.
Like Stargate-1 and Stargate Atlantis, the characters quickly come to care about each other as friends and family. Though in FarScape they also fight and at times have serious, long-running, and recurring issues with each other.
Like Babylon 5, it's got a multi-season plot-arc, and one of the series drivers is the love story between two of the leads. But unlike in B5, FarScape's Crichton and Aeryn actually have chemistry! (Scads of it.)
While Firefly and Battlestar Galactica (2003) didn't have non-humanoid aliens, FarScape is awash in them; actors with prosthetics, puppets/animatronic characters, and a few CGI creations. Still, in most cases the non-humanoid aliens the main characters encounter aren't (just) ""see the fascinating other culture"" plot devices - what the alien characters do tends to be about *survival* of either themselves or their culture - very much in keeping with the theme for the main characters as well.

Some people don't like the idea of a grownup SF show having puppets. But the FarScape puppets - and these are sophisticated animatronic puppets, not simple Muppets or Sesame Street characters - shouldn't be a deciding factor against trying or buying the series. Fairly early in season 1 the actors figured out that treating the puppets like human actors and touching them was a good thing and the interactions with the puppet characters became a lot more natural. Also, the main puppet characters - like *all* the main characters - clearly develop over the course of the series.

Again, *every* main character changes over the course of the series - unlike in say, parts of the Star Trek and Stargate franchises, there is no reset button at the end of an episode. Things that happened in one episode don't magically go away by the beginning of the next one. This can be uncomfortable at times - Crichton's progressive instability isn't just a one-episode gag. Some of the heroes become less heroic, some of the villains become less villainous; by interacting they change each other. Even the (living) ship is a character with its own emotions and motivations. As is the ship's confused child. (Though admittedly these two are less dimensional than the other main characters on the show.)

FarScape is at times quite dark but is also very layered. And the darkness (while still not on BSG's level) is offset by the large amounts of humor, comedy, and caring. In fact, *so much* comedy and humor, some of it is really out there, and not every gag succeeds. But most of them do - enough to stand up to repeated viewing.

One of the fun things: FarScape is full of pop-culture references, both classic and more recent, which are especially funny because only one of the main characters gets them: the one who's making them, John Crichton, the lost astronaut from Earth. So viewers may be tickled by the *many* pop-culture references, but the extra laugh comes from his shipmates either having either no idea what he just referred to, or after a few years of hearing these references, thinking they do but confusing them in entertaining ways.

The whole series - not just the comedy, but the adventures, the drama, the love story, the tragedies and all - do well on rewatching (with the exception of a very few episodes that are better to rewatch with the commentary track instead of the episode audio - hello, Jeremiah Crichton!)

That's another reason to buy the DVD set: the commentary tracks for many of the episodes. A lot of TV series' DVD boxsets include some commentary tracks, and in many of those half the commentaries are... okay. But for FarScape, most of the commentaries are genuinely entertaining - it's not just Ben Browder who clearly loves this show.

Last but not least, much of the series is gorgeously shot (especially considering its relatively small budget) - either with clever set dressing or often by using certain color palettes. Just keep an eye on the different colors and lighting used for various sets and cultures throughout the series, they add another layer/level of tone to the show.

In sum, you might not like FarScape; some SF fans just don't, just like some just don't like Firefly. But - and you'll need to watch a handful of episodes, not just one or two, in order, preferably starting with the premiere (and perhaps answering some email while watching I, ET) to get a proper feel for it - if you do like FarScape, you'll probably *love* it.

Occasionally - like today - Amazon has a special offer of around $50 for the 88-episode boxset. So with that and Syfy and other channels apparently making a hobby out of canceling their current SF series, doesn't FarScape sound worth a try?",1294099200,2,7843,4.886466165413534

2624113,5,B000GY75JE,"From the very first episode, when John Crichton yells at the aliens, ""What is the matter with you people?!"" I was hooked. Farscape is by far the best sci-fi show ever produced. Ben Browder and Claudia Black play off of each other so well. Moya is simply the most beautiful space ship. :o)
If you like sci-fi, and stuff blowing up, and crazy aliens, you will love Farscape.
Oh, and get the movie after you finish the show...!",1294099200,,424,4.448717948717949
2624114,5,B000GY75JE,"It's a grand, operatic in scale, funny and poignant journey. When the show first started, it was an experimental idea done on a shoestring budget. But as the money grows, so does the show, and evolve to comes into its own spectacularly ground breaking self towards the end of season 1.

This is without a doubt the best written and imagined scifi TV production I have ever seen. It's funny, whimsical, imaginative, and superbly drawn out. The characters evolve in accordance with the experiences they go through. The realism of that psychological growth is sometimes painful and frustrating to watch, but always appropriate, intelligent and right. Whether they go darker or lighter the characters are always in line with their motivations. All of the people we encounter in Farscape are fully fledged 3 dimensional beings with complex personalities, morals and behavioral codes.

Good and evil is blurred here, as it is in real life. The good guys do bad thing to survive, and the bad guys are sometimes motivated by the greater good. Farscape succeeds in creating an utterly far-fetched believable Scifi universe populated by animatronics, muppets and aliens that is entirely relatable in its human complexity.

Above all, Farscape is funny and touching and clever, so very very clever. It will make you laugh and cry in equal measure. It'll surprise you, scare you and even make your skin crawl quite effectively at times. And if all this is not enough, Farscape is also a love story of epic proportions.

This show is worth every single penny you spend on it. And the new box set is fantastic. I highly recommend it as a show, that I've no doubt, we'll keep you entertained for years to come. It's certainly been entertaining me since the day it first aired on TV.",1294099200,3,1767,4.8604651162790695

2624118,5,B000GY75JE,"What else can be said ? Henson Productions 88 episode long sci-fi/fantasy epic story called Farscape is one of the most amazing , creative and wonderful things I have ever watched on screen in this genre. Nothing can surpress it in its sheer genius and novelity in television medium ever and since. Seriously Farscape's production values , crazy sets , make up , CGI , costumes , different species and above all writing of individual character story arcs are nothing like I have seen since original Star Wars trigology...Characters of Farscape evolve , change step by step. We do not see that kind of character development anymore on small screen. There is clever and crazy out of box humour , drama , tragedy , action and best romance story written in science fiction in here. The writers take their time to create and establish Uncharted Territories and main characters of Farscape. And let's not forget best antagonist of all known universes : Scorpius played by a chillingly effective Wayne Pygram adds a real edge and wonderful thrill. This is a high quality sci-fi/fantasy production with character stories of Crichton , Aeryn , Dargo , Rygel , Zhaan , Pilot and MOYA leading above anything else

The box sets are impressive , each are full of extras , interviews and commenteries from actors , production staff. They are fun but I skipped most of them to enjoy the whole story. The package is decent. This whole set is an excellent gift for those who want to enjoy series first time or those who would like to have a rerun....My only problem is this DVD package does not involve Farscape : The Peacekeeper Wars , three hour long mini series to wrap up unresolved plot threads at the end of Season 4. Farscape The Peacekeeper Wars is a must-have finale to this great saga ( but it can also be purchased from Amazon again with a fair price ) Don't miss this seies.",1293840000,2,1869,4.646525679758308

This set consists of a big box, with 5 smaller cases within to contain the 4 seasons' worth of dvds, plus one case with extras. Right there, is the only flaw with this set: the extras are pretty much a waste, and should have been replaced with ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" mini-series that was released several years after the series was unceremoniously canceled when everyone had been told there was going to be a 5th season. So as it stands, this is *not* the ""complete series"" as named, since it is missing the vital wrap up; that's the reason it only got 4 stars from me instead of all 5.

Creative and imaginative sci-fi at its best.",1293667200,,386,4.16
2624143,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape is a science fiction that breaks the mold many previous shows had set.  There are many things about this show that are great... from how characters are developed, the acting, script writing / plot-lines.  Believable alien creations using Jim Henson studios for make-up / puppeteers (that's right they don't just CG aliens)  The show ran 4 full seasons (22 episodes each season) before being suddenly canceled by the Sci-Fi channel.

The basis for the show is that a human named John Crichton basically gets zapped down a worm hold and ends up on the other side of our galaxy.  Of course not only can he not figure out how half the stuff works but he needs to survive and get back home.  Throw in a bunch of escaped prisoners, a crazy captain bent on killing Mr. Crichton, a worm hole obsessed maniac, and some wild and crazy adventures ; you pretty much have Farscape right there in a nut shell.  A show that hits the afterburners and really doesn't let up, having very good pacing throughout each episode. Farscape probably will end up being a show you can watch over and over without getting bored once.

** What you will get in this Complete Series package **
- Included will be All 4 seasons that aired originally on TV  (Seasons 1-3 are in 4:3 while season 4 is in 1.78:1).  However do not fret if you have a HDTV; I've tested it on a HDTV w/ Component and HDMI via an upscaling DVD player and a normal old DVD player.  Seasons 1-3 auto adjust to widescreen just fine with almost no visible stretching.  The show looks fantastic!

- Each Season has been completely remastered to look better than when it originally aired on TV; on top of that they redid the audio and music into a 5.1 audio track for maximum enjoyment.  The music tracks were also given a bit of a lift and now sound much stronger and fitting.

- Plenty of bonus features such as bloopers, commentary on various episodes.  Also included is a 5th DVD which contains interviews and additional bonus content such as behind the scenes stuff and how they made the show  (I found it very cool how they actually filmed the show.  You wouldn't even realize that Rygil's voice is dubbed over the original voice and that Cpt. Bialar Crais' actor actually voices Pilot as well!)

** A downside however is something I do agree with a few reviewers on.  The Glossy box the 5 DVD packs come in looks great! However it is simply a carton to hold the boxes. Over the past year it has started to show some wear, and I barely opened or closed it.  Nothing ridiculous but it would of been nice for A&E to give a sturdier cardboard holder like how the Andromeda Slipstream set comes as.  So just be a little careful with the box as it is delicate **

-- Overall if you are a science fiction fan, a Farscape fan who simply never got around to getting the show on DVD, or new to science fiction  this is a show worth picking up.  Farscape was a unique show that shed an interesting light on the galaxy we live in.  Bringing strong plots, fantastic and original characters, unique perspectives, strong character interactions and of course some very funny Earth humor ^_^  A must have for any collection!

++ The current price ($68 12/28/2010)  is a steal if you think about it.  $17 a season!!
++ While Farscape: The Complete Series is technically the complete series aired on TV...  Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars is actually the conclusion to the epic tale.  Due to being suddenly canceled by Sci-fi, the entire 5th season that was planned was compressed down into a 4 hour special called ""The Peacekeeper wars""  and will tie up many lose ends, plus give the show a true ""series ending"" feel rather than that ""season ending"" kind of feel you will get at the end of Season 4.",1293494400,4,3734,4.492581602373887

2624147,5,B000GY75JE,"FARSCAPE is a splendid science-fiction show with awesome special effects, considering that is was filmed in Australia and with a TV budget, I should congratulate the Art Department for the amazing scenarios of the show. The spaceship MOYA is my favorite spaceship of all times because they achieved a organic look for the ship, colors that seemed womb-like, golden and amber, and the cabins with the doors opening at sides, were very cool. The Central Command is very well done; to be truthful there are two Central commands in MOYA, one, the deck were all the characters look at the exterior scene and the central command with the Pilot, that is the real command, because no one except the Pilot has real control of MOYA, and even he sometimes only does was MOYA wants! She is perhaps the most original character of a serie with many outstanding characters. Who does not love Ka D'Argo, the most lovable warrior of all science fiction? And Zhaan, the blue priestess that is really a vegetable-derived life-form? The Sebacean Aeryn Sun, warrior that becomes the love interest of Crichton, the hero of the saga is very fierce and very vulnerable. And the actor Ben Browder here shows why he is a great actor. His character is funny, lovable, easily adaptable (none of the others are) and very able to make any machine functions (only Carter of Stargate SG-1 is better than him!). And not forgetting Chiana, the sexy mate of Ka D'Argo (great actress!),and Rygel the Dominar (the Puppet that many criticizes but is so beliavable that we almost forget that he is only a animatronic!) The package with the complete series is a very good deal, because then we can see all the episodes in order. The only critic, NO SUBTITLES in any language! I am lucky that my TV has closed-captions capabilities because the CC helps a lot (Aeryn Sun speaks with an accent that I think is a little difficult to understand without the closed-captions!).

I would love to watch the entire series with my children in HD, as far a Sci-Fi goes, this is the cream of the crop. We watch Star Trek, Forbidden Planet and BSG as well. But when you find a hidden gem, which is what this series was, you want to share it with as many people as possible.

I should know, I've been watched TV that long.  10 years later it still holds up and I found myself getting caught up in the characters all over again.

The first half of Season 3 and the last 2/3 of Season 4 are equally spectacular and give proof positive to why people like me won't stop talking about the show.  Unfortunately, the last half of Season 3 was a bunch of rehashed story from previous seasons and cobbled together gobbledy gook (with the exception of the season finale).  Likewise the first part of Season 4 also fell flat as it was just predictable and boring.  This is the only reason I did not give the series 5 stars but the rest of the series more than makes up for it.  When Farscape gets it stride back near the middle of Season 4 it takes off running.

If you are reading this I assume you either know about the show or have interest in buying the DVDs so I am not going to recite the plot or how it ends.  Though not up to Blu-Ray quality I still found the show quite clear to watch on my 50"" flat screen.  I have not yet made it through all the extras but the ones I have seen are neat and make the price worth it.  When Farscape shines, it shines like the sun and shows you how great storytelling can be - it just happens to occur on a science fiction TV show.",1287619200,,1704,4.096385542168675

2624178,3,B000GY75JE,"I just finished watching Farscape last night!  The reason that I can only give this series three stars instead of four or five is because the story lines get really played out after awhile.  For example, Moya (their living star ship) is always being hurt and is in pain ALL the time.  Another story line that is too boring is the relationship between Aeryn and John...I mean for crying out loud...get together or don't.

Also John's attitude is also really annoying.  His character is always talking in Earth slang that would never translate to other aliens...and he acts like he is Rambo of the universe...uhhh Sylvester Stallone he is NOT!  His character possesses wormhole technology and both Scarons and Peacekeepers want this information and are pursuing John non stop which leads us to the relationship with John and Scorpious.  Oh Boy...where to begin there.  I can see how at first it was an interesting development but it just turned out to be too long and drawn out like with Aeryn.

I actually liked most of the other characters a lot.  Rygel, Ka' Dargo, Zahn (which was only in the first two seasons), Chiana, and Pilot were all really interesting and stories involving them were some of the best episodes.

There are a few episodes in this series that were really really good!  I think that this series had potential beyond it's four year run but because most of the story lines got caught up in Aeryn and John, John and Scopious, wormhole technology and John that it just really dead ended the series.  I wish they had developed some other story lines with the more interesting characters.

2624204,5,B000GY75JE,"First let me start by saying that this is a review of the Farscape series not of this set, I do not have this set I have the English two discs per box collection. I however did not feel like making 20 reviews so I will rather talk about the series itself. That being said unless you really want the additional extras on the English sets this one seam to be a good idea, for let me tell you that 20 DVD sets take up allot of space on your shelf.

Ok now to the series itself. In case you do not know what it is about Farscape focuses on an astronaut who is on an experimental flight, accidentally he get sucked down a wormhole and ends up in a far distant galaxy. When his ship emerges it has an accident with another ship resulting in the death of the other pilot, it turns out that our astronaut have arrived in the middle of a space battle. He is taken in and eventually befriends a group of aliens, escaped prisoners who are fleeing from the Peacekeepers a vastly powerful army. The pilot the protagonist accidentally kills when he emerges is the brother of one of the Peacekeeper higher officers so now he is hunted to.

Most of this series is about the astronaut John Crichton and the rest of the small but memorable crew of outcasts trying to survive. While things get more epic in later seasons, the first two seasons is really all about trying to stay alive in a very difficult situation. I think this gives Farscape some of the same appeal as Firefly, though Farscape is far more science fiction than Firefly with loads of interestingly designed aliens. However a big portion of the show's appeal to me was that the characters where not flying around in the Starship Enterprise which is more powerful that most other ships, they are just a bunch of refuges without to much resources. I also like the fact that the character's are not the best of friends after two episodes, at first they work together out of need only and is more than willing to betray one another, but as time passes they develop real friendships, this character development is done very well.

Farscape is semi episodic, meaning that usually you have one story per episode, however there is also a overarching storyline, but there is no problem in watching one episode now and then, the overarching plot moves slowly, however both it and the individual episode stories are very well made.

Costumes and alien design for this show is brilliant There is not much computer graphics, there is a little, but for the most part all alien effects are done with make up, prosthetics and puppets. As for the latter I have to say that the puppets on this show is really impressive. There are two puppet characters on the main crew, Pilot who fly the crew's living, sentient ship and Rygel as small, frog like creature that used to rule and empire. Both puppets are extremely expressive and I often found myself forgetting that I was watching dolls and emotionally connected to Pilot and Rygel in the same way as with the character's played by human actors.

The aliens in this show is in many ways your basic soft science fiction assortment. There is the large, angry warrior breed Luxans, a peaceful spiritual breed Delvians, a small deceitful and greedy breed Hynerian, a space faring, huge brained breed, Pilots and even a lizard like evil breed Scarrans. However there is also a huge number of fairly original races and even the rather clich ones are done in an original way. Delvians for example while they have their version of mind meld and grow very old and have spiritual powers are more than Vulcans in a new pancaking. They are blue skinned living plants with a very interesting culture and well balanced set of strengths and weaknesses. The same go for the other races, one can recognize the archetype from other space opera shows, but they are done in a rather creative way. Perhaps the most interesting species of Farscape is Leviathans, living, thinking ships. The majority of the show takes place on such a ship, Moya, a converted prison transport. All in all the selection of races are excellent. There is even a human appearing race Sebacean, which gibes our main protagonist a good chance for a love affair.

This leads me to one of the things that annoyed me about Farscape, the relationship between Crichton and this human appearing alien Aeryn it is so back and forth. While some hidden feelings and reluctance to accept love and so on is great story elements it just never ends with these two, it is back and forth and back and forth the whole F****** series, by the time in the last few episodes they finally make up their minds I was tired of their relationship and did not really care anymore. Lucky this is just one of many plotlines and it is just a minor complaints. I have only two other complaints about this show, one is the intro music, I found it loud and obnoxious. I am sure some would like it, however for me I could not stand it. The actual music in the show itself however is fine so it do not really matter, I can wind over the intro.

My third complaint about this series is the ending. Like so many shows this one was canceled before it got time to unfold it's story. The last season ends on a cliffhanger and there was obviously intended to be more seasons following them. The miniseries Peacekeeper wars do tie up the loose ends and give the series a sort of worthy finish, however it do feel rushed and I regret that we will not get to see how the story of Farscape could have unfolded if the show  had gotten a few more seasons.

All in all I love this series. It is my number one favorite science fiction series and except for a few minor grips it is perfect. If you like space opera you will like this, if you do not like space opera then you might like this anyway just for the character development and how the surviving against all odds drama that fills the majority of the series. There is also good action scenes. I hate one to five rating as it is hard to give a fair rating with it but I give Farscape five stars, if this was a one to ten rating I would give the series 9 out of ten. I really can not say anything else than this is one of the best space opera shows ever created.",1283644800,,6202,4.433333333333334
2624205,5,B000GY75JE,"SciFi-series with great cast and most extravagant characters. The setup (few crew members on a big space ship) seems similar to other series like Andromeda, however acting and stories are much more imaginatve than anything I've seen before. In Farscape you get everything: various things that live in space, cloning, space disease, looney tunes, cunning villains, mean villains, stupid villains, living space ships, worm holes, vampires, an enormous lot of more things and finally Rygel XVI - Dominar of the Hynerian Empire and leader of 600 billion subjects!

The only bad thing about it: Season 5 was ready to go in production, but got stopped almost last minute - a real shame. However, you lucky guys out there, who haven't seen them yet, still have those superb 4 seasons to enjoy ahead of you. Be sure that I'm a bit jealous of that ;-)

Farscape is one of those unique sci-fi shows that had so much potential, but got cancelled too soon...
This DVD set is a must have for Farscape fans.
If you are a sci-fi fan (and you enjoyed Star Trek, BSG, Babylon 5), then you will like Farscape.  If you never had a chance to watch all episodes (in order) when the show was on Sci-Fi (now known as SyFy... who's the moron that came up with that?!) then this is your chance.
Heck, you don't even need to be a fan of sci-fi genre to enjoy Farscape - this show has everything to make it an enjoyable viewing experience.

2624229,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape was a ""prestige"" show for the sci-fi channel, a TV series meant to use feature-quality production values and show off what the Henson workshop could do at the time.  It lost money every year due to being both insanely expensive and located on a niche channel, so its cancellation was probably inevitable... but it's sad that the show was designed to run for 5-6 seasons and it got canned at the end of the 4th.  Like any episodic series, the first season is the weakest and it's sometimes uneven, but at its best (generally, like every other show in the world, when it's building the overall series arc instead of dallying around with stand-alone episodes) it's fantastic.  The level of imagination and visual creativity on display is eye-opening, the frequent bits of subversive humor help to keep things lighter even when the plot is pitch dark, and the leads have ridiculous chemistry.
  Unlike most sci-fi shows, this one gives more than just lip service to a romance, and minimizes the ""captain Kirk effect""--the male and female leads have a troubled, but ultimately successful relationship that builds up throughout the entire series.  It's very much a ""stranger in a strange land"" story, with John Chrichton being put out of his element in a technologically advanced, multi-species star-faring civilization on the other side of the galaxy--which makes for both a lot of fish-out-of-water gags as well as a lot of chances for him to show the technologically superior aliens that actually, these hairless monkeys are pretty clever and resourceful even if they're ignorant of the local customs and tech.
  Each season ends on a cliffhanger, which would make season 4 supremely annoying if the creators hadn't eventually been given a budget to make ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" 3-hour miniseries (SOLD SEPARATELY) to wrap things up and get the story to where they had planned for season 5+.
  I guess the closest analogue I could come up with to describe the tone or feel is ""Joss Whedon Makes Star Wars""--it's sort of a mashup of Firefly/Serenity with The Empire Strikes Back.  It's frequently funny, sometimes silly, sometimes sappy, often gritty and dark, and always filled with aliens, new planets, and Really Weird Things Going On.  Unlike Star Trek, there is almost zero technobabble throughout the entire series--they never bother trying to explain to each other how anything works, any more than we talk to each other about how our cars work.  It just focuses on the characters, their stories and relationships, and the trials and tribulations that they find themselves forced to deal with as they try to evade contact with an overwhelmingly powerful and hostile enemy.
  *Highly* recommended for any fans of space opera who like imaginative shows that blend intensity with a good dose of snark and the occasional bout of silliness.",1277769600,,2846,5.012738853503185
2624230,2,B000GY75JE,"I already know this review is going to get panned by Farscape fans, so I'll make it clear from the outset - I'm not a fan. I was given the series by a friend because I liked Babylon 5 and I really liked Firefly.

Farscape isn't as good or as engaging as either, and I say that keeping in mind B5's over the top ending episodes and Firefly's incomplete story arc.

There are episodes of farscape I enjoyed, but more than a few where I was drumming my fingers waiting for the end of the show. The main thing to realize is that as best I can tell, this series was aimed at teens or young adults, and I'm neither. Farting jokes do not do it for me. Melodrama by the bucket absolutely doesn't do it for me (a problem in B5 as well). Tormented, angsty love affairs just don't ring my bell. It's hard to find an episode that isn't drenched in one of these, and some had all three.

What I'm saying here is, preview the series online before you put money down on this. About the third time Rigel farts helium and talks in a high pitched voice, you'll have decided if this particular blend of humor works for you.

There are bright spots. D'Argo was given some hysterically funny lines and situations. Sikozu is fine eye candy. Crichton carries his part pretty well, even the melodramatic bits, and Scorpius, especially as ""Harvey"", borders on wonderful. On the other hand, I was overjoyed when Zhaan left the series, as I don't think I've ever seen a less believable or less interesting character in sci fi. (No insult to the actress - it was the material that uniformly stank.) Between wildly uneven writing, occasional descent into ""artsy"" filming that's mostly grating, and science so absurd that calling this science fiction is a stretch, you have a space opera experience best described as ""not for everyone."" In some ways it's to science fiction, what Twilight is to fantasy: if you like it, you really like it, and if you don't, you wonder what on earth the writer was thinking.

I know there are people who believe this is the best series ever. To each their own. I'm just suggesting that if you're not  already a fan, and are looking for sci fi that's detailed, touches on deep themes, and holds up well, skim over a number of episodes before you buy this.",1277596800,23,2257,4.452784503631961

As such, I pre-ordered this immediately and hoped beyond hope that the packaging wasn't crap. Luckily, the packaging was fantastic.

Each season comes in a case that is the size of a single DVD case. Each dvd is secure with no paper or cardboard sleeves around the discs (just the sturdy plastic). The set contains every season and a set of archive/bonus footage in another case, which makes the box about 5 dvds wide.

First of all, storywise, I found this to be one of the best scifi series of all time. The writing was well done and followed a central storyline all through the series. It kept me wanting to see what happened next because there was no ""reset"" from one episode to the next. Changes that occur in one episode were carried on throughout. The characters evolve as well, and their relationships change throughout the course of the series (both with allies and enemies).

The bad about the series is the often graphic nature of some of the scenes. The sexual situations depicted are in no way subtle, especially between Dargo and Chiana. I also don't want to have to see the various bodily fluids that Scorpious pukes out every now and then, or see the little old lady alien taking a leak into a pot. It's bad enough that it was talked about. I did not need to see it up on the screen.

Then I realised that what I didn't like about the show was the fact that the characters didn't get along all the time and there seemed to be a lot of conflict in the characters over silly things.  The fact is that that was just good writing and good characterisation and it actually suited the situation in the show and the alien cultures perfectly.  Halfway through season 1 I was hooked, I loved the setting, The characters and the stories and the effects...

I would also have to say that this wasn't a hugely budgeted show like Battlestar Galactia, which I also like, But rather a smaller budget older show with a fantastic mix of CGI, puppets, great costuming and makeup that create a very real feeling of being in a completely alien setting.  The puppets are amazing and I felt that, like Yoda in the original Star Wars trilogy, they had a depth and warmth that CGI didn't have, for me, until Avatar.

So to keep it short - Farscape is a show that is well worth a watch, it is a pity it didn't last longer than 4 seasons.  It's a show for those who love science fiction or things a little not of this world - If you like Babylon 5, then this the show for you.  If you're into the supper modern CGI of Battlestar Galactica but like a good science fiction story I think you'd love it after you adjust to different feel and the warmth that Farscape has that some more modern shows miss.",1275955200,,1591,4.28

Now that I've been able to go back and watch the entire series marathon-style it is far better, far deeper, and far wackier than I remembered. Ben, Claudia, Anthony, Virginia, Gigi, Jonathan, and Lani (okay, and Wayne too) have all won a place in my heart. Fun action, tense romance, comedy that ranges from in-the-moment to intentionally absurd. The dialogue is brilliant and the production quality superb. The puppetry of Rygel is magificently nuanced - the character really comes to life. Farscape is definitely one of my top 5 all time favorite TV shows, up there with Firefly and Red Dwarf.

I've watched all the DVDs and there are heaps of extras, commentaries and additional bits n pieces: more additional stuff than you usually get on DVD sets. Some of the extras are available on YouTube, but not all of them. I handed this to my husband and he was very quickly a devotee too, watching about 3 episodes every night after work and all day on the weekends until he finished it. I can confirm what others say: this is like a movie on TV - production values high. Puppets are clearly puppets but sometimes you really don't see them as puppets - they become REAL! In other words, the puppet/animatronic stuff is of far higher quality than i am accustomed to. Acting is brilliant (particularly Claudia Black!!! and Ben Browder) and some really funny storylines.

Still, in literature and movies, I feel the reader / viewer is obligated to cut the authors a little slack. Hence, while this is not a perfect series, it IS very, very good.

I love that the human journey is never lost in all the flying ships and wormholes.

The world of Farscape is accessible to anyone, be it fans of drama, comedy or science fiction. Take it from a convert. I was one of those people who didn't give Farscape a chance originally because the puppets gave me pause on sampling an episode. Too bad for me. It was not until Farscape was canceled and all the uproar from the fans caught my attention and caused me to watch. By the time I watched from the Pilot to PK Tech Girl, I knew something was special about this show.

2624374,5,B000GY75JE,"I'm of the opinion that the word ""epic"" is fairly overused when attempting to describe most science fiction space operas.  Yet here in retrospection, I find myself quite unable to coin a more fitting term to describe the endlessly twisting romp that is the Farscape saga.

Let's begin this review by immediately dismissing one of the most ridiculous and laughable criticisms I've encountered surrounding the property: the fact that many of the creatures inhabiting the Frascape universe are in fact puppets (or more specifically complex computer controlled animatronics).  To steer clear of this series on that fact alone is simply ludicrous and equivalent to protesting Return of the Jedi due to the construction of Jabba the Hutt.

This is a science fiction series with a heavy slant toward fantasy; coming up with creatures that border on the very edge of human imagination is a feat accomplished through either computer generated imagery (CGI) which, in case you've been living in a cave this past decade, has pretty much taken over modern filmmaking or through practical (physical) effects, be it puppets, props, suits, or dummies.  In this case The Jim Henson Company, under the stewardship of late Jim's son Brian Henson does it the old fashioned way with mechanical creature designs that are remarkably lifelike.  And perhaps I'm biased, but actual physical characters on set tends to provide the human actors a realism to play off that even the finest CG efforts struggle to duplicate.  Truly this modern day puppeteering effort is every bit as dazzling in action as Jim Henson's original vision in classic films The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.

That said, Farscape deviates from the aforementioned films by taking a fairly realistic scientific swing to establish the fantastical worlds and characters occupying them.  Since the most effective reviews tend to be those which draw useful comparisons, let me take moment to attempt to liken Farscape to some other contemporary science fiction efforts.  Structurally, the series resembles the tones found in shows like Stargate Atlantis with a bit more emphasis placed on rich and lavish visuals (both in its characters and settings).  There is a sociological and political undertone, especially early on, that harkens back to the original Star Wars trilogy.  And finally there could certainly be some loose comparisons drawn (especially in the later seasons) to the likes of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica once earth becomes a predominant factor to the once-distant-conflict taking place.

To summarize the plot (and considering it requires a full 4-seasons and a 3-hour feature film to do properly), I will do my best to condense the endlessly twisting prose into a few brief paragraphs while avoiding any major plot spoilers.

John Crichton is a modern-day IASA (International Aeronautics and Space Administration) astronaut involved in a top-secret experimental project dubbed ""Farscape One"". During a test flight above Earth orbit, a random wormhole appears, swallowing Crichton and his module while instantaneously transplanting him to a distant region of the known universe. Upon his molecular reassembly, Crichton's module inadvertently clips another passing craft, a light-armored fighter, causing it to spin out of control and collide with a nearby asteroid. The resulting impact kills the craft's pilot instantly while Crichton escapes with only a nick in the fuselage of his ship.

Dazed and drifting amidst a heated interstellar conflict, Christon's tiny craft is detected then rescued by a nearby organic-ship, named Moya, which it turns out has been hijacked by escaped convicts of various alien species.  As such the earthen transplant suddenly finds himself aligned with a band of intergalactic outlaws and further complicating matters is the fact that the police force in hot pursuit (the Peacekeepers) just so happen to be led by a fellow named Crais.  When Crichton made his untimely appearance through the wormhole, it was the craft of Crais' brother he collided with and destroyed.  Talk about starting off on the wrong foot!

Like any serial, perhaps the utmost important factor to consider is the level of viewer trust required in the writing.  After all, embarking upon a series of this magnitude is quite a large commitment both in terms of time and emotional attachment.  It's easy to start forming bonds with these characters and poor writing, if even only temporary, can cause definite ripples on the proverbial water.  Fortunately the collaborate effort of Rockne S O'Bannon and David Kemper is such where suspension of disbelief occurs very early on and the inevitable rotation of cast that occurs when a show runs this long is handled believably and properly.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the team is their ability to traverse so many episodes without stumbling into the usual snafus and pitfalls associated with doing so: formulaic plots, recycled themes, dead-end story threads.  In fact, it's tough not to be impressed with the fact that little plot threads set up very early on in the series are revisited and expanded upon in the later seasons flawlessly (and often unexpectedly).  Truly no part of the plot structure is wasted here.

Of course this isn't to suggest the entire run is without flaw.  The show does suffer from the usual slumps and growing pains just like any other.  Of particular note are those episodes that spend a great deal of time (sometimes whole episodes in fact) within Crichton's mind; one that mimics an episode of Loony Tunes and another that was essentially a virtual video game stand out as examples.  The transition of certain characters is equally topsy-turvy from Gigi Edgley's odd initial portrayal of the character Chiana to the ridiculous introduction of the mystic Noranti.  Finally, some characters (such as the loathsome Stark) manage to do little more than annoy the viewer from their introduction to the series' conclusion.  However, and perhaps rarer still, is that even the most annoying characters the show throws at you are revealed to be so remarkably different from their real life counterparts, which just further proves the acting range of the incredible cast.

A&E's release of the entire series (save the final miniseries/ feature film- more on that later) actually marks the second domestic release of the series on DVD.  The first was handled by ADV Films (AD Vision) in the form of small volume releases that were later grouped into box sets.  The trouble was distribution was fairly limited and, not unlike the anime titles they shared catalog space with, quite expensive compared to other domestic television releases.  Further complicating things, ADV lost the rights to the first season of the show to Sony, which prompted miscellaneous collections to hit the market.

A&E snagged then released all 88-episodes of the show (and 15 hours of bonus features) across 26-discs and packaged them up as either individual season releases or as a single complete box set.  While robust in the ADV releases, A&E actually managed to add more material to the special features set.  Additionally A&E's box set makes use of thin pack cases and takes up about 1/10th the shelf space of ADV Films' bulky release and perhaps even more impressive still is that the complete series, (which was going for as low as $54.99 brand new), comes in at just a little over what ADV was asking for each 4-episode release.  About the only disadvantage to the newer box set comes in the form of the bit rate which is roughly 2/3 that of ADV's on account of compression required to fit nearly double the number of episodes on each disc.  However, it is barely noticeable save for occasional slight pixelization.

Now about that miniseries snafu; try as they may to finally place the entire saga into a single collection, A&E, like ADV before it, couldn't wrestle away the rights to the final chapter of the saga (""The Pacekeeper Wars"") is yet a separate entity meaning unless you enjoy ending a show on one of the worst cliffhangers imaginable, be sure to order the Peacekeeper Wars DVD set from Lion's Gate.

And no, this is no mere marketing gimmick to soak a few extra dollars out of fans; in truth the show's broadcast run on SyFy (then Sci-Fi Channel) was scheduled to go five seasons, but was cancelled due to lack of network financing after only four.  The response from fans was both immediate and overwhelming yet Sci-Fi refused to budge on the issue.  In fact so intense was public outcry that various financial backers in Europe stepped in to offer their support to Brian Henson, so that in 2004, The Jim Henson Company was able to produce a four-hour mini-series event to properly wrap up the series story arc; this is what we now call The Peacekeeper Wars.

In all, it is difficult, if not impossible, for me not to recommend this series to science fiction aficionados of all disciplines; it manages to combine some of the best elements of space opera, drama, fantasy, and hard science into a romp with a storyline that is nearly impossible to predict.  In fact it's equally hard not to recommend it to fans of solid entertainment, regardless of the genre.  Well-developed characters, realistic interactions, unique sets & locales, intricate societies and alien races, interesting technology, and even a nice dose of genuine humor round out the show's attributes.  Highly, highly recommended entertainment.  Epic even.",1270252800,2,9461,5.096502590673575

2624376,4,B000GY75JE,"A Nice series, nice box set, just a couple very small problems read on..

The complete series comes in a nice compact boxed set. The series box contains 5 individual dvd sized season boxes. Seasons 1-4 and a 5th special box.

Each season is contained in a nice compact dvd sized case that easily fits where you want to put them.

Now, some small problems with the complete season set, nothing major but its there.

1) Sometimes you will notice sound problems, where sound drops lower and changes volume, especially in season 1. Not a major problem, but you'll notice it a few times. Like someone turned the volume down and back up after a while.

2) The season cases are small and compact, which actually causes 1 small problem. In larger cases the DVD's are held by a holder that goes through the center of the DVD. Since these cases are tight and compact, the ""prong"" that holds the DVD's in the case are very very small and tight, making it hard to take the DVD's out of the case. It really feels like you can break the DVD if you force it. Something you have to settle for, because of the tighter case.

Overall, a nice series. Farscape is more character driven episodes due to lower salary for the episodes, and there are many very bad episodes with very bad plots. The series isn't up to the bigger more popular series like Stargate, or Babalon 5, but its still a nice series that any Sci-Fi fan should have, especially for the decent price of the complete series.",1269475200,6,1470,4.446096654275093

2624444,5,B000GY75JE,"I buy old TV series to watch as background ""noise"" as I work at my desk at home. In the past I had previously watched a few episodes of Farscape on the SciFi channel but had never had time to watch it on a regular basis. I bought the entire four seasons of the series on DVD for $59 about 6 or 7 weeks ago and started watching it every day, again while I worked. The first season of the series was OK and I liked it enough to keep watching. The characters were interesting but the plots sometimes seemed random in that they did not always seem to flow well together from week to week. A few were just poorly written, directed, and acted. The puppet characters were also not fully believable. But, most of the members of the cast were pretty good. The one exception to the first season was Ben Browder, who as John Crichton could not quite seem to find his character which I think made his performances uneven. However, the second season was much better as the cast members found their characters' identities and developed the relationships among themselves that would later serve the series well. The writing and the direction also improved and so did the special effects. Your reward for staying with the development of the first and second seasons is that they setup the third and fourth seasons which were outstanding. Wayne Pygram's portrayal of the evil Scorpius makes the entire show. While the other actors frequently receive more recognition and praise, it is Pygram's acting that makes the other actors believable and the despair and fears of John Crichton real. I don't think that this series could have been half as successful without him. Another standout is Gigi Edgley's development of the character Chiana. While it was difficult to place her importance in the group at first, Chiana eventually develops into one of the more compelling characters later in the series. Most people also credit Claudia Black, who played the romantic female lead Aeryn Sun, as being the ""hot babe"" that kicked *** and stole the show for her sexy, strong personality. But, what I saw was her classical training as an actress take over as the series progressed which made the other actors better. I was pleased to see Ben Browder finally find his character of John Crichton in Seasons 3 and 4 as he became a hero you could believe in. What is interesting is that the writers and directors also finally realized that Farscape's strength is that it is a love story between Ben and Aeryn, who become an unlikely Romeo and Juliet. The story just happens to take place in outer space. This allowed for the story line to become more unified and consistent with better direction soon following. There was so much potential remaining for this series when it was canceled. One disappointment I had was that many great characters remained undeveloped to their full potential. The performance of Rebecca Riggs as Grayza (kind of an evil version of Aeryn and Scorpius combined) was terrific. For those who have watched the series, just imagine the sparks a conflict between Aeryn and Grayza would create between Crichton's lover chosen and the lover scorned, especially if both were carrying John Crichton's child? Another character was that of Jool (played by Tammy Macintosh) and the relationship between Sikozu (played by Raelee Hill) and Scorpius. Later (in the movie to be discussed), we find Sikozu betrays Scorpius who may just be falling for her evil ways. Wouldn't that be delicious to see Scorpius heartbroken? The final Season 4 episode is a real cliffhanger. Contrary to what some have said, I do think that it works well as a closing show to the series. It just does not give the happy ending many wish to see. But, it is highly dramatic and in many ways better. But, for those who must have the finality of a happy ending, don't fear. If you buy the three hour Farscape movie the ""Peacekeeper Wars,"" the final 5th season to wrap up the series is essentially compressed into one last movie. Without giving away the ending, you will be pleased so don't forget to buy this with the TV series. It completes the entire novel that is Farscape. Enjoy!",1269043200,,4139,4.718232044198895

I could geek out for hours discussing the successes and flavor of the series, but I'll cut directly to the reason for the title of my review:  My set includes Peacekeeper Wars!  It was only available from Best Buy and only with the initial shipment to their retail and web-warehouse.  I didn't have to hunt down the individual PKW DVD that 'concludes' the series.  If you can still find one of these, I would recommend it above the standard.  I had been waiting for 10 years to pick this up because of the cost of the original DVD release and will even re-purchase it should it become available on Blu-Ray.

2624448,5,B000GY75JE,Farscape was a great show and when SciFi channel didn't finish the series with one last season that was a big mistake. The story and characters are second to none. I would like to see this series come back for at least 2-3 shows to finish the story.,1268784000,,249,4.208333333333333

If you were a fan of the series then you probably already bought this, if you havn't then what are you waiting for?

2624452,5,B000GY75JE,I had just discovered Farscape on netflix when I noticed that this set was on sale. I didn't hesitate a second in buying it and I'm glad I did. My only regret is that this set didn't include The Peacekeeper Wars mini series that took the place of a fifth season. Farscape has so many things lacking in t.v. sci fi now. The relationship of the characters constantly grows and evolves without falling into the trap that killed many shows when the characters finally end up together. The humor is top notch with plenty of ad-libs done by Ben Browder (the only actor from the U.S.) which gives it a fast and authentic feel. Claudia Black is one of those women that when you first see her you might not notice how striking and beautiful she actually is. Anthony Simcoe and Gigi Edgly give performances that let you see beyond the make up and costumes and show you a person inside. My advice is to buy this set and pick up The Peacekeeper Wars dvd as well. Once you start watching you won't want to stop.,1268438400,,998,4.370967741935484
2624463,5,B000GY75JE,"The show:

There are two primary currents in space opera - the military team dynamic (a la Star Trek, Stargate SG-1, Macross, Babylon 5, etc) or the ragtag bunch of lunatics on the lam (a la Star Wars, Lexx, Blake's 7, Outlaw Star). The Japanese have some other variants (e.g. Galaxy Express 999) and it's arguable if Space Westerns form a different category, but these are the 2 major European and American ones.

Farscape falls squarely into the ""ragtag bunch of lunatics on the lam"" tradition. The main difference in Farscape is that it throws in the fish out of water scenario, too. A human astronaut named John Crichton is unexpectedly teleported to the alien vessel with escaped prisoners after travelling through a wormhole.

This probably all sounds rather derivative. The setup is. Many of the storylines are standard genre fare. In lesser hands it would've been a standard B sci-fi show, yet on Farscape it seems fresh - even though you've seen many of the same plots before on other shows.

What really sets Farscape apart are its impeccable production values, crisp dialogue, and character driven nature. The Jim Henson creature studio did much of the special effects work on this show and it all looks fantastic. It really looks like a feature film every episode. The lighting and makeup is also phenomenal. The acting is also first-rate and the leads have good on-screen chemistry. You really grow to care for the show's characters.

If you like sci-fi and you haven't watched it yet, you will like this show. It's probably the best one you haven't seen. It's solid from the first episode to the last one. This is Space opera done right.

The set itself:

On to the set. The only downside I can think of is the box for the whole set - it's completely enclosed in cardboard. Each season is individually packaged quite nicely in a 6 disc dvd case. I really like these cases as they're very compact and look attractive. Oh, and it doesn't contain Peacekeeper Wars (the miniseries conclusion to the Farscape series), so remember to buy that separately.

The set contains deleted scenes on each disc, commentary by actors and folks involved with production. Not shabby. The behind the scenes documentaries are also really good and shed a lot of light on everything from the effects to the efforts to bring back the show. Also beyond that, it includes the special 2 disc set ""Archives"" which has interviews and features with the composer, the producers, the actors, a behind Farscape feauturette ""Farscape:Undressed"" and a Virginia Hey segment called Zhaan forever. Overall, the special features in this set are pretty impressive and the interviews are insightful and surprisingly frank.

In short this set is an absolute must buy if you like sci-fi, especially at this price. It's less than $20 a season and you get two bonus discs. A real bargain considering the starbursts used to cost a fortune.",1268438400,,2907,4.844758064516129
2624464,5,B000GY75JE,"I am a big fan of the tv series Farscape, but when the show was released on DVD it was in various episode sets and then in full seasons...it was very expensive.  We all have heard about the enormous production costs to make the show, but it seemed like the powers that be wanted to make those costs back on the DVD sales.  But Amazon was selling the whole series, all 4 seasons, for $59.99!  That was an opportunity I could not pass. (I think it currently lists for $74.99, still a bargain)

Once I received the set, I could not wait to watch some of my favorite episodes.  I am not one to really care about the packaging, but it comes in its own set box and 5 DVDs...one for each season and one disk of special features.

I won't go into details about the picture or sound...others have written reviews much better than I could concerning that.  I will say that the picture and audio are outstanding.

If you are a fan of the series or are interested in seeing what everyone has been talking about, this is the set to buy.",1268352000,,1023,4.237113402061856
2624465,5,B000GY75JE,"I first discovered ""Farscape"" shortly after the beginnings of its first season and have been hooked ever since.  My biggest gripe over the years has been how expensive the previous incarnations of the ""Farscape"" DVDs have been...til now!  This set includes the entire four seasons in beautiful prints at what is now a very affordable price.

However; be warned!  The DVDs are set in their holders so tightly that if you are not careful when removing them, you may break them.  This happened to me.  In all the years I've been collecting both CDs and DVDs, I have never broken a disc...until now.  I actually had to replace the (Season One) set to replace one disc.  I'm not laying blame at anyone's feet, but just be careful when removing these discs.

Also, don't expect to find ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" in this package.  The rights to the mini-series are owned by a separate company, so you'll have to buy the mini-series separately, but it's worth every penny as well.",1268006400,,979,4.739644970414201
2624466,5,B000GY75JE,I started watching Farscape somewhere in the middle so I was anxious to go back and see it from the beginning.

2624467,5,B000GY75JE,"I can't add much more to what has already been said. The production values are off the charts, and the work of the creature shop is magnificent. It also helps that so many of the main characters are memorable and that the acting is generally top notch.

I am not sure if this has been mentioned before, but this set does not include the ""Peacekeeper Wars"" finale. It's still well worth the money, however.",1268006400,,405,4.472972972972973

The acting is top notch and the characters are very engaging. Watching the first season has really helped me understand where certain characters from later seasons came from and what their motivations were.

Jim Henson Productions turned out some very interesting puppet designs and work. Rygel is easily my favorite character, both because of his puppet work and because of his personality.

Cannot recommend this enough to people. If you like Science Fiction, you'll enjoy Farscape.",1268006400,,745,4.983870967741935

What more could you ask for in a show?  And just when you thought you knew everything about a character, they throw something new at you, or a new character shows up and brings out a new side in everyone you didn't know existed, and you get to know them all over :)  Everyone in my family loves this show, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good, fun show.",1267660800,,659,4.15748031496063

2624654,5,B000GY75JE,"The box set itself:

1. I won't make any remarks about the Starburst sets, since I've never owned one. However, when I found out A&E had released an old Sci-fi favourite of mine from when the Sci-fi channel was a Science Fiction channel, I was excited and loved the price. It's economical, while the outer packaging isn't the best, it is what it is. The extras are numerous in quantity and the picture and sound are very good. However I'm not one to go into specifics about quality, but I'm very satisfied with the purchase. It's very economical as I said, if you're hard for cash this is one of the cheaper TV series out there.

2. The show:

I always found similarities between this show and Lexx, while there is no direct similarities. Both shows are character and story driven, Farscape has far more going on in an episode than say Star Trek or Babylon 5. It breaks molds and at times is quirky. Crichton himself is the anti-thesis of Kirk which is welcoming, we explore his and his crew-mates psyche throughout the entire series.

Unlike many other science fiction, there is a lot of grey area involved as well. Which I think is good because you'd never see an alien's side of the story in *Insert typical sci-fi show here*.

It is not always serious and when it is you bond with the characters emotionally, such as in the famed John/Aeryn arc, D'Argo's arc and Scorpious' arc. Each character has depths which are explored, while not fully in detail you understand their motives and evolution throughout the series.

If you are currently itching for something different than Star Trek, SG1 or Babylon 5 and even one my favourites: Lexx, give it a try.",1267401600,,1656,4.596610169491526

2624714,5,B000GY75JE,"I was disappointed when this show went off the air, but I understood it was very expensive to produce.  This series still remains one of my all time favorites. it reminds me of the story arc shows like babylon 5 and battlestar galactica(the updated version) where you couldn't wait till the next show.

my kids like it because some of the characters are puppets,not the cloth kind, by jim henson's creature shop and the laser fights. I enjoyed it because of the humor(dry sarcastic) and the comradery between the central characters, these people are willing to die for each other.

i only wish the set also contained the ending to their story called the peacekeeper wars, which is on a separate disk, but still cheap enough to get on its own. yeah! a series with an ending how often does that happen?

my kids favorite, of course,was Dominar(king)Rygel's puppet, he has an interesting body chemistry that has him farting helium when he's nervous and urinating fire when he eats food on a certain planet, what boy doesn't love that.

all kidding aside, there is a deep story line for each of these characters that will have you forgeting this is just a show. it all centers around wormhole technology which cichton stumbles on. he gets thrown into another galaxy where he's pulled onto a living ship full of escaped prisoners. then gets injected with a nanite/biological device and it translates all languages for him in his head.

everyone wants crighton for the wormhole technology, which is locked inside his brain by an alien race he encounters inside one of his trips through a wormhole. he just wants to go home as does all the ""prisoners"" he befriends onboard the ship called moya.

Moya has a symbiotic relationship with her pilot,another puppet character who is attached to her literally and operates the controls with his many arms.

there are a few times that the B word is said to Zhaan, the blue plant woman. so a heads up to anyone with small children. of course its Rygel who says it to her with, after awhile, affection. she is known to him as ""the big blue b****"". Crighton nicknames everyone early in the show and the rest follow his example. so depending on everyone's moods some have many colorful ones at times.

Lots of interesting stuff about how the show was filmed. The box also includes 2 CDs with more extras, but I didn't find that as interesting).

The video quality is not HD (says so in the description though), but good enough for me. Had a little scare about audio quality when I first started to watch the episodes - but that's just cause it was set to surround sound and I only have stereo speakers (& it took me a while to find the settings button on the DVD menu).

2624718,5,B000GY75JE,"I just finished watching FARSCAPE: THE COMPLETE SERIES, all four seasons and 88 episodes, with my husband, who is a long time fan.  After seeing this wonderful science fiction space opera for the first time, I have no idea why I didn't watch it when it originally aired 10 years ago.  This is some of the best sci-fi I have seen in years, not to mention, some of the best television.  Almost a space western, FARSCAPE is an exciting adventure, with gorgeous special effects, great characters, and an intricate story arc that grabs and holds your attention throughout the entire series.

I will provide just the basic plot of FARSCAPE, here.  Earth astronaut John Crichton, on an experimental space mission, is accidentally pulled into a wormhole and hurled across the universe into the midst of an intergalactic conflict. Trapped on a living space ship, living among alien creatures who wield deadly technology and are being hunted by a merciless military race, John Crichton finds himself on an epic journey more spectacular than anything he has ever imagined.  Along the way he finds friends, enemies, and love, but he never stops searching for the way home.

Ten plus years after its original airing, FARSCAPE is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  The stories are still interesting and relevant, the characters remarkable and unique, and the adventure worth living.  Even the special effects still hold up magnificently.  There are not too many high tech series that can make these claims.

What really makes FARSCAPE tick are the wonderful, well developed, imperfect characters.  Even the ones that are Muppets.  Yes, Muppets.  Jim Henson's Muppets.  All of the characters on this show are so well defined, so complete, so rich in history and self actualization, that you forget the Muppets are, well, muppets.  They are real, and every bit as essential to the plot lines as the flesh characters are.  Good, evil, or somewhat ambiguous, you come to care about all of these characters and what happens to them.  They are full of life, full of foibles, and full of angst, and they don't necessarily respond as humans would.  Each is out for his own gain, his own agenda, but still, they come to depend on each other and become a family.  Including their living ship, Moya, who frequently has a mind of her own.

Another wonderful aspect of FARSCAPE is the creators' ability to push boundaries and to have fun.  Mixed in among the serious drama episodes, are fun, hilarious, unexpected treasures, that while unique and often odd-ball, still further the plot, but successfully relieve some of the building tension.

If you are a fan of space opera, then FARSCAPE should not be missed.  If you are a fan of adventure, great tv, and interesting and fun stories, then FARSCAPE should not be missed.  I have to say, though, that the only part of FARSCAPE that I did not like was the last minute and a half of the final episode.  I hated it completely.  Luckily...there was more to come...MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1266192000,2,3014,4.8359375

I have seen way to many Sci Fi and fantasy shows and Farscape is my favorite.  They pushed character and plot boundaries more than any other show I've seen.  The actors had great chemistry and the writing and sets were stellar.  If there was a fifth season I would see it in a heartbeat even if the commercial time was doubled and included ads for the ARMY and Barbie dolls.  Farscape rules!!!,1265932800,,668,4.2204724409448815

I would really recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi or even just a group of dis-functional misfits who get thrown together and at the beginning want to kill each other and end up becoming a dis-functional family by the end of the series and into the Peacekeeper Wars mini-series.(Which if you are ordering this, make sure to order that dvd as well)  Also if you do like this show, then check out Firefly and then the follow up move Serenity.

Now, I am glad A&E took over the release for the complete series set.  I just got it (love Amazon and their prices), haven't got a chance to look at the special features, but 2 episodes in, the video and audio are great.  Now I can have some Farscape marathons for this awesome sci-fi series.

At least two characters that the audience loves to hate, we come to cheer for.  The miracle is that one feels no shame in such turnarounds, because so much attention has been paid to the character development and interaction that the progressions makes sense; the audience is brought along just like the characters are.  Despite the bizarre stage on which the drama occurs, it is all believable.

The level of plot complexity is dizzyingly entertaining, and addictive.  Farscape is easily on par, if it does not surpass, the likes of Babylon 5, Star Trek The Next Generation, and (the new) Battlestar Galactica.

Bonuses in this box set edition include commentary by actors about the most influential episodes, the actors speaking out of character about their roles, and subtitles to decode all the newspeak this series introduces.

Initially, I didn't watch Farscape, but then I saw an episode where one of the characters went into a coma and lived through several ""cartoon"" encounters. I was caught by the ""Chuck Jones"" treatment where he took the place of the Road Runner, with the Coyote being yet another character. I ended up watching the entire episode with fascination.

After that, I had to see more. While I thought that the ""Muppets"" (there are really only two) would make for an unbelievable show, I am happy that I was proven wrong. The character interaction, and superb writing makes this one of the most enjoyable shows I've ever seen.

2624790,5,B000GY75JE,"Finally the best made scifi series is on DVD.... not for an outrageous price like the last sets!

My favorite part of this series is the irreverent humor, but it doesn't take away from the tension, drama, or action in the story... you can tell Aussie's made this! In one episode someone complains about the living quarters and John Crichton replies ""Well.... welcome to the USS BUTTCRACK!"". It is a prison ship, not a hotel!

The female cast members aren't window dressing like in many programs. In this series they are every bit as tough as the men... and in the case of Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan and Aeryn Sun, far more dangerous!

Another good thing is that the FARSCAPE universe isn't a liberal dream world like Star Trek. The characters don't always get along, and the political leaders don't know what is best for the masses... as in the real world, they are only interested in their own ends.

This whole series was also a weekly resume for JIM HENSON""S CREATURE SHOP. Instead of gluing beautifully painted latex parts on someone's head and calling them an alien (as done in a previously mentioned series), in this series they had film quality Animatronics. This allowed two main characters to be puppets! You can read their emotions on their faces, and heard it in the voice so well that very quickly they become characters in the series and not gadgets. They also did full body makeups on many of the regular cast!

Sure all the VFX were perfect, but the most important thing for any series is the writing, and acting. This series was NOT lacking there either! All the actors did a wonderful job, and it isn't easy when you are often reacting to something that will be added in later by the effects people. I would burst out laughing if I had to kiss someone with brown tentacles sticking out of their head!

I wish the series was able to finish it's five year run, but it was dumped after four years in-spite of great ratings... apparently because of money. This leaves the series ended on a cliff hanger. Fortunately the  television film finished it... as usual not in a sappy Hollywood way.",1265414400,,2093,4.595174262734584

the aliens and creature work from The Jim Henson Company. They did a great job and

2624803,5,B000GY75JE,"Don't wait, buy this set.

For those that are curious, the commentaries from the Starburst editions are included in this set as far as I can tell.  Seasons 1-3 are presented in original 4:3, and season 4 in 16:9.  It is sadly true that there are no subtitles in this set, but closed caption does work. Video quality is very good, and the extras are plentiful.

Each season is presented in a standard-sized DVD case, making the entire series 5-DVD cases wide.  Each disc is single-sided (thank God!) and dual-layered.  The last case holds a couple discs of special features, including the much touted ""Farscape: Undressed.""  The commentaries are by far the best features on the discs, as you can tell the people that made the show truly loved it, and it comes across in the acting and production.  ""Box"" the set comes in is pretty much a glossy piece of paper folded into the shape of a box.  It's not great, but the discs themselves are well-protected.

As for the content of the show, if you even liked Farscape at one time or another, you have to get this set especially at this price considering each season used to be $100.  And who knows, maybe one day they'll shoot more.  Brian Henson has been trying to produce web shorts in hopes of relaunching the series in some form, and DVD sales couldn't hurt that cause.",1264982400,,1318,4.538135593220339
2624804,4,B000GY75JE,"I was already a fan of the show, used it as an opportunity to watch missing episodes.

2624805,5,B000GY75JE,Farscape is by far the best show ever put out there. The story of John and then John and Aeryn - how they deal with each other and all the things going on is just phenomenal. canceling this show was the worst thing Scifi ever did.,1264896000,,230,4.021739130434782
2624806,5,B000GY75JE,"Video:

The video presentation for Farscape varies greatly in terms of quality. On the aspect ratio side of things the first three seasons of the show are presented with full-screen 1.33:1 with the fourth seasons shown in 1.78:1 anamorphic wide-screen. The disparity in aspect ratio is a little jarring at first and when the switch happens, but it's just the way the series was produced. Now, as far as the transfer is concerned that's another story entirely.

The picture quality here is soft, grainy, and full of compression artifacts (primarily in the first season as it gets much better during the other three). The color quality remains vibrant and the show's contrast is good as well, but there was definitely a loss in overall quality when the show was compressed from 48 discs to 26. The series hasn't aged too well either and it's a shame that a little restoration wasn't in order for this release. In the later seasons the picture is all around sharper and richer with deeper black levels, so there's at least some light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps if there were ever to be enough demand for a blu-ray set the show would receive a little love? Overall this show looks slightly better than average, but it can't really be considered top of the line.

AUDIO: The audio in Farscape  comes in two forms: Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. Both of those options serve up a perfectly fine experience with crisp, clean sound and a solid enough presence on the soundstage. The 5.1 offers a slightly better presentation with some use of the rear channels, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. The sense of immersion for this show is not the best and the rear channels only kick in during a few key moments. Still, it's more than adequate for this show. Just don't come expecting a bombastic score and you'll find it to be sufficient.

PACKAGING: 5 ""sets"" of DVD s gathered in one glossy box keeping them all together. Each Season has its own ""set"" with the final set being reserved for a number of special features (""making of"" documentaries, mostly). The other Special Features as promised in the description of the set here, are scattered throughout the various discs. I wish the glossy box was a bit more sturdy and easier to access the sets (do you open from the left or right? you decide). A minor quibble though compared to the overall satisfaction I've gotten so far from this new A&E release.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Farscape"" is truly an incredible show with excellent writing and some fine acting throughout its 4 year run. It would have been nice to have the final 3 hour installment ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" (which somewhat neatly ties up and concludes the series) included in the box, but rights issues prevented that from happening. You can certainly buy it separately on Amazon (and you REALLY must do so in order to see the conclusion of the show) and keep it next to this on your shelf. Speaking of which, the amount of shelf space saved with this package compared to the original 2 disc ADV volumes is incredible. Even if you own every ADV release like I do, this set is more than worth getting. The video and audio are markedly improved (even though it is never mentioned that the episodes are remastered, one look and you will be able to tell in an instant); and it truly does make a HUGE difference compared with the original ADV releases. The aforementioned amount of shelf space saved is indeed a plus.

Overall, 5 stars for the quality of the show, and this incredible new release with remastered video and audio. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1264896000,,3578,4.66984126984127
2624807,4,B000GY75JE,"The series is very good - has a little of a '60s/70's ""Star Trek"" feel with better production quality. The characters and story lines are believable enough to get addicted to the show. There is even a flash of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" during the show's opening, ""My name is John Crichton, an astronaut... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole..."" You'll see what I mean when you watch it.

I originally only saw the first season and was desperate to see more, but the seasons were so expensive (and hard to find) for individual purchase. I was ecstatic to see it had re-released - and at a much more affordable price ($60 complete series). I also purchased the final installment ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" with this series.

All-in-all, my husband and I really enjoy watching the series during our down time. I put it right up there with ""Battlestar Galactica"" and SyFy's new show ""Caprica"".

I was truly saddened when this series ended.  It was a different type of Sci-Fi show that allowed the audience to grow with the characters, and experience their lives from a unique perspective.

This show, as with many other great sci-fi shows, ended well before its time.

I purchased the series for approximately $57 and change. The price seems to fluctuate often, which is very frustrating. Amazon is currently selling it for $59.99, which is an excellent buy. Get it before the price increases again.

I gave this series a Five Star rating, however, if I could have given it 10 Stars, I would have.  This is definitely a must buy.",1263772800,,759,4.755725190839694
2624813,3,B000GY75JE,"First of all, this is a nice, and very convenient set, well worth the money.  If you've never bought any Farscape episodes before, or you have limited space to store a collection, then this set is probably for you.  That said, there are some caveats. I did a back to back comparison of the original ADV discs and the newer ones in this set. There's three things that jump out.

1. The bit rate is about 2/3 of the ADV discs. I expected this to be lower since A&E is squeezing about twice the number of episodes onto a disc - ADV put two episodes while this set piles on four per disc. The only way to do this is to compress the programs more. Quality-wise, the image is still remarkably good, and I didn't hear any differences in the audio quality.

2. Unlike the ADV discs, these are not progressive scan encoded - the video is interlaced. Some players don't handle interlaced video properly when they try to convert it to progressive scan output, and jittering can appear in motion. This drops the image quality on players that are outputting a progressive video.

3. For some reason, A&E didn't bother using the original source material, and instead, used their broadcast edits. At the beginning of each episode, they have the ""Dolby Surround Where Available"" bug in the lower right corner, which is unacceptable to me. This just makes it look like they recorded it off TV.

On the bright side, the set takes up about a tenth of the space of the entire ADV set does (the main reason I even bothered to buy this set), and has some extra features the original doesn't. It also costs about as much as about 10 of the ADV episodes did. The cases also use the new Bluray style clips that hold the discs in place, so there's much less risk of getting a set with loose (and thus, scratched) discs.

If you're not a big stickler for quality, then this set is for you - the price is just amazing, and most people won't care about the lower bitrate or encoding method. Videophiles, however, should probably steer clear and stick with the ADV sets, or wait until a new set is released with higher quality.",1263686400,439,2097,4.4453125

2624826,5,B000GY75JE,"This series is one of the best scifi shows i have ever seen! The longer the characters are together, the more they grow. They all learn from each other and face amazing challenges. The relationship between John and Aeryn is amazing to watch. They are enemies, friends, lovers...their chemestry is absolutely amazing to watch! This show also gave me even more appreciation for puppets and puppetry verses CGI. It's much easier, at least for me, to feel for a character, like Rygel or Pilot, when they move and look like they could be real. The show is basically just wonderful and very enjoyable to watch. The humor is great, the characters are great, and i highly recommend seeing it!!!",1262995200,,686,4.773109243697479

I realize it is mentally irregular, but on the plus side, this will take up less space on the DVD rack...well, less space next to the other two sets anyway.  LOL What can I say?  I'm a huge fan.

 The character of John Crighton is being rewritten over and over again on various programs.  The mainstream media finally caught up with the brilliance and vision of Farscape.
  I just want to say that I am thankful that it lasted four seasons and they made a last movie. There was nowhere near the pain of Firefly when it ended.  I felt like they got to tell the whole story.

We could hardly wait for the complete series on DVD...we placed our order in August, 2009 and got a great price on it.  We love everything about this series, and we are serious Sci-fi fans.  The development of characters is amazing and kept us intrigued thru the series.

Our only issue is that there is no closed captioning.  I have difficulty understanding speech from videos (TV included) and we always use the closed captioning.  I know most folks won't understand this issue, but when one is accustomed to having it, watching a video with no captioning really makes it hard to understand.  I know I have lost some of the meaning to scenes because I could not understand what was being said.  This issue, however, in no way affects the absolute beauty of this series.

You can read about the set up and what its about elsewhere.

The simple fact is this, the show was intelligent, unique (i.e. it wasn't dumbed down), and brought forth new ideas, concepts and visual effects. The storylines made sense (even the black shirt episodes), if you had been watching from the beginning.

I started buying the DVDs when they were first released, have the whole series and still enjoy it.
This will be the first series in Blu-Ray I'd buy (if they get around to offering it).

All I can recommend is this, if you have never seen the show and the idea interests you, get the series and Peace Keeper Wars (which is the end cap to the series).

There is a reason why after 7=8 years off the air this show still has a fanatical following. Check it out for yourself. You may find yourself wishing you had a DRD around the house.",1261699200,,924,4.293103448275862

The Audio and Video transfer is superb for a TV show that is this old.
The Special features while lacking compared to the Starburst Edition is extremely satisfying. If you love Farscape as do I then you can't afford not to purchase the entire series.

This series, and THIS sci-fi series alone got me into Sci-fi. Not Star Wars, not Star Trek (even though I still like TNG), CERTAINLY not Babylon 5, or even Battlestar Galactica (and definitely not the newest incarnation/personal abomination).

Farscape, in many ways, stands out from the rest of the Sci-fi crowd, in story, in aesthetics, in varied tone, in EVERYTHING.",1261180800,,572,4.88659793814433

2624850,4,B000GY75JE,"I adruously waited as the Starburst editions of Farscape were delineated out to the hungry masses once a quarter in peacemeal fashion.  When I finally had them all and reflected on my minagerie of Starbursting Moyas formed by the spinal murals of 12 dvd boxes cases, I finally understood what Ash Ketchem searched for when he tried to ""catch 'em all.""  What took ADV seemingly 5 years to push out, A&E stealthily nudges out in an series packaged in a tiny box set that almost makes me ashamed.  What would Captain Planet think about those previous chronicles of silicone discs?

They've removed the Pilot ""prepare for immediate starburst"" splash screens that were so omnipresent in the prior volume.  The extras are all mashed together in one grouping of DVDs.  I was really impressed in the manner that they managed to group these four season into the serving size of basically 4 dvd cases.  There are still 487 dvds, but they are packaged in a way that make it very appealing.

I haven't watched all the episodes because I haven't had 12 consecutive snow days to keep me away from work to watch, but the transition to A&E seems to be seamless.  For Farscape fans you'd have to be a real frelnick to pass this up.",1261008000,,1214,4.609302325581395

If you're interested in Farscape, it's cheaper to pick up the complete series, no matter what price it's set at.  If you're not familiar with the show, you may want to rent a season or two, but I recommend jumping right in.

I won't get into the plot behind Farscape; it'd take too long.  If you're a fan of space-chase sci-fi shows, this is one of the best.  The cast is great.  Ben Browder is at his studliest.. and funniest.  The story features some of Rockne S. O'Bannon's greatest and most creative writing.  I highly recommend picking up this box set up.

I would like to point out, that this dvd set, is still in the show's original, full-screen, made-for-television format, so it isn't a perfect fit for most people's flat-screens.  It's still a great buy though, and I'm happy to get to watch the series all over again.  Woohoo!!",1260921600,,1001,4.683908045977011
2624852,5,B000GY75JE,"My review title says it all.  But, for the sake of review, I'll put in more.

Voted the best show on television more than once, the four seasons of Farscape outdo pretty much all other shows.  It's great to see a show with true continuity.  Every show has it's problems, and I'm aware the Farscape has its share, but overall, this is nature's closest-to-perfect show.

It's mystery, political intrigue, science-fiction, war, fantasy, romance, and history all rolled up into a nice tight ball and bounced around your tv set.

I missed the first season, but on a whim (back when I was making pretty good money) I bought the complete first season (on video...  Is that dating me?).  I watched it through, and caught up w/ second season on Sci-Fi channel, watching it clear through to the series finale.  I fought alongside thousands, nay, millions of scapers in 2004 and 2005 to get them to let Henson complete the series, and The PeaceKeeper Wars was made, aired, and released, rounding out the series to, at least, a satisfactory conclusion, even if I'd rather have seen them do it in a fifth season instead.

Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Wayne Pygram, and the entire rest of the crew were just perfect for each other, adding a depth to the characters you rarely find, except maybe on shows like Lost...(another wonderful show).

I have all 10 seasons of Stargate.  Friends have told me that Stargate is better.  That is, they tell me that until they actually sit down and watch Farscape all the way through, and then they agree with me.

Whether you're a science-fiction fan or not, this is easily the best show you'll ever see if you give it the complete opportunity.  It's highly recommended by many others, and I gladly add my voice to theirs.",1260835200,,1745,4.675409836065573

It was horribly expensive when it 1st hit DVD and I couldn't bring myself to spend the $$ to get it.  But this for $60!!!!!  Unreal and really worth the money!  A guy at work told me he bought it for this price and I couldn't wait to get home and order it.  I have been watching it every night since it arrived.

2624855,5,B000GY75JE,"I'm a huge Scifi fan, I own all seasons of SG1 etc.  I loved the 1st season of Farscape when it first came out but because of the crazy schedules that Sci-Fi channel had back then, I missed some of the later episodes and from there season 2 onwards it fell off my radar.

I had considered borrowing the series from Netflix but let's be honest, at 3 dvd's out at a time, it will take forever to finish the series.  Its a mentality thing.  When I saw amazon offering the entire series for less than $60 I snapped at the chance.

This past weekend, I watched the entire Season 1 of Farscape and was reminded just how good it is.  Nothing beats having all the episodes available for your viewing.  Even better is that selected episodes have commentary by Ben and Claudia.

Considering that each season is about 20-24 episodes, that's less than a dollar an episode.  This is a must buy for fans of SG1, Merlin, Star Trek etc.  Don't miss out!",1260748800,,937,4.333333333333333
2624856,4,B000GY75JE,"I just received this set for my birthday and am pretty pleased! I have read most of the reviews here so I was not expecting the set to be closed-captioned for the hearing impaired. However, when I played the first DVD I found that the captioning is actually there. My television has a setting for CC (I use it for everything) and it just came up on the screen while I was watching the pilot episode. While I realize that it should have been done in a better way with a menu option (I doubt that it will come up if I view the dvds on my computer or laptop), it is certainly better than nothing! So, if you want the CC, see if your television has that setting.

Other than that, I like the new set. I have never owned Farscape (was loaned the dvds a few years ago) so I am excited just to have it and am looking forward to watching them all again. Well, I may watch a few of my favorite episodes first, just to get in the mood! I think I will start with John Quixote...good times!",1260748800,6,978,4.067357512953368

I never saw the series while on t.v., but I did catch ""The PeaceKeeper Wars"" when it came to dvd. I have been looking forward to this day for a long, long, time. Was it worth it? You bet! The transfer of the video is nice and clean, my only gripe technically is that the volume seems a bit low. I wish that dvd makers would insist on a regular setting for volume instead of some being very low to very high.

2624860,5,B000GY75JE,"When this show first aired I was busy with other things and was not able to give it the attention that it deserved.  Since then, I have watched the entire series two times beginning to end, including the concluding movie, ""Peacekeeper Wars"" (you need to buy this latter item separately; no big deal, it's not expensive).  This April my family will start watching the entire series once again.  Yes, my wife and son also watch (I wouldn't call my wife addicted like I am, but she certainly ""grew"" into it).  As a matter of fact, my son (who is just about six) is looking forward to the re-watch, too.  He knows all the characters and likes to watch.  For me, John and Aeryn make the show and their chemistry was instantly noticeable.  But they are not the entire show; there are other great characters such as D'Argo, Chiana and Scorpius, to name but three.  Speaking of Scorpius, when he walks onto the screen in episode 19 of the first season, TV history was made.  Period.  The extras (commentaries, interviews, and more) are great and the price, for all you get, is quite a good deal.

To give this show a fair chance, please watch at least to the end of Season 1.  If you don't have the urge to immediately start watching Season 2 you should quickly call a loved one over to check for a pulse.  By the end of Season 4 and the movie that follows, you will probably want to re-watch the entire series, and this time around, I believe you'll have a greater appreciation of the earlier episodes.  By the way, I only write this because I have read that some viewers couldn't get to the end of the first season and start picking the show apart.  I happen to enjoy those early episodes, and several were standouts.  But for those finding it slow-going, hang in there.  The show absolutely picks up steam and takes you for a ride (unlike any other show I have ever watched, before or since).

On a side note: I was recently watching a relatively new animated show for the first time, named Archer.  After the first few minutes it hit me: this is how Farscape should have been continued.  I don't just mean in animation, but the style of animation on Archer.

In closing, Farscape became more than a show for me (and others, too).  Some of the action figures stand on my bookshelves and several issues of the short-lived magazine are there, too (thank-you E-Bay).  Even though I am between re-watches, not a day goes by that I don't think about the show in some manner.  Farscape left an impression on me, I just wish there was more.",1260403200,,2528,4.457516339869281

Witty, intelligent, with characters that actually grew and changed over the course of the series (some for the better, some for the worse), it wasn't like anything else on TV. I still miss it, but owning the box set of DVDs takes away some of the sting.

Can't recommend this highly enough.  If you've seen it, you know why you should own the DVDs.  And if you haven't, now is the time to buy.",1260144000,2,453,4.345238095238095
2624863,5,B000GY75JE,"Star Trek and Star Wars were before my time. I wasn't born until '86. When I tried to watch them as a kid, I couldn't make as much sense of them as my dad let on. And then in '99, I was around 14 years old when I saw this on Sci Fi late one night.

They were halfway through the series when I got hooked. First off, this is one of the reasons why I got into sci-fi. It wasn't Star Trek pioneering the whole idea of space exploration and amazing intergalactic adventures, or Star Wars with its revolutionary storytelling and impressive special effects; even Stargate was still in the works for its own television series alongside Battlestar Galactica and Firefly before they became critically acclaimed series. But this one? It was a definite cult classic from the very first episode.

I watched Seasons 2, 3, and 4 religiously for the most part when they released between 2000 and 2003. When I learned Sci-Fi had cancelled the idea for a 5th season, I was as enraged by this fact as every other fan out there. Fortunately, they were able to do a small miniseries that constituted the bulk of what Season 5 was going to be into a much shorter timespan. Overall, this series is excellent.

Jim Henson's company contributed HEAVILY to this series when it was being aired, and you can see the exquisite detail in the nonhuman-sized alien and machine life that incorporate themselves into the series. This is a major advantage the series has. But that isn't to say that the human-like cast is terrible at all. Seeing the detail that makeup accomplishes for actors like Wayne Pygram, Anthony Simcoe, and Virginia Hey (who each have their own stories to tell in the series) reminded me of Star Trek and how heavily the series as a whole relied on using human actors to portray alien roles.

The story itself is very interesting. It tells the story of John Crichton, an astronaut (portrayed by Ben Browder) who tests a wormhole formation theory that succeeds. It propels him into an unknown part of space. His transport comes into the path of a bio-mechanical transport known as a Leviathan named Moya, who has come under the control of the three prisoners being transported upon it, Ka D'argo the Luxan warrior(played by Anthony Simcoe), Zhann the Delvian priestess (Virginia Hey), and Dominar Rygel the 16th (one major example of Jim Henson's contribution). Coming aboard and being captured, Crichton finds himself in captivity alongside another entity, a soldier. The soldier identifies themselves as Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), a Sebacean Peacekeeper (which is the equivalent of an intergalactic military). Through some rather scrupulous circumstances, these five work together to escape from the pursuit of a military commander with a vendetta against Crichton and a diminished capacity for his sanity. Other critical figures come into the series such as Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), a Scarran hybrid who takes a particular interest in procuring Crichton, and other allies known as Chi'ana, Jool, and Stark.

I also stated that this was how I got into sci-fi. I watched the Star Trek series (all of the original, most of TNG, and some of the later versions), the Star Wars films and animated shorts, Firefly, and half of Battlestar Galactica. I have to thank Farscape for being the reason I got into sci-fi. Now, all of these series are among my favorites to watch.

With the release of this compilation with great bonus content at an affordable price, it is definitely a series worth checking out for any sci fi fanatic. The drawback of this collection is the Peacekeeper Wars, the supposed Season 5, is sold separately due to licensing issues. But it is available for a low price as well. Overall, expect to pay around 70 bucks total for this collection.",1260144000,,3748,4.812111801242236
2624864,4,B000GY75JE,"I loved this series from the moment the show premired. I even remember critiquing the changes made to costuming and make-up for the second season. The complete series was something I had to jump at

For the price it is an outstanding deal, especially for all for 4 seasons. However anyone buying this should know it lacks The Peacekeeper Wars, the conclusion of the series. So it is not the complete collection, but very very close and for less the $10 for The Peacekeeper Wars it is an outstanding deal for any SciFi fan.

I like the packing, each season is contained in it is own case, with normally 6 DVDs per season and 4 episodes per DVD.

Video: Seems to look as good as if not better than the first season on DVD I bought way back when it was first released.
Audio: Has 5.1 surround and 2.0., so far it looks like there are commentaries from the cast and crew for each show. **Edit only 31 of the 88 shows in the set have commentaries. Video looks as good as the first season dvd I bought years ago, possibly slightly better. Although the A&E set has a also available in Dolby sound reminder that came up in the corner of the screen for the first episode that the original dvd doesn't have.

I'll update this as I go through the shows, It may earn a rating higher than 4 stars however lacking the PK War may hurt it in the end.",1259971200,4,1334,4.260869565217392
2624865,5,B000GY75JE,"For those who bought the AVN version of this know that buying each season in separate Volumes was expensive and annoying,instead of paying $35 for season one, one would pay $20 for 3-4 episodes...very lame. I thank the distributors here for having some common sense on releasing the complete series in one comprehensive Volume and not a bigillion. As for the review that said this was too expensive im pretty sure that $67 is a awesome deal, so you buy from Bestbuy all you want and pay $127 and wait 1-2 weeks for delivery...yes I just checked their site a min ago.

As for the show itself, its an amazing show with the most loyal Sci-Fi fans on Earth. For those who aren't to familiar with the behind the scenes aspect, this show was actually cancelled at the end of the 4th season very abruptly. the were literally filming the last episode when they found out that their producers pulled their funding. What they didn't expect was the incredible reaction from this shows fan base. after months of protests and internet posts and fund raisers, the fans literally forced a Ending to the Story which launched the production of Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars, which brought a non-cliff hanger, full and highly fitting ENDING to the series. Not to mention the cast was fun and awesome. Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Gigi Edgley, Wayne Pygram...etc. The chemistry these characters displayed was incredible and rare and I am sad to see this show end. Also, at the time of the show the special effects and props this show used was very innovative and fun. I, as well as probably every other guy that liked this show loved Chiana's blue/gray Nebari girl look.",1259712000,5,1647,4.71875
2624866,5,B000GY75JE,"I was incredibly excited to see this as a pre-order and bought it at that price. Then it went up, as expected. NOW it's HALF the pre-order price???? Amazon, stop taking our money like this, not when we DON'T have it to spend.

This is an FANTASTIC show cut too short. I would never have thought that I would be so invested in ""muppets,"" but this show made me forget they WEREN'T actually ""human"" actors. To not spoil for those who have not had the pleasure of watching this superb program, the possible reason it was cut short too soon was the third season.

Season's one and two take the viewer on a wild and highly enjoyable ride - very thoughtful and insightful, as the best Sci-Fi does. Tackles subjects such as war, racism, sexism, good vs evil and how close those two can sometimes be blurred.

Season three, oddly, was a very strange season, and while a devoted, if not fanatic, fan of the show, it was a bit of a trial for me to watch each episode and figure out WHY the writers were going in such an odd direction.

Thankfully, the fourth season went back to the wonderful values of the first two seasons, adding and subtracting a number of characters. This show did not hold to expectations that the major characters are ""always safe"" and not a ""red shirt"" character.

With the major cliffhanger at the end of the season four, suddenly we fans - and the actors - found out the show had been cancelled, and everyone was left with a major ""climatic ending"" for this journey we had followed for four years.

While I've read that PEACE KEEPERS WAR is not included in this boxed set, it is an excellent ending for such intense characters, and gave us, the viewers, a senses of closer (though still not as good as having a Fifth season, of course!).

On the subject of Amazon's outrageous price fluctuations on EVERYTHING, daily on many items in my cart, THIS is the most I've ever seen in such a dramatic difference. I've even tried to see if they would refund my card when the price had changed within a few days of purchasing items. NOPE, they WANT us to take the time and effort to send it back (we have to pay s/h, THEN it will be refunded, just to make it even that more difficult). Obviously, they know that most people -heck, almost everyone - is not going to go through that effort. I surely have not, but that is due to being disabled and the extreme process it takes for me to get to the post office and package everything, insure it, etc.

AMAZON, this is extremely frustrating, and during this time when people are trying to save every penny they can, while STILL trying to have SOME fun in their lives, this is somewhat irresponsible. Yes, I realize AMAZON is a BUSINESS and in the business of making money. I find that this, though, is taking it much too far.

For anyone who has not seen this program, IF you can get it at this price, do so - if you are a major SCI FI fan, you probably will not be disappointed. AND, if you are, you can always sell it back to Amazon - there WILL be folks wanting this!

2624867,5,B000GY75JE,"I first started watching this program somewhere in the Second Season during its initial run on the SyFy Channel at the urging of my wife, who had been an avid viewer since day one.  I had seen the Pilot when it was first broadcast, but never watched with regularity (at the time I was working a lot of overtime on Friday nights).  I did come away from the Pilot very impressed by what appeared to be a great premise, excellent special effects, and potentially some great characters.  Eventually my Friday evening schedule cleared up and once I started watching a couple of episodes I was completely hooked.

There is a definite 4 year story arc here; most of the episodes do tie together as the later seasons demonstrate.  I won't elaborate on all the details of the program, mainly because there are many reviews here that do just that.  What I will discuss is the quality of the box set that A&E has released, and has done an outstanding job of packaging and remastering the episodes.  I had collected the old ADV releases over the years, and they did a good job of reproducing very good audio and video for the most part.  What this set has done is go WAY beyond anything that has been on DVD previously.  I don't know if this is the case, but it certainly looks as if A&E did a complete makeover on the video and audio on this set, and it is nothing short of SPECTACULAR.

Some quick notes about this wonderful package:

VIDEO: These episodes are presented in their original aspect ratios of 4:3 for Seasons 1-3 and 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen for Season 4.  Do not be mislead by other reviewers who claim that the final season of the show (which was indeed the only one filmed in widescreen) is not in its proper format.  The quality of the video is STUNNING: details of all levels of color jump out at you, and the detail in close-ups and special effects are truly amazing.  (A note here: I watched this on an Oppo BD-83 Blu Ray player which upscales standard DVDs to 1080i).  The video is so good, I would swear I was watching a Blu Ray at times; THAT's how good it is.  It is a remarkable improvement from the ADV releases of a few years ago (which up until the release of this set, were fetching a hefty price on eBay).  I truly was stunned at the video...I don't think this show ever looked this good.

AUDIO: One word: phenomenal.  The 5.1 mix totally immerses you in the story.  All speakers and the sub-woofer are used perfectly and to to any extremes.  The ADV releases had a very good 5.1 soundtrack, but the new A&E version has absolutely jaw dropping audio.  Yes, it is THAT good.

PACKAGING: 5 ""sets"" of DVDs gathered in one glossy box keeping them all together.  Each Season has its own ""set"" with the final set being reserved for a number of special features (""making of"" documentaries, mostly).  The other Special Features as promised in the description of the set here, are scattered throughout the various discs.  I wish the glossy box was a bit more sturdy and easier to access the sets (do you open from the left or right?  you decide).  A minor quibble though compared to the overall satisfaction I've gotten so far from this new A&E release.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Farscape"" is truly an incredible show with excellent writing and some fine acting throughout its 4 year run.  It would have been nice to have the final 3 hour installment ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" (which somewhat neatly ties up and concludes the series) included in the box, but rights issues prevented that from happening.  You can certainly buy it separately on Amazon (and you REALLY must do so in order to see the conclusion of the show) and keep it next to this on your shelf.  Speaking of which, the amount of shelf space saved with this package compared to the original 2 disc ADV volumes is incredible.  Even if you own every ADV release like I do, this set is more than worth getting.  The video and audio are markedly improved (even though it is never mentioned that the episodes are remastered, one look and you will be able to tell in an instant); and it truly does make a HUGE difference compared with the original ADV releases.  The aforementioned amount of shelf space saved is indeed a plus.

Overall, 5 stars for the quality of the show, and this incredible new release with remastered video and audio.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1259452800,670,4322,4.52319587628866

It's all about Jon Chichton and friends pursued by peacekeepers and scarrans for the knowledge of the wormhole Jon possesses. The DVDs were discountinued by ADV Films(one of the anime license companies) because of some bankruptcy issues. Since it's now licensed by A&E Home Video it's back on DVD which is great.

Anyway, as for Farscape, I think this has some of the best acting and by far many of the most interesting and varied plots, thanks to the writers; of course some seem rehash of older plots, but many are new and unique, such as having a pregnant ship.  I like Ben Browder, but he seems sometimes silly and way over the top emotionally, not as balanced as the other actors; I suspect he'll never get close to an Oscar;  he was not improved in Stargate SG1, so I thinks it is him, not the writers.  Claudia Black on the other hand is very good both on Farscape and on SG1; she has a great delivery and a good sense of humor.  The major irritating thing about the show was Rigel, but it always seems that all shows have to have some disgusting, stupid, selfish oaf.  If that puppet had been killed off within the first few episodes, the series would have been so much better.",1259107200,,1036,4.319587628865979
2624874,5,B000GY75JE,"First, to those of you that are upset that this isn't widescreen, let me say that is because it wasn't filmed in widescreen until season 4. They would have to cut the tops/bottoms off the images to do that (you could just do that with your own remote, if you wanted). In fact, most TV shows weren't filmed in widescreen until recently.

I will also note that I have several TV series, and have yet to find any of them with subtitles available. Yes, maybe that would be a nice touch, but, yes, it surely would increase costs.

I have the original DVDs, so I can't review this newer set, and since I see some are saying the audio is messed up now, I will pass. I did stick my DVDs into DVD cases that hold 6 disks each, so that helped a tad on space.

Also, note, to those with youngsters in the room, there are some scenes that parental guidance is strongly suggested (this was a cable show, after all).

This show had been reportedly canceled because the Henson company and SciFi (at the time) couldn't agree on a new contract. A shame, as season 4 was one of their best-rated years. Ahhh, what do they say about the love of money?  heh",1259020800,2,1136,4.265116279069767

2624879,2,B000GY75JE,"For anyone who already owns the first DVD sets...

I read all the reviews on Amazon before I bought this set, especially focusing on the lower ratings, to see what the negative aspects where. The 2 reviews with a
rating of ""1 star"" outlined Amazon vs. Best Buy prices, and the fact that this box set has no Subtitles. Since none of the reviews covered what I wanted to know,
I'm including them here for anyone else who might be looking for the same information.

Positive aspects of this DVD Set: Space Saver - The Best Buy boxed set comes with the Peacekeeper Wars, as well as the four seasons, and takes up about a tenth
of the space on the shelf as the first DVD set, and about a fourth of the shelf space of the Starburst edition DVD set.

Negative aspects of this DVD Set:
(1) As mentioned - No subtitles.
(2) The background audio has been messed with and is brought slightly into the foreground, thus actually masking MORE of the dialog, made worse by the lack of
Subtitles to make up for missing more of the dialog.
(3) All Seasons are Full Screen, but the Peacekeeper Wars is Widescreen. In the age of 55-inch flat panel LCD HDTVs costing under $2000, someone really needs to
ask the question: ""Why the hell would anyone release a show in Full Screen anymore?"" Is it too much to ask for that the production / distribution companies to go
find the original 35mm film exposure negatives and put in the effort to make this a DVD box set worth buying?

I also noted that someone mentioned in a review that they would wait for the Blue-ray Box set. I say why? Why pay twice the price for such a little gain in video
clarity, especially if the same mistake is made and it's released again as Full Screen. I'll give you an example. Star Trek: The Original Series is out on Blue-ray
(Full Screen). The fact that Blue-ray discs are formatted to 1080i means nothing because the film quality used during the filming of the original series 50 years
ago, even when digitally re-mastered, is only so good. Get regular DVD and a 1080i upconverting DVD player - Sony has a few around $80.

So OK, Farscape was filmed much more recently, but the principle is the same. If I have a Widescreen TV, I want a widescreen picture. Why pay a more expensive
price for a Blue-ray if it only used as much of the screen as regular DVD. Also, in this case (if you already own the original box set or Starburst DVD sets),
why pay for a TV show for a second time if there are no improvements, and a decline in audio quality? The answer is that you don't. I bought this and I'll keep
it as a back-up set, but whenever I get in the mood to watch this show again, I'll be watching my original DVD set.

I can only hope that this review reaches enough people that maybe it gets to someone high enough to authorize a re-release in a Widescreen format, and not pull
a George Lucas - Example: The original ""unaltered"" Star Wars Trilogy is still not available in a FORMATTED FOR WIDESCREEN TV edition (OK, so where is the Zoom
button on this remote?).

OK, I'm done ranting. Since this DVD set had 1 positive aspect, and because if you read the rating classification for 1-star it says ""I hate this item"", I give
it a 2-STAR rating.

I will admit that if you don't own an earlier DVD release of this series, then Best Buy's $70 price can't be beat.",1258675200,32,3317,4.330112721417069

This review pertains to the dvd's themselves. I'm not going into all the plot stuff. Trust the reviewers here at Amazon. It's good and I would put it in the top 5 must own scifi shows.

I bought this set for two reasons.
1. The original owners of Farscape (ADV) did a horrible job with the menu's.
2. The ADV dvds are single layered take up alot of shelf space.

But, A&E fixed all that stuff. The menu's are vastly improved and user friendly. The disks are single sided dual layered with 4 eps per disk. There are 5 total dvd cases. The only downside is that there are no subtitles and Peacekeeper Wars wasn't included with my set. Some sets from Best Buy included PK Wars.

Who knows what the price will be next week. It is such a beautifully made set, so sturdy & sleek. All of you fans do not buy this at Amazon until the price goes down. Go to Best Buy!!!

Just back to add another comment. Now that I have started watching season 1 of Farscape, I can only say that this dvd set is PERFECT!!!
Perfect discs, beautifully made cases. It is well worth the wait for this!!!",1258416000,,557,4.304761904761905
2624885,5,B000GY75JE,"I am a huge Farscape fan, but will not purchase this through Amazon. Best Buy is listing this product at $69.99 and will include the Peacekeeper Wars dvd discs as a Best Buy exclusive. A much better deal!",1258416000,,204,4.394736842105263
2624886,5,B000GY75JE,"I have this series on the original DVDs that were coming out while the show still aired on the Sci-Fi channel. I don't remember the brand name but I think I bought a lot of them in 2 episode packages. But I never had any problems with the DVDs so I guess I was just a lucky consumer. But I heartily agree that this was one of the best science fiction shows ever shown on TV. The actors are all very talented, the characters are well developed and multi-dimensional and the stories are original and exciting. I guess the one thread that to some degree tied most of the episodes together was the burgeoning romance betwee Creighton and Aeryn Sun. You just had to watch to see what was happening between those two. I never had any problems with the puppet characters. In fact I thought Rigel was hilarious. I was startled when the cancellation of this series was announced. The Sci-Fi channel seems to have a habit of cancelling the good shows yet unabashedley promoting the dreck they keep on the air. That said, I would highly recommend this series to anyone who likes not only science fiction but a good, solid, entertaining show.",1258416000,2,1130,4.517073170731707
2624887,5,B000GY75JE,"I only recently started watching Farscape after a friend convinced me. I had just finished Stargate and figured that nothing could beat that in terms of an all around sci fi show... i was definitely wrong. Farscape is an amazing series that creates a whole new formula for how a sci fi show should be done. Not only is it a show that has some sort of philosophical meaning its episodes that challenge you to think while watching (like other sci fi shows), it is also a show that can do this while having fun at the same time! The acting is top notch and what these people did with a third of the budget that most shows get is absolutely outstanding. This show is an absolute GEM and i highly recommend it to anyone.. not just sci fi fans!

Farscape is a show that will be dear to me for the rest of my life.",1258416000,7,807,4.173076923076923
2624888,5,B000GY75JE,"Ok not much of a review other than its such a great SciFi series. Amazing environments, compelling storylines, and creatures they create mostly withOUT CGI - aliens and creatures from makeup, prosthetics, and pupets may lack in someways but give me them over the blended-in no-touch CGI characters (JarJar) any day.

Its been very hard (impossible) for several years to find seasons 1-4 which have been out of print and out of Netflix for some time. Admittedly I just stumbled upon this a day before release and have put my order in - a must for your SciFi library.

Oh...and Claudia Black in her Peacekeeper uniform..always priceless.",1258329600,,635,4.925233644859813
2624889,5,B000GY75JE,"This series is just plain ""AWESOME""

SCI-FI did cancel it tho, stating the cost of production was too much.

The characters are well thought thru and the idea of human beings on the far side of the galaxy, (in my mind) isn't all that far fetched. The costumes and backdrops are wonderfully done.

I say if you hadn't seen this you need to check it out. This is another one of the great series I have in my SCI-FI Libary.",1257984000,,420,4.225
2624890,5,B000GY75JE,"We'll keep it simple. Farscape ended way before it's time. True sci-fi fans know the value of this series. I admit that I am a little bit of a sci-fi geek, but even my grandparents loved this show. Sony has to know that they have a potential goldmine on their hands. Maybe with any kind of luck we'll get sony to partner up with someone to revamp the series (wishful thinking), but the least they can do is bring on the fully loaded blu-ray series, and extras!!!",1257897600,2,462,4.32183908045977
2624891,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape can possibly be considered the best Sc-Fi series to hit TV in this era. Bold and brassy, it also fleshes out each and every character in a way most TV show(even non Sci-Fi)have never come close to.

Sure the series had its occasional missteps, but they're easily overlooked when one views the series as a whole. The SciFi Channel, which aired it, criticized it for being too serialized (i.e. thought provoking), but that was its strength. It built upon itself layer after layer and I for one, still miss those Friday evenings anxiously awaiting a new episode.

Although bittersweet, its great to see this new A&E edition set coming out. Its bittersweet, because Farscape wasn't just a show, it was an experience, and unfortunately it had to come to an end too soon.",1257811200,,774,4.768656716417911

2624895,5,B000GY75JE,"That's right Star Trek Fans, you heard me. Farscape is so beyond anything that Star Trek has ever done that even the Trek movies cannot compare.
Unfortunately, the Sci-Fi channel made a big mistake by canceling the show due to budget problems with the series. The took money away from this series to finance the steaming pile of crap that became known as the miniseries called ""Taken."" I think that they are forgetting the simple fact that Farscape made the Sci-fi channel a viable station.
Great characters and effects for a show and most of all (something that is missing in most TV and movies these days) incredible originality.  These tales are so breathtakingly new to anyone who watches this show.  I have yet to meet someone who has watched the first three episodes and then not become a Farscape addict.
Either way, snatch up all of the episodes in this DVD Box set now!!  You never know when this will go away!!

To me, the genre that benefits the most from Blu-Ray technology is science fiction, and I can't even imagine how brilliant and beautiful Moya would look on my TV.  As visually stunning as Farscape was for its time, I can't believe that a Blu-Ray release isn't forthcoming.  Say the word, and I'll place my order.",1257120000,2,547,4.797872340425532

From the begining to the end of the series, it kept you wanted more. There have been alot of shows that have gone off the air before it's time, but I never was as upset about those as I was when Farscape ended. I love scifi and there have been alot of shows that I enjoyed, but none of them have or had what Farscape does or did.  It was a well planned and executed show.
This show doesn't miss. It give everything: love, lost, hope, friendship, desire, pain, triumph, fear and most importanly, Family.

Rumor has it that there are webisode with D'argo Sun Crichton in the works that are/maybe hopefully will jump start a new Farscape series. I hope so.

Great stories, dialog and visuals, and the chemistry between the actors is impressive.  No matter how fantastic the situation, improbable the situation, the actors are able to make you believe.  Its not an effort to suspend your disbelief with this show and to just enjoy the characters living their lives.

With so many shows lasting longer than they should, this is one that was ""forced"" before its time off the airwaves.

It will be a treat to revisit and watch the series again and a recommended joy to anyone interested in character development, wild stories and some of the best action/comedy scenes ever shown on the small screen.",1255996800,,754,4.821705426356589
2624900,5,B000GY75JE,"A good friend introduced me to ""Farscape"" and it is a place that I enjoy visiting. I borrowed his DVDs to watch and I was immediately compelled to start my own collection. Even though I have most of the series now, I am thrilled to get it in a complete set. It is worth it.  The show is a unique and amazing series.  Easy to re-watch over and over.

""Farscape"" is about an American pilot that ends up on a ship of aliens from other planets. They are a fun group of characters that end up becoming a family. You learn about the history of each and how they came to be on this ship. Each episode is an adventure. One special aspect of the series is the presence of muppets. Brian Henson, son of Jim Henson, is one of the producers. ""Farscape"" is one of a kind science fiction.

Another reason this show is so special is the great storytelling.  One episode can make you laugh and another can pull your senses.  You learn to really care about these people-this family. The show takes you to so many wonderful places and experiences.

The series was sadly cancelled suddenly-fans wanted it to continue but it didn't. I am glad the show had its closure in the movie, The Peacemakers-excellent as the series and fun to watch.

2624902,5,B000GY75JE,"I discovered this show about two years after it was canceled. I had heard of it before but did not give it the time of day due to a snobby attitude towards the sci fi genre. After Stargate SG-1 was canceled (which also became an unexpected love of mine) I was looking for a fix. I was bored and found some episodes of Farscape posted online. After the first episode I was hooked. I could not stop watching. Every episode left me wanting more.
Finally after spending half the day watching various episodes and reading a lot of episode summaries, I had to purchase the series. I found seasons 2, 3, and 4 fairly easy to find for a reasonable price on ebay and amazon, but season 1 was either very elusive or very expensive. The dvd's, while professional are not the high quality we have today. The packaging is bulky also. I share this because this is an amzing thing to have the collection all together with high quality production value and amazing extras.
Yes there are puppets, it is Jim Henson - BUT - it is not a show for children. This show made me see Jim Henson in a whole new light. PLEASE, PLEASE do not be put off by the puppets or make up. It is a crazy sci fi show but it is NOT hokey like Andromeda or Cleopatra or other corny ill-advised sci fi.
I became such a huge fan of Ben Browder and Claudia Black, whom were also on Stargate SG-1 for it's final seasons.
The acting, make up, puppetry is all superb. This show was filmed in Australia which gives it a different feeling but as you will see in the special features, the cast and crew were extremely hard working, dedicated and amazing, which shows emmensly on screen. They also had to do a lot with a small budget. I wish the shows in the US would portray the same work ethic and dedication when they have ten times the budget.
Do not be surprised though when you watch the final episode. It does end with a huge cliffhanger. BUT it is resolved in the seperatly sold Peacekeepers Wars. (Which P.S. is also a must have)
This repackaging of a show, which ended before it should have, is a gift. I normally would not repurchase something I already own but I am definetly buying this.",1255219200,2,2148,4.319306930693069
2624903,5,B000GY75JE,The above reviews have better covered this series than I could. I just wanted to chime in and agree that Farscape is an EXCELLENT series that is not to be missed. You won't regret adding this show to your collection.,1255132800,,216,4.425
2624904,5,B000GY75JE,"It's so great that this unforgettable series is now available in a ""complete"" box set, although the mini-series finale, Peacekeeper Wars, is NOT included here.  The good news is that you CAN buy Peacekeeper Wars separately, and I would urge you to do so. If there was ever a series - sci-fi or otherwise - which deserves to be watched from start to finish, Farscape is it.

SPOILER WARNINGS GALORE!!!

It has been said that the best science fiction is always about Earth. While most episodes of Farscape take place in galaxies far away, its tie to Earth is always maintained in the person of the main character, astronaut and physicist John Crichton. Furthermore, Crichton's Earth is contemporary. Earth as we know it right now.

The opening episode's first image is of Crichton watching the sun rise over the familiar shuttle launch pad at Cape Canaveral. He is about to board the shuttle in a space module of his own design, to test a theory he's just developed regarding propulsion outwith Earth's gravity. He figures this will be a routine flight and test - he's been up in the shuttle a couple of times before - but Crichton is in for what can only be mundanely described as a 'life-changing moment.'

No sooner has he entered space and begun the trial in his module, than Crichton is engulfed by a wormhole - a tornado in space - which appears out of nowhere between the Earth and the Moon. He and his module are shot down the wormhole's funnel in a gut-churning sequence, then spat out the other end into the middle of a space battle, elsewhere in the Universe!

The shocked Crichton and his module are scooped up by a huge ship called a Leviathan, populated by only three escaped convicts - (1) a bald woman with blue skin, (2) a male warrior with tentacles, a loud voice and a short temper, and (3) a selfish little despot who resembles a hairy slug riding a pillow! Turns out these three convict aliens have just stolen the ship and are being pursued and fired upon by the current rulers of their bit of space, a group of human-like aliens called Peacekeepers.

Of course Crichton's first goal - after survival! - is to get back 'home.' However, as the series progresses, this goal becomes more complicated and less clear-cut. As the old song says: how can you keep them happy down on the farm, after they've seen Berlin? (And received Translator Microbes??)

Through Crichton as 'Everyman' we get to watch humans interacting with 'aliens' who, amusingly and disturbingly, aren't actually all that interested in Earth or humans. In fact, most of them regard Crichton as a weak specimen, annoying and lacking intelligence. They have no idea where Earth might be, and they don't much care.

We certainly identify with Crichton and his trials and tribulations with these alien societies, but it turns out Crichton is NOT Everyman - not even EveryAmerican. Crichton is an individual human being with his own strengths and weaknesses. As the series moves toward conclusion, we slowly realise our mistake in believing Crichton is Everyman, and begin to see where this will lead us.

The central story arc revolves around Crichton's search for Earth and the meaning of 'home' and 'humanity.' Farscape's other major story arc deals with the insanity of weapons of mass destruction, an issue Crichton must confront and take responsibility for, albeit against his will.  Another major subplot is a most believable and heartbreaking love story between Crichton and the troubled Peacekeeper deserter named Aeryn Sun.

All story arcs get resolved by the end (in the stand-alone DVD Peacekeeper Wars), I'm happy to report. Indeed, I can't recollect any TV series - sci-fi or not - which has been so strongly focused for five (almost!) seasons, and so satisfactorily concluded.

Season One is vital for understanding the series, and is totally enjoyable to watch, but unlike so many other TV series, Farscape actually gets stronger season by season. Season Four provides the most memorable and shattering moments of the lot, with the exception of the wonderful final scene in Peacekeeper Wars, which actually finishes the story. Many other series start strongly then fizzle out. Not this one. It's a corker, from Day One.

Farscape was meant to have had five complete seasons, but the Sci-Fi channel pulled the plug on production after the fourth season wrap, due to 'high production costs.' Fortunately the channel was later persuaded by Farscape's appalled fan base to at least finish the story with the truncated 4-hour Peacekeeper Wars. It's a bummer that there is no more new Farscape to come, but what is contained in this particular collection will provide 88 hours of mesmerising viewing, as well as many subsequent years of contemplation, re-viewing and debate.  Add Peacekeeper Wars to your collection as well ...and believe me, after watching the first 4 seasons you'll WANT to! ...and that's roughly 92 hours of perfect TV.

I can't recommend Farscape highly enough. Many people who do not normally watch science fiction have been hooked by this series - providing they started watching at the beginning and understand where Crichton is coming from. Why? Because the story is believable and accessible, despite its strange locale.

You love Crichton immediately, because of his wacky sense of humour, his intelligence, his compassion, and ability to roll with the punches. The other characters wow your socks off, including the most compelling villain (Scorpius) ever committed to film. No character in Farscape is ever what they seem to be at first, and none of the myriad plots end the way you expect. Take nothing for granted and keep an open mind! Another lesson to learn from Farscape.

Farscape still makes me cry, sweat, gulp, laugh my head off (figuratively), jump out of my chair with glee (literally, at least twice!), and THINK THINK THINK - every time I watch it. All this and complete entertainment as well? Can anyone ask for more?

Do shell out for this magnificent Farscape box set, and then buy the separate Peacekeeper Wars to finish off. I know it seems expensive as a one-off purchase, but you will watch this show again and again.  You'll never be sorry you bought it.",1254787200,36,6196,4.882857142857143
2624905,4,B000GY75JE,"Alright, so when this show first came on, I saw it as a strange idea with latent psycho-sexual undertones. So I tended to go in and out on it. The shows I would watch didn't make much sense in the ""grand scheme"" because the story arc, which one reviewer mistakenly thinks didn't really start until Season 3, didn't make sense to me. In the final season, I began watching on broadcast TV the last four or five episodes as the story began to come together, come to the conclusion. It made sense because they were answering questions and bringing all the threads together. It ended in a really distrubing way.

Then ""Peacekeeper Wars"" came out. I watched that, too. And everything sort of made sense, given that I hadn't really watched 90% of the series.

So I went out and bought the whole bloody series. I bought most seasons used, so paid far less than the outrageous retail price (even on Amazon it was over a C note). Then I sat down to watch the whole story unfold from the beginning - for the first time, really - without prejudice or preconceived ideas...

As the story unfolded for me, I began to understand. I began to enjoy it. And all the psycho-sexual undertones weren't exactly what I thought. Yes, there were some ""uncomfortable"" moments for me, but as the story continued to unfold as I watched, even these uncomfortable episodes began to have greater context, so became less so as a result.

The character development of even the recurring characters (some only appearing a few times) seemed to be considered where, in some series, they remain two dimensional props to further the story, being foils, just the bad guys or what have you. I liked these little details.

And speaking of details, the props, the backdrops, the set pieces all seemed to be very well developed and lacking no reasonable details. The visual details are something, as an artist, I really notice. Does this ""set"", this ""location shot"", look ""real"" enough? Stuff like that is important for the ""immersion"" experience.

So I watched through the whole series, and the Peacekeeper Wars, and I have to tell you, it was a very satisfying experience.

Is Farscape the ""BEST SERIES EVER""? If I were a harsh critic, I could say that Farscape just repackaged stories we've all seen before, both within and outside sci-fi. But since there are only so many ""story/plot lines"", we have to get beyond the ""retread"" rhetoric and get down to the telling of the story itself. In this, Farscape was good storytelling, period. That alone makes it worthwhile. You come to care about characters you don't like at first. You come to despise characters you thought you'd love. You feel the betrayal, the anger, the love, everything, along with them. We live vicariously through them - and that is what good storytelling should do, draw you into being a part of the tale. Farscape succeeds in this for me.",1254268800,21,2869,4.703187250996016
2624906,5,B000GY75JE,"Having missed ""Farscape"" when it originally ran on the Sci-Fi Channel, I hunted down a hideously expensive boxed-set of Season 1 a few years back and man, was I ever impressed.  So impressed, in fact, that I shelled out the dough for the remaining three seasons.

Basically, astronaut John Crichton goes into a wormhole, comes out lost in space and adventure ensues.  Of course, you've got to overlook the fact that everyone in this new section of the universe speaks English.  Accept the premise, accept the bit.

The production values of the show are superb, with great Muppet creatures and equally superb special effects.  Truly an adventurous series with a natural mix of the serio-comedy most anyone experiences in life.  Great characters, great scripts, great overall storyline.  There are a lot of fantastic things going on with farfetched science, etc., but it all makes for an enjoyable ride.

Don't let the Muppet thing scare you away.  One of the main characters--Dominar Rygel XVI--is a Muppet and, I have to say, he looks fabulous.  And he's funny.  It's not like you're watching ""The Dark Crystal"" or ""Pigs in Space.""  Most of the creatures on the show are costumed humans with various prosthetics applied as necessary.

The series was intended to be five seasons long, but was cancelled after four.  The good news is a mini-series was produced a few years later to wrap up the series in a nice little bow:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars</a>.

2624907,5,B000GY75JE,"I have been hooked on the brilliance that is Jim Henson's Muppets since Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock as a child, and found a love for SciFi with my father who was a long time Trekkie. I started watching Farscape from when it first came out on TV, and I was hooked from the get go. They had brilliantly melded two of my favorite television genres and added a splash of comedy (albeit cheezy at times).

It was depressing when the series ended so abruptly, without a real ending or a final season, and loyal fans like myself needed closure. Thus, the Peacekeeper Wars was born. Thank goodness for that. A while later I decided to see if they'd come out with the seasons on DVD. Woe is me when I realized all too late that the Farscape boxed sets were out of print and that to buy them I'd have to pay upwards of $300 for the whole series. I just happened to look Farscape up again tonight, as I do from time to time (after deciding that I cannot afford to burn $300 like that), and there it was in its entirety!

2624913,5,B000GY75JE,"About Frelling Time!!!  This show is the one of the sci-fi shows ever before I got into Star Wars, Star Trek or Battlestar Gallactica, I watched Farscape every episode was an adventure.  The cast was great the guest stars always played their parts to perfection.  Thank you A&E studios wow suprised they ended up getting the rights but thank you again.  If you like Sci-Fi or any of the Movies or Shows I mentioned above mos. def. check this out.

p.s. To all the BSG fans the whole idea for Frak came from Farscape paving the way.",1251417600,3,531,4.43298969072165
2624914,5,B000GY75JE,"A year or two ago, when I heard that the rights to FARSCAPE had been sold and would be rereleased on the A&E imprint, I was delighted.  I bought the entirety of the series on the way-too-expensive Starburst edition, which was, as expensive as it was, vastly cheaper than the original DVDs.  FARSCAPE as originally released was one of the most expensive series ever sold on DVD.  I've lent my DVDs out to several people as part of an effort to help more people learn about this wonder series.  Now I can recommend that people buy it.

FARSCAPE is, after only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FIREFLY, my all time favorite Sci-fi series.  It is unique in that women tend to love it as much as men (or perhaps I should say younger male viewers, who usually form a huge percentage of the Sci-fi demographic), largely because of the great character development that occurs on the show, and the main romance, which I honestly think is as grand and epic as any romance on any mainstream or nongenre series.  To this day, when TV Guide or Entertainment Weekly or other such mainstream publications do lists of the great TV romances of all time, people who do not know FARSCAPE are surprised and baffled to see John and Aeryn make the list.

In a way, it is amazing that I love this show so much.  It contains many of the things I most detest about Sci-fi series, such as aliens (in fact, the aliens in FARSCAPE are more extreme than usual because it was produced by the Jim Henson Company as a platform for putting some of its more extreme puppet creations before the public eye), pulse weapons, shields (""Shields down to 20%""), and what I call ""magic science,"" where something extraordinary takes place that beggars the laws of physics and some equally extraordinary scientific solution is proffered to set things right.  I hate these things!  But I forgave them in FARSCAPE because it got so many other things right.  Like what?  Well, primarily character development.  My complaint with all of the STAR WAR franchise series is that on all of them (with some exceptions like 7 of 9 or some of the characters in ST:DS9) there is no character development.  I love Jean-Luc Picard, but he is pretty close to the same character on the final episode as on the first.  Contrast that, say, with BUFFY, where every character has undergone an astonishing journey of transformation (e.g., just look atCordelia Chase in Season One, then where she was in Season Three, and then where she ended up in Season Three of ANGEL -- we'll just ignore Season Four of the latter).  D'Argo may be a huge alien with tentacles hanging from his head, but he becomes a rich, wonderfully nuanced character.  Aeryn Sun -- one of the great female heroes that TV has produced -- stars off as essentially a space nazi, but ends a complex, caring, passionate (despite herself) human being.  Scorpius is one of the great, most complex villains that television has produced, original in ways that only a few character in television have ever managed to be.  Moreover, the show tells a great story over the course of its four seasons.  The first two seasons it stays close to a standalone format, even while developing a longer term arc, but Seasons Three and Four develop a great long story arc.

Season Three.  What can you say about it?  On the Internet you often see lists of the greatest seasons of shows in TV history.  Season Three of FARSCAPE almost always makes such lists.  I don't want to give anything away by explaining why it is so great, since much of the joy is in the way the wonderfully original plot twists, but beginning with the wonderful resolution of the great cliffhanger ending Season Two through the heartbreaking twists and plot shockers from the middle of the season, to the new cliffhanger that ended the season, it was a season for the ages.  I've told friend that even if you don't like the first two seasons of FARSCAPE, it is worth watching just for Season Three.  Definitely one of the great seasons I've ever seen.

A lot of people did not give the series a shot because they were repulsed by the use of two animatronic puppets in the show.  I can understand this feeling, but it is not supported by an actual viewing of the show.  I never came to enjoy the smaller of the two main Muppets in the show, Rygel.  He was actually the more complex of the two Muppets, largely because his face was more expressive.  But I personally vastly preferred Pilot, a staggering huge puppet who nonetheless is enormously endearing in a way the small, unhuggable Rygel is not.  There are a few other animatronic puppets on the show, but these tow are the main ones.  I won't say everyone who gives the show will come to like Rygel, but I do think that Pilot is different, and I don't think even Rygel will alter how one feels about the show overall.  In other words, if you don't like this show, the Muppets won't be a factor.

One other thing that I very much love about this series is that it, like FIREFLY, features a nonmilitary ship.  All other space operas focus on military vessels or military installations.  The Star Treks, BABYLON 5, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (both the brilliant new version and the stinky old one), the Stargate franchise, SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, and many others, even RED DWARF.  Ka D'Argo is former military and even towards the end of the series Aeryn Sun comes across like a military officer, but the structure of the crew is that of civilians.

The main ship on the show, Moya, is one of the most delightful ships ever in Sci-fi.  A living ship who is symbiotically bonded with Pilot, she often has a mind of her own.  She is also as depicted on the show one of the most beautiful ships we've seen on TV, with the interiors of a gorgeous organic appearance.  The series was perhaps the first to benefit from advanced CGI.  Previous series such as BABYLON 5 had used CGI, but it was low resolution with flat surfaces and simply not very impressive.  In the second episode of FARSCAPE we see Moya rise from a lake to fly off into space, and it was, at that point, without question the most breathtaking use of CGI up to that point.  The show did not have an unlimited budget, but they managed to make the most of the show they had.  Filmed entirely in Australia, it is unquestionably the finest Sci-fi series ever made outside Hollywood or Vancouver.  And being set in Australia, they use a host of Australian actors not seen in many American productions, though they are seen in films and TV series made in Australia and New Zealand.  The result is a string of unfamiliar actors and filming locations.  Sometimes the wretched American accents of some of the actors will wear on you, but by and large the whole series has a great feel to the cast and guest stars.

If you love quality television, you really need to see this series.  If you love Sci-fi, you need to see it several times.  And if you just love a great romance, you can't do better than this.  And luckily you can now own this great series without having to take out a mortgage on your house or condo.",1251331200,291,7063,4.549485352335709
2624915,5,B000GY75JE,"... now it's only tied for best with BSG.

This show is amazing.  Funny, well-acted, hyper-intelligent, reliant upon the user to be smart and stay caught up through numerous off-the-wall plot-framing devices.

Listen, if the puppets put you off, do yourself a favor and give it 8 or 10 episodes.  By then, you'll have either accepted the puppets as real characters (yes, it shocked me, too), or, okay, your suspension of disbelief has too high a threshold for this show.  If I were betting, with each new viewer willing to give the 8 or 10 episodes, I'd bet on ""real"" every single time.

Finally, there's a reason that Ben Browder and Claudia Black were reunited following the demise of ""Farscape"" ... they're excellent together.  And while their run on ""SG-1"" was okay, in ""Farscape"" they are amazing.

BTW (AKA ""finally, for real""), the commentaries are all well worth watching.",1251072000,,880,4.859060402684563
2624916,5,B000GY75JE,"To say I was sad when they cancelled the series would be a gross understatement, yet I should have know that Farscape, like Star Trek, would be killed off by people who were not ""Fans and Followers. As with Star Trek, I did everything I could to get Farscape reinstated and will continue to do so. Fans and followers of Farscape keep the faith and don't give up. Look what we did for Star Trek.
Yet, I am very happy to see the whole series is available now and I can hardly wait for my copy to arrive. As for The Peacekeeper Wars, I have it in my collection, but it only left me wanting more.",1251072000,4,592,4.112068965517241
2624917,5,B000GY75JE,"Farscape was a breath of fresh air for Sci-Fi on TV. It combined a rag-tag atmosphere of characters not found on any other show(Way earlier than Firefly). It had movie quality makeup and animatronics from the Henson folks who created the Muppets. It launched the careers for Ben Browler and Claudia Black. More importantly, Farscape showed that Sci-Fi doesn't have to maintain the sterile cruise ship atmosphere of Babylon 5, Star Trek Next Generation, DS9, Voyager or Enterprise to get a fan base. Farscape's only problem, was that it chose to evolve into a strictly linear story-line where every episode has a significant impact on the season as a whole. Diehard fans like me love this development, but new fans can't build loyalty to a show that they can't begin watching easily. As such, the Farscape fanbase remained flat, and the Sci Fi channel replaced Farscape's time slot with Stargate shows.

Ironies about Farscape:
-Claudia Black and Ben Browler eventually joined the cast of Stargate, the show that competed with and successfully defeated Farscape in the ratings game.

-John Crichton(played by Ben Browler), has a ghost of his nemesis Scorpious lurking in his head for half the show. Battlestar Galactica borrowed this idea when Six was lurking in Baltar's head, both consciously and in a dream state.",1250812800,8,1315,5.055299539170507
2624918,5,B000GY75JE,"So like many people I missed this show when it aired, being an avid Sci-Fi fan I wandered why; that is until I found how the SCI-FI channel treated this show...dreadful

But enough on that, this series takes you in a completely new direction from what most any series is based on. These people are not together by choice, and for the most part they hate eachother, at first at least. But the show drives on that struggle, and develops to the point, that you are not simply entertained for an hour or so, you find yourself actually caring what happens. You will flip from episode to episode, and from season to season.

This is my #1 for shows cut down way before their time.......

2624921,5,B000GY75JE,"""My name is John Crichton, an astronaut... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole... now I'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship -- a LIVING ship, full of strange alien life forms...""

From the very first episode onward, it's pretty obvious that ""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is no ordinary sci-fi series -- the characters are outlaws, the ship is alive, and distant galaxies are full of Muppets. Fortunately, it's not just unusual but brilliant -- full of irreverent humor, strange alien species, heart-pounding action and eerie sci-fi.

Astronaut John Crichton is planning to slingshot his experimental craft, Farscape One, as a one-small-step into interstellar exploration. Instead, he gets thrown through a wormhole, and ends up drifting in a firefight between a vast living prison ship called Moya and the hypermilitaristic Peacekeepers. Obviously, he wants to go home, but isn't sure how.

So he begins a journey with a gang of escaped criminals -- the priestess Zhaan, the bombastic warrior D'Argo, deposed dominar Rygel, and the prickly, surly ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun.  They gain a few new members of their crew (including Moya's weaponized baby and the seductive, rebellious Chiana), but also lose some valued friends and allies along the way.

As the series unfolds, the Moya crew encounter countless alien planets, where they deal with bizarre problems, individuals (mad scientists, vengeful Peacekeepers, and Ancients), and alien life-forms (shapeshifting space bugs!). And they must constantly dodge the Peacekeeper Forces, and later the cruel Scarrans -- including the Sebacean/Scarran Scorpius. The Scarrans want the wormhole secrets locked inside Crichton's head, and ancient beings are even more determined to keep his knowledge secret....

""Farscape: The Complete Series""  smashes apart the space opera mold, and puts it back together in its own style -- flying Muppets, an alien pilot grafted into Moya, squeaking insectile robots, Leviathans, and blue-skinned telepathic plant people. Yeah, it DOES sound cheesy -- but instead the Farscapeverse just ends up feeling colorful, diverse and sometimes horrifically dark. And fortunately, its promise is fulfilled by brilliant writing.

The series has lots of overarcing storylines twined with clever, intricate one-off episodes and solid personal subplots (mostly involving romance and revenge -- though thankfully it rarely gets soapy). And the dialogue is beyond awesome -- it's crammed with snappy dialogue, pop culture references (""How Batman was that!""), and alien slang words (""frelling"" and ""mivonks"" among others). Every episode has loads of clever, irreverent and wonderfully quotable lines (""I'm not fast enough, I am not alien enough, and you know what, there are people in the universe who don't like me!"").

And the cast is simply brilliant, especially since their characters evolve gradually through the series, revealing tragedies and hopes in the process. Ben Browder is great as the ""alien"" one, a seemingly ditzy astronaut with plenty of brains and sweet kookiness; Claudia Black's Aeryn makes a great love interest for him, as a hardnosed, disdainful ubersoldier who changes into a strong, passionate woman. Virginia Hey, Gigi Edgley, and Anthony Simcoe all give stellar performances as well -- and while Rygel and Pilot are technically played by Muppets, they are gloriously three-dimensional and expressive.

One thing to note: ""Farscape: The Complete Series"" ends on a massive cliffhanger because the Sci Fi Channel unexpectedly cancelled it, and ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" (the conclusive ending) apparently won't be included, since the rights belong to two different companies.

Thankfully, it has bucketloads of extras -- twenty-nine commentaries with actors, directors, Brian Henson; TV promos, slideshows, archival photos and clips; assorted conceptual scripts and art; deleted scenes; archival clips; and chitchats with the cast, crew, and fans. Also a whole bunch of featurettes and documentaries including ""In The Beginning,"" ""Making of a Space Opera"" and ""Inside Farscape: Save Farscape."" Whew!

""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is a cult sci-fi series that deserves to be watched again and again, especially with the new extras. Too bad the final miniseries isn't here.",1249776000,90,4297,5.513677811550152

8135342,5,B000GY75JE,This series really brings me back to my younger days when it used to air weekly on sci fi channel.  The protagonist of the story finds himself on the adventure of a life time and meets a lot of strange aliens and attempts to find his niche in this group.  It has some good humor and some great adventure and sticks to the classic style of sci fi of exploring ideas and meeting strange life.  If you are young may not be used to this brand of entertainment as sci fi is not the same anymore and tends to be about pushing sjw ideology with maybe a slight dash of pretentious entertainment.  This throws the pretentiousness out the window and attempts to immerse you in a bizarre universe that is willing to take risks.  Some risks seem to fall flat but others really take off and you get to see the characters evolve.
