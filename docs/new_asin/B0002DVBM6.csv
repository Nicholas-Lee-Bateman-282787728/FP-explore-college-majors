2080902,5,B0002DVBM6,"I enjoyed watching this and have myself already tried the easiest parts - wave, glide, uprock, popping. Maybe soon I'll try some other things shown on this. I've also personally emailed Mike Garcia and praised this video. If you want to learn this dance yourself or know how those people who entertain you at shows with this kind of dance do their moves, this video is a must and so are also any other volumes of this series. Currently I have volumes 1 and 2, and I have also heard that there is or is going to be a volume 3 as well to this series.",1003190400,6,548,4.179245283018868
2080903,4,B0002DVBM6,"This is a good and useful tape for everyone who wants to start and learn how to practicing break dance. Brings you back to the heroic eighties !!! However the quality of the tape is poor, looks like a 5 times copied version, its time to release on DVD.",996710400,10,252,4.163265306122449
2080904,5,B0002DVBM6,I thought this video was very helpful and awsome. It boosted my energy and strength. Before I had the video i could hardly dance. This video was very direct and step by step. I took me about 2 weeks to learn moves. If you wanna learn how to break dance get this video.,990230400,13,268,4.0754716981132075
8027005,1,B0002DVBM6,"It's been 13 years. I've followed every step, trained myself vigorously in the upstairs of my parents bedroom when I was a child and on the streets perfecting rhythm as well as my popping and locking techniques. Still no girlfriend, still can't dance and now I'm out $18.99 . What they don't tell you is that when you reach the ripe age of 39, you can't windmill without breaking your freaking leg. Not FAIR.",1492473600,,408,4.527027027027027

8027010,5,B0002DVBM6,"This dvd has been fun to use while teaching myself and a thirteen year old student how to break dance.  First of all, Mike Garcia shows the complete move, then he breaks it down into its simpler skill sets, then he shows it ""in action"".  His visual and oral directions are easy to follow, but beware, they often require extreme upper body strength, coordination and balance.  Be prepared to practice the preliminary skills often to develop the requisite strength and balance.  As the dvd warns, you attempt these moves at your own risk.  This dvd was well worth the investment.",1216080000,6,577,4.73
8027011,5,B0002DVBM6,"The step by step is engaging and easy to follow.
We'll be ordering the others in this series :D",1200441600,3,95,4.052631578947368
8027012,3,B0002DVBM6,"I've been breakin since the days when joust and tron were overflowing their coin buckets with bicentennial quarters. The card board on the street corner was my turn table and I was scratching human beats on that urban vinyl. I got a Beta VCR player, so I can play the tape - but the cover looks like its a winner!
Keep up the good work my man - tha breakin beats gotta come back to the streets!",1025654400,5,394,4.12987012987013
8027013,3,B0002DVBM6,"Well I purchased this video attempting to get my hands on any break dance video that existed.  When I received the video I was disappointed by the quality of production.  Mike does an excellent job in demonstrating the movies, but the video is extremely amatuer.  This video is strickly for novist and fresh to the floor beginners.  If you've been break dancing for any length of time, no matter how bad you are, their are more useful videos than this one.  Like I said though, this is great for the people who saw break dancing for the first last weekend at a party or club and decided they would like to participate.  If you know something about hip-hop dance already then look for a video called ""Basic Moves.""  This will give you a little clearer view on technique.  Keep Breaking!
