8593992,5,B00DJYK6LW,"My sole motivation for ordering this Blu-ray release was to get my hands on more Wagner ( I just discovered how brilliant and wonderful his music is this year :-)

His Wesendonck Lieder follows R.Strauss' tone poem Don Juan in the first half of this concert performance ... These five songs are lovely and Nina Stemme more than does them justice with her beautiful singing.  They last a shade under twenty minutes in total, but are nonetheless reason enough to buy this offering from EuroArts.  As an added bonus, so to speak, the third and fifth songs in the Wesendonck Lieder contain familiar strains from Tristan und Isolde.

Strauss' Don Juan here is lively and fun, while the Brahms Symphony #1 is majestic ... in short, Mariss Jansons brought out the best qualities in all three of the concert's selections.

But again, for myself, the highlight of the concert was Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder ... one can sit and listen to a Wagner opera for quite a number of minutes without hearing an aria-type of song ... these five lieder fulfill this sometimes too rare experience nicely.  They are as satisfying as anything else Wagner has written ( with the notable exception of the love duet and liebestod form Tristan & Isolde ).

The Blu-ray audio and video are first rate.",1381536000,,1272,4.754545454545455
8593993,4,B00DJYK6LW,"This release is an odd one, primarily due to the idiosyncratic style of Latvian conductor Mariss Jansons. He's had a long and distinguished career and is well represented in the Blu-ray format, but I have not had the opportunity to become familiar with his performances. Based on the evidence of this disc, he tends to luxuriate in the sound textures of the orchestra, especially when the famously sumptuous Vienna Philharmonic strings come into play. It creates a rather cinematic quality, and this approach serves him particularly well in the first two pieces on the program, Richard Strauss' ""Don Juan"" and Richard Wagner's ""Wesendonck Lieder.""

The tone poem ""Don Juan"" receives a somewhat eccentric reading, but a mesmerizing one. The greater transparency and clarity of the Blu-ray's DTS 5.0 audio accentuates the Vienna players' diaphanous waves of sound. For a composer like Strauss, who's so adept at highlighting the many colors of the orchestra, Jansons' style works beautifully. I could hear individual sounds that I had never noticed in the work before, including, near the end, a foreshadowing of the ""Salome"" finale Strauss was to compose years later.

This same quality Jansons puts to good use in the ""Wesendonck Lieder."" It provides Swedish soprano Nina Stemme with gorgeous orchestral support. Unfortunately, during the first song she encounters a couple of rough patches in the upper part of her range. But she hits her stride by the second song and acquits herself well from that point forward, albeit in a careful, contained way. Speaking of that cinematic effect I mentioned earlier, I was struck by how the beginning of ""Traume,"" the last song, reminded me of Bernard Herrmann's ""Vertigo"" theme. (The song served as the seed for ""Tristan und Isolde,"" which was officially Herrmann's inspiration.)

The disc concludes with Brahms' 1st Symphony, a favorite of mine (and many). Here's where the limitations of Jansons' style become evident. Brahms is simply not suited to the Wagnerian approach that seems to spill over into this work. And Jansons has competition in the Blu-ray format:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berliner-Philharmoniker-Wagner-Elgar-Brahms-Blu-ray/dp/B0040Y7EV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berliner Philharmoniker: Wagner, Elgar, Brahms [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Symphonies-Blu-ray/dp/B007VCN1X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Symphonies [Blu-ray</a>]. I own them both, so I did some side by side comparisons.

Often, looking at the difference in timings is revealing, and that's the case here. Jansons takes the final movement considerably slower than Daniel Barenboim and Thomas Dausgaard. It's not an uninteresting longer journey, but it creates a slackness that dissipates the finale's energy and dampens its effects. To my ears, Barenboim gets the tempi exactly right, and the more muscular Berlin Philharmonic builds up fantastic excitement. It's majestic and yet no felicities are lost -- Brahms' homage to Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" theme from his 9th Symphony is satisfyingly evident. Dausgaard, on the other hand, takes a racehorse-to-the-finish approach, which tends to ride roughshod over the score's beauties.

So if it's the Brahms 1st you're after, Barenboim's your man and the Berlin Phil's your band. It's not even close.

The picture quality of the Jansons Blu-ray is excellent. Notably, the cameras are helmed by veteran classical video director Brian Large -- who, incredibly, been at this for nearly half a century! His expert, minimalist approach is unobtrusive, which I find works best in capturing orchestral performances.

Despite his misstep with the Brahms on this night, Jansons left me intrigued. I'd be interested to see him conduct other pieces that emphasize the full palette of orchestral colors -- such as Strauss' ""Eine Alpensinfonie,"" which would seem particularly well suited to his approach, or symbolist-inspired works like ""Pelleas et Melisande"" by Claude Debussy and the unjustly neglected ""Die Tote Stadt"" by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The latter composer, of course, later gained greater fame for his film scores (to end this on yet another cinematic note).

I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",1377993600,2,4485,5.793626707132018
8593994,5,B00DJYK6LW,"This concert from the 2012 Salzburg Festival received rapturous applause from the packed audience as well as enthusiastic press coverage. The style of the performances has much in common with another recent issue by Jansons with the Bavarian orchestra by emphasising the warm and tonally rich characteristics of the music and by having orchestras with the tonal and technical resources capable of portraying such views to advantage.

The concert opens with that very well known tone poem by Richard Strauss, his Don Juan. This piece opens with a striding horn motif which we can take to be a portrayal of Don Juan in up-beat hunting mode. There is a very egotistical element about this theme that vividly portrays that side of Don Juan and it has lead to many memorable displays of horn playing. Performances led by Reiner, Szell and Solti for example, have been etched into the memory of record collectors through this figure which finally occurs in full glory towards the end. In between there is an extensive quieter section which suggests more of the seducer rather than the predator. This central part can often be overshadowed by the more exuberant outer sections. This does not happen here as Jansons places considerable emphasis upon the central episode that is played with almost loving care and with every opportunity to luxuriate in the orchestral textures found there. This emphasis changes the overall effect of the piece and the apparent nature of Don Juan who is more amenable perhaps and less openly predatory.

The Wagner Wesendonck-lieder is a set of love texts and, bearing in mind the change of emphasis of the Don Juan, may thus acquire unintentional meaning not anticipated by Wagner. The Swedish soprano, Nina Stemme, sings these texts with utter commitment and fully justifies her position as one of the leading sopranos for music such as this requiring a voice such as hers. It is easy to imagine her in roles within Wagner operas for instance. She has a powerful voice of tonal depth and is an ideal soloist here. In this she is fully supported by Jansons and the VPO.

The concert concludes with a warmly affectionate performance of the Brahms first symphony, which in common with the rest of this concert and also the Bavarian concert, lays great emphasis upon tonal and textural considerations. The great horn theme at the beginning of the final movement is a good example, played at a very steady speed and in such a manner as to allow the answering trombones to make the most of their chordal parts. The tempo picks up after this but the example still serves as indicative of Janson's willingness to make the most of such textural moments. Brahms can rarely have sounded so opulent and magisterial as here. The cost, and there is always a cost, is a reduction of dramatic drive which other conductors would prefer to concentrate on. One example being Barenboim's own performance in Oxford in 2010 with the BPO and also available on a fine Euroarts Blu-ray/DVD disc.

The recording does full justice to Jansons' conception and the playing of the VPO and is presented in DTS 5.0 and stereo. The lack of a separate sub-woofer channel does not seem to be significant on this occasion and the sound is full ranging and gives clarity and stage depth. The camera work is typical of the Brian Large team and is clear, detailed but not invasive. Neither is it hyper-active so not distracting in intensity. Sub-titles are provided for the Wagner and the sleeve notes are informative and sufficient.

I would suggest that this disc will appeal to those who view these works in more of a warmly affectionate manner and who respond in particular to the actual sound worlds of the composers. Those who see these works as primarily dramatic statements may find some of the interpretive decisions a little compromising of such dramatic drive.

Nevertheless, it must be stressed that there are always equally valid ways of approaching most works of music and that Jansons clearly has a view that communicated enormously well to the audience and to the attending press. On those terms this disc certainly succeeds and is deserving of serious consideration as a satisfying potential purchase.",1375228800,5,4204,4.914084507042253
