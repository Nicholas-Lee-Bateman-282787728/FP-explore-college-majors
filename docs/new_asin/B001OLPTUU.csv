8330791,5,B001OLPTUU,James Keating is a wealth of knowledge & conceptual genius. One of the best there is when it comes to bladework!,1450396800,,112,4.380952380952381
8330792,5,B001OLPTUU,"Many years ago, I aquired the entire drawpoint system from Mr. Keating on VHS. While I understand  my freind Dex's views on the production quality, hey, it was the 90's, and i was damn happy to get any solid material on knife work! The production issues do not bother me as the material itself is so useful. Having carried knives in drawpoint mode ever since, as other methods I have studied are not as comprehensive or as realistic from a user standpoint, i can attest to its versatility and utility. With some personal effort, one can learn the skills in this series over a few weeks and then USE it for the rest of their life, refining thier own personal aproach to drawpoint as they go. This makes the entire series an excellent value.
Buy it and begin training.",1421884800,,766,4.510791366906475
8330793,4,B001OLPTUU,"I will list the one thing that bothers me about this product out of the way. The out of date production and presentation of this movie can be a little off setting.

Other than that, this is a really good foundation for a reverse grip blade art. This isn't a rocket science based system. If someone has the time, physical ability, and coordination, they can get a good grip on the basics in a weekend, and attain mastery in this system in just a couple of weeks.

This is probably the best mid-range knife system out there utilizing the reverse grip IMO. I would supplement this material with Ray Floro's ""Floro Fighting System"" DVDs for better long range abilities, and Craig Douglas's (a.k.a. South Narc) from Shivworks ""Reverse Edge Methods"" volume 1 & 2 for a better clinch range blade work.",1385769600,2,794,4.624113475177305
