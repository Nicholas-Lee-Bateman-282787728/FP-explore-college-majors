7857391,5,6303969984,"I just watched this movie this afternoon- it's GREAT!

It's about a woman who never forgot that her ex-lover left her a long time ago during a critical moment in her life, and the guy was even responsible for killing her child.  Years later -for whatever reason- the ex-lover returns (now injured) and the same woman the guy dumped is now back into the picture, and the woman has to take care of him as both the woman and man are much much older.

This leads to plenty of moments where the woman tortures her ex-lover by leaving him outside when it rains, leaving him tied down in bed all night long and forcing him to listen to music he doesn't like, and even hitting on him a little bit (in a joking way, as in ""You will never have me again!"")

I don't want to spoil all the other great moments, but trust me, there's several of them.

The ending had a small twist I guess you can say.  The one thing that was interesting about the movie is that you were never sure if it was trying to be a comedy or a serious story about a woman torturing her ex-lover, all because of the way the scenes unfolded.",1248134400,,1100,4.18957345971564
