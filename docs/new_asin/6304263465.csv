824103,4,6304263465,"RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Rod Daniel, Teen Wolf stars Michael J. Fox as a teen in Beacontown, Nebraska, who works at his Dads shop in town (James Hampton), plays basketball for his lousy school team and enjoys a friendship with a neighborhood girl (Susan Ursitti) while desiring the popular blonde (Lorie Griffin). Complications result when he starts turning into a werewolf.

This was actually Foxs first theatrical film, made BEFORE the mega-successful Back to the Future but released afterward. By comparison its a decidedly small movie, but enjoyable for what it is (an 80s teen flick). The second act takes a turn that I wasn't expecting. No spoilers, but the movie poster tells all.

I liked the closing moral: Dont lose yourself in your special talent to the point that you lose your family/friends. If people just love you for your extraordinary gift are they truly your friends? A good real-life example is Bobby Knieval who became world famous as Evel Knieval, the radical motorcycle daredevil: Family members said they lost Bobby to Evel and the negative repercussions of fame (e.g. booze, babes, bucks and pomposity). Thankfully, in his later years he realized this and tried to make amends.

Griffin has one notable scene as the hottie without falling into tasteless sleaze.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 31 minutes and was shot entirely in Southern California: South Pasadena (neighborhood & town), Los Angeles (school), Montrose (bowling alley) & Tujunga (liquor store). The credits acknowledge Friends in Fremont, Nebraska because the director traveled there and spent 3 hours talking to seniors for research. WRITERS: Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Matt Adler plays the protagonists bud and Mark Arnold his rival. Jay Tarses plays the coach while James MacKrell appears as Mr. Thorne.

824645,4,6304263465,"Just to clarify for people because this can get very confusing. the standard for around 50$ is the complete SERIES of MTVs teen wolf which is like a 6 season television show. I only say this because if you click blu-ray it shows the teen wolf MOVIE with michael j. fox from a long time ago.

Ive seen both and other than the name of the main character and his best friend (scott and stiles) and the fact that both are about werewolves the similarities end there.

The tv shows more of your standard supernatural keep our secret hidden while overcoming any supernatural-related issues they come across.

If you like modern Supernatural themed tv shows you'll like the series. IF your looking to relive the nostalgia of the movie from your childhood then leave it at that because the series in no way feels like a sequel or continuation of the movie",1510963200,,847,4.559210526315789

Bad idea. 1985's idea of PG is not the same as 2017's idea of PG. Sex scene, near nudity, underage drinking...all highly inappropriate for any kid under 13 or 14 to watch. Should be PG-13.

824821,5,6304263465,"Have to be honest.  In September 2017, I finally watched this movie for the first time even though how I knew certain audiences really enjoyed it.  And really, I just never bothered to when it was on TV since I wanted it clean and full without interuptions.. but then there was all those years on DVD too that I didn't bother then so...why my big delay?  Because I was jealous of its success and familiarity with another independent werewolf move called RAGE OF NERDWOLF that premiered a year before in a small central California town.  That movie was written and made first but all the attention went to TEEN WOLF.  Now, there is no way Hollywood knew about that film RON, but there are some similar scenes that occur and its weird how when you put things out there in the universe, it can get mixed up in the DNA of other creative things.  Anyhow, TEEN WOLF is a much better, sweeter, kinder, funnier movie than RON, which was much more violent.  Both very campy and hearts of gold - but tip of the cap to TW.. you were worth the wait.

Since then I've been a huge fan of the Teen Wolf series, and have grown to love all of the leading characters. The biggest heartbreak was in season 4 when Alison, and Aiden died. The last season is having it's up and down moments since Stiles is hardly in it, and I don't agree with a few of relationships that have been made all of a sudden.

824989,5,6304263465,"TEEN WOLF Collectors edition blu-ray by Shout factory
i cannot wait to buy, much, much better than the previous blu-ray which had Zero extras anyway
this new reissue has new HD transfer and new 5.1 master mix
the biggest Highlight is the new Legacy Documentary NEVER SAY DIE which goes for over 2hrs
which has new interviews with some of the cast & crew, more behind the scenes crew are interviewed
than the cast from the film mainly cause some of the cast left the acting business over 20 years ago which is not surprising,
i can say that Actors Jerry Levine, Matt Adler, Susan Ursitti and few other actors are interviewed
but i don't think Michael J Fox is interviewed he probably Declined an interview which does not surprise me
he's quoted saying that Teen wolf is the worse film he's done in his career,
so it's tragic but understandable he declined to be interviewed for the film
so Definitely worth watching when you buy the blu-ray considering the previous blu-ray & dvd versions had no extras anyway
and there's also the original Trailer ofcourse and Stills Photo Gallery both in HD quality
shout factory made lots effort to get as many cast & crew they could for the Doco which i'm sure was very Difficult
as i said some of the actors from the film left the business over 20 years ago now so some would've declined to be interviewed
so what's missing well Deleted scenes which there was lots of scenes added for the TV broadcast version
for some reason shout factory didn't add the Deleted scenes to this new blu-ray reissue
so i give 5 stars for this new blu-ray based on new Documentary about the film",1500422400,,1613,4.546391752577319

Dumb story (apparently becoming a werewolf makes you a great basketball player. Go figure! Oh..and no interest in killing people or satisfying your bloodlust. Nope...you just want to play hoops! hehe..GROAN.) . He's a werewolf and no one thinks its that weird in his school. And the hot girl wants to date him now! Who wouldnt want to date a hairy, ugly werewolf?! Zero laughs to be found in this movie. Irritating best friend. Soundtrack and songs are AWFUL.

First of all, there are absolutely NO EXTRA features which is a downer. The print looked and sounded incredible as one would expect from a HD transfer. Unfortunately, for me, I bought this Blu-ray on September 14, 2014 and after only watching it twice it has completely stopped working. I tried playing it in three different Blu-ray players but to no avail. The screen stays blank and it appears that the Blu-ray is still buffering, but it never plays.

Sure, the message is about acceptance and being yourself, but seeing MJ Fox as a werewolf was just silly beyond the fringe of all that is acceptable in this world. The producers could not have created a more stupid premise had they tried for 100 years. The way that the girls are portrayed is demeaning as well. I was a high school kid once and although some kids could be superficial and vapid, everyone in this film was portrayed as shallow and only smart enough to keep their bodies functioning. There are two franchises in film that I have always loved to hate. ""Look Who's Talking"" is the first and ""Teen Wolf"" is the second.",1464912000,,805,4.52054794520548

It has that 80s charm that you can't resist. There's a few laughs along the way, and the plot is lighthearted and adorable. It also gives a more positive spin on werewolves (if you care about that sort of thing), and doesn't have any sparkly nonsense like the Twilight series did with vampires.

Scott is just your typical teen going through some not-so-typical changes: hair growth, increased sense of smell, growling, glowing red eyes, etc. Watch him as he tries to impress the high school hottie, Pamela, deal with her neanderthal boyfriend Mick, figure out his feelings for his best friend, and most importantly, deal with the fact he's a werewolf!!",1463270400,,815,4.506756756756757

We recently watched it (30 years later) with our kids.  They liked it, but I had not remembered all the language, teenage sexual scenes, etc.  PG of the 80s and what we have grown to expect today is TOTALLY different.  Today, this would likely have a PG-13 rating.  Not that we minded the whip cream wrestling, but my 11 year old could have waited.  :)",1432857600,,500,4.311827956989247

This is about a boy who finds a wolf in the woods one day while on a walk to cool down from an argument with his grandparents who are his legal guardians. This wolf was alone so he said, ""C ' Mon wolf, I'll take care of you and teach you how to be one of us. Me and you wolf, me and you."". He took the wolf back home and gave it human clothes and took it to school with him. Wolf quickly became the most popular ""kid"" in school. He also loved basketball. This was obviously a comment on the fact that animals do not have the right to play sports no matter how good they are. This wolf faced adversity as people found out he was a wolf and didn't like wolves playing basketball but boy with the power of friendship and understanding does he over come out ahead and teach us all something.

Those fun, light comedies were the specialty of Fox. The Blu-ray picture quality isn't up to snuff and the audio is only marginally better (DTS-HD MA monaural track). Bonus content in this Blu-ray is disappointingly light. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package. The DVD included Teen Wolf Too with Jason Bateman but it is nowhere near as good as the original so you aren't missing much (it isn't included in the Blu-ray). Some of the cast return for the sequel but Fox does not.

Here Teen Wolf is born  and while it bears no resemblance to the MTV hit it scores big time with being an 80's family comedy that will endure.  Funny stuff.  Scott Howard (Fox) is in High School and playing basketball for a team that Jack Nicholson (not in film) wouldn't buy a season pass for believe me...that is until a little genetic disorder rears it's ugly head.  But enough...don't want to give it away because it's way too much fun to discover for yourself.  This is the High School Musical of the Eighties and believe me it's what High School was really like back then.  Kudos also to his Dad in the film (James Hampton) an 80's character staple on TV given a role he sinks his teeth into.  This is just plain fun...and where can you buy that at these days????,1371859200,7,1051,4.321428571428571

826546,5,6304263465,"From 1985 comes the classic coming-of-age comedy, TEEN WOLF, starring Michael J. Fox! As if homework weren't already hard enough, high school loser Scott Howard starts noticing some odd changes as he is transformed into a teenage werewolf. His enhanced abilities and scary new look quickly make him a star on the court and the most popular kid in school, but as Scott begins to lose himself in ""the animal,"" he must learn that with great power comes great responsibility. Michael J. Fox gives another entertaining performance as Scott Howard, whose shy apprehension prior to his literal and figurative transformation makes him a lovable dork. TEEN WOLF is clearly a product of its time, following strict standards that have been set forth by other teen comedies of the era. Memorable moments like Scott's trip to the liquor store and the van surfing scene have made this a fan favorite for decades, however, and for good reason. Despite the obvious 1980's cliches, the humor is well-written, the lines are perfectly delivered, and the monster make-up used to turn Fox into the wolf couldn't be more suitable to add a soft horror edge. It's time to take a trip back and rewatch TEEN WOLF today!

826551,2,6304263465,"Teen Wolf, 1985 film

The story starts with a teenager playing basketball. His team is losing badly. ""Chub"" hides his snacks. Scotty talks to the coach, Bobby Finstock, about ""changes"". Scotty doesn't want to be ""average"". He developed acute hearing of an ultra-sonic dog whistle. Scotty delivers goods to the drama class. Can Scotty buy a keg of beer without an ID? [In a movie.] A friend rides on the roof of a van while there is a song for entertainment. Scotty goes to a crowded party. A couple shows off on the floor. A bowl of Jello is dumped onto a girl. Scotty and his girl are pushed into a closet. Scotty returns home and looks in a mirror to see changes. His Dad has an explanation! What will he do? The next morning things are back to normal. ""Werewolves are people like everyone else.""

Scott gives correct answers in class. But he has to run to the Boy's Room. Later he surprises his friend Styles in the garage. ""What can I say?"" A keen sense of smell is useful here. There is another basketball game. [Does the other team look older?] There is a fight for the ball. Scotty wins! He shows his skills. [The fur hides his skilled double.] Scotty is the big hero now! [Believable?] Mr. T. is still the Vice-Principal. People ask for Scotty's autograph. Scotty acts in a play and does very well in bowling. Pamela throws a gutter ball. There is a conflict with Pamela's boyfriend Mick. Scotty's friend Styles now owns a big van. [An acrobat doubles for Scotty.] Scott's Dad tells about his past. Scott doesn't want to be average. Scott attends the dance. [Is there another skilled double dancing?] Buff and Scott dance. Mick attacks Scott [to add drama and conflict]. Mr. T. threatens Scott until his Dad intervenes.

Scott wants to be himself in the play. ""Bummer."" he can't do ""the wolf"" anymore. This disappoints his basketball coach. Chubby sinks the ball. Scotty's team does much better now. [Is the fix in?] In the last minute the score is nearly even. A foul will allow Scotty two free throws and a winning score. Scotty knows his true love at last. A happy ending?

This is an about average story that could have been improved with a better writer and script. Does this echo the ""Ugly Duckling"" fairy tale? Is this the hidden fantasy of most average people? This story lacks ""bite"" to make it above average. Showing teenage life alone does not make a good movie. Having a hereditary disease isn't really funny. Stories of werewolves followed any outbreak of rabies in olden times. A bite transfers the disease and resulted in a popular legend. Stories about vampires are usually more popular. Some say economic hard times create an interest in horror movies, in the 1930 and in today's ""Great Recession"".",1347840000,,2723,4.643153526970955

It's a bit of a tortured premise, and the make-up of the wolf is a bit lacking, but Fox (as usual) is such a winning personality, he brings the film up from mediocrity to fun and entertaining.

Michael J. Fox was burning white hot in 1985.  His first American TV show ""Family Ties"" was on top of the ratings, the first ""Back to the Future"" movie was an instant classic, and he even made this B movie an enduring hit.

""Teen Wolf"" tells the improbable story of Scott Howard's struggles with high school, basketball, and a semi-generational wolf curse in his family.  It all works because Mr. Fox plays it with as much believability as possible, and the script has a surprising amount of heart, and relative credibility.  Though the movie highlights colorful suppporting characters, it is unquestionably Michael J. Fox who holds the whole enterprise together with a talented performance.

I'm looking forward to seeing how the movie makes the transition to Blu-Ray Disc, and am glad its being converted to the high definition format.

Also featuring character actors James Hampton and Mark Holton(""Pee Wee's Big Adventure, ""A League Of Their Own,"") ""Teen Wolf"" is great.",1298764800,8,991,5.080246913580247

Released in the period when Michael J Fox was incredibly popular, with his Back To The Future releases, sees him in another hard to forget role of his career. As the story was made in the mid-80's, the storyline is quite simple and very clich and probably wouldn't stand out as a good movie compared to releases of today.
