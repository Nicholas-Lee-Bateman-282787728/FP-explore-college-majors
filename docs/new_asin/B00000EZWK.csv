1202413,4,B00000EZWK,"As a child of the 1950s of course I remembered this series and I bought this boxed set of the series with a little trepidation. I feared that my fond memories of this ""strictly for fun"" series would be tarnished by the harsh reality of comparison with more modern efforts like the Michael Praed/Jason Connery series of the 1980s or The Costner movie (not to mention this series' illustrious predecessor, the movie starring Errol Flynn). I need not have worried.
Before I talk about the programmes themselves, I should draw your attention to the bizarre way these shows have been presented in this NTSC (American TV standard) offering. The good news is that the boxed set of videos looks great. A box itself has a beautiful colour poster of Robin Hood printed all around it. The slipcases for each videotape is similarly decorated and when put together in order, the spines of the cases (each of which has printed the episode titles the tape contains) form a Robin Hood logo.  There are useful synopses of each episode contained on the back face of each slipcase. However, the overall box is made of very flimsy card, which won't last long in normal use and will tear easily.
Moving on to the contents of the tapes. The technical quality of the programmes themselves is poor. There are various disclaimers on the tape about the age of the material not allowing full quality etc - however I have seen a single episode on BBC TV a few Christmases ago which was in very good condition - far better than the video quality on offer here - so I don't think the master copy quality is the real culprit. My technical background tells me that this material has been re-encoded to digital formats a couple of times - losing much quality on the way I fear (some of the water sequences look very blocky for example). It's a tribute to the actual programme content that the sympathetic viewer will almost certainly stop noticing this ten minutes into the 2nd episode (to be honest the first episode is a bit of clunker!)  None of the episodes have the opening title sequence intact (but they do run an incomplete segment of the opening title sequence at the start of each tape), Then we have a mostly unnecessary introduction to each episode by a unnamed presenter (who of course, being American, insists on calling the hero ""RobinHood"" - guys, it's two words actually!!!) Then, we dissolve into the start of the episode. Probably most galling of all about the strange bitsy presentation format used is that the end titles are missing. There are tens of players glimpsed in these shows whose faces you can almost put a name to. Surely the producers of this tape must know that in nostalgia programming the titles are very important to the viewer? Perhaps trimming off the credits meant they didn't have to pay royalties to the extant actors and writers? Anyway, suffice to say that the on-screen re-packaging of these shows is bizarre and annoying in the extreme.
Now, we move on to the good part - the shows themselves. Some very strong story lines (wouldn't it have been great to know what writing talent was used?) The show changes gear a lot from episode to episode too - another reason to like it. Most episodes have threads that are played for laughs, but there is always a mix of things going on - drama, tragedy, love story, and the proportions vary a lot from episode to episode. From our great modern sophistication it's hard to say that the show constantly surprises, it doesn't: What it does do is keep you interested. A very few episodes are truly dark and a few others are almost pantomime - but most tread the middle line between the two without falling off.
 Some very strong performances. Richard Greene's Robin Hood still jumps out of the screen with his twinkling eyes and his (seldom lost) good humour. For me, Alexander Gauge will always be the definitive Friar Tuck. Alan Rickman's 1991 Sheriff, in the Costner movie, I think owes something to Alan Wheatley's magnificently tetchy Sheriff of Nottingham here. Archie Duncan's Little John is often a delight and - in one gloriously over the top performance - Donald Pleasance as Prince John is madly, eye bulgingly excellent.
Of course because of when these were made - the early days of British commercial TV - there are future TV stars by the boatload. Even without the aid of cast lists I spotted: Barbara Mullen, Paul Eddington, Lionel Jefferies, Richard Briers (I think), Leonard Rossiter (I think), Donald Pleasance, Jane Asher (as a child), Peter Asher (young),  Hubert Gregg,  Ronald Pickup (I think), Richard O' Sullivan and there are many others whose faces I would not quite put a name to.  Beware the fact that the actors playing some parts seem to change in some episodes (Little John for example, and even the Sheriff are occasionally played by different actors!). I guess this was cover for sick leave or maybe these tapes present the shows in a random order - I don't know.
 The acting quality is of course variable - especially to the modern eye - the settings are sometimes a little bit stagy (for example some of the castle walls sound rather hollow when struck!) but overall the illusions work ok.
So, should you buy this? If you are going to watch it sympathetically yes, you definitely should. If you have no historical affection for these shows you should consider carefully - the packaging and the poor quality of these copies may spoil them for you. .
 I enjoyed them very much. Five stars for the content 3 stars for the box artwork, zero stars for the on-screen presentation.",1075507200,3,5558,4.693333333333333
1202414,4,B00000EZWK,"For fans of 1950s-era television series, it's pretty hard to top this 21 episode set from Marathon Music & Video.  ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" still holds up remarkably well some 45 years after it was produced and aired on television.  At times, this British produced series shows its age but, overall, the vast majority of the episodes are entertaining, thanks to good writing, acting, and production values.  Richard Greene is a very appealing lead as Robin, but, at times, the supporting roles are a bit confusing as different actors portrayed characters like Maid Marian and Little John during the series' run in the US, from 1955 to 1958.
As much as I enjoy this series, these tapes are not without their problems, hence my rating of four stars rather than five.  Several of the tapes had muddled audio which, I suspect, were NOT due to the condition of the source material as the introductions to each episode (read by Marathon's host) are muddled as well.  The introductions are really unnecessary as they are the same descriptions found on each of the individual video boxes.  Also, there is only one opening title segment for each tape and not each episode (3 episodes per tape), and there are absolutely no closing credits.  It would have been nice to learn who the various actors were, though Donald Pleasence can easily be spotted as the evil Prince John.
After viewing these tapes once (I will be viewing them again), my hope is that Marathon Music & Video (or some other enterprising Public Domain video company) does two things:
1.  Release more episodes (with full opening and closing credits), and
2.  Release existing and/or previously unreleased episodes on DVD.",1041292800,12,1684,4.8807017543859645
1202415,4,B00000EZWK,"If you're at all interested in the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950's, this series may also be of interest. In his posthumous autobiography ""I'd Hate Myself in the Morning,"" Ring Lardner Jr. claims that he and several other blacklisted screenwriters were hired to write episodes of this series (under pseudonyms, of course) and were able to deal with, in Lardner's words, ""the issues and institutions of Eisenhower-era America"" - through metaphor, of course.",993945600,3,457,5.273972602739726
1202416,5,B00000EZWK,"What a treasure!  I have been begging the video stores to find out if such a compilation existed.  Thank you, Amazon.  I'm an old fan of this show, watching it from the very beginning and loving every moment of it.  After  all these years, it's like a time machine to be able to see those faces and  hear those voices again.  As an adult, I can see nuances in plots, judge  the acting and the stories in different ways than I did as a 10 year old.  How I wanted to join that outlaw band.  In one episode, an 11 year old girl  actually did do it for a short time and Robin gave her a kiss goodnight.  In my jealous green, I'd fit right into Sherwood Forest.  Even though the  tapes are in glorious black & white, even though the sound is, at  times, difficult, even though stock footage is sometimes used, this was a  class production with real castles and the right feel of Olde England in  the late Eleven Hundreds when Richard was the absent king and only Robin  Hood and friends could keep the kingdom from sucumbing to his evil brother  John.  The actors experiment with different roles.  Once, even the  sheriff (Alan Wheatley) played a French Count, but it was refreshing to see  him stretch his acting abilities.  The show was true to its times in  costuming and social behavior, so very English and well constructed.  Please, can anyone convince Mathathon Music & Video to do the rest of  the episodes?

1202417,5,B00000EZWK,"If you've sort of wished you had some examples of Richard Greene's ""Robin Hood"" TV shows from the 50's - but have never done anything about it - then this boxed set might be for you.  Otherwise, you  might find you already own several of the episodes included.
""Robin Hood"" is the quintessential English adventure story -  set in days when soldiers fought with swords and arrows.  Each episode is  introduced (explained?) by a American frontman who uses 90's language.  As  an Englishman, I found this highly irritating.  For example, he tells us at  one point that Robin strives for ""a win-win situation"".  Yuk!
He also tells us the series was filmed actually in Sherwood Forest.  Wrong!  It was filmed in some woods just outside London. Still, never mind,  because the shows are what really matter - and they are still highly  enjoyable.  Entertaining, gently educating the young viewers about life way  back when.
The actors are exceptional - to an adult it is amusing to  see the same people playing different roles in each episode in order to  keep casting costs within tight budgets. Because the actors are so good, I  was annoyed that both the opening and end credits have been stripped off  the episodes.  I would have much preferred them to the frontman.
The  episodes are: Children of the greenwood, The miser, Too many earls, Friar  Tuck, The youngest outlaw, Woman's war, The highlander, Isabella, Tables  turned, An apple for the archer, The lottery, A year and a day, Goodbye  Little John, The May Queen, The prisoner, Ladies of Sherwood, The Thorkill  ghost, The secret pool, Bride for an outlaw, Checkmate, The frightened  tailor.

7906846,5,B00000EZWK,"I just discovered this 1955 classic series on Amazon Prime. I bought the series years ago, but It is much easier to have the series in my queue, than it is to drag out the CD's. Richard Greene does a remarkable job of playing role of Robin Hood. The old classics are not  action packed and filled with violence and gore as many of the movies are today. Thanks for making these classics available, Amazon.",1510963200,,404,4.386666666666667
7906847,5,B00000EZWK,"What a wonderful series, and so nice to view it again in its entirety sixty years after I first saw it as a child.  Though initially done on a budget until it caught on, the acting and story lines carry the day.  Especially Richard Greene, who was a genuine man of the old school:  no steroids, no plastic surgery, no affectations of self-importance.  His commanding presence, bass voice, expressive eyes and sturdy build that reflects plenty of natural testosterone are the embodiment of what we might imagine Robin Hood to be.

I was somewhat saddened to see Bernadette O'Farrell depart.  Her Maid Marian had a tomboyish, Peter Pan mischievousness that made her excellence with both horse and bow believable.  And she was still plenty of woman when it was time for her femininity to shine forth!  Patricia Driscoll replaced her and did a good job, but she was more of a ""girly-girl"" and the chemistry with Greene wasn't really the same.  Greene & O'Farrell were a pair of wolves, Greene and Driscoll were a wolf and a lamb.  Interestingly, she is the only cast member still alive to my knowledge, and went on to a busy career in films and TV.

Alexander Gauge's Friar Tuck was a character I well remember from childhood.  It is tragic to know that he was dying of a malignant brain tumor in the final season, though one couldn't tell from his acting.  He committed suicide in August of 1960, having already filmed the final season, the last episode airing on November 12, 1960.  Perhaps the show's cancellation and the ever increasing diability caused him to overdose on barbiturates - who knows?  I'm glad we have this record of some of his work.

Alan Wheatley left in the middle of the last season and was replaced by John Arnatt.  I always loved Wheatley's characterization of the Sheriff as a dapper, well-spoken dandy with a crush on Lady Marian, devoid of scruples and always one step behind Robin Hood.  Arnatt had big shoes to fill, but fill them he did.  Tall, muscular and with an articulate bass voice, his character was likewise devoid of scruples.  But his various schemes were far more clever than Wheatley's scripted foibles, his sword fighting far more lethal and his character a compelling and charismatic ""bad guy"".

One could see the gradual improvement in sword play during the course of the series, and by the last season there were some notable encounters on set, with ""Boland"" playing a savagely-skillful swordsman just returned from the Crusades who takes on - and defeats - Robin.

In any case, enjoy good, clean, entertaining shows from a time when family and decency still ruled.",1508457600,,2609,4.76391982182628

7906853,4,B00000EZWK,"In the Fall of 1955, American television audiences were treated to one of the earliest imported television series from England, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood.""  ""Robin Hood"" ran for three full seasons in the U.S. on the CBS network and paved the way for other British costume adventure shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Buccaneers-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000H5U6AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Buccaneers: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Sir-Lancelot-Volume-1/dp/B000NQQ4EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Sir Lancelot Volume 1</a>, among others.  In the early days of television, each season meant a production schedule of 39 episodes.  An abbreviated fourth season of 26 episodes was produced and aired in England, but not broadcast in primetime in the U.S., though these episodes did turn up in later syndication runs.  ""Robin Hood"" starred British film actor Richard Greene, who was well known to both American and British audiences.

While ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" has been officially released in its entirety in the United Kingdom from a company called Network, the series has never had an official release in North America.  Apparently, many or possibly all of the episodes from this series have slipped into the public domain, and the result has been numerous DVD releases from multiple releasing companies.  Currently, the most comprehensive release of episodes from the series comes from Alpha Video, which has released 60 episodes spread over 15 discs.  This release of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is, at the same time, one of the very best U.S. releases of the series as well as one of the most puzzling.  Puzzling, in the sense that the packaging says ""Season 1"" but only the first 30 episodes (of 39) from season one are included, spread across three dual layered DVDs.  It just begs the question of the releasing company, the Timeless Media Group, where are the other nine episodes?  On the plus side, this release contains some of the best looking episodes that I've seen to date on a U.S. release of the series.  The episodes are generally clean looking with minimal films specks and damage, and contrast is good.  And, unlike Timeless' previous VHS release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Robin-Hood-7pc/dp/B00000EZWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Robin Hood (7pc)</a>, the full title sequence and end credits are included.

This set was one of the later DVD releases of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" in North America and, as a consequence, has been overshadowed by releases from other companies, especially Alpha Video and, as previously mentioned, all 143 episodes of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" have been officially released on DVD in the UK.  If you have a multi-region DVD player and the financial resources, then I suggest that you consider importing those sets.  But this is one of the very best (and overlooked) collections of episodes available in the U.S. and, given the low selling price, is highly recommended for fans of the series and those interested in 1950s style action/adventure shows.  However, the question remains, where are those missing nine episodes?",1191456000,11,3340,5.881987577639752
7906854,3,B00000EZWK,"This is a low cost 3-episode compilation from ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" that was broadcast on CBS from 1955-58.  As is the case with most US releases of this series, these episodes have fallen into the public domain and the prints utilized for this release are a bit ragged looking, but certainly watchable.  The episodes ""Isabella"" and ""Food for Thought"" have been released on other Robin Hood TV collections, but the episode ""Lincoln Green"" has not been released on any other compilation of Robin Hood episodes to date, at least as of this writing.  As such, this DVD would be of interest primarily to those who are collecting episodes from this entertaining series, or those who are looking for a low cost introduction to the series.",1112659200,7,741,4.818897637795276
7906855,4,B00000EZWK,"An excellent collection of 21 episodes of the 1950's series Staring Richard Greene.  Many of these Episodes have not been available in other settings (believe me I've looked)
Instead of the standard credits for the show at the begining the company has a general intro with the closing song over the opening credits.  Each episode has an introduction by the makers of the set.  I would have prefered the actual intro but its a small price to pay since I haven't seen this complete a set offered by anyone else.
Of special note are two particular episodes:
FRIAR TUCK introduces The portly cleric into the scene as he attempt to get Robin's help to aid a girl running away from a forced marriage by the lord of the estate.  Alexander Gauge played the role for the duration of the series and died the year it was cancelled.
GOODBYE LITTLE JOHN is one of two episodes included in the series from the later years of the series that contained John Arnatt as the Deputy Sheriff of Nottingham he is a more cerebral villain then Alan Wheatley and frankly more sinister.  Little John has a dispute with Will Scarlett as he feels his role as Robin's 2nd in command is threatened.  The wiley Sheriff decides to expand the rift by offering a no-frills pardon claiming that John was unjustly made an outlaw.  This is a great tense episode as John struggles with both his position and his desire for freedom.
In addition to the high quality of the series it is a great bit of history.  We see the origin of the term ""Hue & Cry"", We learn about serfdom.  For people very young some of the behavor will seem very strange but the assumptions and ways of the time are presented without modern bounce:  A lord stopped from his actions due to fear of Excommunicaton, A woman joking about the beating she would get from her man if getting home late, the arbatary nature of taxes, the life of people living truely hand to mouth, the Crusades (rightly) protrayed as a just war, the absolute nature of law and rule of the time, I could go on and on but you get the idea.
