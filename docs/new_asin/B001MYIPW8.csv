8322457,5,B001MYIPW8,Amazon has apparently cancelled pre-orders of Season 3. Anyone know if Infinity has pulled the plug on this (or did somebody pull THEIR plug)? What a shame... just as they were starting to get the hang of how to properly transfer these to DVD.,1238889600,,243,4.545454545454546
8322458,5,B001MYIPW8,"Can any Route 66 fan let me know which season of RT66 had an episode filmed in Butte, Montana. A mining town in Montana, the show would have featured the gallus frames of the copper mines. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",1232841600,,227,4.428571428571429
