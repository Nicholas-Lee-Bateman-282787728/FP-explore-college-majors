4231959,5,B003YZGWOQ,I watched Opposite Day for the first time today.  I found it very entertaining and am buying the DVD to show to my class on reward day following FCAT.  I found something children can watch as well as adults and enjoy.  It surpasses most comedies where someone/something is hurt or videos where there is nothing but fighting and destruction.,1334361600,,340,4.728813559322034
4231960,2,B003YZGWOQ,"This is supposed to be a kids movie, so I guess some amount of childishness is par for the course. However, it just doesn't get beyond pure silliness. The movie is cute for a few minutes of watching kids in adults' suits and pretending to adults' jobs, and some of the images are priceless. However, that gets old pretty quickly. As for the plot and acting, they're just beyond the usual terrible fare. I can't predict how a kid would enjoy the movie, but my guess is it won't appeal to many.",1307750400,4,492,4.358695652173913
4231961,1,B003YZGWOQ,"My whole family hated this movie.  It's ""plot"" is that the kids become adults and the adults kids for one day.  Two of the kids stay kids and are supposed to be the ""good kids"".  But they are both obnoxious slobs that are terrible role models for kids watching the movie.  Whoever put this out should be fired.",1304985600,6,310,4.293103448275862
4231962,5,B003YZGWOQ,This movie is perfect family viewing.  The actors and actresses are believable and very entertaining throughout the movie.  I'm very happy with the dvd and will watch it over and over again!,1303084800,2,190,4.90625
4231963,3,B003YZGWOQ,The movie had a few funny parts but overall it was boring. To me it reminded me of a B rated movie. It is a family movie though with no cussing or fowl language so I will give it a thumbs up for that.,1299715200,,200,3.5681818181818183
4231964,4,B003YZGWOQ,"My ""8"" and ""10"" year old watched this movie five times in two days!  They loved it.  I enjoyed the movie and it was definitely thought provoking making you think about how this ""opposite"" would affect so many aspects of our lives and world.  The acting was a bit cheesy, but lots of fun.  I think when kids are so anxious to grow up, to have more control over their decisions and lives that this movie gives them some of that to fantasize about, but also leaves them with the message that they do need to be grateful for the parents that love them and that are (hopefully) lovingly guiding them through life until they are mature enough to embark life's journey on their own.  I do highly recommend this film for a fun filled time of imagination for your kids.",1295308800,2,760,4.361702127659575

But, the two teenagers did not like it (it was too ""kiddy"" and the story line was not good).

4232005,5,B003YZGWOQ,"Pretty Good movie?-- fun family movie?  Good God, are these people serious?  Now I feel bad giving it five stars, because I might mislead somebody--I enjoyed this movie in the same way I enjoyed Plan 9 from Outer Space.  And no it's not just because I'm a cynical young adult.  This movie should assault the senses of anybody with respect for cinema, storyelling, or themselves.  It's insulting to children worldwide that somebody actually thought they might enjoy this.  I'm giving it five stars because it's proof that not all hilariously bad movies had to be shot on black-and-white in the 50's.  If you want to watch one of the Appallingly terrible movies ever made, I thoroughly reccomend this Pauly Shore classic.

Also two of the kids from Modern Family are in it, which is a good motivational message that no matter how terrible your start in life, if you keep pushing, an Emmy is just around the corner.",1455580800,,912,4.727848101265823

We had to crank the volume up very high just to hear the talking in the movie.  We have a brand new TV and haven't had this problem with any other movie or TV shows.  I believe it was just this movie.,1395100800,,320,3.746268656716418

It was something the kids really enjoyed and it had a good ending and taught a positive value- kids being grateful that they are still kids and thankful for all that their parents do for them.
