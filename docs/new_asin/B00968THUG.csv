5272902,5,B00968THUG,"The acting was OK, but the message was excellent and the story line captivating.  But my primary take-away is this. After 15-years in this movement, I just find it ironic in the way in which some Jewish Brethren (anti-missionaries) treat their Messianic Jewish Brethren is exactly how some in the Messianic Jewish movement treat those who are in the Messianic Movement who are non-Jewish  (gentiles) who hold to the two-house truths. Judah vexes Ephriam, and Ephraim is jealous of Judah.. Yish, Moshiach Now! Moshiach Now!",1353974400,,522,5.129411764705883
5272903,5,B00968THUG,"Messianic Judaism is a young movement of Jews living as Jews, but have accepted Christ as their savior. They are not generally accepted by traditional reform, conservative and orthodox Jews.

The Sound of the Spirit is about a Jewish teenager brought up in a Messianic Jewish family. Her mother is already deceased, but her father dies of a heart attack.  She then moves in with her aunt and uncle, a traditional Jewish family.  Here's where the tension and conflict begin.

This is the first film that I know of that deals with the controversy between the Jewish believers in Christ and the traditionally Jewish non-believers.  This is something new as Messianic Judaism is only about 40 years old and growing.  In the past, Jews who came to believe in Christ simply became Christians, giving up their Jewish identity.  Messianic Jews retain their Jewish identity, live and worship as Jews and have introduced the new testament to traditional Jewish worship.

This film is well acted and produced.  If the subject interests you, I highly recommend this film.",1351468800,16,1059,4.971590909090909

I'm a Christian and this could have been a really good movie but the acting is so terrible that I couldn't get past the first hour.

5272912,4,B00968THUG,"My kids and I watched this and enjoyed it for the most part.  Differences in religious beliefs always create conflict which drives a story forward.  The obvious acrimony between the two brothers at the beginning captivated our interest and made us curious as to how the struggle between them would end.  When the uncle took Rivka in, the tension between them kept viewers involved in the story.  The story slowed down about three quarters of the way through.  My daughter felt disappointed that the promise of a confrontation between one of the characters and Rivka, that had been more than hinted at, did not materialize.  Beyond that loss in momentum towards the end, the story was a good one.  We watched it on Sabbath and found it to be a spiritual and informative movie.  Nice Christian motion picture.",1501891200,,807,4.797101449275362
5272913,4,B00968THUG,"This has a clean, moving, meaningful and delightful story but....HORRIBLE acting.  I love Christian values and wish more movies would be based on them, however, most movies like this one based on wholesome Christian values do get a deserved negative view due to the horrible acting in most of them.  The acting was so bad in this one, it became comical at times.  It is so sad because these kind of movies could have a huge positive impact on today's movie watching for families, however, the acting really does spoil the fun in the entertainment area and makes one want to stop watching many times throughout the movie.

5272919,5,B00968THUG,"First let me say I am neither Messianic nor jewish however I have always been a child of many questions.
I can't say when I first heard the sound of the spirit. my life through middle school age was so full of trouble that I know I was forever turning to God for answers and only there did I find them. This is a story about a girl that is going though world breaking changes and finding how to find God and hear his voice inside her.
To me it doesn't matter if your Jew Christian Muslim or some other form of belief. What matters is that you do believe there is a God and that he rewards those that seek him. Abraham was not a Jew Muslim or Christian but a simple believer in God. Someone that took God at his word and trusted in him. Moses to was not Jewish but he was not a child of Judah. These men brought hope to all people that there is a God who cares. Find Him and you'll be blessed. Many people are work to squeeze us into a mold but I don't think God cares about these man made molds. He cares that we are a child of man and we seek Him. Find Him and trust me He'll lead you from there. That is what this movie is about finding God and following Him.
Now as to the story, we open with a girl who has lost her mother some years ago and has come to grips with it yet still loves and misses her now and then. She is 12 and about to take a big stepping stone in her life. Her father then dies and leave her to be taken in by her uncle of another faith. The changes she goes through shakes her world to the core. Every choice she makes shapes her own belief in God, She learns to show her own faith not her father or mothers but her own faith.",1482710400,3,1649,3.8816568047337277

5272929,4,B00968THUG,"I will first say, the acting was not great. Clearly this was a low budget film. That being said, the subject of this movie is delicate, and one that has not been dealt with much in the arts. There was some concern about the characters being ""stereo typed"" to the point it could have been borderline offensive, but by the end, all the ends met and given the time allowed, they did a really good job at telling the story from all sides. Had some really great lines in it as well. I was pleased by the ending and even cried a little bit. The main character did a good job, and I liked the character of the therapist, his character brought it all together. This movie shows how difficult it can be to walk in a path of faith that is different from what you know and the courage and grace it takes to take that on. The subject matter may be confusing if you don't have a good understanding of the faiths involved, but a great conversation starter, especially for young teens. I really did enjoy this movie, I would love to see more made that can bridge the gap between the 2 faiths displayed in this movie.",1444521600,,1101,4.247619047619048

5272946,3,B00968THUG,"First of all the ""Messy Antic"" movement is largely one of confusion. From one congregation to the next they rarely believe and act upon the exact same thing. Many think it's all about being ""Jewish"" when in fact it's all about being an ""Israelite"" (not the country but the people). The Jewish people are but ONE of the 12 Tribes. ALL ascribe to follow the Torah/Tanakh. christianity knows NOTHING about this process nor the REAL things taught by Messiah Yahushua (his name wasn't jesus). christianity is entirely a man made religion, Judaism as it is today is actually a LOT of man added  traditions and regulations added to the Torah. A ""true"" Netzarim (follower of Messiah Yahushua) follows the Torah and the Moadim (appointed times of the Most High). It has nearly NOTHING to do with anything xtians observe (like christmas, easter and more pagan evolved holidays). It is so sad so many follow this ""mix and match"" Messianic movement instead of leaving their entire Gentile nature BEHIND. Just wanted to clear that up.",1385942400,,1021,4.867816091954023
5272947,3,B00968THUG,"This movie is very precious to me and Rivka is such a brave character standing up for her beliefs in a sea of discrimination that befalls her.  This is the only messianic film I've found, I hope there will be more made in the future.  I really love this story.

And while I love the story, the overall post-production editing really falls short of a decent film.  It's the problem that plagues most religious based movies- a choppy script and choppy editing.  They used great cameras, a great set, and the actors all had a lot of potential.  I feel that this movie would be its best if it was re-edited to leave less gaps in the dialogue, allowing the story line to flow more smoothly.",1385683200,3,685,4.396825396825397
5272948,4,B00968THUG,"This is the first Messianic movie I've ever seen or heard of so for that reason alone I want to support it.  The story line was good, though the ending was not very likely in reality.  The more ""real"" part was Rivka being told she would not be allowed to go along with the other kids to Israel, and the shul bringing in an anti-missionary speaker, and her friend no longer wanting anything to do with her.  I thought the girl, Anna Lasbury, did a good job in her role but the rest of the acting was lacking, unfortunately.

When I got to the end of the movie, I realized this was not just another great movie, but that this movie was what I consider to be the greatest movie that I have ever seen in all of my 42 years of life. The reason I consider to be the greatest movie that I have ever seen in my life is because at the end of the movie, I was actually crying. I have never and I mean that I have never had this kind of a reaction to a movie in my entire life. When I still think about the movie, I still shed a few tears and it has been over a year since I first seen this movie.

5272954,5,B00968THUG,"The Sound of the Spirit, a movie written by Michael Robert Wolf centers on twelve-year old Rivka.  Rivka is being raised by her widowed father who is estranged from his formerly close older brother.  Although Rivka's father would like reconciliation with his brother, the brother refuses.  Shortly after a brief meeting between the brothers, Rivka's father dies and she must now live with the brother and his wife.

While Rivka is trying to process her grief and loss of her father plus adjust to a new home, school, and friends, she must also face what has separated her father and his brother. Even though Rivka is under emotional duress she does try to keep from making emotional decisions while maintaining her personal beliefs.

What I like about Sound of the Spirit is Michael's willingness and gracious ability to address a hot religious topic by telling a very human story.  Please don't be ""put off"" by some of the reviews which take the focus off the movie story.  Watch Sound of the Spirit and let the movie speak for itself!",1372291200,,1036,4.754189944134078

5272958,3,B00968THUG,"This was the first movie I have ever seen with this confrontational story line. The part that grieved me was the embarrassment I felt by watching a movie that was sub par in script writing and especially the quality of the acting. The story line kept me watching it, but to be honest it was painful, due to the script and acting.  This debate is crucial for Christians around the world to watch. Jesus was a Jew, and just as much as it is hard for Jews to accept Christianity, my heart breaks that many churches turn their nose up at the Jews. I LOVE ISRAEL - my heart will always be connected with its land and people. This movie stirred me in a whole new way to want to see peace between Jews and Gentiles, for that reason I would say watch it. I only wish the movie held to the complete showing of love and peace between both sides. A NOTE TO THE WRITERS, EDITORS AND DIRECTORS: Please if you ever do a movie like this again, take more time to reach out to the Christian Arts. There are thousands who are professions in their areas.

Regardless of what denomination of Christianity or Judaism you follow, this movie will touch you and inspire you to listen to God's Spirit. The storyline is believable and well balanced between the two religions with respect and love towards both; a refreshing concept.

5272963,5,B00968THUG,"While viewing the Sound of the Spirit, I sought chiefly to discern the heart of the writer. I typically do this when watching a movie, that I might walk away from such with something to ponder--in my heart.  I believe most of us by default think too much--thus ignoring our hearts.  We are the product of the Westernized rationale.

Central to the movie is that of the relatively new phenomenon (within contemporary church history anyway) of an ancient theological debate over whether Jesus is in fact the Messiah--represented herein as the tension between Messianic-Jews and non-Messianic Jews.  And to dispel this tension we find 12 year old ""Rivka"" emerging as the humble voice serving to bridge the divide with ""the greatest of these"" - love.

Having met with several well known non-Messianic rabbis in Israel on two separate occasions, as well as having met several Messianic rabbis, I have come to conclude that theological and revelatory jewels can be found with both.  The riches to be found within historical Judaism are priceless.  Equally so, the experience and ""new birth"" to be found within Messianic Judaism is priceless.  It is when both jewels are combined that we meet with the treasure chest awaiting us all--""the Full Monte.""

Sound of the Spirit delicately probes this clash of belief systems.  And as the theological tension continues through the movie, we find it ultimately dissipating through the expression of love.  For it is during young Rivka's Bat Mitzvah that Rivka, who is a Messianic Jew, and who has yet agreed that her Bat Mitzvah would be held at her uncle's Reform Jewish synagogue; that she concludes her speech by quoting 1 Corinthians 13, ""...the greatest of these is love.""  And it is the love of God which then permeates the synagogue to envelope all present--both non-Messianic and Messianic Jews who are in attendance.  They are all arrested by the love of God spoken through this young girl.

The heart of the writer therefore, underscores that through love, and love alone, will we come to know and embrace the truth of the ages.  It is love which frees the mind to embrace God in His fullness.

The movie was refreshing, and I highly recommend it to all.",1357948800,5,2200,4.873655913978495
5272964,5,B00968THUG,"In researching for a movie script I was writing about a Jewish family, I became more familiar with a subculture within the subculture of Christianity that I was only vaguely familiar with, the Messianic Movement. I also discovered a battle going on between Messianic Jews and those who embrace pure Judaism, which denies that Jesus is the long awaited messiah. The movie, Sound of the Spirit, gives us a glimpse into that conflict.
First let me manage your expectations of the potential pleasures awaiting you by explaining what this movie was not. There are no prominent billboards bearing the message ""Jesus is the only way to Heaven"" in neon lettering, although a young girl's belief in Jesus drives the plot. It is also not a swashbuckler action thriller. If you only like movies which trigger adrenalin rushes, then I can tell you that this one is not for you. The conflict unfolds through conversation and conflicting ideas, which for this particular type of doctrinal war is realistic for civilized people. Dialogue based movies are not usually strong at keeping people's attention, and this one is over two hours long. I believe scenes could have been shortened or omitted to step up the pace of the movie. It was not boring for me, but it also was not one of those movies that you hate to arrive at the end.  I think that satisfied viewers either have to be curious about this battleground or be one of the participants in it to have a true appreciation for the content.  If you're a believer in Jesus Christ, I truly believe you should be curious and caring about the Jewish people, especially those who embrace the same savior as you do.

 A salient message of this film is that Jews who accept Jesus as messiah are still Jews and that insightful Christ followers do not attempt to purge people of their Jewishness after introducing them to Jesus. Another theme is that tolerance should prevail and we all should allow others to pursue a relationship with their Creator without disrespecting them for holding different beliefs than our own. The plot is designed to not offend people but to entice them to take down their shields of self defense, so that meaningful interchange of ideas can ensue.  Exposing the elephant in the middle of the room is a good thing. It is time for these two groups to see that they both serve the same God and that loving each other is not optional. There is a conflict here that will not go away. In Matthew 10:34, Jesus said that He came to bring a sword and not peace and that he would set brother against brother and father against son. He certainly did, although the reference of the sword involved separation and not violence. This movie does a great job of showing what happens within a family when one Jewish brother finds Jesus Christ and another brother rejects Him and division ensues. It also shows how those two opposing factions can come to understand that their true enemy is not each other. We are all just frail human beings doing the best we can to find truth and beauty in a world where deception and ugliness abound.  This movie will enhance our search for nobility.

Bottom line, I liked this movie, and I recommend it highly for those who enjoy cerebral and touchy/feely flicks. I think it could have been improved, but Monday morning quarterbacks and movie critics always use that line. At some point these parties need to arrive at the conclusion that they can explore truth together without fear of offending God. And perhaps they will realize that finding a consensus of truth is a mission impossible but that love never fails and that people's similarities far outweigh their differences, especially in the arena of our Creator.",1357257600,,3696,4.72093023255814
8536539,5,B00968THUG,Excellent film and every Jew who believes in Yeshua like myself can relate. I don't believe Yeshua came to start a new religion. I'm of Mizrahi Jewish heritage and my practices are Orthodox but I believe in Yeshua. I highly recommend this film to everyone.,1528070400,,256,4.711111111111111

8536542,3,B00968THUG,We've watched a lot of these low budget independent movies and watch them with certain expectations shall we say.  This one was pretty rough. The lead girl did a good job - that's about it.  It was also too long.  Their hearts were in the right place but my family and I would have to suggest you pass on this one.,1522540800,,314,4.114754098360656
8536543,3,B00968THUG,"The movie had some very good points. I only gave it three stars, however, because some of the main actors just couldn't act, which was distracting. The young lady, her father, boyfriend, aunt, the Messianic Rabi, other Rabi, and the Doctor/therapist, were all very convincing actors, which carried the storyline and kept the theme interesting. I especially enjoyed the ending... It packed a powerful message that made it all worthwhile!",1519257600,,436,5.242857142857143

8536546,5,B00968THUG,"There is a real struggle when we come to Yeshua from a Jewish background.  There is a big assumption that it separates us from our heritage.  This is a primary issue that is dealt with through love.  In this case, love won out, even though there was a big struggle.  The whole basis of following Yeshua (Jesus) is love from a pure heart.  Watch this movie and be prepared to be challenged yourself!",1512259200,,398,4.397260273972603
8536547,5,B00968THUG,I loved it!  I am not Jewish but found it very enlightening as to the divisions between religions even those of Jewish faith.  The acting was very basic however the star of this story is actress Anna Lasbury who gave a great performance.,1510358400,,237,4.488372093023256
