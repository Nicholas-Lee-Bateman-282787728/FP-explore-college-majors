1633953,5,B00005NGAF,"This masterpiece in disguise comes from the depths of the model industry, and seeps through the life of one model who was a former hockey star.  She was discovered, and little did she know, she was going to be taken on a whirlwind of the fashion business.  The main character is portrayed greatly by real life model Jessica Pare, she is taken into a world where the truth lies still and she's not exactly ready to handle it all.  Instead she dives in headfirst and comes out with not only the aftermath of the business, but the scars that remains within her memories.
This great movie shows you how a model's life is like through the photographer's eyes.  He captures intense and entertaining moments of this model's life and most of all, you should understand that this should be a big accomplish for this guy who is filming all of this.  It is sort of like a documentary, and interview session mixed in with our views on everyday life for this model.  It reminds me of Gia, which was also a movie that brought viewers on a journey through a model's life.  Stardom is great to watch, it abandons you, alter your thoughts while you want what she has, but in the end, you should be happy with what you have.  Stardom can be exhilarating, yet this movie leaves you an honest trace of what the business and money can do to you.  Plus, it shows how many people in this world doesn't take models seriously, all they see is glitz and glamorous.",1041120000,,1438,4.437262357414449
1633954,4,B00005NGAF,"Deftly directed by Denys Arcand, this is an inventive, highly stylized film about an athletic and beautiful, teenage girl who plays hockey, Tina Menzhal, and her transition to international celebrity and super model. Her life is seen exclusively through the eyes of the various media. This is a fast paced, eclectic, imaginative, and innovative look at a young celebrity and her interactions with those around her, as well as her various romantic relationships. Tina's rise to stardom is shown through a number of media montages. The viewer sees her life progress through the eyes of a camera and the media, at all times, whether it be talk shows, newscasts, a cinema verite documentary, music videos, or fashion shoots. This is a totally engrossing film, as if the viewer were taking a naughty peak into the life of another. It is voyeurism at its best. At the same time, it is a biting, funny, and sad commentary on celebrity life.
Beautiful Jessica Pare, a real life model, is wonderful as Tina, bringing a certain wide-eyed naivete to the role. Dan Ackroyd is very good as the successful restauraneur who, during a midlife crisis, sacrifices his family and his business to be with Tina, only to find himself caught in an obsession that ends badly. Robert LePage is drolly funny as the cameraman who seeks to record every moment of Tina's life. Hunky Thomas Gibson is sensational as Tina's agent, a cooly cynical master of the universe. Frank Langella is terrific as a controlling and urbane diplomat with very set ideas about the role of a wife. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent. The film alternates between a black and white and color picture, which adds to its overall quirkiness. This Canadian film deserves kudos!",1031702400,13,1738,4.875
1633955,4,B00005NGAF,"Having watched and enjoyed Jesus of M., I picked this up -despite- what looked like a rather cliched premise - I'm -very- glad that I did. While told in a fashion sure to appeal to ADD sufferers everywhere (...) this is a highly taut, biting inquisition on celebrity, sex and everything else irrelevant in life. This movie shows exactly how most people think about the entire modern media world.
Having a super-model playing a super-model works better than you (or do I mean I?) might think - and the supporting cast all turn in good to excellent performances. -very- worth a watch.",1008460800,5,582,4.715686274509804

7947133,5,B00005NGAF,"(Great price!)

Several years ago for a short time, I traveled in some of the social circles this movie depicts - the models,  the restaurateurs, the fashion designers, the artists, the writers, the media pundits, and the people who make themselves victims by their obsession with physical beauty.
This movie captures it all, especially the arcs of the characters.
The movie did not do well at the box office, because, I suspect, it shows both the fun side and some of the unglamorous truths. It avoided the usual feel good Hollywood ending.
Dan Aykroyd took a huge risk here as an artist; he portrays his character as flawed, not funny; Aykroyd takes you within a sad, complex, and eventually a self-destructive ""everyman"" - far from his usual comic roles.

If you are smart, get this movie and take it to heart. It may save you a lot of disappointment and even grief!",1362873600,4,869,4.703947368421052
7947134,5,B00005NGAF,"Zermgarde Skrudlind (55), the fashion model on whose life this movie is based, was murdered last month (August 2011) on her wine estate, about 5 kilometers outside Stellenbosch (South Africa).

Zermgarde's dark sense of humor, which she attributed to her Polish upbringing, shines through in this unique  Arcand-movie.

(She and her family escaped from Poland in 1968 when she was 12 years old, and they eventually settled in rural France.)

She appears as herself (un-credited by her request) in the movie (Scene 11) in the Stock-Exchange-Visit, the  blond super model walking next to the Jessica-character -- and I urge you to watch that scene again, because  it reflects the person she really was:

Apart from her beauty, it shows her outgoing personality, her friendliness and attention to everybody around  her, and her way of floating through a room, leaving everyone breathless.

The TV-report (Scene 14) of the assault on her by Dan Aykroyd's character which interrupted the segment on the  Algerian-massacre on 412 woman and children, was based on a real event when she visited South Africa in 1976:

The assault on her took place on June 15th, 1976 in Johannesburg, and was  bumped-up (as breaking news!) in the newscast on June 17th when the Soweto-uprise-report was terminated by order of the then Aparthate-Regime.

In the talk-show with Philippe Gascon (Scene 3), Zermgarde's daughter is actually sitting right next to the  Jessica-character in the audience.

She spend a great deal of time in Canada and France while the movie was filmed, and that turned out to be the  last time she left South Africa.

Although the movie portrays her as 'the blond is inside', she had many facets to her personality and was  actually an extremely intelligent woman.

I once asked her about her favorite scene in the movie, and she answered immediately: ""The last one"".

She then told me that she and Jessica spoke many hours before the final scene was shot about their respective  lives in the fashion industry. Jessica never rehearsed this scene during these talks, and the scene was only  shot twice.

Asking Zermgarde what her thoughts would be if she had to play that scene herself, she simply turned her face away and never answered me.

I treasure this movie as a cult-movie-still-to-be-discovered, and recommend it without reservation.",1316131200,,2342,5.054830287206267

7947136,4,B00005NGAF,"The cult of celebrity and beauty is exposed in the blackest humor by Denys Arcand with the hysterical ""Stardom.""  Jessica Pare as Tina Menzel is a vacuous beauty never allowed to be more than pretty face and sexy body. The casting of mostly Canadian actors, Dan Ackroyd (SNL), Thomas Gibson (Dahrma and Greg), and newcomer Pare are ensemble perfection in a scathing parody of entertainment television, expose documentaries, fashion, and confrontational talk shows. Frank Langella (HBO Unscripted) who rarely is seen in comedic roles portrays the stuffy Blaine de Castillion, an aging minor diplomat who marries Menzel, his young trophy wife only to be overthrown for another monosyllabic athletic type.

Menzel as characterized by Pare is the uneducated, unsophisticated, and naive young girl swept to the heights of fashion and celebrity solely by the manipulation of others. She is a victim of both men and women of the vapid fashion and art trade that cashes in at her expense.  The modeling world which Tina inhabits is revealed  with stunning cinematography as Arcand strips away the layers of commercialism that relies on selling notions of youth and physical perfection like Menzel.  No pc topic is overlooked by Arcand who takes a swipe at Canada's First Nation's eco-hype and indigenous spirituality, PETA animal rights fanaticism, heavily accented, and pretentious Toronto ET-like reporters, Canadian ice hockey, and feminist-lesbian-politics -- all with hilarious results.

Gibson as the steely agent for a multinational public relation agency who represents Tina never permits his client to be anything but an innocent yet desirable money-making commodity. Gibson's brief b/w screen time reflected roots of high production cosmetic ads, and with Pare, is beautifully photographed to highlight the couple's physical attractiveness although theirs is the only relationship never consumated.  His droll performance is ambiguous and dead on esp. teaching a 400-level Yale course in ""Sports and Celebrity Entertainment"" and warning students of Millie-Vanilli versus Celine Dion talent spotting.

With little exposure beyond HBO, ""Stardom"" continues to be true to the reality-TV trend.  Yet, it was ahead of its time particularly in forecasting the reactions to full frontal nudity and actress, Meg Ryan that unfortunately have come true.  Arcand's film is so subtle with drollness and satire that much of its  humor may fly over non-Canadian audience failing to grasp the sources of regional and nationalistic jibes.  There are no sacred cows in Arcand's stable, just sharply insider commentary on the cult of celebrity.  A film that should be included in every home collection.",1129852800,3,2685,5.456521739130435

But the makers of Stardom do know enough to make you laugh.  This movie is terrific.  It's as artsy and pretentious as the people it makes fun of.  for example, all the whole movie is seen as footage taken from other filmmakers and tv shows.  It mercilessly pokes fun at models, designers, rich people, and fashion.
