8518478,5,B007JT7SDC,I became a very big fan of KARA shortly before buying this DVD. I've been a k-pop fan for a long time but fell off for a while. When i started checking out the scene again I was drawn to KARA immediately. This DVD was a excellent purchase for me. The subtitles were a plus because I didn't think there were any. It has all versions of STEP and the interviews and making of were very nice. Any lovers of KARA should definitely get this.,1386720000,,435,4.129411764705883
8518479,5,B007JT7SDC,"I ordered this through Amazon--I don't remember if it was a direct or third-party sale, but usually I have to buy Asian pop music from Asian or Los Angeles based vendors.  The product arrived promptly and in perfect condition, and the DVD recording is top-quality without defects (something that is not always the case when I have bought from sellers in Asia).  One DVD is a fabulous music video of the Kara female singing group, and the second DVD shows the group rehearsing and other scenes and discussions with group members.  Kara is one of the most popular groups in Korea and in Japan.  If you want an album that could immediately become your favorite one--this may be it!",1360108800,,678,4.6722689075630255
8518480,5,B007JT7SDC,"First of I thought it'll be a big packaging judging from the image,
but it has a really nice small size to it. At least it won't take up too much space.

Packaging is very beautiful and I really love the design.
The photo book... well let's just say it's worth having
in my Kara collection.

Another item I'll most definitely treasure in mint condition.",1349913600,,353,4.415384615384616
