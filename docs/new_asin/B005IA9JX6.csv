8474387,3,B005IA9JX6,"I'm a fan of Conrad Nagel, especially his voice. His speaking voice so clear, melodious, and has such a pleasant timbre. He gets lots of speaking in this film, so I love watching it just to hear him talk. His performance is excellent as well; he gives a sincere and riveting performance. The rest of the cast is nothing to write home about. Nagel keeps the film interesting and moving forward, otherwise it would probably be quite dull. However, it is a clever story and has the potential to be an engaging courtroom drama.
The film quality is so-so; the white has a tendency to be washed out/over-exposed. At the beginning, there is a piece of fuzz/string in the lower left corner that ""waves"" along for a little while. There is some ""hum"" in the sound, but the voices are all clear. All the movies I've bought that are released by Alpha Home Entertainment have been mediocre in sound and film quality, but at least these obscure films are available to watch. Perhaps someday they will be remastered.",1373760000,,1001,4.629213483146067
