7999895,2,B0000D1FIV,"This is a fine example of a great concept falling flat. Basically you have an Irish narrator telling different tales of Irish folklore. He does so in a jovial manner with a brisk Irish accent.

Meanwhile, all we see on the screen are shots of countryside, castles, and occasional revelers in a pub or somewhere.

Although the stories are interesting, the scenery is lovely, and the music is enchanting, none of it really seems to fit together. And it definitely is not conducive to an enjoyable DVD watching experience.

I agree with the reviewer who said a book of photography and a CD of stories would have served the same purpose, and probably would have been more enjoyable becuase you could control which pictures to look at when you wanted. This DVD is really not worth watching unless you're very very interested in Irish folklore and have nowhere else to go to hear stories.",1167782400,5,882,4.714285714285714
7999896,3,B0000D1FIV,"This one was a disappointment. It does indeed narrate some interesting Irish myths and legends. That's about all it does, however. The narration is the only worthwhile part of the DVD.

This is not to say that it does not contain some beautiful scenery or that some of the music is good. Both statements are true but they are not the stuff of great DVDs. That's a shame. This could have been done so much better.

The format is simple. A narrator tells tales while the screen shows scenes of countryside and occasional castle and with some Irish music playing in the background. The background music comes to the fore during long pauses between stories and during pauses within individual stories. All the while, the scenery continues on.

I would have preferred a book for the scenery and a simple cassette would have sufficed for the stories.",1119139200,10,844,4.727891156462585
7999897,3,B0000D1FIV,"This movie uses historic and popular tour venues as backdrops for explantions of several Irish legends and myths. If you're looking for a series of stories performed by Irish actors, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you're planning a trip to Ireland - or if you've returned from a tour of the Emeral Isle - this is worth the investment. The narration provides an introduction to locations like the Rock of Cashel and Blarney Castle through a retelling of the stories that make these sites significant points of interest.",1080518400,8,529,4.824175824175824
