7887999,5,6305340536,"Although all the Secrets of War DVDs generally get good reviews, this one's a little different -- it's twice as long as any of the others, and still the same price!
This contains 4 hour-long programs (each one's actually 52min. since there aren't any commercials).  Anyhow, that's about 3 1/2 hours for 10 bucks.
The documentaries are each very good -- some of them are a little densely-packed, so you may find yourself rewinding a few times to catch everything.  Although there are some interviews and the requisite pan across a photo while the narrator tells the story with the stirring (or foreboding) music, these documentaries consist mostly of wartime footage (which is good, you didn't pay your money to spend the time staring at a map).  They are very well done, with a lot of good information.  Narration, writing, and editing all come together to make a comprehensive and informative product.
Lastly, picture quality and sound are decent, even with the wartime footage (sound effects added later, of course).  Highly recommended.",1017446400,14,1039,5.017441860465116
7888000,5,6305340536,"This is an excellent documentary for people interested in the second WW. If you like to see how spy networks are created and how magic, yes magic, is used on the battlefield as a tool of deception. How the british made believe the desert fox (General Rommel) that they had a 100 tanks when there was only 2-3 on the battlefield. Just buy the DVD it's worth it, and Charlton Heston does a great job narrating it.",976838400,12,411,4.35064935064935
7888001,5,6305340536,"I'm not a real fan of documentaries, however lately I've been interested in WWII. This is a fantastic glimpse into the intelligence and spy aspect of that war. Charleton Heston does a wonderful job as narrator. A must see  for anyone interested in intelligence work or WWII in general.",924220800,12,285,4.816326530612245
