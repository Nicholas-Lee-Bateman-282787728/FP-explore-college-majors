4214414,5,B003WOSKOY,"Great performances by Brenda Bleythin and late Sotigui Konyat&eacute;.

A beautiful depiction of a father and a mother, trying to understand the world their kids live(d) in, in horrible circumstances.

Bigger message is that with lots of things trying to tear us apart, our humanity keeps us together.  In fact we don't have a choice but to understand each other and live together.

4214415,5,B003WOSKOY,"After the crude aftermath of 07/07/05 in London, Elzabeth (Brenda Bleythin)who works as farmer in Guernsey, devout Christian decides to go London after failing to hear from her daughter. On the other hand Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyate) is a  West African Muslim who has come from France to find his missing son.

Both parents are unknowingly inextricably linked by the traps of destiny and will face more call the tragedy of racial prejudice or religious beliefs.

A concise and memorable film, where nothing is reiterative, which had a flawless script, masterful performances and superb direction both behind the scenes of Bouhareb Rachid.

A bold, stark and bleak movie that takes a tiny portion of this collective tragedy that rocked the city of London in that fateful year.

You can not ignore one of the thirty best films of this decade for the world. I recommend it widely.

P.D. This film deserved to Sotigui Konyat the Silver Bear Prize as Best Actor 2009. And at the same time, was his last film, due he passed away in 2010.",1316044800,17,1028,4.8125

4214417,5,B003WOSKOY,"Like hundreds maybe thousands of parents who worry about their children after a terrorist bombing, this film brings us two different parents reactions and actions. Brenda Blethyn, one of my favorite British actors, plays Elizabeth Sommers, and Malian Muslim Ousmane, who is played by Sotigul Kouyat&eacute;.

Elizabeth is a farmer, living in Guernsey, and Ousmane has been working in France as a forester for 15 years. Elizabeth watches as the bombings unfold on her television, it is July of 2005. She calls her daughter multiple times a day with no response. She finally decides to go to London and search for herself. Ousmane travels from France at the urging of his ex wife to find the son he left at age of six. This film observes them as they travel daily looking for their children. Separately at first, but then they find common ground, and join forces. A warm, emotional film that is so well acted and directed. I loved this film.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-26-17",1506384000,3,977,4.879518072289157

4214429,4,B003WOSKOY,"A thought-provoking movie that will leave you unnerved and perhaps mystified with its conclusion. Two gentle people with disparate backgrounds seek the whereabouts of their respective children unheard from since the terrorist bombings in London. The bombing, horrific in its nature, joins two parents in the search for their missing children, two parents whose paths would not have crossed otherwise. They learn there is enough similarity in their human responses to the disappearance of their children to overcome their differences in virtually every other respect. As news of their search becomes hopeful then grim the range of emotions is brilliantly portrayed by Brenda Blethyn. The final scene shows anger and resentment perhaps a little puzzling given their gentle nature as both parents move to a new reality of the world.",1403740800,2,829,5.384615384615385
4214430,5,B003WOSKOY,"I didn't know if I'd like this film - but I watched it, and I was not disappointed. I love Brenda Blethyn (I love her in Vera) and I love multi-cultural stories - plus, I love London! This film had good pacing, writing and editing. Both lead actors playing the parents were superb. However, I was swept away by the power of Blethyn's performance.",1396828800,,346,4.421875
4214431,4,B003WOSKOY,"If you enjoy movie that expand your emotional horizon, you will like it. The movie revolves around the events of London Bombing and how four lives intersect through death, violence and parental love. Of course, it deals with race relations and inherent tensions expected in a multicultural and multi-racial society. I am an implanted American, and this movie will have different appeal to American audience that, say a British one; it's simply because the dynamics of race relations and fear of the unknown take a different form in different societies. Yet, the movie tried to create a thread to connect various pieces of human experience. You can easily notice symbolism and unintentional nudge from the director about race, gender, religion, situations that are socially inevitable, and a total encourage to accept ourselves as not too different from the guy/girl who look so different at first glimpse. Four star, because I think the camer work could be better. The two main characters did excellent job.",1385769600,,1007,5.146341463414634
4214432,5,B003WOSKOY,This is a must see for anyone who wants to understand the worldwide effects of terror strikes. To see people in other countries face the loss and not knowing in the same manner we do when terror comes to the states. I am a huge Brenda Blethyn fan which is what drew me to this film and she delivered a wonderful performance in the work. The supporting cast is equally wonderful,1370131200,,377,4.323943661971831
4214433,5,B003WOSKOY,"This a wonderful and touching movie and Brenda Blethyn is the reason! Although a difficult and painful story to watch, it is filled with emotion, warmth and love. Truly a must see!",1349481600,2,180,4.65625
4214434,3,B003WOSKOY,"This is a suspenseful story that moves @ a snail's pace. There are plenty of misunderstandings, stereotypes & mistrust to get through. You really must understand British ladies of a certain age to figure out why she seems to be so obtuse.
This movie makes you think...a lot. Well written & acted, just slow on the uptake-keep with it, you'll be rewarded in the end.",1342828800,3,365,4.630769230769231
4214435,5,B003WOSKOY,"Directed by Rachid Bouchareb, this movie is set in England during and following the bus bombings of July seventh, 2005.  A long widowed mother, Elisabeth (Brenda Blethyn) has been watching the happenings on her television during the day, leaving messages for her daughter, Jane, to call her back. Where is her daughter who is prompt in returning calls?

Elisabeth lives in the lush countryside by the river on a small farm.  She spends her days doing many different things with tending to her animals and with her church activity.  She frequents the cemetery where her husband, William, has been laid to rest after his service in the war.  She talks to him as if they were carrying on a conversation and also sees her brother Edward at the farm.  Hers is a simple but fulfilling life.

A lone man, Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyate), has traveled from Africa fifteen years prior, now residing in France although has journeyed to London.  He has come to look for his son Ali, after the bombing has caused him to go missing.  Ousmane had promised his wife that he will find and return him to his family in Africa.  Ousmane and his wife live separate lives, although their son is first priority.

Elisabeth becomes more and more desperate while waiting for the phone to ring with Jane safely on the line, although no call comes for her.  The next morning she quickly goes into London to her daughter's flat.  Jane is not there and hasn't been since the day before.  Elisabeth starts the necessary steps to search for her daughter while during this time Ousmane is doing the same for his son Ali.

The movie poses: How in the world does this unlikely pair meet to search for their children?  What do they find alike in each other?  Along with, Could it be possible to not find their children alive?

This is a very human story which is very slow paced, happily so for me.  It gave time to really drink in the deep emotions that come to the surface and the blending of two completely opposite people as far as religious beliefs.  Exploring more of the pain and the depth of feeling in the characters of Elisabeth and Ousmane through this horrid situation.  The director digs deep with Brenda Blethyn to bring out a range of pure gut-wrenching pain to happiness and everything in between.  She is just spectacular in this movie, as is Sotigui Kouyate in his own quiet expressive way.

Be ready to run the 'gamut' in this scenic and overtly emotional movie.",1331510400,8,2441,4.625581395348838

8407450,5,B003WOSKOY,"While it is hard to say, ""Wonderful"", considering the reality of the event, it is a very good production and presentation.
The presentation of the facts of what it can be like for the family and friends of those innocents killed is done with
an honoring of those whose lives were taken from family and friends. I appreciate the sensitivity of parents looking for their
children and the necessity of seeing shortened lives in respect to what life they were making for themselves. A loving tribute
to those who lost their lives. I hope others watch this.",1514505600,,552,4.701030927835052

8407452,5,B003WOSKOY,"Excellent in its poignancy. Sotigui Kouyat's performance makes the film not only believable, but worth every second spent watching him portray a conflicted father in a land not his own, looking for a son he does not know.",1511913600,,221,4.842105263157895
8407453,5,B003WOSKOY,"As any parent knows, not knowing where your child might be or if they are safe is gut wrenching. This movie takes us through how although people have different languages, religions and culture as parents we share an iron bond for the welfare of our children. The common language of love. This movie sets a realistic pace and it continues on to show that this love can uniquely overcome the many barriers that keep us from understanding we are all so very much the same. It's a beautiful walk towards acceptance of our differences and arriving at our deepest commonalities. A truly engrossing film, beautifully portrayed and
Exquisitely acted by the perfect pair of actors . I can tell you it's one of the most enduring and poinent films and I am so happy I took the time to watch.",1511308800,3,780,4.578571428571428
