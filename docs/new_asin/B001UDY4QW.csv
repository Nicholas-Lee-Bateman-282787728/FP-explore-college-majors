8343368,1,B001UDY4QW,"I was hoping for more from this product. I know the description says that it is 11 min. long but the title, to me, was a little deceptive. ""Building a Solar Home"" should have read ""A really brief look at Solar Energy"" You can get much more information from just reading a few articles on building a solar home. This was more like an infomercial with nothing to sell at the end. While the photography was nice it has no substance past a brief explanation of Solar Power and certainly does not justify the money spent for it. I returned this item. Don't waste your money.",1281484800,,569,4.377358490566038
