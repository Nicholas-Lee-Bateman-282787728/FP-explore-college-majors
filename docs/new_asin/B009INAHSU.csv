5340581,3,B009INAHSU,"My two favorite cities in Europe are London and Paris (I also like Tokyo, but that's in Asia). Europe also has smaller cities that I like, but not as much as the big two, including Amsterdam, Berlin, and Copenhagen. I decided to purchase this DVD. It features vignettes of Marlin Darrah's visits to 33 cities in Europe, the vast majority of which I never heard of. He made some questionable choices in choosing cities. He chose Moscow and St. Petersburg- and Vladimir Putin doesn't exactly love the United States. He also chose some random cities in Spain and off the Mediterranean. Several high-profile cities were left out, including Madrid and Berlin. The segments for Copenhagen and Amsterdam were quite short. In Copenhagen, he showed Tivoli Gardens, the Little Mermaid, and the Copenhagen Opera House, but it felt like a rushed segment. He barely spent two minutes in Amsterdam. He DIDN'T visit Vondel Park, a Coffee Shop, or the Anne Frank Museum.

The Rome episode was better. In Rome (which isn't one of my favorite cities), he visited the Arch of Constantine, the Colosseum, Campo de Fiori, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon, Vantican City, and several fountains.

In the City of Lights, he visited the Eiffel Tower, Luxembourg Gardens, Museo de Orsay, Champs Elysses, Tuileries, the Louvre, took a cruise on the River Seine, visited the Notre Dame, and stopped by the Latin Quarter, which reminded me of the Village in NYC. He rode the Metro where he encountered two attractive women. This lasted 17 minutes and it was the best episode of the DVD (I personally prefer London over Paris, though both are spectacular cities).

On the other side of the English Channel, Marlin visited the London Eye, Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Kings Cross (rail terminal), Westminster Abbey, St. James Park, Buckingham Palace (Changing of the Guard), Piccadilly Circus (which looks like Times Square), and Leicester (lester) Square. Marlin missed some of London's iconic attractions like Harrods, but you can't cover all of London on a single visit.

I wish Marlin simply stuck to the 10-15 most popular cities in Europe (London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, ...) but increased the amount of time he spent covering those 10 cities. By trying to cover 33 cities, he came out with a diluted product. I would still recommend this DVD as a supplement to Rick Steves.",1422489600,6,2379,4.984886649874055
5340582,2,B009INAHSU,"Beautiful photography, but incredibly poor narration... Wooden, &, what is worse, providing mangled pronunciation of non-English language names & places... Don't know if I can continue viewing; maybe I'll turn off the sound...",1413676800,,226,5.878787878787879
5340583,5,B009INAHSU,"This DVD was excellent, the photography was wonderful, This DVD is good for travellers that have been to Europe before, it brings back fond memories. It's also appropriate for first time visitors, you could plan a wonderful itinerary with this DVD as an example. The only problem I have with this DVD is Mr. Darrah's repeated mis-pronunciation of numerous Italian words (being of Italian descent, this annoys me), he may also mis-pronouce other foreign words, but I don't speak those languages, so I don't know about those. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",1400889600,3,561,4.9787234042553195
5340584,2,B009INAHSU,What no Madrid in the video? Was the weather going to be bad the day of film? The video should be 34 cities to include Madrid. The art in Madrid art alone make is an important city in Europe. Add the Spanish food and wine found in Madrid there is no excuse for this city not be in the DVD.,1385942400,4,289,3.8333333333333335
5340585,3,B009INAHSU,"There is a lot of good video footage on this disk....but also a lot of unnecessary long stretches where you see only tourists doing normal tourist stuff that you could see anywhere.  Boring and a waste of time.

The narrator has a very distracting habit of pausing inappropriately or not at all.....e.g., between locations there will be no pause or appropriate inflection denoting that a location's narrative is about to be stopped...and then the next location narrative starts up like it's a continuation of previous narration about that next location when it is, in fact, the first thing being said.  This, along with his deplorable pronunciation of famous people's names and location names, had a negative effect...in my opinion.",1385510400,8,732,5.1344537815126055
5340586,5,B009INAHSU,We truly  enjoyed the dvd of Great Cities of Europe  We have visited many of the cities on this dvd  and it was so nice to see the cities again  The dvd is nicely done and the filming is wonderful It is a really good way to see history and the sites  We are very happy that Amazon have the travel dvd's available,1372982400,8,312,3.888888888888889
5340587,2,B009INAHSU,This video was somewhat odd.  It showed typical places in a variety of cities but the narration was a little on the dull side--also it would focus at times on odd things for a long time.,1368662400,5,186,4.166666666666667
5340588,5,B009INAHSU,"I liked the format of this dvd, and the cities and areas included . The HD format is beautiful, I would buy more dvd,s by this company. Signed Daunn Munn.",1368403200,7,154,4.166666666666667

8542027,2,B009INAHSU,"Mangling of city names and places has already been mentioned. I also did not like the frequent quotations, which were gratuitous in this context. I did enjoy seeing places I've never heard of, such as small, ancient cities in Croatia. I fast-forwarded through episodes of handsome young women and gorgeous food, except the produce markets. It sure could have been much better with more care taken, especially with the Italian pronunciation. It's not that hard! Just ask an Italian speaker and do your best.",1464134400,,506,5.035714285714286
