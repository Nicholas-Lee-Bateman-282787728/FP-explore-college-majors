8430318,2,B004I8Z26W,This anime series and live action version  is very good  no complaints  on that !!but I  will give this 2 stars because  I just can't understand why Amazon is allowing these people or seller's to rack up the price so high where no one can afford it it's obvious no one's going to buy this anime at these high original prices get a clue.,1510704000,,336,4.1875
8430319,5,B004I8Z26W,I really enjoyed this tv show.,1480809600,,30,4.166666666666667
8430320,2,B004I8Z26W,"It's cute, but the anime is better and the Taiwanese adaptation is 10000000 times better.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend this version of the tale. Not saying it's not good just there's definitely better and with it being pretty much the same as the others but with more of a rushed? feel to it.",1471046400,,297,4.60377358490566
8430321,3,B004I8Z26W,"First, I will tell you that to me this  is a good enough drama. But many people would be disappointed if they made the mistake that I did.  This  is NOT ""Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo"" from 2013-- rather, it is from 1996, and it seems it was the first televised version of the popular manga.

The production quality isn't all that great, so while I watched the first chapters I tried to figure out when it was from (there isn't any information about the year on the DVDs or the box, at all). And it could have been from the 1980s even, I thought, since it looked dated enough to make me wonder. It definitely looks like a low-budget drama.  Even the date 1996 surprised me after I looked it up on Wikipedia.  So that's why I assume it's a bit low budget. If I had known, I would not have bought it, of course, because what I wanted to see was the 2013 Japanese version known as ""Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo"" before I saw the Korean version (also sold under the title ""Mischievous Kiss"").

It's my fault because I should have looked more closely into what I was actually purchasing, I know.
I thought that if I posted this clarification,though, it may
help someone else avoid making the same  mistake! :)",1411689600,9,1209,4.366071428571429
