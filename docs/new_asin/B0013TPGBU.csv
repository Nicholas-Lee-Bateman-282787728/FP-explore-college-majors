8296247,1,B0013TPGBU,"This is incredibly bad. How can such junk be edited? Absolutely without interest. No comments, just pictures. I stopped it after half an hour and threw it away. Save your money.",1367107200,2,177,4.741935483870968
8296248,1,B0013TPGBU,"While I appreciate the effort it must have taken to create this video, I was expecting something more along the lines of a documentary, not just endless video shots of plane wreckage in New York with amateurish voice-overs. I am a fan of ""Air Crash Investigations"" and ""Seconds from Disaster""-type shows where they explain what led to the accident and how it was investigated. This is just a voyeuristic journey into the actual crashes. If I could have rented or previewed it, I never would have purchased it.",1362009600,8,509,4.795454545454546
8296249,1,B0013TPGBU,"This DVD is thrown together footage (mostly poorly taken amateur clips), spotty and bad narration... and overall, not worth the money.
The interesting pictures in this video could be spliced into an acceptable 30 minute presentation.
Buyer beware, this product is not at all good.",1312070400,4,280,5.2444444444444445
8296250,1,B0013TPGBU,"ACTUALLY I POSTED ABOUT THE WRONG MOVIE. IT WAS THIS ONE THAT WASN'T GOOD ""PLANE DOWN"".  THE ONE CALLED ""CRASH"" WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER.  SORRY FOR THE MYSTAKE.",1293148800,,157,4.571428571428571
8296251,5,B0013TPGBU,"Just recently purchased Mr. Spaks latest DVD and found it Excellent,he captures all of the action taken by responding Emergency Personel working at the scene of several different aircraft disasters. This is the second video that I purchased in addition to his videos taken at the World Trade Center disaster on Sept 11, 2001. I also found several of his pictures in our daily newspapers and also noticed his work in the trade magazine ""Firehouse"" I am looking forward to his next video. He has a web page if anyone would like to see some great pictures that he posted. stevespak.com",1203206400,2,582,4.772277227722772
