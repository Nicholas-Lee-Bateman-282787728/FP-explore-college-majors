8156562,3,B000KGGZVM,"My best guess is that this is an ""R"" rated version of a hard core movie. I

have seen this done with another movie. It was "" It's Called Murder Baby"".

This was the ""R"" rated title and I forgot what the hard core title was. Anyway, I suspect that this is the case here, which actually adds a little substance to the movie by concentrating more on the story and less on the sex. I recognized a whole slew of porn stars, including Ron Jeremy,

in this thing, that is why I suspect that there is a Hard core version of this somewhere under a different title. All things considered, it was OK, not great, but watchable. It is probably better suited to rental rather than sale. After watching it, I was glad that it wasn't a hard core flick, by abbreviating the sex it left more time for a story.
