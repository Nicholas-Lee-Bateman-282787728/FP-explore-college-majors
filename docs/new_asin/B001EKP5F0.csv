3555401,4,B001EKP5F0,"I haven't seen these films beyond the trailers yet however I wanted to comment on the packaging which I found to be a bit odd. All 3 DVD's were stacked one on top of the other in a single large hub. Very strange indeed. All 3 features are in color and have English subtitles available..

Man from Colorado is 1:33 with the folowing trailers playing before the movie starts. Gilda, Silverado, Bridge On The River Kwai. It should be possible to skip these by using your meny botton on the remote but I didn't try that. You can view the trailers from the special features menu if you wish to.

The Man From Laramie is 2:35 & goes directly to the main menu. You will find the trailer in the special features menu. There are no other trailers on this disc. There is an audio menu with a choice of the original 3 channel sound for a Dolby Digital system or 2 channel stereo.

Man In The Saddle is 1:33 and also goes directly to the main menu. The special features menu plays the following trailers. Silverado, The Professionals, Major Dundee, Glory, and then a compilation trailer for several western movies. 3 movies for $14.99 to me was a good deal & I'll be playing all 3 soon.",1230076800,11,1174,4.376146788990826

3555411,5,B001EKP5F0,"Each western by itself is a good western. Packaged as 3 different westerns for $10 (what I paid) is what gets it a 5 star. Man from Colorado, a dark western in what can go wrong in a Civil War veteran. Man from Laramie, a strong Stewart western (best of the 3 and filmed at 2:35 to boot). Man in the Saddle, better then the typical Scott western.",1256083200,6,346,4.102941176470588
