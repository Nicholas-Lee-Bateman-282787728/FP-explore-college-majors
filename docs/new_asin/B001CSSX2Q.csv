It appeared recently and I purchased the DVD and the good old days returned. A powerful cast set in a French sector of the western front. Some terrific battle sequences but the plot carries two stories: a steamy romantic triangle and a father and son struggle amid the brutality of trench warfare. Warner Baxter is terrific in his role as the commander of the French infantry unit that faces the Germans and let me say, June Lang is stunning in her role as the love interest. She looks fabulous and for some reason, she bailed out of the film world shortly after this classic was released.
If you like classic old films with some great character actors and decent amounts of combat and excellent set production  then this is one you must watch. And the ending, the rolling artillery barrage and... well you gotta see it.
As they say, they sure don't make 'em like this anymore.
Five strands of barbed wire and one black choker for this lost gem.",1375833600,17,1081,4.4873096446700504
3517861,5,B001CSSX2Q,"This was one of the few Hawks films I hadn't seen previously.  I should no longer be surprised when I see a lesser known Hawks film that the lack of attention it has received is not because of any want in quality.  It was the second script Faulkner worked on for Hawks, who was responsible for bringing him to Hollywood in the first place.  Legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland bring his mastery to the film as well.  The acting is uniformly gripping.  I can't talk about some of the best aspects of the film's construction without spoiling it for those watching for the first time.  It is set in World War I and tells the story of a French troop with a long, distinguished record and especially about the three principle characters.  As with most Hawks films, the individual scenes are so engrossing that it is not until you've seen the film at least once that you discover how meticuluously everything fits together.  A very moving story with a few surprises.  One thing I can tell without spoiling the movie.  There is a scene when the troop in the trenches discovers that the Germans are building a tunnel under them to blow them up.  They must hold their post and hope they can somehow miraculously survive.

Though the product has the titles in Spanish, you have the option of watching it with or without subtitles.  Once you hit play, everything is fine.  The quality of the print is excellent and the price is right.",1284681600,10,1426,4.58498023715415

8289128,4,B001CSSX2Q,"Like the Dawn Patrol (1930) is this a classical WW1 movie from Hawks. The actors are brilliant, especially Warner
Baxter. He's in command on the front seeing the madness around him. When his own father arrives as an volunteer
in his brigade things are getting tougher. Too corny at the end, but well made.",1398124800,,305,4.666666666666667
8289129,5,B001CSSX2Q,"I believe this is one of the greatest war films ever made, especially on WWI. It does not try to hide the dirt, filth and despair war brings. At the same time it shows the courage of those who fight, even when not knowing why. Wonderful performances by Warner Baxter. Lionel Barrymore gives a bravura performance as an old man wanting to fight one more battle for his beloved France (what an actor!).",1397606400,,400,4.493150684931507
8289130,5,B001CSSX2Q,"This movie helps bring to the screen the horrors of war, this time in the trenches during World War I. Warner Baxter, Fredric March & Lionel Barrymore excel in their roles and this is one of the classics from old Hollywood when they used to know how to make good, dramatic films instead of today's fast paced, CGI movies. Recommend this one.",1379030400,3,341,4.516129032258065
