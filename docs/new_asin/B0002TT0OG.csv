2119979,1,B0002TT0OG,"This was the lamest, most boring movie I have ever seen. It was so bad I couldn't even laugh at it,it was just that bad. When the filmmaker put it together did he really imagine anyone would like it? Did he even like it? I highly doubt it. The acting and special effects were so poor I couldn't even begin to describe it. I should buy myself a digital camera and make a terrible movie; maybe I could just film myself getting out of bed everyday,seems about as good of an idea as Avalos making another film.",1108857600,,506,4.22680412371134
2119980,1,B0002TT0OG,"Hoo-boy, where to begin?  All right, for starters, I really do love Avalos' The Last Broadcast.  It had the stupid and boring Blair Witch Project beat in spades.  The digital video production suited the pseudo-documentary style, and even if you didn't like the ending (I do), there are plenty of creepy and funny moments throughout the film, and Avalos did make a fine case for making low budget horror flicks on his desktop computer.

However, the same cannot be said for the truly wretched Ghosts of Edendale.  This time around, the digital production makes it seem like you're watching either the cheesiest of soap operas or a [...] flick minus the sex (there is a brief sex scene here, but completely pointless) - and who wants to watch one of those, right?  Avalos' story and dialogue are helplessly thin here.  The actors are worse than [...] stars, delivering their lines as if they were in some kind of high school acting class.

As for the scares, there aren't any.  The brief bits of digitized gore that worked well in Broadcast look completely silly in Edendale.  Not that there's any gore, but the faces appearing in the fence, and Our Hero morphing into a skeleton are lousy at best.  This is the kind of goofball effects that were popular in old PC games like The 7th Guest years ago that were innovative then, but are scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

My advice to Stefan is to just quit making these types of flicks.  If you want to make low budget horror movies, then by all means join up with a studio that specializes in such things and go for it.  Heck, even old fashioned special effects look ten times better than the stuff Avalos is doing on his computer.  And for God's sake, don't be afraid to come up with something interesting again.  Edendale is like reading Beowulf, except it's not high school anymore and you're not required to sit through it.  And that's my advice to anyone interested in this wreck; just don't bother.

So yeah, whenever I see anything lousy anymore, I immediately say, ""Dood, that was sooooo Edendale, brah"".  Feh.",1105056000,,2078,4.6438356164383565

2119982,3,B0002TT0OG,"This another in the ongoing direct to vid shot on dv ghost stories flooding the market right now.
When an aspiring writer and his not so supermodle wife move to LA for a fresh start the home they inhabit as well as their new neighbors are not quiet what they seem.
The relationship between the couple begins to crumble when he becomes more Hollywood buffing up quitting smoking and attending trendy parties while she starts seeing dead people and wonders wether the place is haunted or if she is in fact crazy.
The film plays out like a cheap Shining knockoff with hints of about a dozen or more films of this genre.
However considering the low budget nature GHOSTS is a very smooth watch as long as your not expecting too much because it is slow and in the end the movie is little more than a tele drama.
Not bad. Not Great.

2119983,3,B0002TT0OG,"This movie had its moments. THe theme of the movie was very good but some of its execution needed work. As a B movie goes, I enjoyed watching it and my friends will enjoy borrowing it from me.",1098748800,2,192,4.078947368421052
2119984,1,B0002TT0OG,"I usually save my Amazon reviews for music (and an occasional rant about a great movie), but after seeing all the superlatives thrown at this horrible (not horror) movie, I must try to rectify the situation. This is the lowest budget movie I think I've ever seen attached to a major studio (Warner Bros.). Anybody giving this flick any positive word at all must be attached to the production or a relative of the filmmakers (""The scariest indie horror movie I've ever seen and in many ways stands up to the best in the genre""!!? Tell me this guy isn't the director's brother!). The acting is wooden by all involved....the script is junior copywriter-level writing....and the effects, if you can call them that, are on a par with what I could accomplish with downloaded FX software on my five-year old Compaq Prosignia. And the story, about a guy being possessed by spirits in his house? The Shining.....Amityville Horror....HELLO?! While I will concede that there are some good ideas buried deep within this film, they've been simply unable to escape. And while I was prepared for the look of digital video here, I could not believe how poor this film looked. In the few outdoor scenes, everything is generally OK, but the indoor scenes had all the color drained out of them, and the nighttime scenes were almost unwatchable in their artifacts-laden graininess. Surprising, since the ""making-of"" feature had better indoor filming, on the same damn sets!  Several horror-movie websites have also given this dribble high marks, so I am mystified. But, if you want the look of a movie that your friends made with their Sony 8mm Handycam, then by all means.....",1098403200,12,1657,4.875886524822695
2119985,5,B0002TT0OG,"This is a classic ghost story, pure and simple...with an interesting tweak or two.  And that is part of its charm, in a day where hack `n slash and witty self-referential dialogue rules the genre...it's a throwback to the Twilight Zone and the Tales from the Crypt style of storytelling.

Another aspect of its charm is that this is the Little Picture That Could. Writer/director/editor/half-the-sound-department Stefan Avalos (The Last Broadcast) and his partner in crime, producer Marianne Connor, push their independent, itty-bitty budget way past the envelope.  Sometimes it shows...many of the effects have the earmarks of video effects (good video effects, but still video effects)...but often, you don't even realize that the effects were done on the computer instead of a makeup lab, or that the sky had to be repainted. Avalos and company made their own dollies for track shots, and even pulled off an effect shot by hand that is normally done with a motion tracking rig.  Essentially, they shouldn't have been able to pull this picture off, and because they did it so well, one tends to forgive the areas where it's a tad rough.

Avalos has crafted a film where the reality of the situation is up to the viewer, and he's done this using traditional ghost story trappings (and an unhealthy dash of Hollywood paranoia). It's story that would have fallen flat on its face if the leads were not cast so amazingly well. Wastell alternates between charmingly laid back and stone cold creepy with apparent ease, and Ficara's arc covers practically every emotion in an actor's repertoire...and she nails it every time. What's more, both actors have an innate sex appeal that, combined with their range and ability to project their emotions onto the screen, makes Avalos very lucky that he found these two before they get snatched up by the major studios.

As for the DVD itself, it's packed with behind-the-scenes tidbits, and advice on the dos and don'ts of independant film making. The FX section practically shows you how to do it yourself. If you're getting into the business or thinking about it, this disk is worth it for the extras alone.",1095811200,5,2147,4.933518005540166
2119991,2,B0002TT0OG,"I got this movie when the Hollywood Video by my house was going out of business...

I found the movie predictable and had lot's of ""tension"" built up but never went anywhere. In several scenes I found myself being ""anxious"" waiting for the ""BIG SCARE"" and then it just never came.

2119992,5,B0002TT0OG,"""The Ghosts of Edendale"" tells the tale of an East Coast couple, ambitious to make their mark in the movie biz, who rent a run-down house in L.A.'s Echo Park district. The previous occupants left in a great hurry, it seems, although the procession of mildly creepy neighbors who emerge early in the film appear not to have gotten their stories straight on exactly what happened.

We learn also that the house, which is located at the far end of a hilltop cul-de-sac, sits on ranchland once owned by early 1900s cowboy-movie icon Tom Mix, back when Echo Park was known as Edendale. It is within this context that the ghost story begins to unfold.

The filmmakers gradually transform the ambience from sunny to sinister over the course of the movie. For example, the breezes wafting through the hilltop foliage in the opening scenes are palpably soothing and inviting; by the end, the chill of those very same breezes wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of Twin Peaks.

What starts off as an almost Nancy Drew-like mystery thus evolves into a more disquieting tale as the proverbial ghosts of the title make their first fleeting appearances. An even deeper fear sets in as these apparitions grow bolder and nastier -- and as hints emerge that a key character may be possessed by the spirit of Thomas Edwin Mix himself. Although there is only one moment of real terror, involving the discovery of a murder, a nervous gloom settles in for the remainder of the movie and never entirely disappears.

Despite its horror-genre DNA, in its more thoughtful moments ""Ghosts"" takes some thematic cues from the psychological thriller -- chiefly the mental disintegration of an emotionally unstable and increasingly isolated character. Think ""Gaslight"", among others. This is a welcome departure in an era of cardboard-cutout protagonists, rapid-fire edits and increasingly over-the-top CGI effects. (Viewers should nonetheless consider themselves warned that their startle reflexes, too, will be tested at times. And it should also be noted that ""Ghosts"" is not itself effects-free, although the few tricks that are employed have an almost homemade feel to them, based as they are on a clever mashup of those strobey old silent films and the monochromatic video-cowboy wraiths who occasionally stride by or thunder past on their horses, six-shooters blazing.)

The pervasively low-budget feel -- no doubt born of necessity for the indie filmmakers -- is a virtue in this style of cinematic storytelling, and helps give ""Ghosts"" its spooky charm. Even the haunting soundtrack borrows a cheesy bit or two from the B-movies of a bygone era.

Much of the 151-minute movie has the vibe of an extended Twilight Zone episode, both in the story arc and in the sometimes intentionally wooden acting -- and most especially in the emergence of an underlying moral as the story progresses.

It is in the ending -- which will leave viewers sympathetically tut-tutting with pity over the fate of one major character -- that the film pays its most direct homage to Rod Serling's 1960s-era cult series. As the remaining pieces of the story fall grimly into place in the not-entirely-unpredictable closing scene, we half expect to see Serling himself step in front of the camera, cigarette in hand, and deliver the coda to a tale as much about the morally corrosive effects of blind ambition as it is about supernatural possession.",1187827200,3,3406,4.99647266313933

2119999,1,B0002TT0OG,"Don't get me wrong, I love low budget horror movies, and in fact, that was what attracted me to this film, not what put me off.

  Since it was low-budget, I can easily excuse the bad acting, fairly low quality sound, and brush aside the lousy special effects.

  What I cannot excuse, however, is a weak story that adds up to a far less than satisfying conclusion.  There are plenty of scenes and attempted scares that really have no place in the movie, (like the hot tub and the fence; you will know what I mean if you see the film.)  Worse still, since this was apparently shot on video, the picture quality is lousy, and the camera reacts extremely poorly to back light - (as well as low light, and most other lighting situations for that matter).

  More frustrating still, is that despite the film's best efforts, it is not in the least bit frightening, save for one scene in the very beginning that made me jump.  That won't cut it, especially since being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.

  As for DVD extras, there is one extremely lousy behind the scenes of production, one interesting featurette behind the computer effects and image layering, a number of deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a one ore two other assorted extras.

  But since the film is this bad, the DVD extras should not determine whether or not you give it a rental.  My advice is to steer clear.",1117756800,,1404,4.52191235059761
2120000,3,B0002TT0OG,"As a warning- this disc degraded after about 6 viewings to the point where it would not play in either my iBook or my DVD player.  Tke the following review with that grain of salt.  Too bad, it's a fun movie.

While it's not exactly ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"", it's not ""Don't Go in the Woods"" either.

The story of two people from back east who move to Hollywood to make their fortune, Rachel and Kevin luck into a new Hollywood Hills pad, complete with Hollywood sign view, the belongings of the former owners who high-tailed it into the night so fast they didn't bother to clean out the icebox, and (wait for it) a price TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!

Sadly, since they are trying to break into films as scriptwriters, they don't see the big giant warning signs that something might be a little (ahem) askew on Edendale hill, even when various neighbors show up to ominously tell them that the former occupants didn't fit in and that the street used to be the center of Hollywood's first studio.

Rachel, who has a convenient past as both a model and a loony, has, in rapid sucession, ghost sightings and a job modelling in New York.  Since their writing isn't going anywhere, and they need the money (and the movie isn't moving very fast) she hits the big Apple fo the gig.

Ten seconds or so later, she's back, and things on the hill are changed:  Kevin's suddenly a filmland Zane Grey, banging away at his laptop with a screenplay that has the whole hill abuzz.  Rachel is convinced there must be something terribly wrong!

Is Kevin in the clutches of the ghost of Tom Mix, bent upon recreating his Hollywood comeback?  Is Rachel really just losing her mind?  Didn't anybody see ""Burnt Offerings""?

Like I said, there are a few big flaws in this movie: They seem to want to have it about 5 ways about how we are supposed to are be taking what we're seeing (Witness the ending, which I won't give away), and anyone who had been enough of a movie buff to want to write one would have seen this plot before.  While I applaud the film-makers for not going all Kevin Williamson self-referential on us, it's still a bit of a hole.

The movie was shot on DV and seemingly in availble light.  To some, it gives an immediacy to the movie that really works, some people will find it annoying.  It worked for me (and I know that street, it's incredibly steep; I have no isea how they got equipment up there).  The actors are decent, although it would have worked better to have made Rachel a soap-opera actress instead of a fashion model.  Not that she isn't a beautiful girl with a spectacular figure, but let's just say that Janice Dickinson would flay her alive if she showed up on ANTM.

This is a fun movie that will give a few chills and a few thrills.  I enjoyed it, especially the DVD extras (where they practically give you a primer on how to do an indy movie of your own)  The makers of this clearly love movies; I'd love to see what they'd do if they had a slightly better worked out script and a lot more money.",1109548800,,3013,4.350626118067979

I had this DVD sitting around for about a year before I got around to starting it. The Amazon reviews weren't exactly good and I was in no rush to watch it (got the DVD for free).

Having been involved in some low budget film-making in New York with Youtube director Frank Stamm, I started this film last night (and will probably finish it this weekend) and I wanted to post a review to counter the many negative reviews on Amazon. For a low budget film, it's actually pretty good.

What the film is not: It's not a fast-paced intense horror film, so the box art is a little misleading.

What the film is: It's a low-budget film made with some care. In terms of quality it reminded me of some of the Asian soap operas my wife watches (which are shot in actual rooms rather than on sets): you can see that there wasn't a huge budget, and it runs a little slow, but the quality is decent enough that you can keep watching pretty easily.

Most of the primary actors have some talent. The couple actors who are horribly stiff thankfully have had very small parts in the film.  The main character is a woman (Christine Charters?) and the actress who plays her is great. She's a capable actress, she's pretty, and she's seen in some revealing outfits.

I could recommend buying this film used, but more for people who like independent film than horror movie fans. The film is sort of like a low-budget soap opera with horror elements.",1304640000,,1438,4.420454545454546
