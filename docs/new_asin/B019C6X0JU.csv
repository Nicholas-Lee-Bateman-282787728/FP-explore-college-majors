7569946,1,B019C6X0JU,"With Danny Trejo on the cover, you're probably expecting a fast paced action film in the vein of Bad Ass and other movie's he's starred in. Well Trejo is hardly in this film at all for one thing and although a few people do get killed in the film's duration you may well miss them due to having fallen asleep due to sheer boredom. After a lengthy opening credit bad song playing in background sequence we finally get to the film. We see some guy hotwire a car, only to have another guy appear and put a gun to his head. He gets out of that situation with a screwdriver, drives off, checks the boot (trunk) and finds a human organ in an esky inside. Then he tells us he died and this is how it happened, and we go from lengthy chatting in a mechanic's (Trejo's character's) office, to sitting on a couch talking to someone else for ten minutes scene. The movie isn't shown in chronological order or anything either.

The acting in this thing is terrible, I'm assuming this is a university student film where someone's daddy had contacts in the film industry and knew Trejo and asked if he could be in their kid's film for a few minutes. Also the film was probably made before the teachers actually taught anything they just said, ""group assignment guys, make a movie, then we'll look at it as a class and everyone can say what the other groups did wrong and how each film can be improved, then we'll teach you how to make these things over the next three years.""",1460937600,,1461,4.351648351648351
7569947,1,B019C6X0JU,"Jimmy Greco (Grazi DiPaolo) boost (steals) cars in L.A. He works primarily with Roy (Danny Trejo) who he doesn't consider his boss. Jimmy supplies us with some first person narration because the script is not that good. Jimmy steals a special car for Roy, which doesn't go well. This car had a kidney in it for Lorenzo (Rob Nagle) which we later find out it is for a little girl, something you might pick up from the Amazon/IMDB one line spoiler description of the film.

The movie is not told in chronological or any logical order. Why a little girl needs one kidney on the black market to live is not explained nor is the fact she is not prepped and near the donor. Trejo and Rob Nagle are the only things close to actors in the film. Grazi DiPaolo was bad in the lead role as was most of the support cast, especially Justin Dray who couldn't deliver a convincing line.

This is a crime film we have seen before and done far better.

7569990,5,B019C6X0JU,"First of all , I enjoy Danny Trejo so much. Great actor, Awesome tough guy. A movie or tv series has to grab me, or I am gone. This movie in my opinion was great! Well written, Back and forth time lines. I usually have movies on in the back round while playing video games. There were no
video games on during this movie. I wanted to make sure I saw everything. Thanks for the entertainment!",1472083200,,391,4.157894736842105

7569992,5,B019C6X0JU,Better than I expected for a $5 gamble. It had a very good story and plenty of twists and turns to keep me entertained.,1466380800,,119,4.0

7569994,1,B019C6X0JU,"This movie is bad bad, it tries to be special by switching between times but it's really boring. From one stupid murder they make a whole story around that repeats itself over and over. Danny Trejo almost don't appear in the movie, looks like he thinks he can already be a guest actor to ""Boost"" the movie, He did not",1464739200,,317,4.3
7569995,4,B019C6X0JU,"Don't understand the tone of the negative reviews...the movie I saw struck me very differently. Yes, it has a few flaws, but it also has many virtues. First, the acting by Garcia and Nagle is very strong, although Nagle's big scene with DiPaolo could have been a minute or so shorter. Couldn't take my eyes off Garcia...she really delivered. Trejo is...Trejo, as expected. Grazi DiPaolo I didn't find wholly convincing, mainly because I thought a more physically imposing actor might have had more impact. The movie has a complicated fast-moving plot, and you have to pay attention. You start out thinking, 'what the hell is going on?"" And then get really interested in putting the pieces together. It might benefit from being watched twice, but for my part I found it perfectly comprehensible (and very enjoyable) on the first go-round.",1460937600,,837,4.985714285714286
7569996,5,B019C6X0JU,"This contemporary LA crime drama brings an asymmetric point of view to a fast paced narrative with a surprise ending. I've watched it twice and got more out of the second pass but found the plot both clever and understandable with the application of some brain power; something not that commonly applicable  in feature films like this. The actors bring the genre to life in unconventional ways and there are several highly stylized sequences that are quite artistic and surprisingly well acted. I really enjoyed watching this effort. The themes of survival, necessities, proportionality, revenge, and undercurrents of genuine love, give the movie a human feel with a satisfying resolution.",1460937600,2,689,5.263636363636364
7569997,5,B019C6X0JU,"This is not your typical Danny Trejo Movie. It has a lot of twists and turns and you have to pay attention throughout as the movie is not told in chronological order. Overall it's fun and engaging, especially if you're not looking for some run of the mill action movie. It's a thriller with some drama and tension throughout which is achieved by balancing the action and story with some good character development. The film is shot well and the editing, and music are top notch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of LA gangster films.",1460937600,2,552,4.475247524752476

8744649,5,B019C6X0JU,"good movie. anyone else notice how much Trent Garrett resembles a younger Channing Tatum ?
at first i almost thought the date was wrong on the production date. because i initially thought it was channing tatum in his younger days,lol.
all that aside the film had some serious life moments that brought back memories, great watch, grab some popcorn and enjoy!",1513382400,,358,4.885245901639344
8744650,5,B019C6X0JU,"A really refreshing and creative film. I loved the cinematography- very well-rounded, artistic, and appealing, seemed to have the goal of drawing in audiences from different backgrounds yet also satisfying the action-lovers' appetite. Throughout it all I detected a sort of blend between reality film and cinema, which resulted in a perfectly entertaining and yet totally believable and realistic movie. Great balance of art, suspense, and twist! LOVED this film and look forward to seeing more from this Gabaeff family!",1512691200,,520,5.5125
8744651,3,B019C6X0JU,I just couldn't follow this it was like an endless repetitive loop. I really like Danny T but he wasn't much of a player in this one.,1512432000,,133,3.962962962962963
8744652,5,B019C6X0JU,Not a bad movie at all. Suspenseful and it keeps you guessing all the way throughout the whole story. Well acted. It jumps around a lot but there is a reason for it.,1511308800,,165,4.03030303030303
