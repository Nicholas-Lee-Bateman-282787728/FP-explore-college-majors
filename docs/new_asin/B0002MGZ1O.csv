8029485,2,B0002MGZ1O,"This series is a lot slower than what I remember.  When I first glimpsed it all those years ago on PBS as a Brit-TV import, I managed to catch an episode where there was a little action.  Having seeing the historically questionable ""Cromwell"" starring Richard Harris, I thought this series might be a toned down version of the English Civil war movie epic, but never had a chance to catch much of it when it was airing.

I therefore took a chance and splurged on the DVDs, and instead of a drama punctuated by moments of action, I got a soap opera.  I don't mind dramatic British television that's more oriented towards personal conflicts in period settings, and where I think the overall production values are quite exceptional, I just couldn't get into the whole thing about dowries, marriages, estates and what not during the time Cromwell.

A historical drama it may be, but I also found myself fending off sleep as I tried to watch it.

If you're into historical drama presented by the BBC, then this might tickle your fancy (to borrow from the language of the time), but otherwise there're other series out there.",1484870400,,1119,4.654822335025381
8029486,5,B0002MGZ1O,"There is a good set of reviews concerning this series (whether it's this particular release or some other version) but I wanted to add a new point of ""value"" to this.  First off, I have not seen it since it was released, as also had many reviewers here and, along with them, I remember it with great fondness & wish to add my voice to those hoping for a decent American release.  Also... I'm inserting this review into the chain for a product of the Series One of this title, BUT... I've only seen Series Two and my discussions below are for the first two episodes of Series Two... I'm just doing it for the entirety of these titles, Series One & Two.

BUT(!) here is the point that is most important for me: B.T.S.D. stands out by Head-n-Shoulders from other similar titles for historical accuracy beCAUSE... in the teensiest fine print at the end of the (Season 2) first episode's credits' crawl - that is, the episode that deals with the trial & execution of Charles I - is the statement that the script for this episode is a VERBATIM recreation of the actual trial transcription of Charles I's witchcraft trial.

Then, the second episode details the spread of Oliver Cromwell's terrorizing of the countryside & it's citizens by the use of (trumped-up) witchcraft trials of typical local citizens, in this case, that of a local teenage girl who had not placated Cromwell's emissaries with her sexual favors so, they put her on trial as a witch.  Again, the final line - extreme fine print - of the Credits' Crawl says, this script was a VERBATIM recreation of this country girl's ACTUAL trial for witchcraft 350 years ago.  Apparently the English were absolute sticklers for detail and recorded all these trials & preserved the transcripts.  If I, as a would-be film producer of this sort had, some how, encountered these trial transcripts, I'd have been equally obSESSED(!) with seeing to it that they were realized on film.  The legacy of these unjustly executed individuals demands nothing less; we today are desperately in need of reviewing the past - so as not to repeat its mistakes :-)  The official English government of the time conspired to try AND EXECUTE... an innocent country girl on witchcraft charges because she would not have sex with one of that government's officials... !!! ...if that isn't a SCANDAL(!!)... what could possibly be?

It is for points such as these that EVERY historian ought to be interested in acquiring these videos, among many other points of authenticity... not to mention the fact that it's VERY entertaining.  I often find that actual history is much  more interesting than anything any novelist can concoct so... I've been DYIN' to get my hands on a nice copy of The Lot that I can play :-)",1398902400,4,2737,4.714884696016772
8029487,5,B0002MGZ1O,"This production is so very long overdue for release on dvd in America. It's been so long now, I can't remember any details of plot, but I've never forgotten the rich experience of becoming absorbed in this magnificent historical tale. For twenty years, I've hoped to come across it again.

Why isn't it being released? Is there some kind of petition we could get up and who do we send it to? With the surge of interest in period drama that's followed the release in this decade of so many high-quality ones, there's never been a better time to introduce this masterpiece to a new audience!

*******************************************************************

One year later: Ok, I have to add in the interest of total honesty, that having now gotten my hands on a copy of this series on dvd, it was fun to watch but not (sigh!) as good as remembered. Such is life. Well, it had been twenty years. Partly, the writing and production values simply paled in comparison to the more recently produced period dramas in my collection.",1230595200,2,1028,4.829545454545454
8029488,5,B0002MGZ1O,"This is an incredible show which has remained unforgettable since first airing decades ago. It is well acted, intelligently written with sumpteous costumes and absorbing in it's dramatic characters. In addition it gives the viewer a glimpse of a part of history rarely taught in America despite having direct effects which echoed down the years to America's development.
Enjoyable entertainment which educates on the side. How could you ask for more? Other than an edition playable in America!",1189555200,3,493,5.333333333333333
8029489,1,B0002MGZ1O,Don't buy this for $200. It's available for around $90 from amazon.co.uk including shipping to the US.  The guy offering it for $200 is trying to rip you off!,1173139200,7,158,4.448275862068965
8029490,5,B0002MGZ1O,"I have always been fascinated by the English Civil War (which was a TRUE Civil War, unlike our own War for Southern Independence) and the series enthralled me from the first.  I have never forgotten it, and have waited for it to come out in a DVD format that could be played in the US.

Alas, as I notice, the price is exceptionally high :( and out of reach at the moment.  But if you have the cash and are an English History buff, as I am, don't hesitate to buy this wonderful and historically accurate (for the most part) look at both sides of this important conflict.

True to the high standards that most British series adhered to, I remember the wonderful costumes and attention to the most minute aspects of the time and its people made by all involved in this production.  One truly is looking through a time capsule at one of the most important periods of British history.  The acting, as usual, is superb. It is hard to pick a favorite character, since all draw you into the life of each individual and the sometimes heartwrenching loyalties that divided brother from brother, father from son, etc.

Meanwhile, I'll wait for someone, somewhere to offer it for a bit less, and continue to dream....",1164326400,9,1206,4.529953917050691
8029491,5,B0002MGZ1O,I saw this production years ago on Masterpiece Theatre and I was fascinated by it then.  I thought that the telling of the story of the Engish Civil war through the eyes of a divided family was an extremely effective way of making the history of a complex time come to life.  Like our own Civil War the tale seems one of romantic glory at first but becomes ever more grim and real as the war is prosecuted.  The story is historically accurate with everything that I have read on the ECW.  I have been checking over the months to see when the American format DVD will come out and hope we see it soon.,1144540800,28,600,4.191304347826087
8029492,4,B0002MGZ1O,"Anyone who remembers and enjoyed the Masterpiece Theater presentations of the 1970s and 1980s like ""Upstairs/Downstairs"", ""Elizabeth"", and ""I, Claudius"", would also enjoy this mini-series depicting the struggles of 2 families during the English civil war of the 1600's.

Although it's been ages since I've seen this, I never forgot how good it was.  I've been looking for this for several years, and I'm glad to see that it's being released for region 2 viewing.  Hopefully, there will be enough interest to soon make it available stateside on region 1.",1144108800,24,553,5.122222222222222
8029493,4,B0002MGZ1O,"I really enjoyed this series when it was shown on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS back in tht 80's. It's available in the UK on DVD so it's probably only a matter of time before it's available here in the US. Good acting, engrossing stories, and sometimes more brutal than you'd expect for a prim costume drama.

Would love to be able to see the series again.",1137110400,20,354,4.363636363636363
