3431079,2,B0019BI114,"I have all 4 season of That Girl. I am a huge fan. To give my rating you have to undrstand how I got there.  I have seen seasons 1-3 about 6 times each since I first purchased them.

Season 4 I have only seen once. I didn't want to see the episode again. That is highly unusal for me. It is not bad.. It's that I found the episode too silly and not written as good as the other seasons.

However, I am a fan always and will purchase any future That Girl dvd's",1221868800,4,459,3.8105263157894735
3431080,5,B0019BI114,My wife just LOVES this TV series!  We also have the previous 3 seasons and are awaiting the availability of season 5!  We would highly recommend it to anyone who remembers this TV series and enjoyed it!,1221264000,4,203,4.45945945945946
3431081,5,B0019BI114,"Thank you Shout Factory for giving us season four of That Girl.  Even though the show was made in the mid-sixties, early seventies, the show's theme (single girl trying to make her way in NYC) is still relevant today.  The laughs are there, the sweet moments (so missing in today's TV) are special and I enjoy the shows just as much now as I did growing up watching this show.  Ted and Marlo are magical together.  I only wish Shout Factory would have included the bonus comments from Marlo and co-creator Bill Persky.  Hopefully, they will in Season Five.  If your'e a child of the sixties and seventies, you must own all of the That Girl DVD's.  If you're not, give it a try and you'll love it!",1220832000,3,696,4.390625
3431082,4,B0019BI114,"While Season Four of That Girl is missing special features, these great episodes more than make up for it.  Ann and Donald have grown closer, making the show very romantic.  Visually, the show is more cinematic (I wonder how in the world they filmed in always busy Vegas!!!).  This is, so far, my favorite season.  I am looking forward to season 5.",1219881600,5,348,4.564516129032258
3431083,5,B0019BI114,This is a great show worth waiting for to come to DVD Marlo Thomas is just great as is the rest of the cast.,1219276800,4,108,3.5416666666666665
3431084,5,B0019BI114,"This has been my favorite show since I first saw it on TV Land a while back. I was so excited to hear that season 4 was coming out and it didn't disappoint! I loved every single second of it! My only problem was that they changed the actress who played Ruthie, but even that wasn't enough to let me give less than a perfect 5 for this wonderful season!",1219104000,5,352,4.042857142857143
3431085,5,B0019BI114,"There was a nasty rumor that Shout! Factory was abandoning That Girl when they took a year between season 3 and this release. Thankfully that's not true. The latest boxset has 26 episodes. There are no bonus features. The gang go out to Las Vegas for Ann to perform at the Sands. They really did shoot at the casino so you can get an idea of semi-old Vegas when Louis Prima still ruled.  Behold the Impeccable Hair of Ted Bessell!

Hopefully we won't have to wait another year to get the fifth/ final season. That is when Ann lost her bangs and the theme song gained lyrics.

3431138,5,B0019BI114,"Love That Girl - however, I don't understand why the writers treated each season as if nobody saw the previous ones. Case in point in this season was The Meter Maid episode. Anne Marie grew up in Brewster NY the entire series, but in this episode they claim she was a meter maid in another town - the place they lived before they moved to Brewster. How can that be when she was in her 20's? Also, they had Donald write about Anne and her career ""for the first time ever"" about 5 or 6 times.

Loved Ted Bessell - very good actor. Marlo Thomas, I've read, is not so nice in real life. Whatever, I just enjoy going back in time when life was not so complicated.",1422144000,,658,4.140625

3431170,5,B0019BI114,"As a huge fan and owner of classic tv series, I think this tv series is so cute and wonderful to watch!  I would say that women would enjoy it more than men, but even my husband got tickled at a few lines he would walk in on.  The show is so refreshing.  ""Anne"" and the other characters are fervent in their patriotism, respect for others, love, doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do, work ethic - values that seem to be deteriorating today.  The cast and sets are GREAT; the story lines are cute and funny.  I LOVE seeing Anne's now-vintage clothes and jewelry!  The sound, picture quality and packaging are GREAT.  I own all 5 seasons, watched the whole series twice and can assure you that at some point, I'll watch the whole series again.  It's truly a 5-Star purchase.  And BTW - since you have to buy each season separately, I'll post this same review for all five.  They're all worth it!",1395187200,3,918,4.347058823529411
3431171,5,B0019BI114,I have always loved the old TV shows.  That Girl is one of them so I was excited to see that it was available on DVD.  The quality is pristine and the price is very reasonable. So far I have all 4 seasons that are available and I love the fact that  Amazon sends me notices when a new season comes out of any of the series that I have previously ordered!,1394236800,2,354,3.888888888888889

3431203,5,B0019BI114,"There is no doubt that Marlo Thomas is of Hollywood royalty. Daughter of Danny Thomas, who is responsible for much of what was on television in it's early days, she always was and will be for me one of the cleanest and ""pure talent"" actresses that will ever grace any screen. I grew up with ""That Girl"", along with ""Family Affair"" and many others. So to be able to have them in my possession to watch when I want is in fact a ""God send"". And each season is as good as the one before. I especially like the commentaries with Marlo and Bill Persky, on of the show's writers. These were and still are the Golden Age of television. When the censors were making sure that anything seen on the tube was suitable for the entire family. And now it is on to the finale of ""That Girl"", season 5.",1384560000,,785,4.2052980132450335

3431205,4,B0019BI114,"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way. This Shout Factory DVD boxed set for That Girl Season Four has no extra features. On the plus side, the episodes are in good condition and season four has plenty of episodes that are worth watching. In a two parter, Ann Marie and Donald go to Las Vegas. The neon lights, gambling, booze and carefree atmosphere of Las Vegas brings out Donald's nasty side! In another episode, Ann Marie goes undercover in a sweatshop. In another episode, Ann has to wear a cheesy, garish chicken costume to promote a fried chicken franchise. I like her comments on the chicken costume(""I thought this outfit would be more Las Vegas and less Disneyland""). One episode recaps scenes from season one such as Donald meeting Ann Marie in an office building for the first time. In another episode, Ann Marie is brainwashed into impulse buying!
That Girl Season Four was another solid season.",1365984000,2,908,4.716981132075472
3431206,4,B0019BI114,"The fourth season of THAT GIRL is really the last great year of the show.  Boasting several of the greatest episodes, it's in many ways the most entertaining season of THAT GIRL.  This year kicks off with a fun 2-part episode entitled ""Mission Improbable"", in which the owner of a pyjama design factory (Lou Jacobi) asks Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) to go undercover as a seamstress in a rival company, complete with a banana camera!

In ""Nobody Here But Us Chickens"", Ann is cast as the mascot for Chicken Big, a fast-food chain, but doesn't count on the romantic advances of the Colonel Sanders-esque chairman.  ""The Snow Must Go On"" is a real charmer, in which Ann, Donald (Ted Bessell) and her parents (Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp) find themselves stuck at a snowbound Kennedy Airport.  Frantic Ann must think fast and winds up auditioning on-camera for the role of a man-eating temptress named Mary Thatcher during the news coverage; whilst her father squirrels away 40 ham sandwiches in an airport luggage locker!

There is also the lavish 2-part special ""She Never Had the Vegas Notion"", in which Ann wins a supporting role in a Sin City show starring Marty Haines (Jack Cassidy), a womanising prankster who decides to use the trip to play an extended joke on Donald... and almost ruins his relationship with Ann!

Through it all, there is the delightful Marlo Thomas, dressed to the nines in delicious Cardinali fashions.  There's never been a lovelier GIRL.  This set includes all 26 episodes from the fourth season.  Special features are, disappointingly, not included at all, whereas the last three seasons came with some very enjoyable extras.

3431207,5,B0019BI114,Season 4 is the high watermark of this show. Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessel are once again hilarious in their day to day lives. This is probably my favorite season. The good news at the end of this season is that season 5 is yet to come!!.,1325721600,,236,4.042553191489362
3431208,4,B0019BI114,In this season we see Ann Marie transition from her girliness to womanhood (although just as feminine and stylish as the previous 3 seasons)as we are being prepared for what is to come in season 5. Marlo and Ted are just as wonderful here as before and just as loveable. I am anxiously awaiting season 5 to arrive at my door..The whole collection brings back many fond memories of a wonderful show and era. Thank you Marlo.,1281312000,,423,4.5064935064935066

If just to see Ann Marie with a new hairdo! And with lyrics to the theme song. This show was a lot of the same thing year after year. Some episodes aren't worth the time watching more than once. It has a certain charm to it, but Ann, Donald, and especially Mr. Marie can really get on my nerves at times. I'm hoping Season Five is the best because I plan on purchasing that as well, may as well complete the series.
If ""Ann Marie"" was an actress why did she always look the same in every episode and stuck to Donald 4 years without an engagement ring! Lose the old fashioned hairdo already!! And the apartment was really boring. It was 1969-70, the writers could have made this show a lot more interesting than it was. Thank God for the Mary Tyler Moore show!! She really turned the world on. Ann Marie was like Mary's younger sister who could have used some good advice. Did Ann Marie even have any friends? Some new characters could have added to the enjoyment of this series. The cover art for these DVDs could have been better as well.
