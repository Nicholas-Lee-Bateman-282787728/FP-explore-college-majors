It is a beautiful journey through the four seasons and was produced by digitizing the photographic slides taken over 30 years by George Ostrom who has hiked over 10,000 miles in the park, going where few ever go.  Thousands have been sold in the park and you will enjoy watching it over and over!

Another reviewer stated 'There is no natural soundtrack. The music is not as annoying as is common in this genre, and but I preferred to mute it' - This production went through an extensive review process by the National Park staff including the Chief Interpretive Officer, and has been selling in Glacier National Park for 3 years. Everyone at the park approved of the music and the entire staff loves it. To mute the music while listening is simply not done by the vast majority of purchasers and is unfair to the artists.  It also shortchanges the viewer by not allowing the music to enhance the viewing experience.

They also stated 'There is a narrated soundtrack that I did not listen to for more than a few seconds'  If  they did not listen to it how do they have the right to comment on it?  A lot of work went into the narrated portion, and again, it was approved by the National Park staff.

And finally, they stated 'I should have researched Telly Awards on Wikipedia before buying this DVD-R, as it is not impressive that the winners have to pay for their own award statues'  - this comment implies that there is something dishonest about the award, as if the award was purchased, when in fact it is the most prestigious award in the non-broadcast video industry, and is judged in competition from thousands of worldwide entries by very qualified judging panels.  The fact that the award statues have to be purchased is actually a good thing since they are produced by the same company that produces the Oscar and Emmy statues and are of the highest quality.  They cost $150 and allow the winners to purchase multiple statues for themselves and people who contributed to the production.  Does the person really think that these statues should be free?  Where would the money come from?",1282608000,,2182,4.663185378590079

The collection of photos is impressive, the subject matter is interesting and beautiful, and I liked the concept of viewing the park in different seasons. But photographs have only a single plane of focus and zooming in on areas off center to see blurry detail is uncomfortable to watch. Photographs also do not do justice to waterfalls, raging rivers, and wildlife. There is no natural soundtrack. The music is not as annoying as is common in this genre, and but I preferred to mute it. There is a narrated soundtrack that I did not listen to for more than a few seconds, and but it seemed informative.

I should have researched Telly Awards on Wikipedia before buying this DVD-R, as it is not impressive that the winners have to pay for their own award statues.",1263081600,3,886,4.572327044025157
