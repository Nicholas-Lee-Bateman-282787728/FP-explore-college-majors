8052543,1,B0007VXZIG,"Amazon clearly states in its advertising that they ONLY sell DVD's which are formatted to play on DVD-players for ""Region 1"" (which includes the United States).  I do, of course, live in Region 1.  However, when I received this series in the mail and tried to play it, I found that it was formatted for a region OTHER THAN ""Region 1"" (my guess is that it's formatted for play in Europe), and so none of the DVD's would play on any of our DVD-players, as they always gave the error message, ""wrong region"".",1369353600,2,505,4.419354838709677
8052544,4,B0007VXZIG,"I watched this series as a child on PBS and loved it.  I've looked for it a couple of times since then and had trouble finding it.  Finally found it here and bought it.  When I tried to watch it, it would work on any DVD player I had because it's made in the wrong region for me (made in the UK.)  I was able to get it to work on my computer...

The series is everthing I remember!  Perhaps the best WW2 documentary series ever!  The other review on this site was not the same as my experience...the first series chronicled 6 battles, and that is what I recieved.

Again, the only problem I had was my DVD players being for the wrong region, but I can't find this anywhere else!  What's the point of regions if it's not sold anywhere else?  I'm still looking for series 2 with no luck though :(",1349740800,8,794,4.097402597402597
8052545,4,B0007VXZIG,"The Battlefield Series 1 is evidently no longer sold as originally packaged.  Instead, Series 1 and 2 have been combined and broken into 3 disk sets.  Be sure before you open it that it will play in your region.  I got a used set that did not play in district 1.  The seller had mismarked it.  I was able to return it for a refund, but only after calling the seller.  This series is a well done look at different phases of World War II.  Each disk has one 2 hour episode in two parts.  the first part looks at the background, leaders, forces and some of the weapons and equipment used.  The second part covers the main battle in several phases with a final section giving the aftermath of the battle.  The Battle for France, for example, give a brief description of the invasion of Poland and Scandinavia by the Nazi's, then in the part 2 looks at the invasion of France,covering things like the original plans of offence and defense, changes that were made, an order of battle giving armies with numbers of divisions in each of general types, as well as the commanding general.  It finally goes through the major phases of the battle.  This is more military history than many documentaries give.",1308614400,16,1196,4.486111111111111
