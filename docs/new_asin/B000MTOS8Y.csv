8172382,1,B000MTOS8Y,"First of all, I bought this DVD to gain some knowledge about this breed. This video may have well have been about German Sheperds. There was no in site on grooming techniques or anything. When they talk about feeding, they show a puppy gorging on a large bowl filled to the rim with food. The most distressing part of this DVD is that the narrator is shown with a Maltese puppy and is constantly having to prop him up because he is so sleepy and groggy. I really believe the puppy is heavily sedated in this film. The film is very cheaply made also for a DVD that costs $25.  Don't waste your money.",1177200000,17,599,4.254385964912281
