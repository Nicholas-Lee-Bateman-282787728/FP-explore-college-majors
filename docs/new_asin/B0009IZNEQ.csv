8157112,3,B0009IZNEQ,"I first became aware of Les Blank from his documentary 'Burden of Dreams' about the making of Werner Herzog's 'Fitzcarraldo'. Blank and Herzog focus on the irregular and the quirky. In 'Gap-Toothed Women', Les Blank interviews a number of gap-toothed women-from Vogue models and belly-dancers to book-keepers- as they discuss their teeth. The film explores different connotations of gap-teeth such as a beauty mark or as  a sign of an amorous nature. Ultimately, the film is a celebration of difference.
The film is interesting, although I would suggest you rent it rather than buy it, unless you are a hard-core Les Blank fan. It is availble at Kim's Video on St. Marks in NYC.",1018396800,7,678,4.947368421052632
