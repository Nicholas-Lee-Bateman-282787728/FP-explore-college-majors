4261437,5,B0044M2OTU,"As I stated in my review of this company's first set of Krav Maga DVD's, I hoped that they followed-up with a set of DVD's that focussed on advanced techniques and techniques geared toward law enforcement.  I believe they have achieved this with the completion of their advanced KM DVD series.  The content is much more advanced and depicts real-life scenarios, the defense of the attacks, and the proper mind set for dealing with and surviving the attack.  Again the use of multiple instructors and numerous fighting techniques are used which benefits the student and makes for a more enjoyable learning experience.

The production side of the DVD's are first rate and mirrors the KM training I have received in the past.  The instructors and the people behind these DVD's have created a very realistic product that will provide hours of excellent training material for KM instructors, students and those who want to learn the best self defense system in the world today.  KM is the real deal and if you want to learn how to protect yourself in real-life situations, get this DVD set and you'll be well on your way.

I look forward to more training aids from this group.",1296604800,,1171,4.767326732673268
4261438,5,B0044M2OTU,"I am a fitness, movement teacher of a couple decades.  DVD watching is one of my professional requirements to determine what folks are interested so I can understand motivation for movement.  I was guided to this DVD for production and information purposes.  I am not an expert in Krav Maga, but I am experienced in critiquing DVD's for approachability, artistic rendering, and content.  The quality and attention to the audience is of utmost importance.  Congratulations to this production company.  Well done.  I will look forward to their future DVDs for attention to detail.  These folks are passionate in the information that they are delivering.",1296432000,,651,5.1923076923076925
4261439,5,B0044M2OTU,"Well, being highly compulsive and wanting to learn something new, I ordered this ""part 1"" video, not reading that it is an ACCOMPANYMENT to the 5 or 6 disc $99 set that you should prolly buy first. WELL, I didn't realize that until after I read the back case but I was willing to give it a shot, as I'm somewhat coordinated and know some 'moves' already. ""Moves"" meaning ""practicing"" roundhouse kicks and takedowns and punching couch pillows while half drunk after watching this months UFC fight. By myself. Takedowns of couch pillows, chairs, dresser drawers laid on their side, you know, stuff laying around the house. So yeah, messing around like a banshee in the living room is totally my style.

I've no prior knowledge of Krav Maga, other then a YouTube video of some guy destroying 30 dudes using Krav Maga. Naturally I was excited. I was SURPRISED at how fun and effective (effective meaning hammer punching the S outta the couch) krav maga can be! It is a really simple and natural form of fighting, and makes sense to me. It just 'works' with the way I think and react. I really like the guy presenting the techniques, and they are presented pretty clearly and half speed and are easy to follow. The way the video is shot is also cool, as you feel like you're watching an underground fight club video. Cool points for that.

Overall, this video really sparked an interest in Krav Maga, and if you can't afford the whole $99 set, you can still learn something from this single dvd. HOWEVER, now that I bought this one, I am DEFINITELY going to buy the entire set, because I really like it and I would perfer to know the basics and foundation of what I learned in this video. My girlfriend is not happy about this, as I use the big couch cushions to repeatedly punch and kick and throw around. So yeah, if you have some rage to get out or just want to learn some really easy, effective and fun fighting techniques, give this video a shot!

UPDATE: OCT 2012:BONUS ""FEATURES""

After viewing this video several times, I'm noticing how unintentially funny it is. A couple of the guys have such odd, robotic movements and facial expressions. The main host guy seems sort of like he's on meth, the bald guy I'm pretty sure, is a CYBORG, I just sometimes found myself cracking up at the rediculousness of it all. I hope you too, can find the humor in this video.

ALSO, I'm not even sure you need the other 6 videos if you want just a simple overview of some effective fighting techniques. This ONE video will give you a pretty good base. I haven't seen the other 6 videos in the set, but all I was looking for was a crash course on some fighting techniques, and this fit the bill perfectly.",1346630400,2,2692,4.463414634146342
4261440,5,B0044M2OTU,"This is a great followup to the highly effective and entertaining Ultimate Krav Maga Self Defense Instructional DVD series.

Duncan Pattle returns as the host and does an amazing job at adding to the skills he taught in the beginner to intermediate series.

I like how it started with a quick review of the basic combatives with important key points delivered in text during the action sequences.

It then continues with advanced techniques, which are important to know not only to deliver, but also to understand how to defend against. The benefits and the risks of techniques are discussed in order to give the viewer a full understanding on how to utilize them.

You will learn things like the spinning hammerfist, inward and outward chops, all headbutts, as well as a variety of back kicks, slap kicks, and heel kicks. Many of the kicks are also demonstrated in their jumping and spinning versions.

I found the fighting tactics to be very important for real life situations. You learn how to effectively counter attacks against single and double attackers as well as how to escape multiple opponents. The knowledge shared here increases your confidence as it gives you great tools to use if the need arises.

There are two concepts that have greatly improved my skills since learning from this DVD.
First, I like the concept of attacking the hands. These techniques are so simple and yet effective and many people have not been introduced to this idea.
Second, overwhelming the attacker is a tactic that works! This shift in mindset will raise your fighting ability and confidence.

As a bonus, the DVD contains a series of training drills that will greatly increase your awareness, focus, and fighting mentality. I highly recommend that you put these drills to work on a regular basis to help instill the fighting mindset that is needed to stay safe.

Again, this DVD is taught by great instructors and the techniques, tactics, and drills are highly effective at making anyone more proficient in Krav Maga and overall self-protection.

I cannot wait until the next installment comes out. I'll be the first one to order.",1344470400,,2125,4.91340782122905
4261441,5,B0044M2OTU,"I've been practicing kravmaga, reading books about KM and getting videos about KM training and this Ultimate DVD is a must have. It goes into the complexity of several attackers, fight yourself through a mob, and complex combo moves for several situations. Very well edited and produced, so you won't get tired of watching it over and over again. In kravmaga videos is common to encounter boring instructors and very slow paced content. This is not the case. 100% recommend it!",1340150400,,477,4.901234567901234
4261442,1,B0044M2OTU,"Very disappointing. I truly enjoyed the first 5 CD box set. But this is not of the same quality. Glad I waited until this was on the clearance rack to buy it. After the first set, some two to three years ago, I was very interested in obtaining this upcoming title that was listed as coming soon.

I think where this title went wrong was the first set taught things that were simple to learn and were sensible in being implemented at any age, which is clearly evidenced by the absence of, in this set of CDs, the more ""seasoned"" (older) instructors from the first set. This CD set goes way off that path with spinning kicks and fists and other movements that only an athletic person could pull off effectively. The first set seemed more user friendly toward women and others whom may have had very little self defense training/knowledge.

The only thing I kind of questioned of the first CD set were the pistol disarms. The way the first CDs taught it seemed very unrealistic and dangerous to attempt. But this CD is complete and utter BS! No one needs drills to tell you to fight as hard as HELL when your life is at stake!!! Futhermore, it certainly doesn't need an entire CD dedicated to it as the second CD was.

The first CD is about 25 percent of what they taught on the first 5 CD set. Surprisingly, they tell you a little more about why things were taught the way they were in the first set during the review, this information should have been contained in the first set of CDs... ie. Why fists should be on 45 degree angle. The answer may not be why you initially thought, or at least it wasn't for me...

Overall, I would say poor filming quality as compared to the previous 5 CD set, which was stellar. Poor instructors, almost comical in their different level of comfort on camera at times. There were absolutely no weapon disarming tactics (for an advanced CD???) and the ground fighting (drill section)seemed to deviate from what was taught in the first CD set. The only thing I found new/helpful, and the main reason I wanted the CD, was to learn more about the proper way to headbutt. But even that I have seen taught differently and possibly safer. I will give a little more credit, where credit is do, to the CD for the looking for gaps in an attacker's stance/fighting stlye.

If you want this CD set, I would say, try to get it as cheap as you possibly can!!!",1339200000,4,2378,4.407744874715262
4261443,4,B0044M2OTU,"I found this video interesting.  I originally bought it as a ""stress relieving"" workout video.  (I get a lot of aggression out by doing defense techniques.)  The video plays the scenario twice, then the instructor go through the moves and why, then plays a slow scenario, then normal speed.  I found myself following the scenarios beautifully on the second time I went through them.  I also found the female dubbing over the male instructor a little humorous which helped me keep loose during the exercises.  (She even says ""you bastard"" in one.  Had to replay it I was giggling so hard.)  If you want a way to learn something useful, aren't a die-hard, and need a way to focus inner-aggression this is it.  If you're a die hard looking for some new technique, you would probably want a more advanced video.",1323993600,,807,4.666666666666667
4261444,5,B0044M2OTU,All of the instructors on this DVD did a fantastic job. The instruction was clear and the way it was filmed was awesome. It was kind of like watching a movie with the cool music and editing style. I look forward to more DVDs from this company. Great Job!,1314662400,,254,4.204081632653061
4261445,1,B0044M2OTU,"The first set of 5 dvd's is very good.  However, this second, advanced series is terrible because of the WAY it was filmed. The instructors and demonstrators are wearing black t-shirts and the entire series is filmed in a low light, dark back ground. It makes people look as though the top part of the body is floating and one cannot SEE what they are actually doing.  It's too bad as the instruction is very good.... if only you could see it.  The Ultimate Krav Maga producers should redo this using a light background so viewers can see what is being demonstrated and taught. You'll be disappointed. [...]",1309824000,18,607,4.601851851851852
4261446,5,B0044M2OTU,"I was very pleased with the Ultimate Krav Maga DVDs. The narrator/host, Duncan Pattle, explains in great detail every move and attack in the simplest terms, so that any one who watches the DVDs can learn the basics of Krav Maga very quickly. And unlike other videos, he and his team keep it very interesting throughout the entire disc. Strikes, drills, and conditioning are all demonstrated in this video, and anyone from a beginner to a Krav Maga expert can benefit from viewing these videos !!",1308096000,,495,4.767441860465116
4261447,5,B0044M2OTU,"After having finished to watch the ""Ultimate Krav Maga"" DVDs very intensively, I had the great desire to learn more from these skilled instructors. So I was very glad about the ""Advanced Series"". In these DVDs you learn about some special technics and a lot about advanced drills and trainings methods to be prepared for a real life-threatening situation. These international instructors know what they are talking about! You learn about headbutts, spinning kicks etc., not only to apply them yourself, but also to know them if these technics should be aimed against you.
Pressure drills prepare you for the real fight situation. Simulating stress and unprovided situations during the training plays an enormously important role in realistic self defence.
In other drills, you learn to combine the technics you know so far. This is also one of the most important things: Not only delivering one good strike but series of different strikes blending one into another.
I'm now really looking forward to part 2 of the advanced series...
Simply to get better.",1301097600,3,1054,5.098265895953757
4261448,5,B0044M2OTU,The Ultimate Krav Maga are back with a new DVD.  The standards of teaching and instruction are once again of an excellent standard and the production technique again improves and enhances the learning experience. The Krav Maga systems has many facets. This one focuses on Fighting Tactics and does it very well.  I hope more DVDs like this are going to be produced in the near future.,1296691200,,384,4.7164179104477615

8416239,5,B0044M2OTU,"This is another DVD by this producer which matches what they promise. I have all of the other DVDs and am glad I added this one as well. They start with a short review of the basics, then get into partner drills which brings the level of pressure and challenge to another level within a safe environment. These drills will enhance your awareness and reaction time under pressure and have fun at the same time. I highly recommend this DVD to add it to your collection. There are many Krav Maga DVDs out there, but I feel I can and have learned much from this series. Obviously, it is a great complementary to my training under an instructor. By looking at the DVD your brain is being exposed to the information and you can envision yourself doing the drills. See yourself performing the drill. Your mind doesn't differentiate from mental training or visualization and actual physical action. I feel that's how it helps me when performing at the training center.",1414972800,,960,4.652941176470589
