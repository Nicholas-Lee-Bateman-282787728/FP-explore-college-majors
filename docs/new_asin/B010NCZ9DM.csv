It is up to us to read it, you just don't think its necessary since you bought 1 & 2 with No Problem. The first two are Wonderful! The 3rd we saw at a friends and it is very good too!
Hope we can get what we need to watch it again, even so we all walk around singing the songs too. Cant get the Soundtrack for the 1st movie either, which is such a shame but they are our new favorites! So, with that...Happy Christmas Everyone! ",1513296000,,526,3.9622641509433962

Deliberately bought PAL format as it has been the only version available for a very long time.  Had it converted to a digital file and watch it on my PC.
