The camera work is awkward at best with claustrophobic fisheye shots and weird angles...",1046044800,3,295,4.285714285714286
8186468,5,B00005UJ8U,"If you know any firefighters, get this video for them. As the father of two small children, I've seen a ton of ""Firetruck"" shows. This one is the best. It entertains the kids and really has a lot of interesting information. Plus, you get to visit the firefighters and get a real sense of what they do. The visuals are great. There's one shot from the top of a firetruck as it is answering a call and roaring through traffic that really makes you feel like you're there. My daughter and I also enjoyed seeing some FEMALE firefighters. There's a reason they're not called fireMEN anymore. Great video.",1014854400,11,599,4.555555555555555
