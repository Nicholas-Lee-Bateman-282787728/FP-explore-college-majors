7888002,5,6305334706,I love this movie. Saw it once many years ago and It was great seeing it again. Well worth owning a VHF as well as DVD player.,1363392000,,126,3.7037037037037037
7888003,5,6305334706,"This French film by de Broca defies description -- its simultaneously a taut mystery involving the murders of Members of Parliament, an hilarious comedy (including a fantastic take-off of police car chase scenes -- with a driver who doesn't know how to shift out of first gear!) and an absolutely delightful middle-aged romance between a mild-mannered bachelor professor of Greek (Philippe Noiret) and a hard-boiled divorced female police official investigating the murders (Annie Giradot) who re-meet years after their university days by accident (i.e., she hits him with her car while he is bicycling to work), with a good supporting cast (Guy Marchand and Catherine Alric only two of many) and set in the beautiful city of Paris (and with accurate sub-titles and fitting music). This is probably the only police murder procedural that qualifies as a ""date film"" guaranteed to leave a smile on the faces of all who see it.",1254182400,3,924,5.0855263157894735
7888004,4,6305334706,"A very good production of a favorite French comedy (with sub-titles). An outstanding cast and a fun plot. A female French Chief Inspector of Police is much more interested in romantically pursuing a reluctant, liberal ""anti- police"" professor than solving a serial killing which occasionally interferes. Typical of ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" and ""The Tall Blonde Man"" era. What favorably impressed me about Amazon was that the original copy that I was sent was of rather poor quality. When I contacted the seller, despite some initial well intentioned confusion in which they kept offering a full refund if I so desired, they rapidly sent a replacement copy in excellent condition, at no charge.",1178928000,5,689,5.160714285714286
7888005,5,6305334706,I saw this movie in Oakland 28 years ago and loved it.  I've been searching for a copy ever since.  Thoroughly enjoyable...vastly superior to today's insipid farce.,1158537600,,164,5.037037037037037
7888006,5,6305334706,"Ph. Noiret has a voice like Morgan Freeman has one: music and distinction in it. Annie Girardot has a temper like Woopie Goldberg. If you like parisian streets, french humour... and tenderness.",1101513600,2,193,5.0625
