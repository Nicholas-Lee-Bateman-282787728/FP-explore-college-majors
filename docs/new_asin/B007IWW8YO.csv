5090283,4,B007IWW8YO,"Have you ever wondered about those wise, earthly creatures that out-live humans? If so, check out this film! ""A Bird of The Air""  explores the history of a parrot that finds a man, but then takes us deeper. We soon find ourselves engaged in the story of a man and a women, who in the process of discovery regarding the bird, find themselves and each other.

Meaningful, colorful, and insightful.... ""A Bird of The Air"" is delightful!",1335052800,7,433,4.6103896103896105

5090288,5,B007IWW8YO,"For a unknown cast, i consider a B rated movie... This was very good,.",1524268800,,70,4.071428571428571
5090289,1,B007IWW8YO,"The film itself was Hollywood cutesy, with a ridiculously pretty and terminally witty librarian and a handsome but Aspie-ish highway worker as the main characters. However, the message was anything but--that it's acceptable to imprison a flying creature in a cage and pass it on or abandon it when you get bored with it, or it becomes too inconvenient for your lifestyle.

There are exotic bird sanctuaries filled to capacity for abandoned birds like the parrot depicted in this film. Many people are attracted to the idea of keeping a parrot in their homes, until they realize that these highly intelligent birds live a long time and need a lot of attention and care, pulling out their own feathers out of frustration if they're neglected.

Keeping a bird from flying is like forcing a human with perfectly functional legs to use a wheelchair. Life in a cage with maybe occasional opportunities to fly around the house is a horrible life for any bird.

Because it sends the wrong message, I don't recommend this film.",1524268800,2,1018,4.839080459770115
5090290,5,B007IWW8YO,"It's difficult to pull off an entire movie with basically just two people but this one did it.  Very intricate and well written film performed by two excellent actors, it should leave you very satisfied by the end.",1524096000,,214,4.631578947368421
5090291,5,B007IWW8YO,"Light-hearted film, but had some humor and also a sort of predictable ending.  Nice to watch a light film with odd characters that get along well.  Enjoyed spending the time watching it!",1524009600,,186,4.78125
5090292,5,B007IWW8YO,"Adorable! This is a great movie if you're looking for something with a mix of a little comedy, a little depth while staying light, and cute romance. I like the dynamic between the two main characters, and I love how the search to learn about the bird turns into something meaningful and symbolic.",1524009600,2,296,4.60377358490566
5090293,2,B007IWW8YO,"Plain, predictable, and the editing is choppy.  Nichols seems trying too hard to make her character perceived to be ""VERY cute"", but turns out to be fake and dramatic, which is very opposite to what her character is supposed to be, ""earthy and adorable"". Both Nichols and Hurst are attractive, but the chemistry between them is just not there; many occasions, I feel awkward to watch.",1524009600,,384,4.818181818181818

5090298,2,B007IWW8YO,"We've definitely seen worse movies. But few movies combine stilted acting, lack of chemistry, and an awkward script quite as uncompellingly as this one. Pick a different flick.",1523750400,,176,5.321428571428571

5090309,5,B007IWW8YO,"I loved the quirky characters. They seemed like such an unlikely pair, but they gradually grew together, just like in real life. There were a lot of sub plots and ideas accompanying the main story that added richness. I've not read the book, but it's clear that the movie had a great storyline below it. Movies like this are rare birds.",1522108800,4,336,4.524590163934426

5090315,5,B007IWW8YO,"Wonderful.  The stars are adorable  and good actors and there is a parrot and a Bassett  Hound .  This is light hearted, quirky, and charming.  It is a lovely diversion.  Note this, People, a Bassett Hound is a loveable, incredibly appealing canine with all the intelligence of a lug nut.  Smart they are not so to see one as well trained as the one in this movie is probably for most of us a once in a life time event !  Don't miss this movie !",1519948800,,445,4.093023255813954
5090316,5,B007IWW8YO,this movie is one of my favorites...good acting and a great  plot,1516838400,,65,4.416666666666667
5090317,3,B007IWW8YO,"At first glance, this looked like a sweet falling-in-love story between two opposites. It wanted so badly to be the cute and touching romantic comedy, but it tried too hard. The male lead was often wooden, even for an extreme introvert, and nothing was driving the plot forward. I think that's why there were two very sudden and overly dramatic devices thrown into the mix at the weirdest times, and because of those two things alone, it decreased my rating of this movie. I was left scratching my head and wondering why I had wasted my time. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. It's a good movie to leave on while you are dusting the house and don't really care to follow too closely.",1505260800,,697,4.5396825396825395
5090318,4,B007IWW8YO,Never heard of this film.  Screened it at my parrot club meeting.  The group gave it rave reviews.  Good heartwarming story about the people that move through a parrot's life.  The Amazon parrot they used was a hoot!,1474934400,,216,4.605263157894737

5090322,3,B007IWW8YO,"A friend loved this and suggested I watch. While the story line was different and I get the gist of the journey, I thought the whole thing was weak, the acting dry and over the top in some places. For me, it was just okay.",1470787200,,222,3.9555555555555557
5090323,4,B007IWW8YO,"I enjoyed this tender story of hope, redemption and acceptance. The story line is unique with a plot that keeps rolling out in ways that support the story. I love movies about librarians, so it won my heart with that key role.  I have to admit that I chose it because I have fallen in love with Jackson Hurst, one of the sweetest hunks around! Very satisfying, especially for one of those days when a good story is just the thing!",1469404800,2,430,4.308641975308642

5090328,4,B007IWW8YO,Love this film! The chemistry between the two main protagonists seems so pure and real. Can't wait to own the DVD so I can revisit it frequently.,1452297600,,145,4.407407407407407
5090329,5,B007IWW8YO,What a delight! One of those hidden gems. Non-formulaic quirky mix of a socially-challenged guy and a free-spirited girl who find common cause in a stray parrot. This amazing bird moves the film along while sparing us the usual tedious animal antics that would have obscured the delicate interweaving of two lives so desperately in need of human connection. Looks like this feathered polly-anna (Sorry! Couldn't resist) has had more meaningful human relationships than either of his would-be benefactors and will become the not-so-silent catalyst that helps them see they're more caged up than he is.,1449360000,10,600,5.260416666666667

5090334,4,B007IWW8YO,"I have a parrot so this movie had a special meaning to me. It is a quirky love story but I did enjoy watching it. I enclosed a picture of Bernie pulling one of his tricks. During a long recovery I required a help button to wear. One day he decided to push the emergency button on the main receiver all on his own. Only one of the many moments of the fun, frustration and loving companionship he brings to my life.",1433030400,2,413,4.048780487804878
5090335,3,B007IWW8YO,"I have an amazon and I'm a parrot freak, so that's why I wanted this movie. However, the acting leaves a lot to be desired and the storyline isn't exactly riveting. One of the main aspects of the movie was true to life and that was about finding the bird's original owner and discovering that it had had a long line a former owners. Unfortunately that occurs all the time; parrots are difficult to own as pets, which is why they are abandoned and neglected a lot of the time. Birds are very sensitive and intelligent and become very stressed when they are rehomed over and over, many times mutilating themselves because of that stress. They need lots of toys to destroy and new ones to replace the destroyed ones, which can get pricey, but it's very important for their well-being. They need chopped up fresh vegetables and fruits and nuts as well as a nutritional pellet food, although many, many people only feed their birds the seed mixes in bags from the pet store. If people decide after much contemplation that they can handle owning a parrot, there are a LOT of bird rescues and sanctuaries to adopt from! I believe that breeding parrots is unconscionable when it comes to the bigger birds, especially cockatoos, but also macaws, African Greys, amazons and also smaller ones like conures that are often too loud for many people. Adopt! Don't Shop!!",1432080000,,1355,4.673640167364017

5090345,5,B007IWW8YO,"ALL Parrot Owners need to watch this movie!

It tells the story of a parrot who flies into the trailer home of a man and how
the man went back to trace the history of the parrot.

""A Bird of the Air"" is a saying the parrot often says.

The journey the man goes on takes is amazing.
He meets a girl and her dog.
And as well know, parrots have a mind of their own, and he
makes it known!

I'd like to say more on this movie, but it would ruin it.

Again, animal and especially Parrot owners need to watch this movie!!!",1406678400,3,516,3.876190476190476

5090347,5,B007IWW8YO,This movie is lovely.  A sweet message about how people have hidden depths and great unsuspected gifts that one has to be willing to have patience and devote time to another person to discover.  Well worth watching.  We both loved this movie.  Rhonda in Alabama,1394668800,,261,4.733333333333333

5090350,5,B007IWW8YO,"The story is mostly about the man who found the parrot, or should I say, the bird found him. He tries to track down the previous owners of the parrot and in the process finds love. I would have liked to see more of the parrot in the movie but the story is cute. There are some comical moments as well as more emotional threads all throughout. Both my husband and myself enjoyed this movie. My husband is the one who gave it 5 stars. I would have given it 4 stars only because of the lack of parrot scenes.",1381708800,2,505,4.06

5090358,5,B007IWW8YO,"A very different, out of the mainstream, kind of movie, but totally fun. Kind of an out-there ditzy girl is trying to connect with a quiet, loner guy. She uses his parrot, and her love of animals to to finally force her way in. A very fun ride.",1362873600,,244,4.104166666666667
5090359,5,B007IWW8YO,"This is simply a great little film, the kind I want to see more of. The story was allowed to unfold, not pushed, as two wounded characters find their way past their wounds to unlock each other, using their research on the history of a parrot's life as a springboard to unlock the blocks to their own happiness and fulfillment. The actors produced fine, nuanced performances that can measure up to performacnes in some of the best European films of the last century: sexy young people yet making their way through some real dark emotional forests to emerge into the light. No big special effects and the cheap stuff that can fill other films with a lot of empty jazz. This is a character film, and the actors fill in all the small places to make it well-rounded so that the larger theme really shines for the viewer by the time the film takes you to the next to last scene, where your heart or stomach make their way to your throat, only to settle into a really satisfying ending. Good performances by the supporting cast, too, and kudo's for the writer and director of this lovely story and lovely film. I am still reflecting on it days after having seen it. Well done!",1362528000,,1169,4.4672897196261685
5090360,3,B007IWW8YO,It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't GREAT either. A few times I thought the movie put stress on things that would matter later in the movie and nothing ever came of it?? I wouldn't add it to the keepers in my collection.,1357430400,,220,4.0227272727272725

5090366,5,B007IWW8YO,I must give five starts to this movie because I fell in love with the actors and their love story.  The chemistry between Rachel Nichols and Jackson Hurst was very believable.  You will laugh and cry in this film and if you must know...it has a happy ending.  Of course the parrot was excellent too!  I will definitely add this movie to my collection in the near future.

I have watched the movie several times now, and one of my own birds has come out with the word *eagle*.  I am only waiting for her to connect the action that goes with it now.

The rest of the cast weren't much better, but she was in a league of her own when it came to how incredibly bad she was. We are talking cringe-inducing bad. When it was over, we just looked at each other and talked about how on earth it got past production. The bummer part is with some decent and believable acting/dialogue, it could have been a decent movie because the story was interesting.
And curiousity question, what was with everyone having the same ultra-blue/green eyes?",1347494400,,598,4.704761904761905
5090370,5,B007IWW8YO,"We loved it!!!!  A parrot easily becomes a centerpiece in your life.  Having had a Parrot in the family, this movie really hits a home run.  This is a must see!!",1347321600,,161,4.129032258064516
5090371,5,B007IWW8YO,A wonderful romance that also shows how animal companions can change and make your life better. The story was incredible and the acting was superb. Movie of the year for me!!,1346889600,,174,4.645161290322581
5090372,5,B007IWW8YO,"First and foremost, this is a romance.  Based on the Joe Coomer's novel, The Loop, it also offers comedy, drama, animals, mystery, tragedy all wrapped up in a satisfying package of goofiness and zip-up overalls.

Lyman(Jackson Hurst) lives as the Lone Ranger.  A man of few words, mysterious past, he prefers isolation, living in annonymity in a trailer during the day, attending college on the forever plan to learn helpful skills and languages, but then at night, donning his mask, a set of overalls and a cap, to rescue those in need and clean up the messes of disasters that the world discards while working the highway courtesy patrol.  One day, a talking parrot flies into his place, and sets off a determined, noble quest by him to discover the bird's owner(s) and past and perhaps discover his as well.

Enter Fiona(nicely done by Rachel Nichols)the school's librarian and her dog.  Drawn to those things unavailable, she relentlessly sets her sight on obtaining him.  He's a challenge, and she's up to it.  Cute, forward, obnoxiously flirtatious, but underneeth vulnerable and fragile in her own way, she upturns his life as she helps, unwantedly, to solve his mysteries.

It's a comedy of opposites: his life ordered and apparently fixed, hers a mess like her car, named Sacajawea.  Fiona's life, though passionate, is flighty and temporary.  Lyman's, though noble, is empty and lonely.  It's  fun to watch the conflict of the two worlds, and how the real attachments and understanding start to grow.  She becomes smitten with him, and he starts to open up and join the human race and appreciate her.  But can he ever truly, love her, and can she get beyond just the romantic image she holds of him.  It's the joy of the journey, and there are some great cameos by the likes of veterans Buck Henry and Judith Ivy et al.

The filming and directing are nicely done.  It's a low budget film with characterizations and oddities of life the emphasis.  The nighttime desert highway shots are both creepy and beautiful.

Not a family tale, there are some tragic situations not shown in gratuity, mild language, some prelude to sex, but no real nudity.  Of note, both the main actors have done a lot of TV work and are good.  Rachel Nichols graduated from Columbia with dual degrees in economics and math and went on to modeling then acting.  Jackson Hurst graduated from Baylor with double majors in economics and management info systems with a minor in Spanish.",1346803200,11,2465,4.802850356294536

5090378,5,B007IWW8YO,"This is a wonderful twist on the ""boy meets girl"" plotline.  Both of the major characters have significant personality flaws, and Margaret Whitton has paid careful attention to their development to hold the viewer's rapt attention and make both of them endearing.  Zane the parrot could easily steal the entire movie, and Floyd the basset hound has similar star quality.  Ultimately, the blend of characters and their perseverance in their quests is nuanced and extremely well-developed.  Loved it!  Hope to see more of Margaret Whitton's work.",1341100800,2,544,5.27906976744186

5090382,5,B007IWW8YO,"After seeing the movie, I am sure we will be seeing more of Rachel Nichols and Jackson Hurst. The movie, ""A Bird of the Air is a fresh new romantic comedy, loaded with palpable chemistry between the lead characters. Fiona (Rachel Nichols) helps unravel the mystery of Lyman's (Jackson Hurst) parrot, but more importantly unravels the mystery behind Lyman's propensity to avoid relationships altogether. Lyman goes to great lengths to do this. He works the graveyard shift for the transportation department (which coincidentally was interesting in itself, i.e., stuff you never knew that goes on all night) to avoid speaking to people altogether. Lyman still somehow manages to be totally hot and camara-ready despite the fact he is in an unappealing jumpsuit most of the movie. The movie gives us hope that there are interesting and intense love stories waiting to be uncovered even in the most of ordinary of landscapes. I also happen to have enjoyed the lighting in this movie. It's vibrant coloration seemed to make the movie more compelling and more intense overall. Well worth the price of a DVD!",1337126400,17,1101,5.021857923497268

5090388,5,B007IWW8YO,"These days, it's a rare film that forgoes special effects and car crashes, relying on nothing more than a good story and the actors who tell it. But Margaret Whitton (I think she's a first time director as I was unable to find anything else by her)  has done just that. This little gem-of-a-film somehow found me and won my heart. It's a bit of fairytale, love story and magic realism, blended together and seasoned with heart and warmth. I'm hoping my description hasn't made it sound too ""cute,"" although it would make for a fine, night at the movies with a date. I won't reveal anything about the storyline for fear of robbing you of the pleasure of watching it unfold.",1337040000,6,672,4.508196721311475

It is a terrific story, with flawed but attractive people who find themselves in an awkward situations, but everything resolves nicely in a storybook ending that is unexpected and refreshing.

Margaret Whitton's directing and  decisions in telling the story harkened back to the days of real film-making and I can only imagine how happy Joe Coomer, the book's author, is that the film equalled his amazing book. I fell in love with every character both two and four-footed all over again. Special highlights are also seeing some of the film world's best character actors together on one screen and to walk out realizing that there still are films made that parents can share with their children and together experience hope and love by celebrating the joys in a person's idiosyncrasies without the any violence or foul language.

The male lead is sort of charming, and it would be nice to find out if his range extended into any other emotions as the story developed, or if he stayed locked in the same surly shyness all the way through. But the female lead is so unbelievably obnoxious that I couldn't get past about 25 minutes.

EVERY TIME she came on screen and opened her mouth or gave that stupid dimply smirk I cringed, and I wanted some berserk extra to run up and punch her very hard in the face. Nobody ever did, and I couldn't stand any more of her, so I stopped watching. It's not like I HAD to watch this movie.

It's amazing that such an obnoxious person ever got hired to be in anything, even a direct-to-video flop like this. I need to look up her name so I can be very sure never to see her again. Rachel Nichols. Yuck.",1526860800,,878,4.098837209302325
