1272234,3,B00003CXNX,"Living with her brother, and loser father, Bronx girl Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), lashes out with anger to everyone she meets.
While visiting her brother at his practice in a boxing gym, Diana, realizes the best outlet for her frustrations will be boxing.
Being the only girl in an all male boxing gym, Diana, has to deal with prejudice, as well as hostility with the fellow boxers, and although being completely focused on being a contender, Diana, opens up her heart to Adrian (Santiago Douglas), a featherweight looking to make it as a professional boxer.
Before long, the two are dealing with the problems each has kept bottled-up, and falling in love.  But as luck would have it, Diana, and Adrian are put in a situation that may rip them apart.
""Girlfight"" is a good movie, if a little over-rated.  The performances of Michelle Rodriguez, and Santiago Douglas are strong, and the romance between the two is interesting enough to carry the whole movie, but what could have been a great coming-of-age tale, becomes somewhat boring as too much time is spent on boxing, and not enough time developing Diana's stormy past, and the relationship of the young couple.  This could have been an excellent film, but as it stands it's watchable for the performance's of the two young stars, and the surprise at the end is suspenseful enough to bring about the satisfying climax.

1272235,5,B00003CXNX,"American movies rarely focus on the underclass without (a) glamorising the violence inherent within the 'hood' (b hammer you over the head with its socially redeeming message or  (c) milk the rare and the bizarre out of the situation to titilate the overstimulated middle class adolescent audience. To its credit this movie attempts none of these. Director Karyn Kusama and lead Michelle Rodriguez can take a lot of credit and pride for the obvious work and thought that has gone into the making of this movie. It deserves all the accolades it has been awarded.
Its naturalistic shooting style and dialogue puts to shame hundreds of movies that have operated on a budget 5 times its scale. Money cant make up for lack of talent or integrity and this movie has that and more.
Diana(Michelle Rodriguez)is a young woman with an attitude. Her constant fighting at school consistently gets her in trouble with the school authorities. Her home life isn't much better with a solo dad bitter with failure and a geek younger brother at odds with the tough urban environment. To toughen him up Dad pays for him to learn boxing at what has got to be the most realistic version of the seedy gym ever filmed. She is attracted by the pugilistic world she encounters and persuades the trainer to take her on and train her. The film revolves around the challenges she has to become a boxer and gain respect,the disapproving father and a burgeoning relationship with one of the other boxers.
Its sucess comes from its simplicity. The director never overplays her hand and every scene has a ring of authenticity to it. She is served well by the lead actress who acts as if the part was written about her and for her. This almost lowkey documentary approach beautifully mirrors the no BS attitude of the character and the boxing subculture of the nickel and dime gym. Her brooding defiant glare says more about this character than 10 pages of dialogue and aptly is the image used to market the film.
Girlfight makes an interesting counterpoint to the othe rave martial movie of the moment,Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon. Both films with a stunning young female protagonist,a film grad student could have a field day (and probably will) comparing the gender and power themes inherent in both films,one yin,one yang,one soft,one hard,one on an epic scale, the other made on the others catering budget. Both a triumph for their respective directors.
Great films transcend gender,culture and ideologies. Thats because they reveal truths about the human spirit and soul at a level we all connect to. Girlfight connects with the left, the right, the jab and the uppercut. A winning combination.",982368000,15,2668,4.88962472406181

1272470,3,B00003CXNX,"It was odd.
I was looking for a boxing movie and I got it so that is...nice? I guess...
The boyfriend goes bounces between 'nice' and 'whiny' throughout the entire movie.

While I know that women don't show muscle as distinctively as men do, it still takes a lot of time to develop the amount of muscle needed to take down a man twice her size and it showed some training but mostly, it focused on her learning the footwork and combinations (when they weren't focusing on Adrian).

In the climax, I think Adrian let her win the match. I think it was something along the lines of 'Am I so determined to go pro that I'm willing to beat up my girlfriend?' and when he said that he 'gave it all he had', he gave it all he had emotionally - not physically.

Boys are different from girls. Guys can bulk up; women can't. I'm not saying that women can't be as strong as a man but she will never be bulky. Unless a woman is specifically training herself otherwise, a man will win on the power scale every time.
I think it was a good movie. I'm not going to rent it again but it was somewhere between 'okayish' and 'good'.

1272536,5,B00003CXNX,"I've always loved this film and the way it represents woman. Usually, it's the woman that gives up herself and her dreams for the man that is currently in her life. But Diana, the character that Michelle Rodriguez plays, is such an empowering female. She decides that she wants better for her self and to finally stand up to abusive father. Diana does't break down when her love interest, Adrian Sturges played by Santiago Douglas, goes out with a ""prettier"" girl after showing his interest to Diana, instead she channels her rage and hurt and improves herself in a sport that is mainly dominated and controlled by men. She rises so much so, that she started to get attention from the boxing world. Something that her love interest wasn't expecting, and realizes that he grouped Diana like those ""other girls"" when clearly she is not. I do recommend this movie, especially to you females who need a positive female character.",1415664000,3,925,4.7875

1272540,4,B00003CXNX,"They aren't reinventing the wheel here. It's pretty much a paint by numbers flick, but I found it absorbing none the less.

Here's the scoop. Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) is a high school senior with a bad attitude. She lives with her brother and father. Dad has his artistically inclined son training at a boxing gym to toughen him up. Diana gets a sense she should be doing this so she convinces a trainer at the gym to train her. Now all things around her change.

Michelle Rodriguez will probably never be a great actress but she has a strong presence and here, in her screen debut, she gives the viewer a good look at what would propel her into a formidable career. She has a natural ability in front of the camera and a pair of killer eyes. She has a strong and tight looking body so you believe her in the role. Her physical attitude, even in the way she walks, also signals that she has what it takes to step into the ring. Strong use is made of her surroundings. She's poor. Her boxer boyfriend is poor. These aren't bad folk. They've merely been toughened by their surroundings and boxing offers them a way out and a way to develop a sense of self worth.

Some of the dialogue might be a bit too insightful given the characters we're dealing with. Some of the scenes are a bit clunky, and at times I was too aware of the camera, but I found myself being drawn in none the less. I liked these people and wanted them to succeed. By the time the film ended I was in all the way. I might be a bit generous with the four star rating, but this is definitely worth while. A movie can be good for any number of reasons. It doesn't have to be art or even all that original. If it sets out to do ""X"" and accomplishes that goal, it can be deemed a success. This is a success.",1411603200,,1779,4.195906432748538

1272725,5,B00003CXNX,I've been searching for a movie where Michelle Rodriguez has a bigger part. I think Girl fight was her first movie and she hit a home run.  John,1278633600,2,144,4.142857142857143
1272726,4,B00003CXNX,"A lot of people have written off Michele Rodriguez.  I totally get that.  I mean, I really totally understand that.  That is why, when I defend her, I understand why people don't bother to listen.  It's not that she has produced a lot of amazing work, and her personal life is simply a mess.  That said; if you haven't seen her marvelous performance in `Girlfight' then I really think you need to sit down and breathe it all it.

As a tough Brooklyn teen, Rodriguez plays the role of Diana.  Diana has a troubled life (not the least of her problems being her father) and is prone to violence in school.  When she seeks an outlet for her anger, she turns to boxing (naturally).  At first she is somewhat dismissed, but Diana is not only physically tough, she is mentally determined and that goes a long way.  Through this new facet of her life, Diana is able to exercise personal demons in a constructive and ultimately rewarding way.

It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it.

There are some conventional clich&eacute;s in the script that emerge as the film draws in for the finale (that whole love interest subplot is rather unnecessary but the romance sells tickets so I understand it) but overall this is just a simple yet poignant story being told very well.  There are no shocking revelations or big reveals and twists here and the story isn't one that will blow you away or haunt you, but it is to-the-point and sincere.

So, let's talk about Michele Rodriguez for a minute.  Her performance here is just phenomenal.  The way that she effortlessly captures every ounce of this woman's soul, it is just so engaging and powerfully mesmerizing.  There are some roles that some actors or actresses seem born to play.  This is the case for Michele and the role of Diana.  She embodies the pain, the hurt, the anger, the fierce determination.  She commands every scene.  It is no surprise at all to me that she racked up those critics awards for breakthrough actress.

She really was astonishing.

So, while there may be nothing overly remarkable about the film, it is a very well made and acted drama that will engage and reward the viewer; most definitely.",1274140800,,2158,4.606299212598425
1272727,3,B00003CXNX,"Having heard a lot about this movie for years, I was disappoint to finally watch it and see that it's more a love story than a true depiction of a girl, a woman, breaking through the barriers of a male-dominated society and getting into boxing. Although the movie does have a boxing storyline at its center, it often looses its way in its overall theme and stumbles. Michelle Rodriguez though, has a natural knack for acting (this is her debut role) and tends to make the best of her moody scenes. Overall, this is a good indie feature but it's hardly an earth-shattering film.",1273449600,,577,4.5576923076923075

Girlfight is quite different and is right up there as one of my favorite movies. Great storytelling by Director Karyn Kusama and the cast is superb. Kusama commented that the uncut version is 3 hours long. The movie draws you in and you care about the development of the characters. I would like to have seen the 3 hour version. How about a sequel?

You can always find faults with a movie if you wanted to but this is a very satisfying peformance and you find yourself rooting for the two lovers.

She doesn't leap these hurdles to prove something to society, but because she knows she's good, and with training, could be better.

This a great movie for the younger generation. It portrays hope, desire, ambition, drive, whatever you want to call it.  The directing was great: the city scenes, the fighting scenes, and the family scenes sucked you into a world of struggle and survival.

The theme might be cliched, but the acting certainly is not.  The girl who plays the main character is fabulous, with a signature glare that would send anyone in their right mind sprinting to the other corner of the ring.  The usual love-interest schtick is also complicated by some interesting plot twists.

As per the subject of this review, this movie is like Million Dollar Baby, but with admirable performances by unknown actors, and without the melodramatic ending.  Though my sincerest admiration goes out to the women stars of BOTH these films.",1125619200,5,718,4.852459016393443

1272814,5,B00003CXNX,"Prove them wrong. Three short simple words punctuate this Girlfights tagline. Three words that have the effect of a boxing combination even Rocky would be proud of delivering. Prove them wrong, three words that the films protagonist has to live by because everyone and everything seems to be working against her.

Girlfight is the story of a quick-tempered young woman who finds discipline, self-respect and love in the boxing ring. One day, after just having a fight in school, and being warned that she better get her act together or else, she goes to the gym to pick up her brother. After a sparring partner sucker punches her brother, she attacks the boxer. Once Diana decides she wants to become a boxer her priorities are forced into focus as she begins a grueling training regimen in the same gym her brother trains in. Along the way she falls in love with a talented amateur in the same gym.

We are inundated with Hollywood pictures. The money shot, the big budget, the big names. Sometimes with all of that you get a big zero. Then there are the independents. The films that are made with little money, with talented, but not yet famous people, sometimes you get zero here as well. Not this time. Girlfight is one of those small indie pictures that packs a wallop.

Newcomer Michelle Rodriguez is brilliantly enigmatic as the troubled Diana. We can see the adolescent angst in her, and believe her motivations when she wants something more, when she wants to learn to box. Rodriguez not only is able to play the hard edged side to Diana, but the softer, more vulnerable side as well. I hope to see a lot more of her in the near future.

The film won many awards at Sundance, and happened to do well considering that most of the two months it was out, it was only in limited release at less than 100 theatres. Please don't be confused by the title. This is not a soft core piece of fluff, nor is it a film for girls.

This is a film for everyone.",1104796800,8,1955,4.495774647887324

1272896,5,B00003CXNX,"OK, so ""Rocky I"" wasn't so bad (in my book).  The big lug had his challenges in and out of the ring to overcome.  But that movie shot for the big time, the big crowds, and the big excitement.  Not bad, but after hearing that pep rally theme song a million times over the last 300 years, it's become more of a cartoon character than what it probably was originally intended to be.  Thirty five sequels with exactly the same plot doesn't help this point of view.
No such problems with ""GirlFight"".  This is a much smaller film about boxing where, as much as ""Rocky"" came from a less than desirable background, he doesn't have as many problems as Diana, the lead character has.  While Rocky won the lottery to fight Apollo Creed, which makes him the Willie Wonka of boxing, Diana is never going to get such a break.
One of the magical things about the film is that Diana recognizes she has the small problem of getting into fights in high school.  After her fourth scuffle in a semester, and the threat of expulsion, she's smart enough to realize that she needs an outlet, which she finds at the local gym that her brother is involved in.  The brother is forced to take boxing lessons from her father, who wouldn't dream of letting a girl into the sport.  That Diana steals and connives her way into the gym doesn't make her an outstanding person, but it is a gritty portrayal of a person's determination to try and accomplish something.
I live in Las Vegas, and have seen that there are growing opportunities in the world of female boxing.  But that path was not so clear three or four years ago, when the movie was written.  So I'll go with the plot situations that need her to fight males, or not fight at all.  But while most movies would have some plot gimmick to occur in the ring, this movie just has her slugging it out.  It pulls no punches (pun intended) to show that she has to fight for everything tooth and nail in the ring as much as she has to in life.
My daughter is in gymnastics, a sport in image as far away from boxing as it gets.  But, although the movie has a lot of rough language, I've shown it to her as inspiration to see how obstacles in life have to be overcome as well as those in just the sport.  I think she's learned to appreciate things a little more after the viewing (in my book).",1044144000,2,2312,4.2949308755760365

The boxing, however, is not quite there in all three movies though. Moves were kinda sloppy with all the dropped hands and rabbit punches. Someone definitely needs to train these girls more if they want to see more like legitimate boxers on the silver screen. But as a dramatic movie, Girlfight wins in the entertainment factor. Well, as some said, it does get weak towards the end of the movie. I was kinda left bewildered as to what direction they were trying to go at the end so I was left a bit unsatisfied.

1272904,5,B00003CXNX,"Writer/Director Karyn Kusama's tour de force about the fledgling world of women pugilists brilliantly showcases the beauty, athletism and talent of star-in-the making Michelle Rodriguez (Diana Guzman).
Handsome Santiago Douglas as Diana's love interest, Adrian, is not only poetry in motion in his boxing scenes but his character is strongly defined, well acted and believable.
Hector (Jaime Tirelli) as Diana's boxing coach is solidly behind her and teacher her not just the moves but also the strategy and mindset a successful boxer must have in order to win. He believes in her when no one else does -- possibly not even herself.
The love story between Diana and Adrian is put to the test both figuratively and literally. When she runs to him and they hold each other it is less about sex and more about two people who have not been held enough or loved enough and find that physical contact can be rewarding and gratifying instead of always brutal.
Eventually of course you know that they must meet in the ring.
All of the boxing scenes are gritty, tough and very real -- no punches were pulled in the filming of these scenes.
The character of Diana's little brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) could have been explored a little more -- there may be a whole further film there.
The cinematography by Patrick Cady moves from frenetic while in the ring to soft, sweet and intimate in the tender and quiet moments.
The soundtrack is very nice -- adding just the right touches of emotion at precisely the right times.
I wonder how many people that see this film make the connection that Ira (Tom Barbour) the owner/manager of the seedy boxing gym where most of the action takes place is also the billionaire father of Dudley Moore in the `Arthur' films!
This is a first rate film with great production values, a great cast that has a compelling story to work with all put together by a brilliant director.

While all the men in this film are laughable, it's strange that even the female boxer star of the film is made to look like a joke. We go into the movie wanting to believe in her but by the end it becomes impossible. If this movie really was based on the life of Lucia Rijkers, the remarkable women's champion who was so brilliantly depicted in the documentary Shadow Boxers, then they should have used Rijkers herself.

1272996,5,B00003CXNX,"With a one, two punch, this movie knocks your senses for a loop.
Brooklyn native Diana has lead a life of trouble. She seeks it like a bee does honey. Any fight that comes her way she will take it, any challange that faces her she tackles it--the hard way. Growing up in a bad neighborhood with her emotionally abusive father Sandro and younger brother ""Tiny"" has not been easy. Especially since Diana's mother committed suicide years before and left Diana and ""Tiny"" without a gentle mother figure to protect, love, and look up to.
Marisol, a girl from school, is Diana's only friend. While Diana sees Marisol more like someone who needs her protection against people who will take her for granted, Marisol sees Diana as violent, tempramental, but a loyal friend. They get along because they understand the boarders of each others character and for the most part accept it about each other.
Diana soon finds a way to channel all of her inner aggressions when she sets out to pay Hector, a local boxing trainer, to train her to be a boxer. Overcoming hardships and gender differences she excels and learns where she can be accepted for the agresstion and power that she has inside her. And finally she finds a place to fit in. In the boxing ring.
Adrian has always wanted to be a boxer and has trained for years to become a pro athelete in the sport to make some money as well as a little fame from the Brooklyn side of town. But when he finds himself becoming interested in the aggressive yet pretty Diana he finds himself questioning things about himself he has never had to face before. And soon, as they are pitted up against each other he must determine what is more important, love or winning.
This movie has some slow parts here and there and in essense you want to see MORE fighting going on than really happens which can make it a little frustrating. I mean, you really want to see this chick set someone to the mat, esp with all the gender hardships that happen in the gym but beside all that you see enough for some great eye candy. This movie hits home for me. It is one of those feel good movies that speaks to the heart and yet has enough hostility in it to show the darker side of personalities and hurt and be glad that I've never been in THAT much trouble before.",1018828800,,2280,4.430952380952381
1272997,4,B00003CXNX,"Girlfight (Karyn Kusama, 2000)

It's rare that TV station-produced films (this one comes courtesy of IFC) live up to their pre-release hype. Girlfight not only did so, IFC's commercials may have understated the case for this overlooked gem of a film.

Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez [Resident Evil], in her big-screen debut) is a high school student with a very bad attitude and four trips to the principal's office in one semester for fighting. When she's asked to run some money from her father down to the Brooklyn gym where her brother trains, she finds herself intrigued by the idea that people can not only fight without getting called to the principal's office, but might actually get paid for it. From there, it's a pretty small step to begging, borrowing, and stealing in order to come up with the cash for her to start training as well. Hector (Law and Order regular Jaime Tirelli), one of the gym's trainers, is willing to take her on, and away we go.

Part of the brilliance of Girlfight is that it's a sweet movie masquerading as a tough movie. While the film never loses focus on Diana's up-and-coming boxing career, Kusama balances the boxing with Diana's coming-of-age story; it's never explicitly said, but we get the feeling the developing relationship between her and another boxer is, in fact, her first real love affair. Another part of the brilliance is that it's a boxing movie that, well, doesn't have all that much boxing in it. Fight Club this ain't; there's actually very little in-the-ring action, and what there is is quite tastefully done (including some excellent from-the-fighter's-perspective camerawork). At various times during the film, boxer affirmations tacked to the walls of the gym are focused on for a few seconds, and it's obvious that Kusama takes the first one very seriously-that boxing is a game of brains over brawn.

Many mystery novelists could take some from Kusama about how to unobtrusively introduce storylines.  There is nothing of artifice in the way the film is set up; everything falls together in just the right way, to the point where much of the film has an almost documentary feel to it. Comparisons are inevitable, warranted, and favorable to Matty Rich's excellent film Straight Outta Brooklyn, but Kusama is a little more slick in her ability to keep everything smooth and well-paced throughout.

Girlfight is yet another film from the supposedly mediocre crop of movies released in the year 2000 that puts paid in no uncertain terms to that judgment. In retrospect, 2000 may have been one of the strongest years for film, especially independent film, we've seen. **** ",1017619200,3,2636,4.963718820861678

1273001,3,B00003CXNX,"For entertainment value, this movie scores quite high.  But i feel it does not deliver what it should.  For one thing, it is tremendously predictable: you know Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to get involved with Adrian (Santiago Douglas), you know she is going to end up fighting with him, you know she is going to beat him in their fight (not unlike a Venus vs. Serena Williams scenario)...  With all the guesswork gone, the only thing left was the excellent acting that Diana and especially Hector (Jaime Tirelli) showed us, plus the excitement that i, as a girl, felt every time Diana kicked some serious...  Boy, can she fight!
I would have liked to see how Diana dealt with the rest of society after so many months of training had gone by.  How about school?  Was she getting into as many fights as before?  What about her dad (Paul Calderon)?  The last time he appears on screen, Diana beats him up.  Was there a resolution afterwards?  Did Diana feel better after she told her dad all that she had been dying to yell for so long?  Did her dad's attitude towards her changed?  How was boxing helpful to Diana?  Too many questions that the movie did not answer.

We are shown the stark reality of Diana's life in the projects, her troubles in school, and the even stronger troubles at home with her belittling and abusive father. When she has to pick up her younger brother Tiny from boxing lessons she is thrust into a world she has never seen before, and is ultimately drawn to it. We watch her struggle with herself, against others who can't believe a girl can hold her own against a man in the ring, and moreover we watch her put down myths from small minds. When she falls in love with Hector(Jamie Tirelli) a fellow competitor in the ring, it begins to complicate her world in many respects.
Karyn Kusama does a wonderful job of directing this film, she keeps it raw and real. You don't doubt or second guess anything in the film.

When her oppressive father asks her to deliver an amount of money to one of Brooklyn's famous boxing gyms, the meaning of being reveals itself as ""Boxing"". First comes Boxing to Diana Guzman's life, followed up by Love (with a male boxer- and a later opponent that is). With her love and anger Diana Guzman stands against patriarchal order by doing what this order is basically established upon: using physical force to beat one up. Okay wait, but she does it only in the ring and this is believed to make Diana a better person in school and anywhere outside the ring. But then again she ends up beating the hell out of her father who forces her younger brother Tiny to go boxing when all Tiny wants is to study art; and who does not appreciate Diana's enthusiasm in boxing; and whom Diana holds responsible for her mother's death. A typical american independent film, in the way the problem is presented both visually and scriptwise. Slowly the story is told, with sudden shockingly beatiful scenes (such as the part where two woman boxers are in the ring) and  boringly (but very realistically) put love scenes. The female character building up a harsh male attitude against the male order is a bit problematic but still the film is very well directed and the cast, especially rodriguez is very successful. Recommend myself to wait and see Kusama's second film before establishing any prejudice(be it positive or negative) on her career as a director. No words to say on the DVD quality.

1273074,4,B00003CXNX,"Girlfight has been well received by the public and critics alike. The film portrays the dismal living conditions of the Bronx.
The opening scene sets the tone for the film, as the camera focuses on a young girl obviously in her teenage years with stunning looks and an intense persona. Within ten minutes she is fighting the lead cheerleader, a teacher disbands the fight and Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodrigez), gets a formal warning from the head mistress.  It becomes clear, when Diana walks home through the projects, where her aggressive behavior stems from, living in a small flat with a father, who is an alcoholic and gambler.
Diana also lives with her younger brother Tiny, (Ray Sntigo) and although he is understanding of Diana, he deals with the situation differently by immersing himself in books and art. They are both fighting their fathers' social paradigm and it is clear Diana has played the role of mother and bodyguard to Tiny throughout the absence of a mother figure. This is seen when Diana punches Tiny's boxing opponent, after an un-fair match.  They are both fighting for survival and to finally break the family mold.
It is not until Diana manages to convince her brother's boxing coach to become her mentor that Diana's full potential is materialized. She has the power all she needs to develop is technique and stamina.  Determined to make it and become a good fighter she starts running laps at her school, and starts training seriously with Hector (Jamie Tirelli) her coach, he recognizes her talent and starts entering her into competitions, although in her first fight her opponent is disqualified she continues to train hard.  It is whilst training at the local gym that she meets her boyfriend Adrian (Santigo Douglas), a smooth talking mechanic who sees his way out of poverty by becoming a professional boxer, not only does he have the good looks but he also has the talent. Issues arise in their relationship when Diana finds out that he has been seeing a very good looking girlfriend on the side, she is used as a party piece to show off to all the other boxers, this is how he gains respect in and out of the boxing ring. Diana's father opposes her boxing career and tries his hardest to stop her, it is not until they end up having a fist fight and he loses to Diana that he becomes distant and ultimately disinterested. It is his attitude that makes her want to become one of the best and she goes on to fight one of the best amateur female boxers to win. It is from this point on that she is treated seriously by her male peers.
She gets through to the finals and she has to compete against Adrian. She wins, not only the fight but also her pride. This film is fantastic, although the acting can be a bit wooden in parts, and the visual quality is poor. The over all performances from Michelle Rodregez and especially Jamie Trielli are impressive.
The director's ability to question social acceptability is inspirational. Karyn Kusama is a director to watch for in the future.
This film is for all the girls who never quite fitted in at school and as adults find it hard to embrace the image that pervades capitalist society as we know it. The female image that is depicted in fashion magazines and television. The one that states all women should wear makeup follow fashion and be unhealthily slim.

1273075,4,B00003CXNX,"Directed by first-time director/writer Karyn Kusama, Girlfight is a gripping urban drama that follows the trials of Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) a tomboyish protagonist with a tortured past and an emotionless father. Equipped with her bruting fists and emblazoned emotion, Diana decides to take her distaste of all things wrong with those in her immediate sphere of influence and put it to productive use, through the vein of boxing. In this film we follow her through the hollowed detention halls of her inner-city high school, the romance that blossoms between her and the boyfriend her father refuses to accept, and her journey through the patriarchal arena of professional boxing. Shot in a documentary-style (devoid of big-budget Hollywood sheen) to give the film a rawer, more realistic edge, Girlfight takes many risks and pulls them off brillantly. The film is so captivating that you find yourself rewinding certain moments over and over to keep those feelings within your heart. You become attached to the characters of the film and you begin to care about their tribulations. Almost all of the elements of Girlfight work, from the style in which Kusama shoots the fast-paced boxing scenes to the subliminal marker-written messages situated throughout the film. The only drawbacks of the film is the angle Kusama chooses to take in beginning her story, she doesn't give to much detail into Diana's past life, only a few brief allusions mentioned during the scenes at the dinner table. With that aside, Girlfight maintains its grit, furvor, and raw intimacy with intensely effective results. This is a must see film for all of those who've ever felt misunderstood or have had to rise above and beyond the call of duty. One of the best films of 2000.

Played brilliantly by the newcomer Michelle Rodriguez, the role calls for a brooding hostile intensity as well as a deep sensitivity.  Diana has to be strong, both physically mentally in order to battle the stereotypes in her macho Latino culture.  And Michelle Rodriguez doesn't just have power in her biceps; she has power in her eyes. One of her narrow-eyed scowls says more than pages of dialog.  During the film she learns to focus her rage into her boxing, and the joy of her growing control is apparent by the delight on her face.  She also falls in love with a young male boxer, Adrian, played by Santiago Douglas, and their relationship has its ups and downs.  Eventually, they have to fight each other in the ring.
The whole cast is excellent -- Jaime Tirelli as her trainer, Ray Santiago as her little brother, Elisa Bocanegra as her girlfriend, and Paul Calderon as her brutal father.  And, in a small cameo performance, the famous director, John Sayles, is cast as a boring science teacher.  Later, I discovered that the brilliant 32-year old writer and director of this film, Karyn Kusama, went through some training of her own.

With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her.  And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.  Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons.  When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money.  Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.  It's an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better.  And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in ""gender blind"" competitions, does not faze her in the least.  Diana has found her element.
 First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere.  And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, ""I was a fighter once.  I lost.""  Then, looking around the busy gym, ""Like most of these guys, they're going to lose, too.  But it's all they know--""  And it's that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is.  It's a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.
 Making her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves.  She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?  Whatever it is, it works.  It's a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation.  She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.
 As positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there's no indication of where she's headed.  Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?  After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it's arms to women.  And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate.
 The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira).  Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of ""Girlfight,"" that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring.  That aside, it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience.",988070400,,4736,4.649459783913565

1273080,3,B00003CXNX,"I had seen some very good reviews for Girlfight.  I had also thought I had seen some stuff saying it was a female version of Rocky.  Well it is not exciting like Rocky was but it was well acted.
Girlfight was not a very exciting movie.  The fights were not that good and there were not many of them.  However all the people in the film did a really great job.  The film had some great acting.
However the film was a bit too slow for me.
Also, I feel the film which is set in Brooklyn lacked a NY feel.  I recently saw Finding Forrester, which really captured the Bronx.  Woody Allen always captures NY.  This film, though set in Brooklyn, to me did not feel NY.
I do not recommend buying the DVD.  The film will be watched once and I really do not think watched again.  Also the extra making of footage was really just a 5 minute commercial.  There are no real cool extras on the disk.  Michelle Rodriguez the star, was really really good and I hope goes far in movies.
This is a good DVD to rent once and watch, it is not one I recommend owning and watching more than once.",987379200,3,1074,4.110576923076923
1273081,4,B00003CXNX,"Written and directed by Karyn Kusama, a former assistant of John Sayles, GIRLFIGHT is a film for you if you're interested in independent american movies. Michelle - Diana - Rodriguez is boxing the screen in this role which seems have been written specially for her.
While most of the male boxers of Hector's boxing school consider this sport as a way to make money in order to leave their poor neighborhood, Diana is boxing because she has too much aggressivity in her. The school authorities want her to see a psychiatrist but what's the use with a girl who doesn't want to be helped. So boxing will replace the doc at a lower cost and allow Diana to face her father for a cathartic final confrontation.
Karyn Kusama is without any doubt very talented and knows how to make you feel the rage of the boxers during a fight. Michelle Rodriguez is outstanding, giving a stellar performance that our young starlets should study again and again in order to understand what is cinema really about. A movie highly recommended.

1273082,5,B00003CXNX,"Yes, he started out viewing this movie thinking it was going to be really dumb but quickly changed his mind.  There is just something uplifting about seeing a young woman, who is in a rough neighborhood with rough relatives and rough peers, handle it all by learning literally how to be the best fighter she can possibly be. She trains to be a professional boxer.  She even gets to box her boyfriend in the ring, who also wants to go pro. We were both laughing during this part because actually it probably would be a tremendous help to marriage and relationships to pick someone you could literally go into the ring against and beat the hell out of them (professionally speaking, of course).  This sure would be one marriage or relationship where abuse of one party would have a hard time arising! This shared the jury award at Sundance and also won its (female) director and the drama itself awards. We also liked the real way this girl was allowed to look without turning her into some unbelievable starlet type.
