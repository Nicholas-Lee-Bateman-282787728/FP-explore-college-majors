2520762,5,B000EHSVVE,"Let me start by saying if you enjoy films such as ""The Wild Geese"", ""The Hill""(hopefully, it too will be on dvd someday),""Too Late the Hero"" or perhaps ""Breaker Morant"" you will LOVE this film! I know the films I mentioned are depicting warfare in different eras, but they star great british/european actors such as Sean Connery, Michael Cain, Ian Bannen, Edward Woodward etc.. This stars the great Richard Attenborough as the senior sergeant in charge of a group of british non-comms who are trying to maintain order in their compound after control of the country has been turned over to the native government (set in a british colony in africa). The weapons are proper for the time period...sterling smg's and FN-FALS (brit L1A1). Great drama full of wonderfully stuffy british military etiquette! About time it has been brought out on dvd, it has become almost impossible to find on vhs and they don't show it on television much anymore. Truly outstanding!",1143072000,49,959,4.925925925925926

And, get this, it was screened as the *second film* on a double bill. The first film on the bill was (...gotta love this...) an Annette Funicello thing called ""Pajama Party.""

Most of the teens exited the theater when the Annette movie ended. Too bad for them.

Seeing this terrific Richard Attenborough film at that age wet my appetite for trully great acting and quality films. And it firmly set me looking for more.",1142208000,20,527,4.536842105263158

2520843,5,B000EHSVVE,"I just finally discovered this old classic and I was VERY impressed! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in Africa in the beginning of 60s, in a former British colony which recently became independent, a regiment of British army is still stationed - although it is now mostly composed of African soldiers and includes many African officers, who are trained to transform it into the elite unit of local national armed forces. Colonel Dean (Jack Hawkins), until now in charge of the regiment, just received the order to transfer the command to senior African officer, Captain Abraham (Earl Cameron), a very competent and distinguished man.

The colonel obeys willingly and then departs because of an important appointment in the capital. Before leaving, he orders Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) Laudersdale (Richard Attenborough) to watch other things and especially welcome an importnat guest. Indeed, the same day a female MP, Ms  Barker-Wise, a very left-winged person, comes to visit the regiment and especially her old acquaintance and a kind of protg, Lieutenant Boniface (Errol John), the second most senior African officer of the regiment.

But what Deal, Laudersdale and Abraham all ignore is that a coup-d'etat just began in the capital - and the rebels have many partisans also in the regiment... And then the film really begins.

This is not exactly a war movie, but rather a study of characters of people who are involved in a crisis, a dramatic stand-off and also a duel of wills between all the protagonists. The central character of the film is that of RSM Laudersdale, who in absence of any other authority must take matters in his own hands - which are in fact very, very strong and able indeed... Richard Attenborough (who was not yet Sir Richard at this time) played this character to the perfection! I must say that he is one of the most impressive Sergeants I ever saw on the screen (together with Colour Segeant Frank Bourne from ""Zulu"" and RSM Sandy Young from ""Wild Geese""), a man of total authority and in fact quite SCARY, even if (unlike NCOs in real life, I assume) he never uses obscenities to communicate.

In fact this film actually IS about RSM Laudersdale, a man who clearly joined the army because of sheer love of this kind of life and who then cultivated and developped the art of Regimental Master Sergeantry until he reached perfection. This man has an answer to everything, a solution to every problem and a procedure for every situation, he never misses any details, suffers no fools and makes no compromises when matters of honor and duty are concerned - and all of that forces some respect, even from people who usually really don't care for military discipilne... He also always obeys orders of his superiors - even when those orders are so hateful that he wants to scream. The one scene in which his heart is broken so badly that he lapses in one and only one moment of rebellion in his long life of exemplary service is one of the greatest treasures of this film...

There are of course other important characters, like the courageous Colonel Deal, noble Captain Abraham, Colour Sergeant Ben Parkin, four other Sergeants (""Dodger"", ""Muscles"", ""Schoolie"" and ""Aussie"")  as well as a slightly clueless (and completely lost) Private named Wilkes, whose engagement ends in one week...))) Ms Barker-Wise (Flora Robson) is another important character - she is co incredibly STUPID, cut from reality and living in her own world that clearly ""progressive"" politics were the only field in which she could succeed...))) One must actually admire the olympic calm of RSM Lauderdale, whom she constantly insults and humiliates in the most outrageous way, simply because he is different from her and refuses to consider himself inferior and apologise for his difference...

Young Mia Farrow (she was 19) appears here in her very first role - she is so young that she still had some hair on her head...)))  Her character is not very important, but together with Private Wilkes, who totally hits on her, provides some comic relief.

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT FILM, with an INCREDIBLE performance by Richard Attenborough, who cleraly is able to play anybody and anything, from Queen of England to a bowl of fruit salad...))) I am so keeping the DVD for a future viewing. Enjoy!",1402876800,,4347,4.916780354706685

2520847,4,B000EHSVVE,"My understanding is that Richard Attenborough, before taking on the roll as Seargent Major, attended Sandhurst Military College UK to get a real ""feel"" for the chatacter he was about to play, and he played his character to the hilt.  Anybody thinking about joining the armed forces should view this movie. Anybody wishing to see some absolutely superb acting should see this move.

2520848,5,B000EHSVVE,"Set in a former British colony, the story begins at a barracks in Batasi, the home of the 3rd Battalion of the Africa Rifles.

Sergeant-Major Lauderdale, a tough old man with military experience collected all over the world, winds up being in command when the colonel is called away to the capital. The movie looks at the struggle between the NCOs and their recent charges as politics threatens to pull apart the regiment.

This movie is done extremely well, with humor, drama and thoughtful insight. The sergeant-major has to protect not just his soldiers but also a liberal MP who happens to be on a fact-finding mission in the country and the loyalist African captain who was badly wounded when the coup was initiated.

2520849,5,B000EHSVVE,"Not a grotesque and violent type of war film, Sir Richard Attenborough nails it as the tough-but-fair British Army Regimental Sergeant Major. How he got it so right is beyond me. Set in 1960's Africa, a mostly African (infantry or artillery) unit commanded and mostly staffed by British regular-Army career chaps; has its loyalties split by sudden political unrest. Inspired in part by the mouthy left-wing members of the UK parliament, one of whom has to seek shelter from in the apolitical Sergeant's Mess, summary justice is sought for ""crimes against the new government"" by an African former junior officer. Doing their duty to protect their charges from disproportionate action, a tight stand-off follows.

However This was defiantly a B movie shot with a low budget and some pretty unconvincing stage sets.

2520855,5,B000EHSVVE,"For those with (a) a love of Africa (this is my tenth year of living, now in my third African country) and (b) the enriching experience of the British army (my teenage years), this is a film to watch, often. Why? Two reasons I suppose. First is the riveting performance of Richard Attenborough as the regimental sergeant major (RSM). He captured the very essence of discipline, ""spit-and-polish"" and the inflexible tradition that saved his comrades and guests, trapped in the sergeants' mess, from being captured by the perpetrators of a political coup. His performance was 'so true to life' because my own squadron sergeant major (SSM), way back when the British were being kicked out of Aden, was exactly the same; lots of ""bull"" but lots of care as well! Secondly, it captured the 'down-side' of those solid characteristics; an inability to understand the political nuances in such a process. The performances from a stalwart British (and at least, one Australian) cast were excellent. High Noon has been described as ""a Swiss watch of a movie"". For me, this garners the same accolade. The end of the film is perfection.",1287446400,3,1123,4.91578947368421
2520856,2,B000EHSVVE,"The title of the film, as well as the photo on the DVD cover, make one assume that this is an action film; however, it really isn't. Richard Attenborough and the African officer act rather well, but overall I find this film rather tedious and boring. Also, I couldn't figure out the significance of Mia Farrow's presence. The enhanced black-and-white 2.35:1 picture is very good.",1275609600,,379,4.846153846153846
2520857,4,B000EHSVVE,"One of few 'fun' movies regarding the military. It is set in a specific time period that many young persons may not grasp. It was the end of the old colonial period where a fading empire still had some stature and influence. Attenborough rightly deserves great credit for his charactarization of a British RSM. The supporting cast did a great job too. The special features has commentary by John Leyton which is worth listening to for the background.

Not very well remembered but nonetheless a worthy film, Guns at Batasi looks at decolonization in Africa from both sides of the story; interesting and thought-provoking, with a nice turn by Richard Attenborough, it's worth a watch if you like British films or history.",1233446400,,286,5.085106382978723
2520879,5,B000EHSVVE,"I have watched this film multiple times over the years. It is a great piece of miltaria, and a fine example of Sir Richard's tremendous range as an actor of the old school. The details of a mixed BA/native contingent Battalion in the last days of the Empire are spot on. The frustration of a proper RSM doing his duty in the manner that has served his sovereign and country well for decades only to be stimied by politics can be appreciated by current and former NCOs of all nations. I simply adore this movie.",1205971200,6,510,4.378947368421053
2520880,5,B000EHSVVE,"This film is one of those ""quiet"" pieces of work that didn't make much of a splash when it came out, yet more than 40 years on, remains a compelling and absorbing production. Attenborough gives an inspired performance as Regimental Sergeant Major Lauderdale, a consummate professional soldier who collides head-on with political expediency. Attenborough's Lauderdale is utterly convincing-- a soldier who is unbendingly loyal to centuries of military tradition, experienced and effective in combat, and fiercely protective of those underneath his command. He also has a wry sense of humour. He is faced with what is essentially a mutiny, and an officer wounded by the mutineers takes refuge in the Sergeants' Mess. Lauderdale defies the threats of the mutineers, and destroys the guns they have trained on the mess... only to find that a change in government means they weren't actually mutineers after all...

This is a great film that will not fail to move you-- as well as make you laugh.",1192838400,9,991,5.117283950617284
2520881,5,B000EHSVVE,"Guns at Batasi is a great movie. Not only does it tell a story about the old British Commonwealth countries obtaining home rule and going through the typical violent political changes most of these nations experienced then and some are still experiencing today, but it showed accurately the life of a British Empire soldier and his professionalism.
Flora Robson played the typical do-gooder middle class socialist MP - a breed that exists even today.
The rest of the cast did an excellent job and the movie moved at a goodly pace right up to the (almost) predictable end.
Excellent entertainment and for anyone who has served in the army, a realistic and somewhat nostalgic reminder of a time when things were more black and white.",1185148800,9,731,4.856

2520886,4,B000EHSVVE,"+++SPOILERS+++

Let me preface that I am a huge militaria buff, history books, TV shows and especially movies, if they are British they are even better (even though I'm American, go figure). I also live and travel in parts that were once part of the British Empire and let me tell you, there remains a little of that colonial sense to these places concerning whites and the natives at least thats the way I feel about it. in the I bought this DVD from Amazon for pretty cheap, not really knowing what to expect. Well I was expecting a tense escape from the heart of Africa of the last of the white Brits to be honest, kind of like a Wild Geese escape. Did it turn out that way, not at all. That's the best part of not reading a web site like Amazon's partner, IMDb before you see a movie, it won't spoil the movie for you! So what do I think this movie is? I think it's the last of the line in many ways. While probably not the absolute last one made, this is a pro military guys movie. While probably not the absolute last one made, it's also a black and white film from a large studio in the 60's. God, I'm listening to John Leyton's commentary on the DVD as I write and he just said (again) ""I don't mean to remind you, this film was all shot on a stage"", now that was really cool to hear it at 30 seconds into it (I kid you not that was his first point) but this is minute 45 and he has told us over ten separate times how this was all made on an indoor stage, hurrah already! That gets old really fast after the 5th time, lol. John Leyton also has glowing comments about everyone here EXCEPT, you guessed it, the black actors, unbelievably shallow and so obvious a mistake. OK now I probably sound like a liberal who bashes others, on the contrary I'm not. But even though the black actors will not go near the heights that Lord Attenborough will, he could have at least acknowledged Errol John who plays the mutinous officer and has a lot of face time, Leyton didn't once say his name or anything about him. Errol John would also play a mutinous African officer in an episode of Dangerman made around the same time, he plays an effective nemesis in my opinion. OK my pluses of the film, Attenborough's RSM in a verbal debate with the liberal MP (she fits the part too, doesn't she?), pretty much summing up England's future with the conservative pro empire voice ceding to the guilt trip liberal voice that trusts everyone except those defending their own countries interest's. Mia Farrow, for Mia Farrow fans , this was her first film role, she's very hot. In the commentary Leyton said a lot of their footage was cut out. Why was it cut? Well you have Attenborough in this great dramatic performance and in the context of a small group of whites in a revolutionary African nation where anything could happen. And than you have a light hearted Mia Farrow/Leyton young 20's fling and everyone else not really showing any tension that they really could be in a serious predicament. I'm glad they trimmed their bits down or this film would have been horrible. So, in summary, good time piece film. Its a guys feel good movie (white guys), not to be taken too seriously, with a great performance by Attenborough. In war movies from then on the action would get heavier, and there would be much more moral consequences to be introduced. Also, if your looking for a British black and white military drama made close to the same time, I recommend ""The Hill"". My Amazon rating for Guns Of Batasi 4/5.",1165968000,5,3499,4.383076923076923
2520887,5,B000EHSVVE,"This excellent film is a rediscovered jem.  Attenborough is first rate as the stiff upper-lipped RSM.  He was your typical British senior warrent officer who basically held the battalion together.  An empire was built by such men and their spit and polish manner.  The movie concerns itself with a post-colonial African nation, under-going the usual tumult for that time and place.  The RSM and the Sarjeant's Mess of the 2nd Royal African Rifles get mixed up in a political coup d'etat.  There is some fine acting by Richard Attenborough who really personifies the British RSM type for that day.  This is not a war firm per se.  The overtones are military for sure, but the story really concerns itself with clashing personalities. In this respect it resembles some other very good British films of the period that probe post war feelings and attitudes in the arm.  TUNES OF GLORY comes to mind as another fine example of this genre of British film.

 There is some racial tension between the RSM and the arrogant Black Captain of the battalion who seeks to take political charge and remove a wounded rival in the process.  The RSM rightfully puts him in his place, and while we may find this sort of behavior hard to understand today, RSM Lauderdale is really the kind of guy you want to have in a crisis.  Frustrated perhaps by missing out in WW2, and molded from years of strict military etiquette into something of a martinet, one has to see RSM Lauderdale in the light of both sympathy and admiration.  Attenborough manages to convey both of these elements in his wonderful portrayal of this personality.

In the end the political crisis passes, but the RSM is sacreficed to political expedincy.  You might say this marks the beginning of Political Correctness in that stern characters like Lauderdale are sacreficed for racial politics.  A fine story and a touching portrait of a kind of soldier we are not likely to see anymore. What a pity too! Well worth many viewings.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

After BUYING and PAYING for this DVD set I discovered that..

When the DVD first starts to play you watch video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie. The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music.

This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.

The movie itself, I liked very much, (5-stars).  It reminds me a little of the old engineering adage; ""Punish the innocent, and promote nonparticipants"". Here we have a commanding officer doing his duty and protecting his men. Nonetheless, his decisions were in conflict with the new political winds. Regrettably, similar things happen in the US military even today. Top men in our military are often faced with a choice of doing nothing and keeping their rank and retirement intact, or speak the truth, and face removal.

Wait for the DVD to be fixed before purchasing.",1451779200,,1257,4.76036866359447
8110215,1,B000EHSVVE,Didn't work - it won't playback - claiming 'wrong region code' - can this be fixed? Very disappointed as the 3 DVD's that don't play are the 3 main & favourite one's I wanted most! - including 'The Anderson Tapes' and 'Lion of the Desert' below - upsetting. It can't be an issue with my player as the other DVD's in the order DID work/play ok!,1441670400,,343,4.212121212121212
