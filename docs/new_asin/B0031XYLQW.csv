8387300,3,B0031XYLQW,"Rocky Jones, Space Ranger survives today because it's one of the few shows from the Golden Age of TV that was shot on film (not recorded on video). The existing prints, however, are fuzzy and washed out, the image shakes but the sound is pretty good. They are watchable, but that's about it. So Alpha Video's transfer is about as good as we're likely to get. But the price -- for 4 episodes -- is not really a bargain.  Mill Creek offers a 12-disc boxed set that contains all 23 episodes: Classic Sci-Fi TV-150 Episodes at http://amzn.com/B001LQQJ66 and it's only a couple bucks more than the Volume 1 listed here. Plus you get Captain Fathom (3 episodes), Captain Z-Ro (24 episodes), Flash Gordon (14 episodes), Lights Out! (4 episodes), One Step Beyond (18 episodes) and lots of other rare goodies. (The set also contains 3 movie serials, including Radar Men from the Moon).

Rocky Jones is a piece of TV history. It was ambitious for its time, with special effects better than many of 1950s science fiction B-movies. In fact, the producers retired the popular show because it was too expensive to make! The show still entertains, with brisk story-telling and adequate performances from the actors. But I think it's best viewed as a piece of pop-culture history. It's the first (I believe) depiction of a united planets organization patrolling the cosmos (a la Star Trek). Uniforms with insignia, ray guns, and a girl in a miniskirt, all predate Star Trek -- but these actually were all elements of pulp SF adventures by writers such as E. E. ""Doc"" Smith and, later, Robert Heinlein. As a matter of fact, watching Rocky Jones is like seeing the pulps come to life.",1464048000,,1666,4.741379310344827
8387301,5,B0031XYLQW,"If your into classic sf shows from the 1950s this was I feel the best of them. Good story lines with very good special effects for the time.  Love the space ship style they had, and the woman ranger as part of the team you can say introduced the 1st mini-skirt style. Very good program other dvds are available. This dvd has 4 epos. of which 3 of them are 3 part continuation epos. For the price try it you may like it.",1431475200,,419,4.048192771084337
