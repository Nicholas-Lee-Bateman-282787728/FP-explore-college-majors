4911484,1,B005ZV54Z0,"I tried to view the streaming content, and either the streaming file is corrupt or there is just no audio for this video.  Either way it's not something you can watch without some kind of audio accompaniment.  If this is something that is a problem with the streaming file this might be a different story. However as it is, I can't recommend it to anyone, which is a shame because there is really a lack of educational multimedia material for kids featuring information about insects.",1355011200,,484,4.682352941176471
4911485,5,B005ZV54Z0,"I am so impressed with The Fascinating World of Insects! The colors/clarity of the insects are gorgeous, and the DVD content is presented in a highly organized and concrete format. The DVD gives tons of great information about a variety of insects, and in a very interesting and fun way! I am a teacher and I showed this DVD to my class, and my students absolutely loved it!! All of my students- even the couple of students who had said they did not like insects before I turned on the DVD- were completely absorbed by and fascinated with the DVD. :) They especially LOVED the review activities at the end of the DVD, and had a great time chanting their answers to the multiple choice review questions!!

After watching this DVD, my students enthusiastically requested to watch more of the DVDs in this series! I am looking forward to watching more of these DVDs too, and will definitely be making some more purchases from the BrainFood Learning series of DVDs!",1327708800,7,961,4.652941176470589
4911486,5,B005ZV54Z0,"A great insect DVD !!  I have most of the animal videos for kids on the market and this children's DVD is among the best I've seen.  I bought this insect video for my grandchildren (ages 2,4,6 and 9) to watch while they are visiting.  They all love it, even the one that doesn't like bugs!  The praying mantis and the butterfly sections are their favorites. The other BrainFood Learning videos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fascinating-World-of-Birds/dp/B0088L7D9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fascinating World of Birds</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fascinating-World-of-Mammals/dp/B0070U9CSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fascinating World of Mammals</a>&nbsp;are excellent!!!

This wonderful kids DVD has great closeup videos of insects moving around in their natural environment.  The video content is educational and well done by DISPLAYING and DEFINING words about the insects.  I highly recommend this insect video to parents, grandparents and teachers.  It is a great teaching tool.",1322524800,7,1320,7.986301369863014

8489978,5,B005ZV54Z0,I have played this video over 10 times since i've purchased it. My grandkids and student's love it. It is easy to understand and comes with a ready made test. The kids get excited and know all the answers by the end of the video. I highly recommend this to anyone in and out of the classroom. I love it!!!!!!,1363824000,3,308,4.15
8489979,5,B005ZV54Z0,"I gave this 5 stars because this is a great tool to use for science.  My first grade class did a science unit on insects and this DVD was a great informational resource that reinforced the concepts and characteristics of insects.  I highly recommend this to use in the classroom!  Even though it has some higher vocabulary in it, it just introduces them to the word and moves on.  Great for all levels of students and really holds their interest, we have about 50 first graders in my room for science and they all stay focused and love these videos!",1360713600,3,549,4.46
8489980,5,B005ZV54Z0,"My 4 year old son has his learning phases, a few months ago, it was planets.  This month we are into insects! We have lots of rubber and plastic bugs to play with for creative interaction, a few reference books to read, flash cards for quick visual reference, the 2003 movie BUGS! (narrated by Judi Dench)and now this video. This particular video is an excellent detailed video explaining the many different types of insects and it's quality is comparible to National Geo kids or Discovery kids. It thoroughly explains the anatomy of an insect and literally displays a visual disection of each insect.  My 4 year old is a bit too young to truly understand some of the language terms but visually he is very interested.  Specific example, during the lady bug segment, you might think a lady bug to be only red and black in color, however, in the video they show 4 different colors a lady bug could be: red, yellow, orange and even blue!  This type of information is fascinating to him. A blue lady bug, really?!  I would recommend this video for elementary or middle school aged children that are interested in insects or for a student that might be doing an insect project.",1356307200,,1173,4.6201923076923075
