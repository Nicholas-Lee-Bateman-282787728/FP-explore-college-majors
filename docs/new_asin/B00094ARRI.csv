2262032,5,B00094ARRI,"This is still a funny flick for those with a sense of humor. I had an old, second-hand VHS tape of Party Animal and when those went by the wayside, I made a DVD copy but it wasn't great quality. This DVD is very good quality and the price is right. The movie is not highly rated on IMDB but 8 out of 10 friends who see it are laughing all the way through.",1386028800,,355,3.810810810810811

2262034,5,B00094ARRI,"I first saw this movie in the mid 1980's.  I went into watching this movie with a blind eye.  I never laughed so hard in my life, sure there was plenty of T&A but the movie truly had substance.  If you ever need a good laugh this movie keeps you laughing.  From the scene of going to the black fraternity party, the sex shop, the sorority house, and who will forget the flatulence scene in the car.  I bust a gut everytime I watch this timeless classic.  Some writers of today's comedies need to take note this is truly some funny stuff.  I will watch this again and again and always laugh and never get tired of it.",1374105600,,616,4.169491525423729

It now has a cult following of some sort. I love it an recommend it if you like this type of movie. It may fall in the American Pie catagory.,1359417600,,282,3.9649122807017543

2262039,2,B00094ARRI,"I remember this film from my youth.....I just don't remember it being this bad.
Good thing there is a decent two man male stripper scene which runs for several minutes near the front of this very sophomoric film.

2262110,2,B00094ARRI,"Party Animal is a truly horrible movie despite a few scenes that make it ""watchable"" (and I use that term lightly). If not for the awesome soundtrack, the role by Jerry Jones, several nude scenes, and creepy/hilarious homo-erotic tendencies, I'd declare this movie unfit for anyone. Watch at your own risk unless you're into this type of movie, but at the cheap price it's not like you'll break the bank.",1335312000,,404,4.785714285714286

2262118,4,B00094ARRI,"This movie starts off dumb enough....and though there are many idiotic moments, the females in this movie make up for it. Literally a guy film in most every way.

Who hasn't had those times where they can't seem to do anything right when it comes to the opposite sex?  This is a VERY tongue in cheek look at our boy Pondo 'Hound Dog' Sinatra, a college student who just wants a piece.  Gotta love it!!",1168732800,,367,4.5
2262201,4,B00094ARRI,"I first rented this video back in 87 or so and it became an instant classic with my friends and I.  It is a typical guy movie with plenty of T&A, flatulence, and crude jokes to keep a guy entertained.

Rather then recap the entire story, I will highlight some of my favorite parts.

The strip poke game with Pondo was a classic.

The best guy scene in not only this movie but in all of these type of typical guy movies is with the beautiful Italian girl the the problems she experiences on her date with Pondo.  His reaction is priceless.

I rented this movie so many times when friends stayed over that we knew the movie line by line.  When the video store closed, it was lost forever (or so I thought).  Thanks to Amazon, I now have a DVD copy which I'm sure will be a hit whenever my 40 something buddies are over and having a few drinks.",1156464000,6,841,4.148148148148148

2262203,5,B00094ARRI,"i was delighted to see that this film has finally made it to DVD. in the crowded market for teen comedies, this little known gem stands head and shoulders above all others. forget things like American Pie and the sequels, this gets the ""close to the bone"" jokes right every time.

the plot? every teenage boys' dream : the quest to be come irresistable to women. does it succeed? oh yes!!

it has always amazed me that one hardly ever hears of anything that the cast and creators of this film did afterwards. there was certainly a high level of talent and ability on this film, a shame that there was no more from them.

if this being one of the funniest films of all time was not enough, then just wait until you hear the awesome, classic soundtrack - it captures the 80's feel in a way that not even my beloved Grosse Pointe Blank could!",1142380800,5,839,4.3312101910828025
2262204,5,B00094ARRI,"This is one of those films that is obviously bad (even the star, Matthew Causey, still hates to be identified with it.) but I love it anyway.  Maybe because I saw it during my own lusty teen years i still have some nostalgia for it, but it still makes me laugh every single time I watch it.  You've gotta love it for the soundtrack if nothing else, REM, the Buzzcocks, The Fleshtones, Dream 6...damn shame a soundtrack was never released.",1138579200,6,438,4.4625

This movie is purely an immature escape. There is nothing wrong with that and I can see there are a few people out there that could really use it.

Very funny movie with an outstanding sound track!",1138320000,2,362,4.171428571428572
2262206,4,B00094ARRI,"This is a fun, cheesy, 80's flick, that you'll either love or hate. I love it and was so happy to see that it was available through Amazon!! So thank you sooo much! This is a movie my brother and I used to watch when we were younger, so to watch it again was so great. And it has such a great soundtrack. If you love 80's music, you'll enjoy it as well.

C'mon!!! It was hilarious and totally fun to watch for a group of inexperienced teens who thought we were studs in the rough..haha  Watch it,enjoy it,live alittle and see it for what it is,silly fun...

2262209,2,B00094ARRI,"This movie is a must see for any guy who had women problems growing up.  Though extreme, the movie shows the lengths a guy will go to pick up some chicks.  I saw this movie in high school at the theater, and thought it was one of the funniest films I saw in an endless line of similar plots, topless women, and low budget films residing in the where are they now file.  This film is just funny.  I have several friends that I see about once every 3 years who still quote it.  This film should have been lifted into cult status, but I don't think enough people have seen it, one thing is sure, if you find a guy who did see it, they will remember it fondly.

Not a good film to watch with a female, or your children.  Not really all that bad, but I have figured out that most middle aged women do not want to view topless women from the 80's.",1133222400,,841,4.0
2262240,4,B00094ARRI,"Granted, this is not classic film making; it is low budget and looks it.  I saw this film while in high school years ago, and loved it.  Then it fell off the radar.  I always checked to see if it was available, but could never find it.  Suddenly, there it is on dvd.  I bought to show friends who had never heard of it, and we got together and laughed our heads off.  If you like silly comedy and don't mind a bare breast or two, you will like this film.",1130198400,,454,3.934065934065934
2262241,5,B00094ARRI,"Ummmm about the movie, I thought it was insightful and covered everything that there is to say about a guy piclking up girls.  I thin kthat any movie with enough audacity to make fart jokes with the themed soundtrack is great.  We love the Buzzcocks.  They were the illest ever.  This is a must-see for any hard core punk rock fan.  Surlychad rocks the house.  Yosank at aol is looking to discuss further with him the pretense of any such party movie.  Especially when Jason concerned.

Pondo Sinatra is a renaissance man; choosing as his pallette the colorful world of teenaged masculinity.",1128038400,,591,4.7254901960784315
2262242,5,B00094ARRI,"How do you explain Party Animal? I've been watching this film for damn close to 15 years now (I just turned 30)To be quite honest I'm shocked to see it on DVD (and extremely excited). This movie basically is about a confederate redneck who can't get any tail. He tries throughout the movie and no luck. Pondo (confederate redneck) finally comes across a ""love potion"" that actualy works and everything he touches turns to poontang. I'm not going to say to much, but if you enjoy B-movie cult classics as much as I do, check this movie out. Great 80's humor plus an outstanding soundtrack including The Buzzcocks greatest hits.",1125446400,2,626,4.7
2262243,3,B00094ARRI,"My how things have changed in the past 21 years. This ""B"" film actually had big studio backing. Pondo Sinatra is the southern (?) hick who literally falls of a truck with some turnips on it on his way to college. Getting the plot out of the way...Pondo tries to get laid, but messes it up every time, even with the help of popular big-man-on-campus Studly. The laughs are basically few and far between, but manages to get in some pretty clever slapstick and a slew of decent sight-gags. Lead man Matthew Causey dropped off the face of the earth after this dog of a movie, but alas, the film has its charm. There's enough T&A and low brow humor to keep the young males interested for the entire movie and photography is actually very good (hence the big studio effort). The film also takes comedic chances here and there with off the cuff comments to the camera (al la Ferris B's Day Off)and pieces together a menagerie of comic styles. My personal favorite bit is when Pondo ""becomes"" a pimp/type characture complete with fur and feathered pimp hat and quickley finds a party thrown by 70s stereotypical African-Americans (complete with the ""kill the white man"" song playing in the party background). Pondo enters the room talking jive like a street pimp (drops the n-word bomb) and moves in to woo a lovely brown babe only to finally realise that he's a stupid white guy surrounded by large black men just before getting his afro pick gouged into his forehead.....a pre-politically correct scene, but the ending is quiet correctly. The film's strongest point is a KILLER soundtrack featuring a handful of old-wave/punk acts such as a trio of Buzzcocks tunes to name but one of the now defunct bands here. One thing of note....REM's ""Radio Free Europe"" is given credit, but never shows up in the film! I saw this when I was 16 and loved it then...now it's a different story but I purchased it all the same because of the fond memories. What I would like to know is where is Matthew Causey nowdays?",1124150400,,1997,4.612359550561798
2262244,2,B00094ARRI,"The line of dialog I used for the title of my review was a sentiment held by many of the female characters towards the main male character, named Pondo Sinatra, in this film, The Party Animal (1984)...sadly, it was pretty much how I felt about the film after watching it last night, which was odd especially given the five star praise.  I don't know what happened...I thought perhaps maybe there was some sort of mix up in that the wrong movie got encoded, labeled, stuck into the DVD case, and sent to me under the pretense of being the film everybody seems to love (but me)...but that wasn't the case...perhaps I'm just an uppity, highbrow snob with no sense of humor, but I've never thought of myself as such...I've enjoyed such juvenilely puerile comedies like Porky's (1982), which, by the way, radio personality Howard Stern is remaking for a 2006 release, Bachelor Party (1984), and The Hollywood Knights (1980)...heck, I even liked the movie Up the Academy (1980), which was so reviled that Mad Magazine, who initially conceived the idea after National Lampoon's success with their film Animal House (1978), actually disowned it, shortly after one of the stars, Ron Lieberman, sued to have his name removed from the credits...anyway, back to The Party Animal...written and directed by David Beaird (My Chauffeur), the film stars Matthew Causey, in his only screen credit to date (big surprise), coming off much like a really unfunny version of Larry, The Cable Guy.  Also appearing is Timothy Carhart (Thelma & Louise), who many may recognize as the main bad guy Ellis De Wald from the 1994 Eddie Murphy movie Beverly Hills Cop III, and Jerry Jones, who's other credits include a number of the Dolemite films, among other things.

As the film begins we see the main character, Pondo Sinatra (Causey), arriving at college on the back of a turnip truck (literally), looking rather old to be a college freshman...oh wait, there's one older looking than he as we're introduced to Studley (Carhart), fellow student, campus Lothario, and soon to be Pondo's best friend (actor Carhart  was about 31 at the time this film was made, which really helps perpetrate a college-like atmosphere) ...you know, the actors in the movie Animal House may not have all been the `correct' age for their parts, but at least they looked it...anyway, turns out Pondo's never enjoy the intimate company of a woman, and it's pretty obvious why...he's not very appealing (he's got a serious case of the receding hairline, which he combats by growing his hair long and combing it forward...that's a good look) and has all the personality of a fireplug frequented by many, soon to be relieved dogs.  Anyway, Studley becomes Pondo's mentor of sorts, as this lecherous hillbilly is in desperate need to dip his wick.  Studley's first suggestion being Pondo learn the art of seduction...which leads him to a male strip bar, where we get to see a bunch of oily men in thongs dancing on a stage...let me tell you, it's generally not a good sign for a film like this when I see more male flesh than female flesh so early on...after this Pondo tries any number of things, even attempting to sell his soul for some `tang, but success finally comes in the form of an accidental mixing of chemicals which create an aphrodisiac that women find irresistible...now Pondo's got all the action he can handle, for better or worse...

Was this a comedy?  Or a cinematic ploy by the makers of the film to get to see women topless (of which we do, a lot)?  I'm opting for the latter because the comedy aspects were patently unfunny, perhaps the unfunniest I've seen in a long time, and that's saying a lot, especially since I bore witness to the Chevy Chase/Dan Aykroyd/Demi Moore festival of pain titled Nothing But Trouble (1991).  Not only that, but the movie was also kind of embarrassing, especially the sequences after Studley, deciding Pondo needs more help that he can give, hooks him up with the man who taught him everything he knows about women in that of the African American school janitor named Elbow (Jones).  The embarrassing part comes after Pondo and Elbow's meeting, when Pondo, dressed like a pimp, attends an all African American party, shuckin' and jivin' about, and just acting the fool...I thought the C. Thomas Howell movie Soul Man (1986), was cinematic low point with regards to racial relations, but this sequence beats that entire movie hands down.  It's not so much I thought it was inappropriate, but just that it wasn't funny...and really, really dumb.  Here's another highlight in the film...Pondo sneaks into a sorority house dressed like a really ugly woman and convinces the already half nekkid women (who were stretching and exercising in their lingerie) to play hi/low strip poker...of course the girls end up losing, and we get a very decent boobage sequence, but eventually the jig is up when Pondo can't keep his boner from popping through his disguise...oh man, my sides are splitting for all the laughter.  The plot basically consists of a series of sequences where Pondo tries a number of half-witted tactics to score, most all of them failing due to his own ineptitude, that is until he accidentally comes across a secret formula that causes women to literally tear their clothes off and attack him.  There was an seemingly unrelated element in that of the continually appearance of a beautiful woman, who I think is meant to represent evil incarnate, in relation to Pondo's claim that he would sell his soul for tail, but the connection is never clarified or elaborated on to the point where it figured into the story in a meaningful manner.  I'm giving this film two stars, one for the excellent soundtrack featuring such bands as R.E.M., The Buzzcocks, Concrete Blonde, The Untouchables, and others, and another star for the skin...other than that, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this movie for much else...as I write this, I see only one other on Amazon to rate this as low as I did, and that person certainly suffered an onslaught of negative votes, so I expect I will see much of the same...perhaps this is one of those films best viewed under the influence...

MGM presents both the widescreen (1.85:1) and fullscreen, pan and scan formats, and both look clean and clear.  The audio comes through well in Dolby Digital 2,0 audio.  There really aren't any special features, except for a theatrical trailer.

Cookieman108

If you're looking for a really funny comedy, I'd suggest one that was recently released on DVD called Moving Violations (1985)...I'd also suggest Hollywood Knights (1980), and Used Cars (1980), all three under-rated films of the 80s, in my opinion.",1121990400,6,6682,4.859278803869833
2262245,5,B00094ARRI,"The movie is complete with original music and a trailer is thrown in as well. Nothing special about the interface, just a still image like the case cover with navigation to the movie, scene selection and the trailer.

The disk is the old two sided flip flop type with standard 4:3 on one side and 16:9 on the other. The widescreen is simply the standard frame expanded and cropped. This will look nice on widescreen TVs but you will watch the standard side to get the original effect. The picture and sound are great especially compared to my Lightning Video VHS release from 1985.

Maybe someday they will release a soundtrack. After searching for a year I am still missing a couple of the songs.",1121644800,,697,4.568

My college roommates and I ended up renting the VHS of this movie about 2-3 times a month for over two years. The guy who ran the VHS rental store thought we were crazy! This is a total cult classic! You can watch this one over and over again. It is very stupid....but very intelligent. It belongs in your DVD collection as one of those 'special' movies to pull out at certain times. Now...it is finally out on DVD!",1119139200,2,502,4.239583333333333
2262247,5,B00094ARRI,"Like many others that have seen this movie, my friends and I passed up the black and white VHS box many, many times.  About 15 years ago, we decided that we just had to rent this and see what in the hell it was.  We were not disappointed by any means. What we ended up watching was one of the most cheaply made, poorly lit, ridiculously silly and implausible movies we had ever seen.  We also ended up making about 10 copies so we could all have our own.  It is difficult to tell anyone how funny this movie is.  You just have to see it for yourself.  Trust me though, you will not be disappointed.  Watch for the farting scene, the drug scene, the raggae party scene, and the black and white sex toy scene.  This movie is basically an excuse to film several set pieces surrounded by blatant scenes of nudity.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot the sorority scene where Pondo dresses like a girl and plays strip poker.  Outrageous!!  I have attempted to find out what happened to Matthew Causey (Pondo Sinatra)but have not had much luck.  From what I can tell, he is now a college professor in Georgia or Alabama.  I have heard that he gets very upset when anyone asks him about the movie, but he shouldn't.  He should relish what should be his place in cult cinema right up there with Bruce Campbell.  Sure, he only did this one movie and this one character, but what a movie and what a character.  As Pondo would say ""I am a pilgrim"" or ""A lesbian?!!""  Lastly, you will find out what the question is that has plagued man since the beginning of time, the answer to which is ""'Cause that ol' hound-dog wanna' eat it up.  You got ta be the hound do!!!""

2262248,2,B00094ARRI,"If you like the Porky's series and other 1980s films where male main characters struggle and succeed at losing their virginity, then you will like this.  It is a bit of ""the nerd finally gets his.""  Still, it has predictable jokes.  It's really just for people who want to see a lot of female nudity.  There is a token black guru in the film.  He does say a phrase that may stay with you for a while.  Near the end there is a stereotypical gay character that is only there for homophobic audiences.  This film was made before there was a broadscale outcry against displays of the confederate flag.  The unthoughtful display of that item may upset modern viewers.  Face it, this film is not for people who watch the Oscars.  It is very much meant for immature watchers like the main character.",1115596800,3,792,4.475524475524476
2262249,5,B00094ARRI,"I first saw this film when I was about fifteen or sixteen. My brother and I were at the video store trying to find a movie with boobs in it without raising too many red flags with our parents, who were paying for it. Well, we found it. That night I had a religious experience. My brother was like, ""Yeah, that was alright"", but me, I went away with something I carry to this day, about fifteen years later. It wasn't just the boobs, it was EVERYTHING! The main character, the music, the ridiculousness of the situations, this film was genius on so many levels and firing on so many levels that it honestly leaves me speechless. Sorry for rambling--About the film: the plot revolves around a young man from Alabama (like myself) named Pondo Sinatra (what a great name) who enters college and does what most everyone does at college: Tries To Get Laid. This may sound like every 'Porky's'-type 80's movie---BUT IT'S NOT. Like I said before, the music itself is amazing. The Buzzcocks, the Fleshtones, Dream 6 (which later became Concrete Blonde), R.E.M. (which I've never actually heard on ANY VHS release of the movie, but it's on the credits, so someone help me out there) the Untouchables, and the list goes on. My friends and I have even tried to make our own personal soundtrack of the film because we knew there would never be one, but even in the days of file sharing we still can't pull it off. It's that GOOD. But I digress. From the onset, Pondo is befriended by the campus badass (now that's different already, isn't it?) named Studley who's played by Tim Carhart, who some  of you might recognize as Geena Davis' boyfriend in 'Ghostbusters' and the really NASTY fellow in 'Thelma and Louise'. He's also helped along by Elbow, (you might recognize from the film 'M.A.S.H.')the janitor of the college and resident GURU, to help Pondo find the perfect aphrodisiac. What follows is quite possibly the funniest, most ingenious visuals, music, plot devices and acting that I have ever seen IN MY LIFE. I pray to God that the DVD will have some sort of extras, but if it doesn't, whatever. I'm just extatic that it's finally coming to DVD and I won't have to take my old ratted out VHS to some place to have it transferred, which I absolutely WAS about to do. Enjoy it, really enjoy it.",1115510400,16,2289,4.569343065693431

8057054,3,B00094ARRI,Funny for the 80's so if you are not in that 80's kind of humor this will suck. On the other hand if you have a twisted 80's sense of humor this will be right up your ally.,1451260800,,172,3.5526315789473686

8057062,5,B00094ARRI,Greater than Citizen Kane.  More of a classic than Gone with the Wind.  The Party Animal brings back too many awesome memories of the early '80s.  Quite possibly one of the funniest and awesome movies...OF ALLLLL TIME!,1427241600,,218,4.837837837837838
