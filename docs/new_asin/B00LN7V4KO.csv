6492763,5,B00LN7V4KO,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

6492768,4,B00LN7V4KO,"Season three delivers as expected with the usual recipe of one part crime thriller, one part office drama, and one part dreary Yorkshire urbanity. It works well and the series is solid.

One aspect that American viewers may find noteworthy or just curious is (spoiler alert) is the reaction of the police to information that a possibly loaded handgun is in a home. A family friend mentions it to Banks and asks for a discrete recovery if it from her home. Instead of that, Morton orders a swat team to go in!!! Things go wrong on the over-zealous raid and a man in the home gets tazed and suffers a heart attack. The tazing fiasco somehow merits an internal investigation that could cost Morton her job!!! This plot falls flat in the U.S. Aside from that, the episode and the season was quite enjoyable.",1486857600,,803,4.576388888888889

I enjoy the team method of working cases, as opposed to the lone detective or pair of detectives.  The variety of backdrops, from gritty city to beautiful countryside, adds to the realistic impression.  If you enjoy DCI Banks, I highly recommend you try the Inspector George Gently and Blue Murder series.",1456704000,,430,5.114285714285714

6492820,5,B00LN7V4KO,"Another triumph for the excellent actress Caroline Catz. When she was added to the cast, 2 seasons ago, in my opinion she saved the show. There had been a LOT of press about possibility of show cancellation due to low ratings. Today... thanks to Caroline... there's upgraded far more interesting storylines... and her character is so unusual... the show is again good to watch. Caroline Catz is brilliant in her long time and current role as ""Louisa Glasson Ellingham"" in the beloved award winning ""DOC MARTIN"". In the U.S. new series 7 now airing on local PBS stations. In Europe Doc Martin airs on iTV.  DCI BANKS Series 4 begins European debut February 2016 on iTV.  Check with PBS about when it airs U.S.  and the easiest thing... just stream it from Amazon when it comes available. I love these British masterful mysteries... you must also.

DI Helen Morton does not exist in the books and has been introduced as a foil  for DS Annie Cabbot. The battle between them is interesting, but otherwise the Morton character (or ""Spock"" as Cabbot would have her) is of little interest. DS Cabbot is a much stronger charcter in the TV series than in the books and offers a stream of surprising facts about her convoluted personal life. Her professional contributions are equally interesting, although it is often unclear whether her primary purpose is to advance the investigation or undercut a colleague. The mysteries themselves are good and this talented cast is able to breathe life into one of the weakest books, ""Bad Boy.""",1445558400,,777,4.976923076923077

6492894,5,B00LN7V4KO,"Three more ""Banks"" novels (approx.. 90 minutes each) fill the THIRD series with one episode that will keep you on edge. NO SPOILERS HERE!
If you've come to this review direct, you have obviously (or, at least I hope) watched the two previous ""series"" (a short season) of this terrific procedural crime drama that aired in the UK on the commercial ITV television network. (It aired in the US on BBC America and is released for home video by BBC Home Video.  So I won't spend much time telling you about the characters except to say the Banks two female assistants - each of who was there for one season, are both here.

All three of the approximately 90 minute episodes are uncut so you will hear language and see violence. The first disc contains two crime mysteries which were - for me - just okay in the plotting, but my attention was kept by the talented core cast of detectives. The second s=disc contains just one story - ""Bad Boy"" - and will grab you and not let go. While the lead characters' personal lives are not focused on in all the previous stories, everything comes together in ""Bad Boy"".

If you've read my reviews of other BBC crime shows you'll know that I hate ""spoilers"" (and I don't understand why some reviews give too much info - especially in mysteries) but I can tell you that the show  has gone into at least 5 series so we'll see where it goes. And, I don't consider this a spoiler either, but know that - unlike some other crime dramas - there are no cliffhangers at the end of this ""series""

If you love the first two series you'll love this one too. By there, there are no bonus features on this set.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6492895,4,B00LN7V4KO,I ordered season 3 from Amazon UK and received it in about 3 weeks.  FYI.  I liked it but wonder why it hasn't been released in English in the US.  Its extremely irritating to fans to have to wait on the product and have to settle for subtitles.,1435017600,,245,4.0625
6492896,3,B00LN7V4KO,"caroline catz is the main reason i watch this series as i love her work. really enjoyed 1&2, just not feeling it with this one. the stories weren't as interesting, and i had little to no connection to the characters. hopefully, 4 will return us to the good old days",1434844800,,265,4.32
6492897,5,B00LN7V4KO,"First, caveat emptor.  The subtitles are in Dutch and unless you have an all-regions player you will not be able to see these dvds on your player.  Not to worry.  If you are a fan of DCI Banks and similar British programming, you should purchase an all-regions player.  They are not expensive and the new models do not need to be set.  You simply pop in a dvd from any region and the player does the rest.  With an all-regions player you can do comparison shopping.  Sometimes the British dvds (I purchased those for this review) are less expensive than the U.S. ones.  As a rule you can also get the shows earlier than their U.S. release date.  Our players are by Pioneerpurchased via Amazon.comand we have been very pleased with them.

Now for series 3:  There are three episodes: Wednesdays Child (a putative child abduction story that focuses on two individuals who may or may not be posing as social workers); Piece of My Heart (a journalist dies and Banks sees connections between that death and the death of a member of an 80s pop band); Bad Boy (a former neighbor finds a gun in her daughters bedroom; Bankss daughter is abducted).

All three episodes are strong; all have high production values.  Note that the Peter Robinson novels on which the episodes are based are generally very long books, filled with texture in the British manner and with what Americans will sometimes perceive as a deliberate or even slow pace.  This is not the case with the film adaptations, where the pace is appropriate for the length and the action and intensity more or less non-stop.  These episodes are different in that they focus a great deal on Bankss private life.  He is now dating his Detective Sergeant (Andrea Lowe), seeing more of his daughter and trying to keep his private life disentangled from his professional life.  Stephen Tompkinson is an excellent actor and these episodes stretch him more and enable him to show his chops (particularly his ability to act with every part of his face and not just his eyes).

Series 3 may be the best of the show to date.  I recommend it highly.  Good news for all: a friend of mine was recently on a British mystery cruise in the Baltic.  She met Tompkinson (who was very, very nice) and he assured her that there were more episodes to come of DCI Banks.",1432425600,2,2299,4.58578431372549

6492900,5,B00LN7V4KO,"One year before the official North American release, Season 3 of DCI Banks was released in two European DVD versions - from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
Both European versions have found their way onto Amazon.
By the time I posted my review, thirteen reviews of the European versions had already appeared on this page.

Some reviewers have complained that the subtitles are in Dutch, not English.
Some reviewers complained that it will not play at all.
There is a simple explanation:
Both the English and Dutch versions are in PAL Region 2 format - If you buy them, you will need a special region-free DVD player.

The North American release is identical in content to the UK release (with English subtitles), but it is in the NTSC Region 1 format (the North-American standard).
The different versions are easy to tell apart
- the cover art for the European releases is radically different. *
Make sure the cover of yours has the two women on the left and the man on the right (and no Dutch writing).
------------------------------------------------------

This excellent and gritty British police series debuted in 2010.
Filmed in Yorkshire, primarily in the city of Leeds (population 750,000)
Since the series began, Stephen Tompkinson has played Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and Andrea Lowe has played Detective Sergeant Annie Cabbot.
There is a surprising amount of sexual tension on this show.
D.S. Cabbot took maternity leave at the start of Season Two.
Nobody knows who the father is, and there is a great deal of speculation among her fellow officers.
[No, DCI Banks is not the father.]
D.S. Cabbot is back as a single mother in Season Three.

In Season Two, Caroline Catz, as Detective Inspector Helen Morton, was brought in as a temporary replacement, but has caught on and is now part of the team.
(I have a major crush on this woman. This was her first series after ""Doc Martin"").
All three are back for Season Three.

This show keeps getting better..
Season Three has the best writing so far - especially the final episode ""Bad Boy"".
Very Dickensian.
Charles Dickens had a knack for introducing unrelated plot lines, which are finally brought together by a remarkable chain of coincidences.
In lesser hands this would be a recipe for disaster, but Catherine Tregenna pulled it off successfully.
In real life, DCI Banks' evidence against the killer would not be admissible in court,
but dramatically the episode was very satisfying.

My only concern is that there was entirely too much fraternization between the ranks in Season Three.
also Too much ""Boinking""
also Too much ""Rogering""
also Too much ""Shagging""
also Too much ""Snogging""
also Too much ""Hiding the Sausage""
----- Euphemisms from from the Online Slang Dictionary

The implied sexual tension of Seasons One and Two is out in the open.
I would have thought the lower ranks were off-limits to Detective Chief Inspectors, but this is apparently not the case in Yorkshire.
Season Four will be interesting.

Only real complaint is the lack of a Blu-Ray version.
Still five stars.

Don't order the UK or Dutch version unless you have a region-free DVD player and need Dutch subtitles.

Region-free DVD players are actually a good idea.
Unfortunately you won't find them at Best Buy, Target or Walmart.
They are not illegal, but the big retailers are under a lot of pressure not to sell them.
On the Amazon search bar, under ""Electronics"" enter ""region free dvd player""
Several models under $50.

All DVD players are region-free when they come from the factory.
The regional encoding software is programmed in later.
It can be deprogrammed by someone who knows what they are doing
(there is a computer port on the back of your DVD player - along with a warning label that it is for authorized technicians only).

I have owned a Toshiba region-free player for two years, and it plays flawlessly.
In addition to playing every DVD in the world (PAL or NTSC), it will also play region A and region-free blu-rays, but not European region B blu-rays.
Region-free blu-ray players are available, but more pricey - in the $200 range (but the price will almost certainly come down if you are patient).
- but read the description carefully: ""region-free DVD / Blu-Ray player"" is not the same as ""region-free DVD / region-free Blu-Ray player"".",1429401600,44,6536,5.987138263665595
