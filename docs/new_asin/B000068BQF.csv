1723307,4,B000068BQF,"Well, there is no substitute for a good teacher in martial arts, however, this is a useful dvd insofar as the techniques are well demonstrated and adequately explained.  If you already know the basics of either karate or taekwando you will reap the benefit, but it is difficult to teach yourself.  But I use the kicks to help me stay on top of what I know and to expand my knowledge.  What was of particular interest to me were the triple kick combinations at the end.  Quite interesting, especially if you are interested in competition fighting.

I notice one defect in taekwando - not enought blocking or hand techniques. But hey don't get hit with one of those high kicks - cause then its ko time!",1122595200,6,700,4.523809523809524
1723308,5,B000068BQF,"If you can only afford to buy one kicking instructional DVD, get this one. Sang H. Kim works progressively from the very basics (front kick, roundhouse kick) to combination kicking, jumping kicks, spinning kicks and multiple kicks with the same leg, which I've never seen my instructor teach. What I love about this DVD is that I can use it to learn and get pointers on some of the intermediate kids while my son, who is a black belt, learned a whole bunch of new jumping kicks that he couldn't wait to show off to his black belt friends. A nice bonus is the way the menu is set up - you can chose the kick you want to learn or practice and go right to it rather than trying to fast forward or rewind to find things. It's a small detail but saves lots of time and frustration when you're working out and don't want to waste time fiddling with your remote control.",1118880000,16,863,4.2682926829268295
1723309,2,B000068BQF,"taekwondo has so many kicks, escpecially on the demo circuit ...this covers only the basic ones used in forms ... no new information, nothing that should not have already been taught by your instructor ... for the price that one must pay for this dvd, very shallow, very disappointing ... yes, i was hoping for some aerial kicks, some gee whiz moves ... dvd's do exist for them, this is definitely one of them ... unfortunatly i bought this first before i found the others ... if you cannot learn in class, get this, it does teach the basics well, if you are looking for something challenging, buy something else ...",1115856000,16,616,4.558558558558558
1723310,5,B000068BQF,"This DVD is truly a must have.  The interactive screens allow you to jump directly to the kick that you want to see, and the number of kicks that are presented is amazing.  No other video on the market has the detailed descriptions or the number of kicks in a single DVD.  KIM Sang H. has done a wonderful job.  Keep up the good work.",1072224000,17,334,4.092307692307692
1723311,4,B000068BQF,"This dvd is very easy to understand, all the techniques are really easy to practice, I practice Tae Kwon Do at the University and i've found this stuff good for beginners, it goes from the simple kick through the most powerful and awesome kick.
Although there are several techniques to perform it's still a good material to learn...",1042675200,21,332,4.741379310344827

7964014,2,B000068BQF,"Very mediocre film.  None of the kicks looked to be beyond black belt level, except perhaps the side kick, back kick shown in the very last portion.  The problem is that this kick is shown for a few seconds, with no explanation at all on how to perform it, or when it would come in handy, actually there is no words about the kick at all, heck it might not even be a side-kick, but simply stepping on your opponent, and back kicking them.  All the kicks are your basic kicks you learn at white-yellow (front, roundhouse, side, ax, crescent, hook/whip, back, etc) then adding hops and spins to the kick.  If you are a green belt, you know everything.  If you are not a green belt, then the instructions here are too poor to really assist you.  It is useful to practice along with, and the one-leg double kicks are nice.  However, everything else is of little use.  I can't see myself watching this very often at all.  The guy has good technique, and all, it's a shame he didn't focus a lot on a few kicks, rather than scantily try to show how to perform a lot.  The bonus features are also pure rubbish.  For instance, sparring tips, which I was most interested in, was nothing but a list of words!  Skip it!",1275955200,3,1207,4.315555555555555
7964015,4,B000068BQF,"I have experience in Japanese style Karate from the past and I'm looking to join a TaeKwonDo Dojan near my house soon so I bought this DVD to practice my kicks a little bit before I join.  I was pretty impressed by the instructions.  Sang H. Kim demonstrates each technique many times in full time, slow motion, against targets, and practical application so that you can fully grasp the technique and even do it with the video.  He covers what seems to me as all the basic kicks and advanced ways to apply them.  Really nice DVD for anyone looking to learn versatile kicking.",1251676800,5,575,4.5
7964016,4,B000068BQF,"Everyone has to start somewhere, and this dvd does just that.  It starts the practitioner right at the beginning.  The level of complexity rises the further you go into the dvd. Stances are discussed; varying camera angles are given.  Will this aid the person who's been studying for years? Not really. Will it aid a child who may need extra time to get a kick right?  Definitely. Will it enhance an adult who is trying to ""remember"" how to do certain techniques?  Yes. It's never to late to get back to basics.",1187136000,9,511,4.510869565217392
7964017,5,B000068BQF,"If you need excellent training material to reference on TKD kicking, this is it. The quality is excellent and the repetitive views of each technique is invaluable to the learner. I would recommend this DVD without reservation. Only for serious students.",1186790400,5,253,5.195121951219512
7964018,5,B000068BQF,"I thought this DVD was excellent.  I study a martial art that does not do much kicking.  I received this DVD as a gift and it taught me a number of very good kicks to incorporate into my practice and sparring.  The instruction was clear and the quality of the production is outstanding.  I highly recommend this product.

7964019,5,B000068BQF,"I bought this when I was just getting started in taekwondo so I could review at home and almost a year later, I still use it to review each kick as I learn it in class. The kicks taught here go well beyond black belt so it's something you'll be able to use for quite a few years as you progress through the belts. I like the many views of each kick and the slow motion allows me to pick up the little things that I don't catch in class. Very useful DVD and well worth the price!",1150070400,7,478,3.8877551020408165
7964020,5,B000068BQF,"This DVD is no substitute for a master, but still, the kicks are clearly shown, from different angles and slow and normal motion. Interested viewers can also easily analyze the more subtle parts of kicking, like positions of knees, feet, how much knees are bent etc. The different types of kicks are also conveniently indexed in the disc: you can move directly to the kick you want to view or practise. Definitely recommended for coloured belts. Instructors might also want to have a look at this DVD.",1141430400,7,501,4.7701149425287355
7964021,5,B000068BQF,This DVD covers kicks from beginner to black belt.  The kicks are explained clearly as they are demonstrated.  A great supplement to class.,1125446400,6,139,5.0
