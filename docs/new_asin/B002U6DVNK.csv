3988803,3,B002U6DVNK,"The idea for this film, a documentary that includes rehearsals and performances for the 1970 birthday tribute to Louis at the Newport Jazz Festival, is a far, far, better thing than the realization.  For both the good and the bad, we have respectively to thank and condemn producer, George Wein.  It is wonderful to see and hear Louis rehearsing, teaching the routines that he wants to the members of the band. Louis is relaxed and largely jovial, but the music is something he takes very seriously.  Clearly, though, there had to be much more footage of same than was shown, and excising any of it, given the opportunity to show it and especially given the poor quality of some of what IS shown later on, is a little like ripping pages out of Beethoven's sketch books.  The splicing in of Louis's narration, actually an interview as Wein explains in one of the bonus features, is awkwardly managed (cutting off rehearsals, informal moments, and performances) and redundant for anyone who would invest in buying the DVD.  At the same time, any spoken words by Louis, especially about his trumpet-playing colleagues, are worth hearing for their own sake.  A lot of the music is well worth having: Bobby Hackett throughout; Dizzy Gillespie's incorrigibly charming send-up, ""I'm Confessin'""; Dizzy's amazing extrapolations on ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" Jimmy Owens, on flugelhorn, performing straight melody on ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen""--a huge highlight; and, of course, Louis's rising to the occasion in his singing of old standbys like ""Blueberry Hill"" and ""Sleepytime Down South"".  As most people know, he had been sick and mostly inactive for two years prior to this occasion, and his doctors had forbidden him to play the trumpet.  Seeing Louis without the horn and hearing other trumpeters featured around him is weird and disconcerting and yet moving as we imagine what the situation had to be like for him.  For all the good music, there are two editing blunders:  we get to see in its entirety the longest single performance---an endless ""I Want a Little Girl"" by the largely inept Preservation Hall Jazz Band; and we also see the entire set done by Mahalia Jackson, who looks unwell and was not in very good form, prior to Louis's return to the stage for a typically good-spirited but not well-organized grand finale.  For all that, two moments alone are worth the price of admission:  after ""Sleepytime,"" Bobby Hackett puts his arm around Louis and kisses him on the cheek, the two of them mutual admirers for many years clearly so happy to be back on stage together one more time; and early on, as Louis arrives on the  grounds, greeting musicians, he walks up a short flight of stairs and finds none other than Dizzy G, clad in shorts and wearing the funkiest shoes you'll ever see.  It is a mark of the film's production values that a voice-over obscures what they say to each other.  And when this moment is reprised in Wein's remarks about how the film was made, it is AGAIN obscured, this time by Wein's voice-over.  Wein gave us great things, including some of the things in this film, but his sense of self-importance has always been huge and often obliterating.",1310428800,3,3183,4.845018450184502
3988804,5,B002U6DVNK,"The content of this has been well summed up in some of the other reviews. But what I would add, is that this is a beautifully filmed and lovingly edited concert film of one of Pop's last major public performances.

Coming on after a heartfelt and hot series of tributes from top trumpeters, Louis takes centre stage and his radiant smile lights up the whole screen as he sings some of his biggest hits. Sadly no trumpet as he was recovering from serious illness (although he had recovered sufficiently to play some beautiful horn on the Johnny Cash show 3 months later) but his singing is so soulful, so moving that I'm not ashamed to say I had seriously damp eyes by the end of the film.

This film is of interest not just to existing fans of Louis, but to anyone who like's superbly made concert films.

Alongside ""Jazz on a Summers Day"" and ""Jammin the Blues"" this is the best jazz performance film ever made.",1283126400,3,912,4.449101796407185
3988805,5,B002U6DVNK,"...although they (i.e. we) ARE the target audience for this magnificent concert documentary, other music fans should pay attention too...
Tunes like ""Bluebery Hill"" and ""When the Saints go Marchin in"" definitively have cross-over appeal and,
let's not forget the magnificent MAHALIA JACKSON in one of her wilder appearances anyone has ever seen (IMHO)...
Jazz is, however, the main attraction here, with Satchmo singing (no, he wasn't able to play his trampet in 1970) and the beatiful playing (and occasional singing) of Ray Nance, Wild Bill Davison, Dizzy Ellington, Bobby Hackett and other beatiful jazz giants PLUS some authentic New Orleans jazz masters (Preservation Hall Orchestra)...

LOT of feel good moments here, jazz, pop and gospel;
LOT of good spirits (Dizzy Gillespie kissing Joe Newman in the cheak after his solo), Bobby Hackett and Satchmo exchanging true friendship and musical understanding...
Also, I've seen a fairly miserable clip from this on youtube - forget about that!

THIS IS MAGNIFICENTLY RESTORED 16 mm material.

Too soon after this one, Satchmo was gone, Mahalia was gone... Folks, this is musical history.",1277683200,3,1139,5.351955307262569
3988806,5,B002U6DVNK,"This incredible document of the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival is a must own.  Filled with music and warmth, this wonderful film shows Louis in one of his last major appearances.  It features Louis in a casual rehearsal session before the Newport concert, in full force in front of the crowd singing the songs he helped make famous and a short while later commenting on the event.  It's priceless.

Fans of New Orleans jazz should be aware of the parade of legends in this film: Percy Humphrey, Willie Humphrey, Billie and DeDe Pierce, Cie Frazier, Captain John Handy, Big Jim Robinson and others.  It's a rare treat to see these great neglected musicians get their due.

Don't miss out on this film.  It's not some hodgepodge of musical bits thrown together but rather a brilliant and complete portrait of a remarkable event.",1265241600,6,822,4.787234042553192
3988807,3,B002U6DVNK,"I got this DVD based on the extensive song listing.  There were some songs played in a professional environment, but many we in a very casual setting and not done like the professional he was.  They were at an informal rehersal. I'm quite disappointed in the manner he performed some of my favorites.  Additionally, most songs were not played in their entirety.  I wish they would simply put together a DVD of Louis singing all the favorites in a fine show business presentation!",1264636800,5,479,4.734939759036145
3988808,5,B002U6DVNK,"""Louis Armstrong:  Good Evening Ev'rybody,"" an invaluable live concert recording, is based on never before publicly seen footage of the entertainer's 70th birthday party at the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival.  The feature-length high-definition production has recently aired, in a shorter version, on public broadcasting channels (PBS) in the United States, and on several international broadcasters, including BBC4 in the United Kingdom.

 Famed jazz producer George Wein, who created the Newport Jazz Festival and has produced it for many years, threw Armstrong's all-star party, featuring Mahalia Jackson and Dizzy Gillespie as well as many other jazz greats; he also had the foresight to get it professionally filmed, though the film was never released.  He even went to Armstrong's house, in Queens, New York, and, by asking the musician a series of artfully-framed questions, got what is, in effect, a narration from the master.  Mind you, Armstrong was not well at the time; he passed on July 6, 1971, and this is believed to be his last filmed concert performance.  The original, first generation 16 mm. film of the 1970 concert was produced and directed by Wein, filmmaker Sidney J. Stiber, and executive produced by Jack Lewerke.  Producer Albert Spevak created new hi def masters from the original, and digitally restored the audio from the original concert masters.

On the DVD, we see Armstrong rehearsing and performing many of his greatest hits. He is joined by performers such as Jimmy Owens, Bobby Hackett, Wild Bill Davison, and Ray Nance, who perform some too.  I believe I counted 24 songs in all.  Gillespie does ""I'm Confessing,"" and ""Ain't Misbehavin'.""  Davison does ""Them There Eyes."" Owens does ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.""  Nance, a big band performer with lounge lizard style, gives us ""I'm in the Market for You."" We also get ""Thanks a Million,"" and ""Way Down Yonder in New Orleans.""  Armstrong gives us his signature tune, ""Sleepy Time Down South,"" ""Pennies From Heaven, "" and ""Mac the Knife.""  We get ""What a Wonderful World"" and ""Hello Dolly"" in rehearsal.  Also, his surprising, unpretentious take of ""Blueberry Hill,"" which he sings complete with New Orleans accent: ""you bodder me still.""  Well, the New Orleans accent, like the famed Brooklyn accent, grows out of the Irish accent, and the troublesome ""th"" sound might as well not exist.

 Watching this, you can never forget that these artists are making music, in the truest sense of the word.  They are largely older adults at the time, with bags under their eyes and around their waists; some of the women performers appear to be wearing $10 wigs, and some could use them; everybody smokes - and there's Schlitz beer everywhere.  And the performers just stood and made the best music they knew how, with, apparently, little attention paid to outer appearances, polish, or presentation; there's not a writhing dancer to be seen.  However, in her show-stopping, show-closing appearance, the late gospel star Jackson, who would herself pass fairly shortly, on January 27, 1972, does get carried away by ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee,"" and breaks her vocal to dance a few steps.  The crowd stood and roared.  Armstrong found himself coming out on stage, and joining Jackson in the gospel standard, which he'd never professionally sung before.  Producer/impresario Wein calls the evening's stars out, and we see them in a final unrehearsed jam of ""When the Saints Go Marching In,"" sung, once again, by Jackson and Armstrong. Armstrong hadn't released that tune since 1938; Jackson had never professionally sung it before.

In his remarks, Armstrong says that ""there ain't but two kinds of music, good and bad, and if it's got a beat, it's good.""  He has, he adds, just bought the Beatles' ""Let It Be;"" and he gives us a few bars of it.  Gospel star Jackson will say that everyone loves Armstrong, who's from her home town, and ""if you don't, you don't know how to love."" If you love good music with a beat, you will love this DVD, as I do.",1262476800,22,4029,4.973134328358209

Filmed in July of 1970 it shows both artists in fine form.  Louis would die in July of 1971 and Mahalia would pass in January of 1972.
