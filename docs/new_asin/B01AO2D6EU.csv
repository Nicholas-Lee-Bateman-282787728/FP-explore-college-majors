8747850,5,B01AO2D6EU,The condition was perfect and just about everything else was except I wish that if it's a 2 disc DVD set that one is on the one side of the inside of the case and one is on the other side of the inside of the case instead of overlapping each other but other than that everything was cool,1527465600,,287,3.8813559322033897

8747854,5,B01AO2D6EU,"Total Riot, great ensemble cast and at bottom, very sweet show.  Really wish it had been picked up after the Second Season b/c all of the characters were great and there was plenty of room to grow with them.  Highly recommended both Seasons 1 and 2.",1474156800,,249,4.391304347826087

8747856,5,B01AO2D6EU,Probably an underrated show.  I think it could have really found a good rythm if it had gotten a chance. A completely different side to Mosley who I've only seen playing darker characters. The chemistry worked pretty well with the main cast even though I thought some of the plotting could have progressed differently.,1458864000,,318,4.888888888888889
