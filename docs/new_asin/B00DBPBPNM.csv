The quality is very poor, they took games that should have been spread over two-three discs and tried to jam them into one.  The broadcast is also not the full version that you see on TV, they cut out several minutes in-between plays.",1391644800,11,367,4.545454545454546
5787593,5,B00DBPBPNM,when I ordered this I thought it was going to be quick highlights. But it took 3 best games of 2012 and it showed the whole game of each one in about a hour. watching each one was great as if it was for today. this is a great past time to watch to keep you going while waiting for the next time for the hawks to play when they are on by week. I would recommend this for those who love watching the hawks and just can't wait for the next game!!!!,1384473600,5,445,3.795698924731183
5787594,5,B00DBPBPNM,"I was very glad to see this dvd released, it's been years since the Seahawks got a dvd. Just to be clear, this is not the usual NFL production you may be used to seeing. There are no super slow motion catches and tackles with cymbals and dramatic music making it a near-religious event. There's no deep voiced commentary amping up the drama in this dvd. What you get are three complete, commercial-free games from the Seahawk's 2012 season. First is the home game against the Patriots, second is the away game against the Bears, and third is the away playoff game against the Redskins. There are no extras on the dvd. Still, it's kind of a tribute to the Seahawks team that the NFL made a dvd even though the Seahawks didn't make it to the NFC Championship game. Perhaps the NFL gets the feeling that there will be more to come from the Seahawks, and they want to start cashing in now?

So, when the next offseason gets here in February 2014, and I'm going through football withdrawals, this dvd will help. But honestly, I'm hoping I will have another one from the 2013 season along with it. One that shows the Seahawks logo in front of a Lombardi trophy.",1381622400,16,1155,4.44811320754717
5787595,5,B00DBPBPNM,"First off, thank you NFL for finally putting another Seahawks DVD out. There is not much Seahawks media out there so it is always a nice suprise to see something like this. The set itself shows 3 games(1 entire game on each disc) commercial free. The listing on Amazon is incorrect however; The games are vs. New England, at Chicago, and the wild card playoff at Washington. The set though is excellent, documenting the rise of budding stars Russell Wilson, Golden Tate,Richard Sherman,Robert Turbin and Bobby Wagner while also showcasing Beast Mode himself, Marshawn Lynch. All in all, this DVD will be a real nice collectible to any true 12th man. You will certainly enjoy it while reliving a lot of the memories from the amazing 2012 season. Go Seahawks!",1379376000,7,757,4.8307692307692305

8591470,5,B00DBPBPNM,"Love this as a Seahawks fan, but the film quality isn't as good as  the HD people now watch.  Had problems with disk 2 and hope I can fix it with a bit of cleaning.  A great start for Wilson and the team that back him up.  When you watch this you will notice the improvements the players make in their personal performances in the following seasons.  Worth a look.",1431820800,,364,4.142857142857143
