5082534,1,B007FILEP0,"I feel ripped off, this was the most horrible movie i have ever watched in my life.. just saying! save your money.. i was so mad when i watched it i had to find a place to write a review.",1338076800,5,187,3.7
5082535,1,B007FILEP0,This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not finish it just fast forward to see the boob shot and ended it.  Shot in an old prison with no locks on the cells that must have held them sex slaves secure.  Computers used are old CRT monitors and a keyboard that is not even plugged in.  The only other movie that I have seen that is this bad is Santa Claus and the ice cream bunny.  Acting is horrible and the action scenes just plain funny.  Not nearly enough nudity to make it onto late night cinemax.  I am amazed this is even being sold or rented in Redbox. Shaking my head in utter disgust.,1337817600,8,610,4.084033613445378
5082536,1,B007FILEP0,"Probably the worst movie I've ever dared to sit through. I rented it! I can't believe anyone would pay to own it. Wait for the tv release, one of those 1 or 2 am flicks. But, be very drunk before you watch it!",1337472000,3,209,3.883720930232558
5082537,1,B007FILEP0,"I hate to say it, but I haven't seen a movie this bad since I was in high school.

Things to note:

1) Horrible acting. . . every actor in here acts as if they are robots. It is pathetic and I feel that a group of 16 year olds are better than them.

2) Low-Budget. . . With today's technology, even cheap technology can make things look pretty real. In this movie, it looks as if we are still in the 70's . . .Let me explain: ""When I get shot, I hold a spot on my body to show where I get shot."" Ohh btw, one guy takes over 20 bullets before he dies.

3) Waste of money: Wasn't even worth the dollar in redbox. . . Save this for taken. THat movie is much better all around.

In all, the guy who gave it a 1 is right and the guy who gave this a 5 is probably someone who helped with the creation. THis was a pathetic movie for any movie watcher.",1337126400,3,844,3.772727272727273
5082538,5,B007FILEP0,"I have to say that this movie is amazing... chad roberts has wacked out poo brain if he hates this that much... i have it in good knowledge that he owns The Notebook!... haha... as for the superstar Crimson, its his coming out party much like tom cruise in risky business or stalone in Over the Top... all the greats start somewhere and crimson has officially arrived as a crossover sucsess... crimsons star continues to shine brighter and i look forward to him starring in his own motion picture wich is surely right around the corner... chad you know i love ya but cant let you dog our boy in his debut... i'll send you $17 and a signed copy.... haha",1337126400,,652,4.396694214876033
8515774,1,B007FILEP0,"This movie was terrible. I wish I could give it zero stars.  Don't waste your time. Definitely low, low, low budget with horrible actors.",1528675200,,137,4.708333333333333
8515775,4,B007FILEP0,"Forget the 2 stars.... forget the slow.. low budget beginning...

Good movie... ironic and a bit strange.. but good

4.9 stars but not for kids.",1504137600,,144,4.72
8515776,3,B007FILEP0,Save the girl theam dous not work well because the bad guy is week.,1436140800,,67,3.857142857142857
8515777,1,B007FILEP0,"We just watched this movie, and a few minutes into it, I looked at my wife and noticed that she was looking at me and we both busted up laughing, we decided to finish the movie and treat it like a comedy, we paused and laughed at how stupid it was as we acted out some of the scenes. It was hilarious how bad the acting was. It was almost as if they tried to make it bad because I can't imagine anyone reviewing the scenes after they were shot saying ""that looks great"" ""Perfect"". My brother-n-law and I could probably make a better and more realistic movie then that in my back yard with an iPod while drinking. LOL! We are planning to have friends over and tell them we have this awesome movie and then try to keep a straight face as we watch it together in a complete trance like we think it's the best movie ever, should be a hoot. Wonder how long before one of our friends say ""Are you flipping serious right now"" Enjoy",1367539200,3,924,4.138888888888889
8515778,1,B007FILEP0,"I think the three 5 star reviews of this film may have all been done by the same person, possibly the filmmaker: these 3 reviewers(Roger Steinberg, Chrsi Stevens, and Jeffrey Baker) have a total of 5 reviews between them....of Tino Struckman's 'Normandy' and this.",1352160000,,264,5.0227272727272725
8515779,1,B007FILEP0,"...at last...the absolute WORST movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad flicks.  ( my eyes..!! )

...Up until now, Transmorphers held that title for me, but at least the directors of that outing had the excuse of trying for science-fiction action scenes on a $1000 budget...Chained has NO excuse for being this bad, especially while NOT trying to BE this bad. There was NOTHING good in this flick, not ONE redeeming quality, not one good actor amongst a sea of theatrical rejects (These are the kind of artists who don't even get selected as extras in B-movies). The fight scenes were ludicrous, the 'terror' of the captives laughable, over-the-top cliche villains, even the gunfire sequences lacked depth (they couldn't even afford the cheap blood squibs that mainstream tv shows use)...never has a movie left me feeling dumber for having suffered through it, more empty and devoid of common sense through the realization that it just WASN'T going to get any better...you just know in your inner-being that as soon as this project concluded filming, not one of the crew associated with it could face their own image in any reflected surface.

...DO NOT see it unless you're extremely inebriated, or desperate for that 'train wreck' experience where you realize how monumentally BAD the impact is going to be, how universally bleak your soul will suffer for having seen it - this is what CHAINED: Code 207 will imprint upon your psyche.",1349136000,3,1448,4.926229508196721
8515780,1,B007FILEP0,"I almost never ever stop a movie in the middle and don't finish it.  It was THAT bad.  The beginning - I was trying to give it a chance; it just had more of a choppy low budget indy film, which I can handle.  I think the acting/writing/editing actually gets worse as it goes on.  Considering it started as choppy and low budget, you can use your imagination how something could get worse than that.....  Glad I only spent the $1 to rent from the redbox.",1345766400,,453,4.22093023255814
8515781,1,B007FILEP0,"The worst movie I have ever seen in my life, bar none.  The people writing 5-star reviews MUST be the actors or producers of the movie.  A group of highschool kids could have made a better film over summer vacation; oh, and if you are hoping for some redeeming nudity because of the NR rating, forget it.",1344124800,,304,4.315789473684211
8515782,1,B007FILEP0,This movie has terrible acting.  The editing looked choppy. The action scenes were not credible.  My boyfriend rented this from Red Box.  I have no idea why.  It was not worth watching.,1340409600,2,185,4.6875
8515783,1,B007FILEP0,Toss up what was worse: the acting or the cinematography or the typecasting. 1 star was more than its worth.,1338595200,2,108,4.45
