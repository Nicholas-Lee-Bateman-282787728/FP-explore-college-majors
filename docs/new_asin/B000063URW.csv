1691782,5,B000063URW,"If you're a fan of Betty Grable like most of the people writting reviews on this movie, then you should just buy it! I did and I liked this movie. Betty Grable was the best! If you have any doubts about it, I suggest you check it out on youtube or some other website first. Mostly though, if you're browsing through Betty Grable's dvd's, chances are you're going to buy this movie :)",1311465600,2,383,4.260273972602739
1691783,5,B000063URW,"What a terrific movie - Betty Grable had everything - looks, talent - she could sing, dance and act.",1198281600,2,100,4.315789473684211
1691784,3,B000063URW,"A Yank in the RAF has to be the politest War Movie I've ever seen ( The devil you say!). The air combat scenes are primitive but effective for the time and there is a very good combat sequence of Dunkirk. But it's the tone of the film that was hard to understand at first. (Cherrio, stiff upper lip and all that!). I couldn't buy the characters attitude through the whole pictire, don't they know there's a war on! Do RAF pilots really shout ""Tally-Ho"" before engaging the enemy? This is not Mrs Minevere! However, where it fails as a war movie, it succeeds as a Romantic Comedy (Rather whitty dialog eh!) Power and Grable are funny and charming on screen and I could not help liking the movie as a romantic comedy. (You could do worse old man!)",1079654400,7,745,4.366906474820144
1691785,4,B000063URW,"...this 1941 film did a lot in its day to interest
Americans in the plight of our British cousins at
the beginning of World War II. It is entertainment,
but with air combat footage that adds to its reality.
Betty Grable and Tyrone Power are attractive and
engaging.  Now that we are once again sadly engaged
in war, it is of special interest to have the chance
to look at ourselves sixty years ago and reflect upon
the similarities and the differences.  Betty Grable
was a symbol of American womanhood back then...she was
more than a pin up...she was a working woman and a very
popular entertainer.  Certainly she is another reason
this film is well worth watching.",1019779200,34,665,4.61864406779661
1691786,4,B000063URW,"Playboy flier Tyrone Power enlists in RAF at the start of WW2. In London he literally bumps into his ex-girlfriend, dancer Betty Grable, and tries to rekindle their romance, in this exciting wartime adventure written by  studio chief Darryl Zanuck (under the name of Melville Crossman).  Hollywood's first WW2 film is a very authentic account of the early days of  Britain at war. Good use of actual aerial battle-scene footage. And Grable  adds a touch of much-needed sex appeal in her scenes with Power. In the  original story Power's character was killed in battle, but when the British  War Office heard of this, they pleaded with Zanuck to change the ending as  it would have a bad effect on the morale of UK citizens!  Zanuck conceded,  and Power wins Grable in the end.  Oh well, that's Hollywood.",934934400,42,804,4.802919708029197

1691810,5,B000063URW,"A YANK IN THE R.A.F. is one of my favorite WWII films. There is a look and feel of innocence and optimism about it for what really lay ahead. This 1941 film made during the War takes a somewhat lighthearted approach, yet under all the gloss and antics there are some grim realities. Leon Shamroy's cinematography is stunning and dramatic especially as the film progresses into its later stages encountering the enemy in the field. His use of light and shadow is extraordinary. Tyrone Power as Tim Baker, the Yank, gives a likeable performance full of confidence and optimism. Reginald Gardiner as Pillby uses his usual charm to enhance this early WWII film. I thought Henry King's direction was excellent. Art Directors James Basevi and Richard Day with Thomas Little's Set Decorations give this film a look of authenticity that I think has been overlooked. This is more than just a lighthearted adventure film. The Special Effects by Fred Sersen and Louis J. Witte  are excellent, especially during the Dunkirk sequence.",1421452800,3,1021,4.970760233918129

1691861,4,B000063URW,"I saw this movie in my early childhood and still enjoy it. Tyrone Power and Betty Grable were both favorites of mine. They both were tremendously popular during this era, and, although this was the only movie they made together, they definitely had some chemistry between them on screen.  Based in Great Britain, Betty is a WAF and Tyrone is an RAF fighter pilot. She does some singing and dancing, he does some flying and philandering... All in all, a very enjoyable little movie!!",1376870400,,482,4.738095238095238

1691863,3,B000063URW,"Good flick for a lazy afternoon with nothing else to do.

Black and white, predictable plot and 1941 level for  special effects.

Good points:  Supporting cast - good job by the Brits.  Remember that this is before the US enters the war and so you have to put up with a bit of ambivalence in the plot line.  There was a surprisingly strong attempt to realistically portray the German aircraft in this movie.
Not so good points:  Betty Grable and her supporting dancers.  If this was a low budget film then all the money went to the stars because those poor back up dancers must have been paid peanuts.  No really good aircraft scenes other than the beautiful Spitfire flying in formation.  War time censors must have restricted the aircraft that could be used.  Plot line is pretty thin.

Bottom line:  It's worth watching and if you are an aviation nerd then seeing ""real time"" 1940 airplanes is worth the effort.  The rest... well... just chuckle and let it go.",1372032000,,963,4.588235294117647

1691865,5,B000063URW,I already watched so many times and never get tired. Became one of my most favorite movies. Tyrone Power is and always will be legend. He really comes from the past as a dream. Today there are not made movies like this. The whole movie is great. I can not imagine how anybody can give this less than 5 stars,1328140800,2,307,4.133333333333334
1691866,4,B000063URW,"The action takes place before the U.S. entry into the war. Tyrone Power, Tim is a crack American pilot flying bombers to England for profit. While in London he discovers his old flame from the states Carol (Betty Grable). She a dancer & volunteers for the war effort. Tim commences to take up with her & is rebuffed. To impress her he joins the RAF (Royal Air Force). This time he has competition from his commanding officer & fellow pilot. John is a  veddy proper, rich English gentleman & loves Carol intensely at first sight. She likes him but loves Tim. Tim in turn loves her but he is ""a worm"". So you have the classic loves triangle. The war intervenes from time to time. with some really good authentic & created dogfight scenes. They both return from saving 350,000 men at Dunkirk. Both have  proposed marriage to Carol before they left. The movie has a feel good ending from the original when one of the men conveniently died. That doesn't happen. Not good for morale. Speaking of which...the biggest star is of course, Betty's fantastic legs, shown early & often. This must have been the movie that launched her as America's Sweetheart. The pin-up that reminded all men of what they were fighting for.",1325894400,3,1211,4.627906976744186

7959697,4,B000063URW,"I liked this 1941 film much more than I expected and I spend a really nice moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In 1940 a cocky, arrogant and rather immature American pilot Tim Baker (Tyrone Power) accepts to ferry Lockheed Hudson bombers to Britain, for the very generous fee of $1,000 per flight. In London, he meets his former British girlfriend Carol Brown (Betty Grable), who works in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force by day and stars in a nightclub by night. He tries to rekindle the relation, but she rebukes him strongly, as he treated her badly in the past. Treating all this as a challenge and a game, Baker decides to reconquer Carol, no matter what... And then the film really begins.

As stated in the title, this is more a war-time romantic comedy than a war film, even if there is some fighting. The real topic of the film is not really war time adventures of Tim Baker but his attempts to get his girl back. It is an uphill battle, because he is kind of an @hole and Carol, who knows this side of him perfectly well, already found a more suitable replacement. But on another hand Tim is a dashing, attractive, dangerously charming @hole - and Carol still has feelings for him. This dance of seduction, attraction and repulsion is very nicely shown and gives the occasion for many excellent dialogs. There is also a lot of polite but nevertheless frequently very corrosive humour.

The only film with Betty Grable I saw before that one was ""How to marry a millionnaire"", in which she was of course very charming but also somehow outstaged by Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall. It was therefore a very, VERY pleasant surprise for me to discover how great was this actress and with how much skill and charm she could deliver killer dialog lines. Skill, wit and charm, all inside a very pleasant frame, walking on never ending legs - well, small wonder that she was the number one pin-up girl during WWII, surpassing even Rita Hayworth... She is GREAT in this film - I will look for more of her movies.

Albeit USA were not yet at war at the time of the release, the film contains also some strongly anti-German and pro-British propaganda, but also gives some insight in the early stages of WWII (1940-1941), showing how USA cheated in order to support Great Britain when preserving the appearances of neutrality, but also how ridiculous were the first RAF air raids against Germany. There is an almost unbelievable but nevertheless strictly true scene with British bombers crews throwing leaflets on Germany and taking great care to unpack them well, so nobody gets hurt on the ground... Well, it all changed quickly after the beginning of the Blitz...

Bottom line, this is a very honest, surprisingly pleasant war-time romantic comedy - not any kind of masterpiece, but a good, solid, honest film and a nice watch. I will keep my DVD for another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1441670400,,2931,4.683495145631068
