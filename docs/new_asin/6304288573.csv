7868366,1,6304288573,"We had ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" taped from AMC. We decided to watch it the other night and we were surprised to see 20 minutes of something strange before ""Flannel Suit"" began. It was so very strange and fascinating we had to watch it mostly in fast forward motion. It was a horde of specimens from a tacky decade that should be forgotten: the 1970's! Men with long, wavy hair, plaid pants, mismatched wardrobes, and a wooden blond with a detonator. Wow! Impressive! Ride up and down on that roller coaster in a fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten, wild and wacky zoom. Will the bomb explode now? Or just around that curve? Nope. All we hear is the screams of joy. Who knows around what bend they will turn to screams of death? Terrifying suspense. Har har. Fast forward. Guy yelling into a walkie-talkie. Guy stalking the wooden blond. Fast forward. No bomb, no explosion. Talk about a let down. I don't like violence, but if we're going to build up the suspense, let's have an explosion here to make it worth it! Fast forward. Credits. I see that this winner film is called, profoundly, ""Roller Coaster""! WOW! I know I will never bother to watch the first part of this film.
Now I know that The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit starts 22 minutes into the video, so I can skip this rolling cinematic gem next time.",1044316800,3,1318,4.518828451882845
7868367,5,6304288573,"I saw this movie for the first time on AMC (the American Movie Classics channel) and I was stunned. The plot was engaging, the scenery was amazing, and it was simply too hooking for me to turn it off!
I thought Roller Coaster was clever and thrilling. Seeing it for the first time was amazing! There are great in car shots from the roller coasters, making you feel as though your actually there.
I would reccomend this film if your a suspense, mystery or Hitchcock fan. It was done very well, and I was almost convinced that it was a Hitchcock movie!",1010275200,,550,4.401960784313726
