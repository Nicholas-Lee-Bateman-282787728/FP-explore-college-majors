8181001,5,B000NQRV6C,"My grandson has been enjoying this video. He had worn out Harold's ""Imagination"" video, and I was pleased to see that this one gave the background to how Harold met his friends who come to the birthday party.",1349913600,,208,4.5
8181002,5,B000NQRV6C,"After getting my daughter hooked on ""the purple crayon"" book, I decide to purchase this video as well.
As other reviewer's have mentioned, the story about the gold fish dying could be daunting, but aside from that, it's an excellent video.",1320451200,,239,4.853658536585366

8181004,5,B000NQRV6C,"I have purchased several Scholastic Storybook Treasures including Harold and Curious George, Make Way for Ducklings, Goodnight Moon and Wheels of the Bus and truly money well spent.  I am very pleased with these DVDs.  I only purchase educational DVDs especially the ones that promote the love of  reading and imagination!  I love these DVDs.  My child loves these stories and seeing it come to life on DVD takes his passion to the next level: he recites the stories verbatim which is soooooo amazing, requests to read the books all the time, sings the songs all day long and it is a true delight for a preschooler and everyone around him. His memory is impressive already and having these DVDs to supplement his books only strengthens his retention!!!!! I only wished they had audio CDs so I can play these stories in the car!  It's fantastic!!!",1267056000,,846,4.760273972602739
8181005,5,B000NQRV6C,"Harold is a very young toddler with a magical crayon and wonderful imagination. Harold contemplates questions pertinent to toddlers and pre-school children. The crayon is really the key to Harold's imagination. This disc includes six episodes from the Emmmy Award winning series broadcast on HBO Family cable television channel.

Sharon Stone narrates and kudoes to her for an excellent performance and not overplaying her role. Pre-schoolers and parents will love these episodes and considering the new disc price, this is a great bargain.

My only warning is to skip buying this disc in favor of the entire series. But, if you cannot afford such then this is a great place to start because the first episode on this disc is ""Harold and the Purple Crayon."" The six episodes have a total running time of 144 minutes.",1261526400,5,816,4.992647058823529
