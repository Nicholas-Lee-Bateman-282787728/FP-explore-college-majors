7789558,4,0780624173,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the many ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around 1998 that ran around an hour long.  Tony Schavone narrates this tape with Randy Savage giving an ""in character"" interview with Eric Bischoff giving some comments himself.  Randy Savage comments on various things throughout the tape such as his meaning of ""Macho Madness"", describing his elbow drop from the top rope, his feelings on Hulk Hogan, where the ""Oh Yeah!"" came from, why he came to WCW, his relationship with Elizabeth, why he joined the nWo & eventually left to form the Wolfpac.  Various highlights of his WCW career were highlighted such as his debut at Starrcade '94, his ""Monster Maniacs"" tag team with Hulk Hogan, his feuds with Ric Flair in 1995 over his father & 1996 over the WCW Championship, his WCW Championship victories, feuding with the nWo, his feud against Diamond Dallas Page, match vs. Lex Luger at Souled Out '98, his feud with Hollywood Hogan over control of the nWo, winning the WCW Title from Sting before losing it back to Hogan, and forming the Wolfpac with Kevin Nash round out the highlights.

This tape overall did a good job of covering the main moments of Savage's WCW career up to that point.  While some of the highlights of matches have been later released in full such as WWE's DVD anthology on Savage, most of them haven't along with the fact that this is the only tape where you actually hear comments from Randy Savage himself so this is a VHS tape I would recommend to get.",1300060800,3,1619,4.607638888888889

This is the most complete and accurate review of this VHS you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful.

Superstar Series- Macho Man Randy Savage- The Man Behind the Madness
I have always liked the Superstar Series that WCW put out. They would go through the wrestler's WCW career and highlight all the major feuds. They are never really detailed, but it is a nice look back at WCW. Macho Man's video is no exception.

This video begins with Macho Man trying to explain with Macho Madness is. I'm not even really sure what he is saying, but he rambles about something. Then we move into his motivation for shifting to WCW from ""the other place."" He finally begins talking about his WCW career after this.

His WCW career began with him saving Hulk Hogan and forming the Monster Maniacs tag team with him. This involved stupid things like Macho waking Hogan up with a Diving Elbow Drop, which is Macho's finisher. It was truly a sad moment in wrestling history. Macho would then move into feuds with Flair and Luger. He also talks about winning his first WCW World Title at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-War-3-1995/dp/6303925537/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World War 3 1995</a>. Also, that link does lead to the right event, WCW just was stupid and put the next year on all their releases.

Macho Man would end up joining the NWO and elevating his career further. In that time he would feud with Hogan, who was the leader of the NWO. This didn't make sense to me and it wasn't explained in the video. Eventually he joined the NWO Wolfpac and that is where the video tape ended.

This is a nice look back at WCW. It has a bunch of clips from WCW to go along with the story. Also, there is a lack of details though. They seem to shift from feud to feud very quickly. Finally, at the end of the day Macho Man hasn't had the most interesting WCW career.",1219536000,2,2167,4.692105263157894
7789560,5,0780624173,"savage has never been one of the characters ive ever liked,but you cant deny his style,the video shows randy in a way most people have never seen,prior to watching it i remember a savage that was beaten senseless by the nwo week in and week out and then joined them,but this video really captures savage's wcw career well,it opens your eyes to what can be looked at as a pretty successful wcw run,great feuds with the nature boy,dallas page,and of course hollywood hogan,great seeing him with elizabeth(rip),brilliantly captures his forever despise of hulkster as he and big sexy kevin nash branch away and begin the nwo wolfpack,its good seeing savage in his days of highflying double axe handles and the seemingly endless hangtime on the flying elbows,awesome,good stuff folks...buy it for sure...HOLLA...if ya hear me",1136073600,,820,5.0814814814814815
7789561,5,0780624173,This is the coolest video I have ever seen! If you want a really good wrestling video then I suggest this one.,979603200,,110,4.045454545454546
7789562,4,0780624173,This was a very good biography. The only reason it gets four stars instead of Five is because it skips a few key moment during Macho Man's carrear with WCW. If it would have showed the shoot interview he did on Nitro it  would have gotten five stars. Still a very good video.,943228800,,275,4.188679245283019
