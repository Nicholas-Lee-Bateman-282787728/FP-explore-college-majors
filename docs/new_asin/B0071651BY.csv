5047084,1,B0071651BY,It should play on a laptop in the US.  I have had that work with DVDs from other countries.  Good luck and thanks for the heads up.,1355702400,,131,3.814814814814815
5047085,1,B0071651BY,"doesn't work, took about 3wks to receive, then realized it doesn't work. seller is false advertising, does not mention anything about not being able to work in USA. Why does amazon even have this product on here. extremely disappointing. wish i saw the reviews before i ordered. save your money and don't purchase this piece of junk!",1354665600,,333,4.859649122807017
5047086,1,B0071651BY,"Same problem as everyone else, does not work in USA.  Contacted company to return it.  What a disappointment.  My son was so excited and now I have to send it back.  My 5 year old and 2 year old love this cartoon and they were so disappointed when it did not work.  I am so upset.",1354665600,,280,3.9285714285714284
5047087,1,B0071651BY,I was sooooo disappointed to get this DVD and not be able to watch it.  It apparently is not compatible with US dvd players.  I didn't see that until after the dvd arrived.  Unless you have a multi regional dvd player don't waste your time with it.,1354579200,,248,4.23404255319149
5047088,1,B0071651BY,Just got this after waiting several weeks for it.  My son was so happy and it was for his birthday.  We live in the US and it doesn't work on any of our DVD players.  To say I'm dissapointed is an understatement.  Why would a company ship an item to the US when they know it doesn't work on our DVD players.  I also have been looking for this information under this ad and have yet to find where it says it won't work in the US.,1354320000,12,428,3.8735632183908044
5047089,1,B0071651BY,"I understand now that it does specify that in the description but it should be more clearly stated in large bold font. And once the retailer realized it was being sent to the US, they should have contacted the purchaser as a courtesy to ensure they had the right equipment to play the DVD. Disappointing.",1354320000,,304,4.545454545454546
5047090,2,B0071651BY,This DVD will not play unless you search online and figure out how to open the regions on your particular player. Most DVD players can be changed but manufacturers don't make the information readily available. Would have been nice to know this ahead of time. If I wouldn't have had a tech savvy friend with me at the time I would have felt like other reviewer did and probably returned this DVD.,1354320000,2,395,4.5
5047091,1,B0071651BY,"If you live in the USA don't waste your money........I guess DVDs are region specific. Bought this for my son and it will not play on any of our DVD players. I have yet to find a way to view the DVD. Doesn't seem to be an option to change the region of the DVD player! Ugh, who knew....not me!",1353888000,27,293,3.9
5047092,5,B0071651BY,"For all those people complaining about having bought the DVD and not being able to play it in the US. LEARN TO READ!!!

The ad clearly specifies that the DVD is for Region 2 and adds ""(Read more about DVD formats)"", as well as providing you a link to a disclaimer. Rather than give the product a bad review, just admit that you made a mistake in not checking first.

As somebody pointed out, you can buy a good quality Region 2 DVD player for a very reasonable price and a region 2 DVD will work even with a US TV (I know because I have a Region 2 DVD for playing English DVD's that are not available in Region 1 format and it works very well).",1364515200,2,644,4.062992125984252
5047093,5,B0071651BY,Great show!! For those complaining it won't work in the USA Right under product details it clearly says REGION 2 (learn more about dvd formats) Pay attention!,1362960000,3,158,4.888888888888889
5047094,5,B0071651BY,"My three year old loves the Octonauts stories in book, DVD or TV version. I received this order during the Holiday season and it arrived much quicker than the original estimate and that was all the way to Hawaii. I'm extremely happy with this seller and would purchase from again. I saw other reviews about the DVD not working but we have DVD player with a Universal Country or Region code and it plays perfectly. It may be difficult to find a player with the Universal code but our player is made by Toshiba and cost about $25 dollars so it's nothing special. We live in hawaii so maybe more foreign DVD's are played here - not sure.",1362355200,3,634,4.38135593220339
5047095,1,B0071651BY,"If you do not have some type of region changer/DVD player, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!  I put this DVD in my MacBook Pro and was prompted to change the region. I did so unknowingly. After the third or so play, my computer indicated that I only had one more time to change the region code. So now, I can't play this DVD at all. My son is super disappointed! I just added DVR to the cable in his room....crisis control.",1360281600,,410,4.061728395061729
5047096,1,B0071651BY,"could not view on our dvd player. Waited so long for it. by the time I realized it didn't work, I didn't bother sending back. waste of money.",1359590400,,141,4.071428571428571
5047097,3,B0071651BY,"My two girls love the Octonauts.  However this product has a few issues with it, some of which have been mentioned in other reviews.

1.  DVD Compatibility.  This is a Region 2 DVD and will only play in European DVD players or Region Free players.  You can get a region free player relatively cheaply on Amazon; the best solution is to get a player that lets you switch the region yourself.  It's harder to find a region free portable player.

2.  Some characters have different voices.  What?  I was ready for the DVD Region issue, but this came as a shock.  The BBC version of the Octonauts has different voice actors for Peso, Dashi, Tweak and Pinto (Peso's little brother).  Barnacles, Kwazii and Inkling are the same.  Peso is the most grating as instead of his hispanic accent he has a young boy's British accent (ditto for Pinto).  Dashi also sounds British, but she doesn't talk much so it's ok.  Tweak still has a southern/country accent but it isn't as broad and the voice actor is obviously different.  My girls mostly just rolled with it (""Hey!  Peso's voice has changed!""), but my 3 year-old's favorite character changed from Peso to Tunip.

3.  The Creature Reports are not part of the episodes.  They are included in the extras, but you'd have to get to them from the menu if you want to play the one that matches the episode the kids just watched.  A bit annoying.

4.  Finally, there is a better product out there for cheaper.  A certain UK sister site has the complete 3 disc series cheaper.  Just let your fingers do the walking...

Hope that helps.

5047098,5,B0071651BY,"Firstly, this is actually a review of the product and not the disc compatibility.
The show itself is wonderful, in that it is not only entertaining, but educational. While some of the facts are occasionally a bit of a stretch when it comes to the storyline (I work in an aquarium so I'm familiar with marine biology!), they educate through entertainment and, as such, are worthwhile in creating future ocean stewards who care deeply about the ocean, the creatures that live in them, and what we're doing to collectively destroy it. Of course, the first step is getting kids excited about the oceans and their creatures, and this show does just that. It deserves to be right up there with the most popular children's shows, and adults will probably enjoy it, too.
The action is constant, the 'plot' is always good, and the short length of each episode is enough to keep most children glued to the screen.
There are also repeat characters, so children get to relate to them. The different accents also allows for discussions on nationality, cooperation and tolerance. As a child growing up in the UK, there were many great children's shows. While I'm not going to descend into nostalgia, I find most of today's programming high on glitz and low on quality. Octonauts bucks that trend.
On another note, because I'm from the UK originally, I have a lot of discs from different regions, and hence have a multi-region player. The listing for the item clearly states it's from a different region and may not play in most US players. Buyers should always check this first but, there is an easy solution. Our player broke down a month ago, and I was able, through Amazon, to purchase a new Sony multi-region DVD player for $38 including shipping. Simply do a search for region free DVD player, and there are lots of choices from $30 and up. And then you can not only watch Octonauts, but also purchase some of the amazing children's programs from yesteryear from the UK and build up a region-free DVD library - such as Mr. Benn, Trumpton, Postman Pat, Paddington and many more.",1359072000,5,2068,4.7154696132596685
5047099,1,B0071651BY,"Apparently the format for this DVD is compatible with UK video players...not so much with US. Have tried several different players without success. Wrote to company and got a response that it is ""supposed"" to work with US equipment, if not send it back. Great :/. Otherwise really cute cartoon that kids love.",1357689600,,309,4.849056603773585
5047100,1,B0071651BY,The dvd don't play in out dvd players because there from a diffrent country. I think it should say that before u buy it. Now I have a dvd my son can't watch.,1357430400,,157,3.787878787878788

5047103,1,B0071651BY,This product did not say anything about having to have a special DVD player. Bought and my daughter was so excited to watch it. Come to find out you have to have a special DVD player to play it. Dont waste your money. Just wait for it to go on sale in stores. Or maybe make sure you purchase it from someone in the US.,1357171200,,318,3.9076923076923076
5047104,1,B0071651BY,"The movie itself is great if that's the shows your kids like, however, be aware that you can't play it on a normal USA/ Canadain DVD player, it is Region 2 and we're Region 1!!!  I didn't know this when I bought it because I would think Amazon would have very clear warnings on their site about this.  I guess I should have did a little more research before I bought it so we didn't have a disapointed kid on Christmas morning!!",1356998400,,428,4.2073170731707314
5047105,1,B0071651BY,"when you put the dvd in it says to take it back out, it cannot be played in this area.  so, unless you can find someone to unlock it you won't be abl to even see it.  what is with that?????????",1356825600,,193,3.682926829268293
5047106,1,B0071651BY,"This was my daughter's big wish for Christmas, and when I ordered it in November to ensure it would be to us in plenty of time for Christmas, there were none of the warnings that are now present.  My five year-old went from being excited to being in tears.  Come on!  All of my other PBS store purchases can play in my U.S. DVD player!  This is just mean!  I haven't heard back from them yet about whether or not I can return it.",1356566400,,429,4.059523809523809
5047107,1,B0071651BY,"Purchased this DVD for my daughter for Christmas. Finally received it after Christmas, put it in DVD player and it won't play. This item should not be available for purchase and ship to the US. It won't work in the US. Shame on the seller for not informing customers of this problem and just shipping it out so customers are extremely frustrated and their kids are heartbroken.",1356566400,,377,4.641791044776119

5047110,5,B0071651BY,"Yes, this is region 2 DVD and it states that in the description. Fortunately, my husband is from England and since he brought many DVD's with him we bought a multi-region DVD player years ago.

So on to a real review:
The DVD is super. However it's worth mentioned that it's sightly different from the US version shown on the Disney Channel. The voices aren't the same. With that being said, my 2 year old didn't notice the voices, only my husband and I did. My son couldn't care less, though. He's absolutely riveted by the DVD.

I'm glad to have a DVD to show him since the Disney Channel airs this show so infrequently on COX Cable.

We're ordering more straight from England.",1356480000,,679,4.459677419354839
5047111,1,B0071651BY,"Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  Will not work!  She is soooooo disappointed as this is her most favorite cartoon.
