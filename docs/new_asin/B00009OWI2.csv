For those who are looking for something gory and creepy with great acting this is a great buy!",1062374400,,251,4.142857142857143
1888782,5,B00009OWI2,"These three films are definitive in the genre of horror, and have been borrowed from, and copied, inferiorly I might add, but as they say,you can't replace an original. All three of these films truly create the necessary 'mood' for horror, no lame jokes, no moments of levity, just that creepy feeling in the pit of your stomach. Watch these late at night, lights off, with your favorite girl or guy, and get ready to have the blood squeezed out of your arm, when they're terrified to death. 'The Howling' is probably the best werewolf film I've ever seen, next to 'American Werewolf in London'...unfortunately the Howling sequels are laughable, inferior trash. 'The Fog' directed by renound horror film meister, John Carpenter, follows a band of ghost pirates, who appear on the hundredth aniversary of their deaths to exact a little revenge on a small, sleepy town by the ocean. Right before they appear, the intended victim is surrounded by a dense fog, it's usually the last thing they see before the creatures make quick work of them. 'Carrie,' well if you haven't seen 'Carrie' then you're not from this planet. The re-make was okay, but nowhere near the original with John Travolta and Sissy Spacek. This film holds up well to moden times, although you may get a laugh from the horrendous clothing and dialogue of the times. What's unusual about this set, is that all there films are landmark horror films. Usually two are good, and one's lousy in these box sets, but not here.",1060473600,6,1484,4.778210116731517

7992686,4,B00009OWI2,"I actually was just looking for Carrie, but was glad that The Fog and The Howling were included.  It was a good price for the three.  These movies are on TV, but they cut out a lot of the good moments when it gets scary.  I recommend these movies.  The remakes are not the same as the originals, especially due to the young stars that are in these movies.",1393372800,,355,4.101449275362318
