8129450,5,B000G8NXU0,"We love the Wubbulous World series.  The characters are Dr. Seuss wacky, and many are well known from the stories (such as Horton, the Cat in the Hat, Sam I Am).  Each video has several vignettes, with silly songs and lots of action.  Each vignette has a moral, that is subtle yet worthwhile.  The videos appeal to parents due to the clean language and subject matter.  They appeal to boys and girls ages 3-8 due to funny puppets, voices, and situations.",1276992000,2,454,4.555555555555555
