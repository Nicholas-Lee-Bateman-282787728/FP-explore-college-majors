2551884,5,B000F4TMFK,"I've been collecting sneakers since i was 14. Sneakers are considered a big part in my life. From working at retailers to sneaker shops. I thought I knew everything about sneakers. But after I saw this DVD on a shelf of Footlocker I was interested to spend $20 on this documentary. Even when i wasn't really into documentaries, but this is one of the best ones I've seen next to SuperSize me.

I learned so much I didn't know about the culture and the sneaker game. The history of must shoes and the current status of the culture. It shows how it all started in the 1980 and 1990s. It gave very detailed interviews and informations about the history of the sneaker culture. This is a great movie for anyone. Whether your a sneaker head or not.",1165881600,,743,4.423357664233577
2551885,5,B000F4TMFK,"I wouldn't have rented this documentary about sneaker sub-culture if it hadn't come with a $10 coupon to Foot Locker. Seriously. But for those who know about BAPE and Ice Creams - people who know the history of Air Jordan's - I guarantee a love affair with this movie. Filmmaker Thibaut de Longeville delivers a logical, in-depth, and engaging presentation of how America came to create and embrace the lifestyle sneaker scene as a business and an art form. With interviews from Damon Dash, Russell Simmons, a host of graffiti artists, rappers, and sneaker executives, Thaibaut comes at this with academic precision. The documentary is simply awesome. Look for it at your local Foot Locker.",1161820800,,690,5.008695652173913
2551886,5,B000F4TMFK,"I am an avid shoe collector and have been this way for years. I go on forums and talk about shoes. I got my first job the summer of last year, just to get two pairs of shoes. I applied for a job at a major shoe retailer just to get first dibs and a discount for Christ's sake. Shoes are a big deal for me. So when I heard about Just for Kicks I was excited. Another thing, I am an aspiring filmmaker and my dream project is a documentary, like this, that caters to people like me. And unlike a lot of other documentaries I've seen, I wanted to do something that dug deep into this culture.

Just for Kicks is one of the greatest documentaries, and not to mention most insightful, that I've ever seen in years. I never sat through a movie that almost felt like it was made for me. Another thing is that my knowledge of shoes is so vast and it never occurred to me that this movie would teach me things that I didn't already know. It covered so much on the culture, from Run D.M.C. claiming their possessions on ""My Adidas"" to the Air Force One phenomenon of recent.

I had an idea for a sneaker documentary myself and as of recent I started doing more research to find out what I didn't know and champ all the other documentaries. But now, I feel like I can't beat this movie. This is top of the notch and no other film can document this movement as well as it was documented in Just for Kicks. Interviews with huge figures in this culture such as Scoop Jackson, Bobbito Garcia and the greatest designer of all time Tinker Hatfield gave this film a huge plus.

This film serves as a historic recording of this culture that can be very beneficial to those wanting to start this hobby. I strongly recommended this film to those people and those nostalgic collectors that like looking back at these images and reflecting on the past.

The in-depth interviews in the special features are incredible. Especially the one with Tinker Hatfield.",1153785600,11,1935,4.337016574585635
