2869519,5,B000RMJ4DK,"I have a couple of DVDs that deals with Princess Diana, I have to say this one gives her justice as to who she is! The acting is great and tells how her last days were and the great person she was! The only downfall of the DVD is the details said its 120 minutes and fullscreen, but its only 90 minutes and widescreen, at least the one I have is! I highly recommend this one because it shows how she felt and what she went through the last few moments of her life!",1222646400,5,464,3.9468085106382977
2869520,5,B000RMJ4DK,"I had originally watched this movie on TV in 2007.  Watching it again in my own home brought back memories and contemplation on what happened.  This movie combined actors and news footage to show hw Diana reached the emotional state she ws in at the time of her death.  From everything I've read & heard, even the recent UK inquest, I think that this movie pretty well portrayed Diana's last month of life, focusing on those last days.  I would recommend it to any Diana fan.  The movie did not go past the accident, and that was inferred rather than shown.  I think that this was a good move. I also think that it would be interesting to pair this with the movie, ""The Queen"".  Very professionally and thoughtfully done.  I highly recommend it.",1210550400,18,745,4.507462686567164
2869521,4,B000RMJ4DK,"finally, a diana movie done somewhat right. They actually had a good actress to portray diana. very haunting actually because her characteristics in the movie were just like Diana. I wish the movie kept going without the documentary style but overall the movie is pretty good and gives you a sense of the last day.",1196121600,7,314,4.7272727272727275
2869522,5,B000RMJ4DK,"Hi, i love this dvd. What happened to Mr. fayed,s children? He told Diana at the ballet that his children are closer in age to Diaan,s two boys. Where was Mr. Fayed,s wife? It seems to me that those 2 men rather watch diana in bathing suit than showing his wife and kids. When dodi showed showed Diana his apt. in Paris, Where was dodi,s butler and his big, black dog. If you read the book by Dodi,s butler Renee, The book states that when Diana sat down on Dodi,s sofa, his dog ran to and jumped on Diana,s lap. This movie didn,t even show much of William and Harry. I wanted to see Willaim and Harry ride the ride the speed boat. I just love Willliam and Harry. This movie is good and I am glad I have it. maureen",1190764800,7,715,4.078014184397163
2869523,5,B000RMJ4DK,"I highly recommend this docu-drama to anyone who is even remotely interested in the late Diana, Princess of Wales.  I've read over 20 biographies about Diana (carefully avoiding what I'd consider to be the really gossipy renditions of her life) and I feel this DVD accurately portrays the characters and events that finally led to the tragedy in an objective, unbiased manner.  I really enjoyed all of the actors' potrayals, but I especially liked the way the actor who portrayed Mohammed Al Fayed played his part.  He did it beautifully, just as I have imagined this colorful character to be.",1187568000,32,593,4.91
2869524,4,B000RMJ4DK,"My heart stopped when I first saw/heard the commercial for this movie - the commercial aired constantly on The Learning Channel, Animal Planet, Discovery. (The song in the commercial was, I later found out, a haunting cover of Bowie's ""Modern Love"" by a female voiced band called The Last Town Chorus, which is causing a stir...superb song/album!). Soon after, a colleague who had an advance copy invited me over for a screening - the movie was curiosity-piquing, a bit uneven in production value, but with enough grit to hold one's interest. Worth seeing. Wish the DVD extras included the commercials!",1186358400,16,602,5.03
8201381,5,B000RMJ4DK,"With interviews, actual footage, and reenactments this feels like an all-inclusive look into the final weeks of Diana's life with the Al Fayed family on their boat. With two sleep deprived body guards they make their way to Paris and Dodi comes up with what turns out to be a bad plan. what a sad absolute mess for a result. To see this causes the viewer to feel like they know just about everything that happened during those days. Engaging.",1504569600,,442,4.5375

Very sad, but reflective in her memories as she is extremely missed around the globe still today.",1353888000,,253,5.023809523809524
