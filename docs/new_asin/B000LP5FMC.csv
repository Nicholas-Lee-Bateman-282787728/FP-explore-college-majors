8162608,3,B000LP5FMC,"I really liked the aesthetic of this doc made in ""Forbidden Fiji"", as the title says- everything looked great, from the people to the island to the culture to (most importantly) the waves. However, I would have liked to see less of the Irons brothers and maybe a couple more soul surfers. Fun seeing cute little Alex Gray in there though, back when he was a kid! I was way more intrigued by the movie on a surface level when I bought it, and after actually viewing, it wasn't all it cracked up to be, just overall a less interesting documentary. It was nice that Keala Kennelly got a cameo, too- I am all for any movie that reps a good female surfer!",1282003200,2,650,4.2926829268292686
