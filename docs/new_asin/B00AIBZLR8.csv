5426574,5,B00AIBZLR8,"And the previous four reviews are all ""spoilers"" that tell too much. Describe too much. How can you ""review"" a tree or a bright stone or any Object except by describing it? Michael Haneke has objectified the Amour of two senescent lovers beyond the point of empathy. He's reduced the viewer - me at least - to an objective observer of something of beauty and of hideousness. Neither of the old lovers wants your pity or help, or any invasive sympathy; that's the 'operating theme' of the film and Michael Haneke clearly doesn't intend to allow YOUR vicarious grief to overwhelm HIS objectivity.

But if you don't object to my objective analysis of Haneke's object in making such a film ...
""Age is embarrassing. Dying is shameful. Death is humiliating while it happens, then no longer.""
If that message is too harsh for you, you'd best not see Amour.

I suppose, however, that I can get away with saying that the performances by Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant, as the ancient lovers, are astonishingly convincing. If Riva isn't given the Oscar for ""Best Actress"" then the whole Oscar business is merely a beauty pageant.",1358121600,15,1132,4.829896907216495
5426575,5,B00AIBZLR8,"note: Emmanuelle Riva was nominated for the Oscar shortly after I wrote this review.  She is the female lead, pictured, and as a young woman was the lead in HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR, a foreign film classic.

I can't say this depressed me.  However, I must warn you that this may happen to a viewer.  This is not an easy film to watch. It involves a married couple in old age.  She has a stroke which is very disabling. She lives at home with him and he tries to handle it.  But she keeps getting worse.  This movie is about the end for them.  They are a couple who have been in love their whole lives.  They had a complete life together.  They have a grown daughter. You see early pictures of them and they were beautiful.  Plus we know they are talented and affluent.  All of that makes no difference when old age and last illnesses set in. It is a long spiral down and as the husband says to the daughter,""it is very bad, it will only get worse and then it will be over.""  that is the film.

I have been through this with various family members who lived into their eighties and nineties and then got strokes and alzheimer's. watching this is hell.  but his love for her is complete as she begins and progresses along the descent.

I frankly found it very engrossing and the acting is out of this world.  These do not even seem like actors it is so life like.

5426576,4,B00AIBZLR8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 I didn't like Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon' as it was a fable that had little basis in reality. Haneke is on much more solid ground with 'Amour' as the story is based on experiences Haneke observed with one of his own relatives. A story such as 'Amour', which involves the deterioration of a stroke victim and her husband's valiant efforts to care for her, becomes problematic when true-life events are reproduced almost verbatim. Fortunately, Haneke mixes things up enough to keep our interest, and then throws in a twist ending of sorts, which will come as a surprise to most viewers, who likely won't be expecting such a turn of events.

The stroke victim in question is Anne, who lives with her husband, Georges, both retired music teachers. When Anne blacks out at the breakfast table one morning, Georges knows something is wrong but Anne doesn't seem to have any memory of the incident. It turns out she has a blocked carotid artery but after undergoing surgery, Anne ends up paralyzed on one side.

The first half of 'Amour' involves Georges' efforts to help Anne with her rehabilitation. He holds her up out of her wheelchair and she takes feeble steps, using her one good leg, and dragging the other. Eventually, Anne has another stroke, which reduces her to a child-like state; often, she talks in gibberish. Georges becomes more frustrated as there are moments when Anne refuses to swallow the soft food Georges is trying to spoon feed her.

Outside visitors occasionally impinge on Anne and Georges' depressing world. Early on, before the second stroke, one of Anne's students, a well-known classical pianist pays a visit and asks Anne what happened to her. She understandably doesn't want to discuss her situation, merely stating that her condition is a result of 'old age'. Later, Anne and Georges' daughter, Eva, pays a visit, and argues with her father, recommending that she put Anne in a home. Georges' reacts angrily and considers Eva's suggestion callous. It eventually comes out that the relationship between daughter and parents is not good, primarily due to her British-born husband, who apparently the parents did not care for too much.

After Georges decides to hire a second nurse, he discovers that this particular woman has been mistreating Anne (in a particularly upsetting scene, the nurse pulls Anne by the hair, lifting her face to a mirror and mocks her to the effect, 'don't you want to see your pretty face'?). Georges fires the nurse but she indignantly claims that she's never had a problem before with any of her employers and rudely curses the old man, before leaving.

It's interesting that the family doctor is never seen during the entire film. The visitors to the apartment, however, serve to break up the monotony of Anne's deterioration, not only for Georges but for the audience as well. While Haneke has managed to hold our interest until the second act crisis, he's treading in dangerous waters, as it's at this point in the film when the audience's patience is tested. Just how much more of this chronicle of Anne's downward spiral, can anyone take?

SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A TWIST ENDING!

'Amour' suddenly morphs into a crime drama of sorts when the caring Georges, suddenly decides he can't take it anymore, and smothers Anne with a pillow. He prepares the body so that when the police finally arrive, Anne appears in a dignified state. He also seals the door with masking tape, presumably to prevent the foul odor from permeating the apartment. Then Georges pens a final note and while it's not entirely clear, it appears he commits suicide, to join his wife in death. Right before the note, Georges captures a pigeon that has flown into the apartment, but lets it go, perhaps symbolizing that he finally has let Anne go, by effecting the mercy killing.

If you've ever read any newspaper articles about mercy killings, where the spouse who does the killing, ends up committing suicide, 'Amour' pretty much explains why these things go on. The mercy killing also provides food for thought by bringing up the issue of keeping a comatose patient alive while in a vegetative or extremely debilitated state. It's easy to take a 'holier than thou' attitude, but when you're in a situation like Georges, do you completely condemn him for 'snapping'? And would you have been so self-sacrificing for a family member as he was? Many of us would probably have went along with the daughter's advice to place the debilitated relative in a home, thus leaving the care to others, who might have ended up as caring as the second nurse, who Georges was forced to fire.

Veteran actors Emmanuelle Riva as Anne and Jean-Louis Trintignant, are excellent as the tragic couple. I understand that Trintignant came out of retirement, to play this role (he hadn't been in a film for 14 years). 'Amour' is not an easy film to watch but it's important to remind people that illness in old age is a reality and it could happen to anybody. With its jarring ending, Haneke has managed to raise this documentary-like feature to the higher realm of true art.",1357430400,9,5179,4.834085778781039
5426577,5,B00AIBZLR8,"""Amour"" opens with the police discovery of the decomposed body of an elderly French woman in her bed, surrounded by flower petals.  We then get a brief flashback to the life of a cultured, sophisticated French couple, enjoying their golden years - an evening at a concert, stimulating conversation - before she suffers a stroke.

When Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) returns home from the hospital, wheelchair-bound but mentally intact, she makes her husband, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), promise to never send her back.  She says there is no reason to go on living in her current state, and she does not want to be a burden on Georges.  His attentiveness and solicitousness, while necessary, rankle her.  A second stroke leaves Anne in much worse shape, both physically and mentally.  His vow to her leaves him almost as trapped as she is, while she sinks deeper into depression and despair over her body's betrayal.

Viewers, particularly those who have experienced the heartbreak of caretaking for a loved one, will have reactions just as disparate as those expressed by the couple's family, friends, and caretakers.  Some will feel admiration for a husband's unwavering dedication to his wife. Others will feel frustration at his refusal to break a promise that has caused his life to be condemned to one in which he must stand by and watch as his wife deteriorates and slowly dies.  Everyone will pity the formerly vibrant woman who makes clear that she does not want to live in her bed-ridden, helpless condition, no longer able to communicate.

There's not a moment of levity in ""Amour.""  But there are two exceptional performances by Riva and Trintignant in a film that takes place almost entirely in the confines of their apartment.  This couple's experience is unfortunately not uncommon, but that does not make it any less devastating to watch.",1357257600,68,1851,5.0130718954248366
5426578,5,B00AIBZLR8,"AMOUR is one of those films that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.  The plot is straightforward: an elderly man looks after his wife after a stroke and finds that he just cannot cope. Director Michael Haneke constructs the film as a character-study of old age; looking at how people of that vintage think in a different way, as opposed to their offspring. Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) decides at the end of her life to check out; her husband (Jean-Louis Tritingnant, in a memorable performance) tries in vain to keep her alive. For anyone who had had the experience of being a carer, the film has painful resonances.  Director Michael Haneke's filming is just brilliant; the use of long takes, wordless sequences (in which the only sounds we hear are the creak of floorboards, or the flapping of bird-wings) sums up the elderly couple's lives. The film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival; it is easily the best I've seen in 2012.",1357084800,123,945,4.652694610778443

5426645,2,B00AIBZLR8,"My roommate had dementia.  Although he was diagnosed with it several years prior, it didn't hit with a vengeance until about a month before he passed away in the hospital.  However, through it all, he always knew who I was.  I watched this movie at a friend's house.  It did not explore any territory that I hadn't already known.  At about two hours, this film takes an incredibly long time to tell a fairly predictable story, detailing the wife's slow progress on her path to death.  As a one hour documentary, had they not been actors, it might have proved insightful, but at two hours, it's incredibly painful to sit through and watch.  It's a talented director and screen writer who can keep up the interest in a story which basically takes place in about three rooms of an apartment in Paris, unfortunately that is not the case here.

5426755,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Amour is a true love story of a couple who have been together for years and the effect of one of them falling ill in their old age and the suffering that their partner copes with in managing them: the level to which the one goes in meeting their loved ones needs. This subject is personal to Hanneke, as he was brought up by an auntie, who tried to commit suicide, and he found her in time, but when he went away she was able to succeed. The apartment of the couple was made in the studio and is based on his own parents home interior. This made the story personal to Hanneke. Hanneke builds the film around Jean-Louis Trintingnant ,the central actor, for the richness of his voice and the look in his eyes,  being the carer. He also, after casting, thought EmmanuelleRiva( Hiroshima Mon Amour) was the best person to play the sufferer, having worshipped her as an actress in his youth. Also Isabelle Huppert who acted in The Piano Teacher acts as their daughter. Although Hanneke seems to be softening, theres not a trace of sentimentalism, and he demands the utmost from his actors. The film opens with an ominous flashforward, all that follows a foregone conclusion.

Music is in the background of this film as both had been former music teachers. They are shown at the beginning going to a music concert given by one of their students. They sometimes play the piano in their apartment or listen to a CD. The sitting room of their Paris apartment is handsomely furnished, full of shelves of books and sheet music. They are a cultured couple who discuss biographies and the arts. Very early on you have George and Anne discover someones tried to break into their apartment. This sets up the idea of death or chaos entering their abode and foretells of her stroke. Hanneke is meticulous in his planning,choosing not only good actors but the right actors for the part and the same set of technicians hes worked with before. Haneke has Georges recounting of his experiences of his childhood, of summer camp and a funeral he attends ,all drawn from Hannekes own experiences. He gets his actors to embody the characters they're playing rather than acting a role. Annes condition worsens and Georges loyalty to his wife is unshakeable, as she loses control of her limbs,bladder and voice. She becomes a shell of herself but is not dementing. She refuses at times to eat and drink. As frail as George is, he shows endless patience and grace. Shes made him promise not to take her into hospital.

There is a clever use of mirrors, doorframes,long,empty corridors,a recreation of bourgeois interiors, a series of landscape paintings to open up this space to the outside world, and also the symbolic use of pauses and rhythms to shape the film as if its a piece of music. George has to deal with abrupt carers and a pigeon that enters the apartment from an open window. This film is compassionate, powerful and intelligent, getting very close to life in all its contradictory complexity. There is a true belief in humanity, who digs down in his intimate scenes to a core.",1430265600,,3063,4.658040665434381

5426758,4,B00AIBZLR8,"I usually like award-winning movies, but ""Amour"" is more the one to admire than to like. The more emphatic and insightful its viewer is, the less easier it is to watch (Though as such, it's a far less controversial staple than other acclaimed pictures of Austrian director Michael Haneke - ""White Ribbon"" and especially ""The Piano Teacher"".) The film relates a story of an elderly couple, whose life is terminally affected by a crippling mental disease befalling the wife Anne, expertly played by Emmanuelle Riva. Her husband, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, does his best to cope... For all of its neutral, unemotional storytelling, the movie makes the viewer think about ""ungratefulness"" of life in a sad (but frequent) situation, when a person, once an art-loving intellectual and multi-faceted personality, gradually slips into existence of a ""human  being"" unable to communicate all but basic feelings and needs. Despite that, the film retains a degree of elegance, conveyed mostly by classical piano music, Deliberately simple and straighforward, the movie's impact is enhanced by spare style, showing the irreplaceable purpose of love in human lives despite its insurmountable obstacles.",1426204800,,1196,5.43010752688172

I just felt like I was really truly living this tale and I'm only 32 and white-trash American. But I felt like I was these people. I wanted so many things to change for them, I wanted them to break this and make it all better. I wanted to know these people. The daughter in this film shows up in one of the best scenes I've ever seen. The direction is just classic.
There are so many moments in this film where I felt like crying but it wasn't cheesy or anything. One thing that really bothers me about this movie is all the attention that Emmanuelle Riva got for Best Actress. Yes, she does a fine job of ""disappearing"" into her debilitated state... but the HUSBAND WAS AMAZING???? Why wasn't he nominated for everything? `Amour' is one of those movies that you don't really love watching but you need to see it. It made me reconsider my life, it made me scared of the future and it really made me see the value in human earthly love. I sound sarcastic about it but I'm being genuine.

This is the story of how it really is when one partner must watch helplessly as the other suffers and loses themselves piece by piece.  Unflinchingly, the film documents this couple's descent into hell as the once-lovely wife slowly becomes a babbling invalid and the  husband uses every last ounce of his strength and humanity to spare her the indignity of institutionalization. To do so, he struggles with the curiosity of ""friends"", the useless criticisms of their daughter, the callousness of caregivers and his own increasing infirmity and exhaustion.  There is a scene where the husband attempts to force his wife to drink water, and becomes so frustrated at her refusal that he slaps her.  We and he are shocked at this terrible turning point.

The concept, I suppose, is to show the true ""amour"" of an elderly man who takes care of his wife after she's had a series of strokes.  However there is nothing to make this a good film...there is no arc of action, no characters change or grow...there is only unrelieved, tedious, depressing misery;  I've seen old people get sick and die and they did it with true love...which raised the process out of horror into something beautiful.  This is not realistic, not inspiring, and certainly not entertaining.  I finally figured out a tolerable way to finish it...by pushing the fast forward button.

5426896,5,B00AIBZLR8,"This was just a wonderful film.  It reminded me of how poor American filmmaking has become.  Some movies are uncomfortable to watch because of the subject matter and this could have been one of them, but Amour was just superb.",1395014400,,226,4.625
5426897,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Most movies portray love at a time when the participants are young, healthy, physically attractive and just starting out in life, filled with promise and hope for the future. Rare indeed is the movie that focuses on love at the point when the participants are old, sick, frail, and keenly aware of their own mortality. And does love take the same form in those distinctly different periods in life or does it evolve into something new, and perhaps richer, over time?

In Michael Haneke's ""Amour,"" two icons of French cinema - Emmanuelle Riva (""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"") and Jean-Louis Trintignant (""A Man and a Woman,"" ""The Conformist"") - portray Georges and Anne Laurent, two octogenarians who have been married for so long they probably can't remember a time before they were a couple. When Anne's health begins to decline rapidly due to a series of strokes, Georges assumes the role of full-time caregiver. Like all of us facing this situation, Georges is confronted with the dilemma of keeping Anne at home where she can be cared for by the man who loves her, or of placing her in an unfamiliar facility where she could be looked after by professional caregivers who would, however, be strangers. Georges chooses the former, despite the tremendous physical and emotional burden it places on him. This is clearly a couple who takes their ""for better or for worse...in sickness and in healthtill death do us part"" wedding vows to heart. We aren't made privy to the kinds of trials Georges and Anne's love has had to endure over the years for them to have arrived at this point. But something has held them together all this time, and we sense that their life experiences and their commitment to one another have prepared them for this final challenge. Anne's illness becomes the crucible in which all lingering impurities will be burned away and out of which their love will emerge as solid and unbreakable. For only in times of utmost suffering and pain can love be manifested in its truest and purest form. And that is the message of Georges and Anne's story: true love is the ultimate act of selfless giving.

The stars certainly understand this. Now in their 80s, with all traces of youthful vanity long gone from the scene, Riva and Trintignant together deliver an utterly raw and fearless portrayal of the debilitating effect aging can have on the mind, body and soul. How Riva lost the Best Actress Oscar that year is beyond mortal comprehension (like the good Lord, the Academy often truly does work in mysterious ways). Without a hint of histrionics, Riva turns suffering into a palpable thing, and Trintignant, who was not even nominated in the Best Actor category, is no less astonishing. In many ways, because his is the less showy role, he may actually have the more difficult acting challenge here. Either way, you really won't find better performances anywhere than you'll find in ""Amour.""

Because he knows he can rely on Riva and Trintignant to convey the beating heart of the story, Haneke has the good sense to make his presence as unobtrusive as possible, using long takes, stationary camera-work and a scoreless soundtrack to bring out the actors' work. He allows the scenes to play themselves out with minimal interference from anyone or anything that might distract from the performances (Isabel Huppert has a small but crucial role as the couple's daughter).

It would be foolish to deny that ""Amour"" is a difficult film to sit through, that it is spare and unflinching and pulls no punches when it comes to portraying the ravages and sufferings of illness and old age. Haneke is relentless in making us stare directly into the ugly face of all that this couple is going through, to the point where even the audience can come to feel as trapped in the situation as Georges is in the apartment and Anne is in the body that has become her prison. Yet, that doesn't make ""Amour"" an experience we should shy away from. On the contrary, we should embrace it, for ""Amour"" never lies to us about the subject it has bravely chosen to explore. It assumes we are grown up enough to face the harsh realities of what it is showing us, and it is that respect for the audience that motivates us to respond in kind.

There's an amazing scene in which Anne flips through a photo album of the couple's life together, and it is filled with pictures of Riva and Trintignant as we all remember them - when they were young, beautiful and full of life. It's a poignant reminder of not only how much they - and we - have changed over the years, but of what a special treat it is to be able to see them still acting at this late time in their lives, and still at the peak of their power. So many stars seem to fade from the scene long before their actual deaths, only to become a small news item or a blurb tucked away on an obituary page when death finally comes for them, often prompting us to exclaim, ""Oh, I didn't even realize that so-and-so was still around"" and to wonder what their lives were like in the interim between their deaths and the last time we recall seeing them. For more than any other reason, ""Amour"" is an invaluable treasure because it allows us to be a part of these two beloved actors' lives almost to the very end.",1394928000,,5240,4.63010752688172

The same type of acting and direction happens with ""Amour"". This movie is the accumulation of daily facts, the collection of memories, the things that make us what we are.

These things turn to nothing for our female lead, leaving our male lead to carry on alone. A movie that talks simply with the power to destroy with it's accumulated force, don't give up on this movie too early. Let it tell you what it has to say over it's very human scale.

5426963,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Nobody said it is easy to watch the elderly age and fade away.  And, with this French film, you will experience the uneasiness and anguish to watch a man lose his beloved wife.  This is not about the hospital and other illness one  experiences at this stage of life.  It is about the love, emotion, feeling, exasperation of caring and watching your love one fade away, to succumb deeper to that eternal place, that one deems better.

Georges and Anne, in their 80s are retired music teachers.  The movie starts out slow, and one might believe it is too slow-paced.  But, have patience, it takes a while for the substance and emotion to seep through.  You see the sign of despair, as Georges notices Anne has changed as the behavior results from two strokes.  Then, she is in a wheelchair.

Acting is superb by characters Georges, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anne, Emmanuelle Riva.  You don't see them in a role, you see the human side of pain both are experiencing.  Georges' pain and confusion is so visible in the eyes.  While Emmanuelle Riva is superb as the bedridden dying woman.  It is no wonder this film won Best Foreign Film Language Film  in 2012.

5427111,5,B00AIBZLR8,"When the end credits started rolling, it hit me that those responsible for the making of this film -- the cast, the crew, etc -- are so astonishingly smart and intelligent. The decisions that they made about the way the film ended was nothing short of genius.

I'm not going to go into how the acting was great; which it was, or how the writer and director (same person) was excellent; which he was, but just that this is an important film that needs to be watched.

In this day and age when most films are escapism adventures that scare us, make us laugh or take us on journeys into the unknown, this film is in a genre by and of itself. It has elements which can be extremely familiar yet, at the same time, they can also seem very strange.

Is this a perfect film? Probably not. Some have criticized how, at times, death and humanity seem distant and inhumane in the way the director presents some scenes. Others have not been fond of the pacing of the film, and have wished for it to have moved faster.

So why is this an important film? Because life, love, old age, family and death are all issues that are universal and very much a part of each one of us. If love, old age, or death haven't found a way into your life just yet, I'm certain that they will. Despite it's imperfections, this still is an important film which may give us a fresh idea or teach us something new about those fundamentally important concepts of life, love, death, etc.

And any film that teaches me something new about those fundamentals is an important film to me. This film, of course, does that and more. 5 stars out of 5.",1383350400,,1607,4.325581395348837

Especially one paced like this. Once again, I got tricked by critics into believing the hype.

""Amour"" confronts us with the ugliness and beauty of love at the end of life. There is no escape, but there are choices, many of which are between the lesser of two evils. And sometimes, there is no choice at all. Hoping and wishing are portrayed as illusions of youth. Even the slow pace of this movie drives home the message: Saying ""get on with it"" plays into the director's hands: Get on with what? To what conclusion?

An elegant film about an elegant couple at the end of their elegant duet. Tears don't suffice.

The love and loyality of this highly intelligent couple facing the cruelty of crippling illness and the hopeless of the struggle is deeply disturbing. The problem of dying is humbling and cruel. What choices do we have if we want to maintain our dignity up until the bitter end? 'Love' confronts this problem with unblinking honesty. I can not say I 'enjoyed' this movie. It was hard and painful to watch. I can say 'Love' haunts me on a very deep level. I think it always will.",1378684800,2,639,4.7657657657657655
5427256,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Some people watch movies to escape from real life. Some watch in order to live vicariously. Some people want movies to confirm their ideas about love, good triumphing over evil, and all the rest of the clichs we're subjected to when we're children.

And some people watch movies because they appreciate, even though it is a rare thing, a tale told truthfully without varnish, deception, or avoidance.

Amour falls squarely into the latter category of marvels. Other reviewers have summarized the plot. It is enough to say that this is a deeply engrossing movie precisely because it deals with something we all must face eventually: our final moments. People always hope they will die ""a good death"" - the Hollywood fantasy of a painless exit surrounded by one's family and friends, with suitable theme music playing in the background and a magical fairyland waiting in the sky as the credits roll. In reality most people die in hospital beds, alone and afraid and confused, with tubes sticking into them and bedsores festering and indifferent exhausted nurses passing heedless as a desperate effort is made to inhale one very last breath...

Amour unflinchingly observes the complexities of the end of life. There's no Hollywood pap about ""triumphing over adversity"" or making light of infirmity by turning it into a character tic. This is a deeply moving, painful, and utterly true account of one particular couple's way of dealing with the awful inexorable truth of the descent into nothingness and how horrible it is.

You won't be uplifted by this movie. The makers of this film weren't anxious about focus group feedback, ensuring sufficient feel-good moments, and a ""cathartic but uplifting"" end. Instead they made a real, honest, and true account of the end of life. It's absolutely marvelous. The acting is superb, the direction restrained and poised, and everything is under-stated. If you enjoyed movies like House of Sand and Fog or Das Leben der Anderen, you'll appreciate this wonderful offering.

Superbly acted and directed, with a minimum of sensationalism, the movie plays through the dark ending of the lifelong relationship between an artistic, educated, and eternally-loving and caring couple. Following a series of strokes which progressively degrade the cognitive abilities of the wife, the husband stoically struggles to maintain his wife's quality of life and dignity as she increasingly makes her alternative wishes clear. The ending comes suddenly and shockingly, but it leaves one with the question, what would you do in this situation....what could you endure?

You're right in the middle of things with this couple and just like them, you aren't able to speed through the agonizing fall from health and vitality to dependency and misery. The stark contrast in editing styles compared to many modern American films was honestly like a blast of freezing water. This film is truly created by the directing and actors living and breathing their characters; creating moments and beats out of their performances and not out of the cuts or camera angles.

Viewers are taken through a series of painfully slow scenes designed to continue this impression.

By the final scene, the film is carefully crafted to leave viewers feeling as depressed and dark as the message of the film itself.

5427387,1,B00AIBZLR8,"OK. I know everyone loved Amour. I'd put off watching it until last week because I didn't want to see Jean Louis Trintignant at 82 rather than his lovely 36 years in A Man and A Woman. I streamed Amour via Amazon and then had to rewatch the Man&Woman race scenes to clear my head.
  All that aside, I have to say I hated Amour for reasons far more important than the loss of physical beauty. It was boring. Interminable. I mean, this is a story about an intelligent woman, a strong woman, a determined woman. And yet, what does she do when, at the advanced age of 82 she has a stroke and begins the long final slide into incontinence and incompetence? She just slides. Did she think she would never die? Or that she would be hit by a bus and that would be that? It appears she did not think at all. And once she has the first warning stroke, does she order in a bottle of Seconal and fifth of gin? No. She does nothing but show some irritation at her increasing limitations.

  And meanwhile, the ancient husband Jean Louis is rushing around preparing meals and changing her nappies and protecting her from all outside their closely held world. Claustrophobia anyone? This thing grinds on for over 2 hours. I've read many who say it was beautiful. What was beautiful about it?

  My suggestions for a remake: 1. Cut it to 90 minutes. 2. Give the first hour over to a celebration of their life together, show fabulous music, and parties, and friends. Show joy and devotion. 3. With 30 minutes to go, she has the stroke. Goes to the hospital. Learns the procedure for repair failed. Knows she's on her way out. 4. Finally, for the last ten minutes, we see her still able to mix a drink (the above mentioned combo)and she wheels herself into the grand living room full of friends. Her pupils play the piano for her. She sips her cocktail and, smiling, closes her eyes. No one notices she's gone but the camera.",1377648000,8,1907,4.3977272727272725

I have personally witnessed a loved one die under similar circumstances, so the film and the acting and the characters were real to me -- too real for comfort, if anyone dare use a word like ""comfort"" in describing anything about this film. The portrayals were immediate and graphic. The action was deadly slow as would be the actual encounter with life and the immensely slow dying. The struggles of life and what lies ahead for all of us are unknown eventualities, but better to feel than to deny.

It's a lovely relationship, but doesn't really show the power of their love, which, after all, is right there in the title. Emmanuelle Riva won awards for her performance, probably because she's old, has a fairly good body of film performances, was nude at 86 and puked on herself. Jean-Louis Trintignant has even a more impressive film resume (at least in the US), and carried the entire film. Everything was from his viewpoint. He was wonderful, but not recognized by any critics' groups, even a nomination!

You would think a film about old piano teachers would have some music, but there was none besides some lovely Schubert moments. Isabelle Huppert, the gorgeous sex siren of yore (Death Becomes Her) is very fine as the concerned daughter.

Certainly, the husband's descent into madness, as Haneke interprets, wasn't as complete as it might've been. His final decision didn't make a lot of sense.

5427395,5,B00AIBZLR8,"CAUTION: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW

Although I am only 65 years old, most of the people I was close to as a child have died in the past four years, including my closest first cousin (only a month older than me), both of my parents, and my mother's two sisters, who were like auxiliary mothers. We were a very close extended family, all living within two miles of each other until I left home at 18. With the exception of my father, all of those people died in much the same way as Anne did in this movie, but in a much more nightmarish setting, in hospitals and hospices rather than at home, and with an extra kick of morphine at the end instead of a pillow.

But dying for all of them was ugly, protracted and humiliating, no less awful than it was for Anne... and FAR more expensive. The worst was my mother, who had Alzheimer's for 21 years before she died and went through for all those years what Anne went through in the few weeks or months this movie covers (note that the season doesn't change). If my father and others had not spoon-fed her (exactly as Georges did with Anne) every meal every day for the last fifteen years of her life, she would have died much sooner and much more humanely.

The effect of all that horror on me was to make me determined that I was NOT going to end my life that way. I'll spare you some of the tiresome details and just say that I did everything I could to prevent it, including a health care proxy, a living will, a very restrictive MOLST form (a wonderful, sort of expanded ""Do Not Resuscitate"" form available to New York State residents - a legal document which specifies what kinds of treatment medical professionals are legally allowed to give me) and making clear to my remaining relatives and friends that I did not want to be resuscitated or ever receive any kind of life-extending treatment, but be allowed to die as quickly and as naturally as possible.

I got DNR bracelets, lanyard things so I can wear my MOLST around my neck 24 hours, in case I collapse in a supermarket or somewhere, and a bunch of other crap. I got pretty paranoid about being kept alive after my body wears out, which is the norm in today's world. I've had a wonderful life, but I have no desire at all to extend it. Sixty-five years is plenty.

Despite all my efforts to ward off the kind of death I saw around me and later in this movie, I never could relax and quit fretting about it. I was just sure something would get screwed up and I'd end up just like all the rest, lying mindless and helpless in diapers in some motorized bed with tubes stuck in me everywhere and people all around trying to keep me alive until they got tired of it and upped the morphine. What this marvelous movie did is take away that anxiety. I don't know how, exactly, but it did it.

After seeing what happened to Anne in this movie, and through that remembering in a different way what it was like for my relatives, I realized that I'm okay with it now. It's okay now if I DO end up like that - because, even if it lasts for decades as it did with Mama, eventually it'll be over, and that's all that really matters.

If it takes me ten seconds to die or twenty years to die, I'll still die, and nothing can prevent it. That is profoundly comforting to me, and it allows me to scrap the MOLST and all the other voodoo fetishes I had gathered around me and relax. I have no idea how watching this movie gave me this totally unexpected freedom, but I have no doubt that it did.

As he slowly began to die, my husband felt love for him for the first time in his life.  And he felt love in return.  How different that all could have been if we would not have had those few last agonizing days.

5427443,4,B00AIBZLR8,"A white, well to do, French couple, now in their 80's confronts the final chapter of life in their lavish Paris flat. I am told they love each other terribly. But I am not shown that. Routine has taken ahold. The aging process has been registered by both of them. Each submitting to it in their own ways. Cherished piano teachers by profession, having delivered the next generation of performing stars, we witness her in flashbacks, emanating rigid coldness. Rather than being a study of old age and mortality, therefore, Amour is a portrait of sheltered privilege being pulled out of its impermanent shell and confronted with bodily break down, the ultimate imperfection. Unacceptable to both, the inevitable end of life is undermined by a final act of defiance.

Love might exist between them, though it could be just as well residual co-dependence. Love is not what makes their post middle aged daughter show her face a few times. There is concern on her part, that fades a bit too quickly, whenever the words money or house are uttered by her dying mother. A grandson exists, we are told. But love does not motivate him to appear once either. Committed, therefore, predominantly to each other, I lacked to notice loving interactions, or past traces of it. Devoted, loving couples, sadly can witness each others break down and die at any age. That is not what this film is about, in my opinion.

Haneke reverses statistics, by letting him survive her. It had to be that way, for having her kill him and then ending her life could have seemed implausible. This is not a film tackling euthanasia either. Love is many things. Perfectionism is certainly not one of them.  Having witnessed each other for most of their lives, the final chapter, the one where all facades come to an end, is not appreciated. Mirroring such decay horrifies these two perfectionists. Perhaps he had to end her suffering, or perhaps he simply could not endure having her foreshadow what might lie in store in his near future. Ending both their lives before total failure sets in, therefore, poses as last attempt to preserve access to privileges of power and control these two perfectionists seemingly have enjoyed all their lives.

Haneke gave The White Ribbon that title to point to cruelty and hypocrisy. Perhaps, naming it Amour, should be understood in that same vein.",1377129600,,2350,4.838308457711443
5427444,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Michael Haneke wrote and directed this extraordinary film that so sensitively explores the soul and meaning of love, and his formidable talent executes the physical and emotional demand it requires to be told effectively and correctly. This is a film of quiet sophistication and respect and will likely stand as one of the greatest love stories ever placed before the public in a film.

Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a couple of retired music teachers enjoying life in their eighties, attending concerts where Anne's pupil Alexandre (Alexandre Tharaud) is performing the Schubert Impromptus. In their comfortable home they enjoy each other's sensitivity and pleasures, but one morning at breakfast Anne suffers a TIA from which she seems to recover rather quickly. The moments of Anne's silence and lack of response trigger a sense of panic in Georges, and despite the fact that she recovers, he takes her to the hospital.  Anne undergoes a carotid endarterectomy but the surgical result is a failure (she is one of the 5% of failure rates). Returning home with a right hemiparalysis begins Anne's harrowingly steep physical and mental decline as Georges attempts to care for her at home as she wishes. Even as the fruits of their lives and career remain bright, the couple's hopes for some dignity prove a dispiriting struggle even as their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert), also a musician, enters the conflict. In the end, George, with his love fighting against his own weariness and diminished future on top of Anne's, is driven to make some critical decisions for them both. The couple's bond of love is severely tested but then breathtaking conclusion radiates the power and durability of true love.

Both Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva offer impeccable performances, and Isabelle Huppert adds a superlative supporting role as the daughter who does not seem to fathom her parents' love. The musical score is devoted to Schubert's Impromptus Nos. 1 and 3 and Moment musical No. 3, Beethoven's opus 126 Bagatelle No. 2 and opus 33 Bagatelles Nos. 2 and 4 and the Bach-Busoni Prelude Chorale `Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ'  - performed by pianist Alexandre Tharaud who also plays himself in the film as Anne's pupil. Every aspect of this film is treasureable. It is one of the most beautiful films of the time. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 13",1377129600,4,2404,5.078481012658228
5427445,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Occasionally, filmmakers break through with something deeper. Harold and Maude, Going in Style, Venus, and Beginners are all lovely films that offer insights about aging. But they are primarily about making the best out of what time is left. Even Sarah Polley's Away from Her, which finds some solace in the midst of Alzheimer's Disease is a walk in the park next to Michael Haneke's masterful Amour which sets the conversation about aging, quality of life, and death solidly in the confines of marriage and the limitations of human endurance.

Winner of the Cannes Film Festival 2012 Palme D'or, Amour has been called a radical departure for the Austrian director who is bets known for controversial works like Funny Games but Amour signals itself as a Haneke film from the first few moments. A fire brigade breaks into an apartment to investigate a suspicious odor. They find a grim tableau over which Haneke superimposes the title of his film. The words disturbing, incongruous, will immediately leap to many viewers minds. Especially after they encounter the subject of the tableau in the next scene enjoying a concert with a loved one, enjoying a backstage meeting with the artist, and quietly riding the train home as the concert music continues to sound mellifluously on the soundtrack. It is only the beginning of the constant series of conscious juxtapositions that Haneke creates to illustrate the paradox of love.

Georges and Anne, two elderly, retired music teachers arrive home to find a locked door that someone has tried to pry open during an attempted break-in. Unsettled they still simply go to bed, deciding to work on the problem after a good night's sleep. But what awaits them is unlike any other day they have experience in their many years of wedded bliss. As Georges speaks to Anne over breakfast she suddenly stares off into space, unresponsive. Despite his efforts to gently coax her out of this state she only emerges minutes later and begins to pour coffee onto a saucer rather than into a cup.

Haneke does not dress up his characters in easy sentiment but in a raw reality that invites empathy. After it becomes fully apparent that Anne has suffered a stroke, Haneke has the courage to linger on the couple's darkened home, roaming room to room in a series of static shots that show it silent and empty though it is also clearly lived in and full of possessions acquired over a shared lifetime. The moment provides transition not only through the couple's subsequent journey into the unknown but serves as a reminder that even a well-ordered personal universe can quickly empty out into a vacuum of unknowing In the following sequence, the couple's daughter Eva speaks privately to Georges. She is clearly upset over her mother's condition but the conversation turns to her husband's infidelity. She has taken him back. Concerned, Georges asks ""But do you love him?,"" to which she replies ""Yes, I think so."" Clearly love is a mystery in Haneke's stark universe.

""Your mother and I have always coped"" Georges assures Eva when she presses about what Anne's stroke will require. But of course coping is not the same thing as love. Neither is coping always what is best for all involved. Soon, Georges is overwhelmed and the film becomes a journey bordered by moments, small victories, light in tone and larger, more common defeats in which the moments of darkness slowly seems to swallow a once vibrant and happy couple. A surrender is underway. Describing a funeral to Anne, who has had to stay behind due to her being wheelchair bound, Georges lays out a scene relentlessly farcical, almost devoid of dignity. Staring into space, Anne simply asks whether it is perhaps to for her to dies for both their sake, a suggestion that Georges brushes off, but not without a shudder: the first major hint that Haneke is hinging his narrative upon notions of quality of life.

Anne is not alone in her doubts. Georges has, at her urging, promised his wife there will be no future hospitalizations, no extraordinary measures, and despite the help of nurses, he feels his own limitations grow with each passing day. Suddenly, their life together spares no one's feelings. Beauty, strength, ability, even memory, all become lost investments. To live is to age and finally die. The relentlessness of it is a wearing down where menial tasks take on a weight that would require heroism if only that heroism was something more than debilitating. To hope becomes simply a point of view rooted in no particular reality. Reality subsumes, consumes. Every fiber of being, every bit of attention, must be put to the unsolvable problem, of survival.

It is startling how subdued Amour is. Almost all the cold mechanics of body fluid and function that Haneke could use to shock his audience are hidden largely from view yet he makes them felt more powerfully than can be elaborated here. The bathings, the toiletries, the feedings, and the ever growing difficulties in understanding one another are brought to life seemingly through a dearth of artifice and yet it is simply that Haneke is in such command of his medium that viewers simply never take notice of him, or his camera, his subtle framing. They are simply affected by it. Moved in a way that only a master can provoke.

There is something deeply poignant about watching acclaimed actor Jean-Louis Trintignant assay the part of Georges. In 1956 he became the object of intense scrutiny over rumor of an affair with Brigitte Bardot with who he starred in ...And God Created Woman. Other roles have included major parts in Costa Gravas' Z, Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist, and Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors: Red. Amour sees him full circle,  as a man in a tortured and problematic relationship and he tackles the opportunity with every bit of power at his disposable.

Anne is played by the equally accomplished Emmanuelle Riva. After being discovered by Alain Resnais and cast as the lead in his historic Hiroshima, mon amour the future looked promising. But in the intervening decades she way rarely cast in material that was worthy of her. Roles in Jean-Pierre Melville's Leon Morin, Priest and Three Colors: Blue notwithstanding, it appeared she would never again rise to the heights her early career provided. But with Amour she is poised, to share an immense talent once again on a scale that befits her. It is worth remaking the Riva has the far herder job of the two leads as she is forced to convey meaning without dialogue for at least two thirds of the film. Her eyes haunted by the loss of the ability to communicate as her illness progresses sometimes devolve into a stupor. At times, she cries out mournfully and repeatedly ""Hurts,"" when nothing is discernibly wrong. At others, she betrays no sign of her plight, singing along with her husband in a sing-song manner that has become virtually the only true verbal communication that has been left to them.

What becomes of Georges and Anne will challenge any thinking person to examine their own questions about marriage, death, dying, and even human community. Above all things, Haneke seems to suggest that love demands things of people that only they can understand. To love may be to go mad or at least appear mad to others. Haneke unsettles precisely because he does not make any value judgements on such questions. When he is pilloried by critics, which happens less and less these days, it is often for exactly this reason. The irony is that only this humility allows him to deal so masterfully with the subject matter at all.

Haneke has been busy making movies for the ages for a while now. The Piano Teacher, Time of the Wolf, Cache, and the White Ribbon are films that offer timeless narrative. With each effort, he seems to deepen his ability to use his chosen artistic medium to communicate ever more complex observations about the human condition.",1377129600,,7901,4.875651526433358

5427497,4,B00AIBZLR8,"Love Can't Always Keep Us Together, as the old song goes. Troubles interfere, time passes and things change. Love can endure, and we see it up close and personal in this film.

This film has two main characters, Georges and Anne, retired music teachers in their 80s played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. They live in Paris in a beautiful apartment where the grand piano is Up front and center. They seem very happy and they are still in love. The opening scene is a concert given by a former pupil, that Georges and Anne attend. That is the last happy scene. Anne suffers a stroke after carotid surgery, the 5% side effect. She is still able to speak and think, and Anne makes Georges promise never to put her in a hospital again. and, so the slow dance of time begins.

This is at times a lovely film, full of love, but, then, it is sad and the angst George's and Anne feels, we feel. It is difficult to watch a loved one deteriorate and slowly die. Most of us go through it, with one or another of relatives. Even though it is difficult to watch this film, it brings us closer to our own thoughts. How we all think about our lives, ourselves. How will we die, how will our loved ones die? There is no answer.

Moving film of life and death and dying. Should be seen by all.

One morning while eating breakfast Anne suffers a stroke and their lives are forever changed. As Anne's condition worsens their love and dignity becomes tested as George tries to remain the only caretaker. First of all the movie is depressing but not as depressing as I was expecting. While the movie is basically just George and Anne alone in a house for about 90% of the movie it actually isn't as slow moving as you would expect. For me personally this was a hard movie to watch as my grandmother, grandfather and uncle have all suffered strokes of various seriousness so it really hit home. As far as the movie goes you really become involved in the lives of the couple and by the end you are left to question what you would have done in that situation. I can easily see why his was up for best picture. Overall, a thought provoking and beautiful story about what you do for the one you love. One of the better foreign movies I have seen.

He does not compromise, he does not water down his weighty subjects, and he will not make an easy film for the sake of being easy.

Amour, like most of his films, is slow-moving, bleak, and difficult to watch. It has subtitles, no Hollywood actors, no action, and no humor. And, like most of Haneke's films, it is brilliant, thought-provoking, and expertly shot and acted. I saw this film, and instantly I was taken by it. I thought it was the finest film of 2012 (I still do, bar, surprisingly, The Hobbit. Sorry, I am a Tolkien fan. I cannot lie!). I recommended it to several people. And all of them hated it.

Let us ask ourselves why:
They said it was boring and slow. They said it was depressing. They said it had no point. They said it had an anti-life message.

Respectfully, they all missed the point.
Is Amour slow? Yes, it is. It is not fast paced, but instead takes a much calmer, uninvolved look at the life of Georges and Anne. However, I have a surefire remedy for slow movies. Watch the slowest, most contemplative and cerebral movie you know; for me it was Solaris. Every movie after that will seem as fast-paced as a thriller. As for boring, not for me it wasn't, but you have to be in the right mood when you watch the film.
Is Amour depressing? To some, yes. Amour is all too chillingly realistic, and to someone who has seen a loved-one sink into mental decline, this film can be painful and sad. However, I saw beautiful scenes of hope mixed with the sadness. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending was both tragic, heart-breaking, shocking, and perhaps even beautiful (I speak of course, of what happened AFTER the climax).
Does Amour have no point? I beg to differ. It is a film about old age, loss, hope, and above all, true, undying love. In the words of critic Roger Ebert, it ""has a lesson for us that only the cinema can teach.""

And most of all, many people who have seen this film have commented on the ending, which to me hit like a ton of bricks out of the sky. It was devastating, disturbing, and shocking. Many claimed it was anti-life, and promoted euthanasia. Who knows? I did not think it so. In fact, Georges act might be the bravest, most loving thing he could have done for Anne. Then again, it might not have been. Amour sparks endless discussion, but this is a review, not a debate (Why not talk it over in the comments with me?)!

One thing is certain: Amour is NOT an easy film to watch. It is, in the words of critic Roger Ebert, a film ""not for sissies"". Amour can be terribly sad and depressing, and at other times slow and difficult. Many will not see the point of the film. I _totally_ understand that point of view, as it is very legitimate and relevant.

Let's briefly talk about the acting. It was ab-so-lu-tely perfect. And this is something that even the film's detractors pointed out to me. Trintignant and Riva act in very difficult, weighty, realistic roles, and both do flawlessly. There is something almost sad in their very composure; Riva was a stunning French beauty in her day (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hiroshima-Mon-Amour-1959/dp/B008DKLE2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959)</a>) and Trintignant was a dashing young man in his (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Night-At-Maud-s/dp/1572522127/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Night At Maud's</a>). Now they are old and wrinkled, but there is an elegant composure and poise even in their old age that comes with living long and knowing much. They are perfectly matched and believable as the old couple, and the result makes the film all the more emotionally devastating.
Haneke has no non-diegetic music in his film, and the camera work is often removed and distant, so no emotional moment is not earned by his actors. And there are plenty of emotional moments in Amour. They will drain you of all happiness and levity you felt when you went into the movie. Amour makes the saddest film you've seen look like a cheap Nicholas Sparks novel.

It also makes the film all the more harder to watch.

However, to the thinking viewer, one who is ready to view an uncompromising, unsentimental, often removed and heart-wrenching film, Amour will prove to be brilliant, tragically sad, thought-provoking, and utterly unforgettable. Amour showcases Jean-Louis Trintiganant and Emmanuelle Riva's stunning and perfect acting, Michael Haneke's brilliant script and flawless camera work and editing, and one of the most true-to-life and beautiful depictions of true, undying love ever filmed.

I would like to end with a brilliant quote from Empire's film critic David Hughes on Amour: ""In the course of two hours, Haneke suggests that the ultimate test of a lifelong passion may come not in its first flourish, but in the compassion of its very last days, and that while love cannot conquer death, it can give life's bleakest moments a run for their money. Viewed from this angle, Amour becomes not only one of the greatest films ever made about old age, but a love story for the ages. ""

5 Stars! Recommended highly, but not to everyone.

5427502,4,B00AIBZLR8,"As much as I would love to say this movie is boring and slow, and absolutely nothing happens for the majority of the movie, I cannot make it my point. Though this movie might be dull and may lack excitement, it has some of the best acting and directing of 2013 in my opinion. The story is deep, touching, and it moves you in a way not many other films are capable of doing. If you are looking for action and excitement then I would not recommend this movie to you. But if you seek drama and romance that will cast an emotional hold on you like no other than I recommend this movie for you. It shows the reality of old age and the difficult struggles elders must go through at this period of their life. All in all, this movie is an instant classic and I hope you have the opportunity to check out this movie.

Because nothing happens. People who are fairly well off, intelligent, seem to have nice lives; get old and die. And in the process, there is a lot of unhappiness. It was very much like watching my parents all over again. Were those times precious to me? Absolutely. Do I want to see it again? Absolutely not. I don't think I was quite as selfish as the daughter but still. Nobody trains you for this and it's hard not to be somewhat of a jerk. So, if you want to see what life will be like for you, or your parents, when you get old and eventually get whatever illness you're probably going to get, see this movie. As for me, I want my two hours back. See Cache instead. Same director, but that was a good movie. But that's just my opinion.",1373155200,,894,4.203488372093023
5427505,4,B00AIBZLR8,"""Amour"" is a Michael Haneke film, which means something heavy and uncomfortable even to moviegoers accustomed to European art house films. His movies are often perplexing (""The White Ribbon"") and disturbing (""Funny Games""), even to the point of grating against one's sensibilities. So, despite its title, ""Amour"" does not have to be sweet and beautiful. This may be a love story, but even so, it is told with icy realism and zero sentimentality.

The storyline itself is simple. Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers living a quiet life in a Paris apartment. One day Anne has a stroke (in a bizarre fashion) that leaves her partially paralyzed. As her illness progresses, the aged couple's life slowly becomes nightmarish in spite of, or because of, their love.

Most scenes are set in a closed space where the octogenarian couple lives. The film keeps a measured pace throughout, with some key events happening off-screen. As seen in his ""Cache,"" drawing suspense from the static images is Haneke's forte, and he makes a good use of the place's claustrophobic mood that becomes unbearable as the story unfolds.

Probably ""Amour"" is the Austrian director's most accessible film to date. It is not an easy watch, to be sure, but its theme is universal and its approach to the subject matter less pretentious. The film is intelligent, but its intelligence does not prevent us from being emotional.",1369180800,3,1444,5.084388185654008

In effect, the viewer will be spending 2-hours with two people living in the confines of one apartment.  While I certainly appreciate the acting and the poignancy of this production, my main objection is that the pacing is excruciatingly slow.",1362960000,3,348,4.8
5427529,4,B00AIBZLR8,"Most filmed love stories depict the beginnings and complications of couples searching for happiness and a future together.  In rare exceptions (The Notebook) do we also see the waning days of love, and with Amour, we are witness to the end of a long union of husband and wife, whose longevity is matched by their love for one another.  It is a bittersweet study in the challenges and hardships that are grim reminders that although life is finite, love transcends time.  As written and directed by Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher), the story is a realistic study of love, loyalty, and responsibility in a marriage.

Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a married, elderly couple who share a love of classical piano music and live in a modest apartment.  One day, following a visit to a classical concert, Anne is paralyzed by a stroke, and as her body begins to fail her, she and her husband must adjust to a new way of living and the inevitability of the end.  What transpires in the following days and weeks amid concerns of their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), will test an enduring love to its very limits.

Featuring two leading actors who starred in two of the more haunting, romantic films at the beginning of the French New Wave Cinema, (Riva in Hiroshima Mon Amour and Trintignant in A Man and a Woman), it is ironic that we see these veteran performers, as aged spouses.  Riva makes us feel for her, and she conveys much feeling with her facial expressions particularly in her eyes or the absence of any reaction as she convincingly depicts the gradual deterioration of a human being physically and spiritually.  Trintignant deserves credit for making us feel his plight as husband and caregiver. He gives Riva an equal in acting.

The contrast of their day to day routines is thrown awry by fate, and the hardship of caring for an physically impaired family member is heartbreaking.  The details of hiring healthcare workers, helpful neighbors who buy groceries, acquiring a hospital bed or wheelchair, and even the simplest acts of human function are a challenge.  When Anne asks to see a family photo album, we know this is a sign that this is the beginning of the end of her quality of life as she is reviewing her past and better times.  There are moments you wonder how much can Georges take and to what lengths he will endure to support his wife's well being. There are echoes of Million Dollar Baby in the incapacity of a loved one and how those closest must come to terms with life.  It is a tragedy being played out before our eyes.

There is symbolism of a pigeon that repeatedly flies into the apartment; perhaps it represents a precious life that is a metaphor for Anne.  Even the sounds of activity in their kitchen speak to their routine at mealtime. Indeed, most of the story takes place in their apartment.  The absence of a musical score adds to its realism and immediacy.

Despite a somber tone, Amour is blessed with great performances that cap two legendary careers.  Give Haneke credit for an ambiguous, bold ending with its memorable imagery; it reaffirms the power of love. The film says that this may be the end of a life but not the end of love.",1362960000,5,3213,4.674955595026643
5427530,1,B00AIBZLR8,"Why you shouldn't see it:

The obvious reason that jumps out at you is that Amour is a foreign language film, leading you to (unless you know French) read your movie. I'll take this opportunity to go off on a tangent addressing that very point. It's not that foreign languages bother me in and of themselves, or that I consider reading to be all that laborious. The problem that I frequently run into is that I am a slow reader. Accordingly, if I'm watching a movie with subtitles, I find myself spending too much time reading and not enough time taking in things like, oh, say, the movie that the dialog is really just supposed to supplement.

The story revolves around a very old French couple who live in an apartment in Paris. Through the course of the movie, you meet, to the best of my memory, three other characters, but each of them are little more than afterthoughts. And the plot advances entirely within the confines of the aforementioned apartment. So if watching two old people do nothing all in one place for two hours sounds to you like a boring affair, watching this most likely won't do anything to dispel you of that opinion.

Aside from all of the set pieces being tailor made for absolutely nothing happening, the way that the film was made also plays a large part in making the viewer feel little to no excitement. I'm sure you're familiar with the kinetic style in which movies these days are edited, creating fast pacing by cutting quickly from one shot to the next. Well that doesn't happen here. Shots go on for minutes at a time, unbroken and unchanged. Just two old people looking at each other. Or not looking at each other. I don't remember where they were looking, because I was too busy reading. Another element that creates a sort of dead atmosphere is the lack of a soundtrack. All of the sound in this movie comes in the form of foreign language speaking and - very occasional - piano music that the characters listen to.

I don't know if it's standard for people to act like these do once they get old, but everything on screen came off to me as stilted and formal. All of the dialog strikes me as very appropriate when speaking with strangers, which is strange, because almost all of the dialog is exchanged between a husband and wife, their daughter, and a former prized pupil. It's possible that the French just didn't translate well into English, leading me to think that there's an emotionless disconnect that isn't actually there. But then that wouldn't explain why everyone also acts (in their tone and manner) appropriately cold and distant, unless there is also a mistranslation between how French people and American people act. Regardless, when two people were interacting with each other, I couldn't tell whether they were complete strangers or dear relatives.

Why you should see it:

...

...

...

I'm honestly having a real hard time with this part. See, I know that (REVIEW SPOILER!!!) at the end I'm going to recommend that people not watch this movie, and then I have to give exceptions to that recommendation afterward. But I'm afraid that if I say anything positive about it here, I won't have any material left for the bullet points.

I'm staring, right this moment, at a couple of ratings for Amour. IMDB has it at an 8.0, while Metacritic has it at a 94.

I'm speechless.

I won't say that I always agree with every assessment of a movie. I know full well that I like some movies that other people don't, and vice versa. But there is a pretty big difference between agreeing with something and understanding it. I don't agree that Angelina Jolie is all that pretty or the earth is flat, but I understand why someone might think so. Here is an instance where I literally go cross-eyed whenever someone mentions how ""good"" or ""brilliant"" or ""watchable"" this film is.

In Short:

Amour couldn't be a much less exciting movie. If you are looking for something to keep you entertained, interested, or even awake, look elsewhere. To be perfectly honest, the only thing that really captured my imagination was the concept that there were sufficient people in the Academy who considered this their favorite film of the year. I guess I could, somehow, understand a rather morbid individual possibly appreciating this film, but to declare it their favorite would seemingly require an exceptionally special person. Apparently I'm wrong though, and people do like it. I don't know what to tell you. Regardless, I will happily give this movie a 3 out of 10 and suggest that everyone remember there are no ways for them to get these 2 hours of their lives back.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- people who like word association puzzles... For instance, what does the film's title (Amour, which is French for ""love"") have to do with its plot? What in the hell is the filmmaker trying to say about love? Is this a French thing? I thought French people were supposed to be romantic and all that, not the exact opposite and depressing. A far more appropriate title to my mind would have been Misre, but I guess that's why I'm not a filmmaker;
- people who are eagerly anticipating experiencing a stroke of their very own (or of a loved one);
- if you prefer your movies presented to you in book form. Remember earlier when I complained about having to read movies, because it prevents me from watching the movie itself? Luckily that doesn't apply here, because so little happens on the screen anyway;
- if you have a strange curiosity to see things that you have been explicitly warned against;
- if you actually derive enjoyment out of watching old people live miserable lives;
- if this is just sadly one of those few occasions where your bucket list item of seeing every best picture nominee ever will come back to kick you in the posterior.",1362873600,9,5789,4.6506849315068495

Emmanuelle Riva is brilliant as the afflicted Anne. Had the film been cheerier and less challenging, she would have walked away with the Oscar for best actress. Sorry, Jennifer Lawrence.

The film is not easy, showing a couple closer to their former students than to their children. And some of the details of caring for the debilitated are not pretty. But to those who have cared for elderly parents, the film rings true.

While some complain about film's oblique ending, I don't. You don't have to see what happened to know what happened.

5427532,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Haneke continues his artistic journey through the violence of the close nearby in the western societies.  This is no small feat, for violence is revealed from behind the otherwise peaceful decorum woven by conventions and reason/logic.  In Haneke's films, the  burst of violence comes as the decorum is punctured by some event and the characters continue to act as if to call into being the status qvo ante.

This film is set against the increasingly common landscape of our aging population.  An elderly couple, whose love must have firmly set in motion the clockwork of their relation, is catapulted into a different orbit as one of them is failing.  Who's failing from the two, and how fast, is better left for the viewer to discover.  Fact is, they both try in their own ways to keep it all afloat.  Little comes by way of help from the outside, daughter included, for we have all become independent entities, being less so becomes the burden no one wants to acknowledge.

In the end, there is no easy conclusion, for Haneke leaves the viewer again to ponder.

Technically speaking, no surprise, that is, Haneke lives up to his high standard and we have an impeccable delivery from ancient and giant actors, who fit/fill their roles naturally.  Good cameo from Alexandre Tharaud himself.",1362441600,2,1291,4.8493150684931505
5427533,5,B00AIBZLR8,"If you take a look around the filmography of Michael Haneke since The Seventh Continent until this one, you will find a common denominator. The existential anguish and the borderline situations about to ignite.

If you are really interested to watch similar films like this one, I would suggest you to get ""Le Chat"" from Pierre Granier Deferre (1973), On golden pond (1978) and Sarabande (2005) from Ingmar Bergman (his swan's song).

Amour focuses about a sad reality. For all of us who have dealt with this painful situation (I experienced it twice with close relatives) and so, made an instantaneous rapport with this awful situation.

A true lesson of life that may concern you sooner or later. How would you handle?. A film that invites you to think and rethink about this stage of life when the years of youth are not longer valid and you can listen the velvet steps of death.

A crude and essential film that must be seen and won Cannes Festival and certainly captured the whole attention of critics and audience around the globe.

Not to be missed!!!",1362355200,3,1058,4.728260869565218
5427534,5,B00AIBZLR8,"I had a very distinct experience at the theater while watching Michael Haneke's Amour. While primarily focused on the film itself, I was also paying attention to the body language of the audience. Very early on, almost immediately after the title card sits across a blank screen, there is a shot of Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) waiting for a recital to begin. The way Haneke is able to bring us toward these two, even in a frame of much activity, will not be surprising to anyone who has seen a certain other film of his. But what was so eerie about this scene this time around was how it set such a tone for the story to come, how it announced from the outset that it wasn't here to hold our hand. In the theater I could hear coughing and shuffling, whispering and grumbling, and that was simultaneously what I was hearing on screen as well. Already the bodies in the crowd were stirring, perhaps wondering where the music was that would guide them emotionally through this couple's twilight. Or just hoping that the next scene or the one after that would show Georges and Anne jaunting around a scenic Paris street in a rainstorm, laughing and looking on the bright side. But that never, ever comes in this film. It employs a sort of desolate quietude early on, and it only gets quieter. More stirring ensues around me, some people looking at each other for cues that Haneke refuses to give them. Refuses at every turn.

Prepare yourself for that. We do not see this kind of restraint in modern films. We also don't see this kind of willingness to venture into the tunnel of mortality. You'd have to go back to Bergman's Cries and Whispers for a true counterpart, and even then Amour is something more distilled. To be sure, a common complaint you will hear about the film is that it has a thousand pounds of ice in its veins, that it is removed or distant. Such a charge is often leveled at Haneke for his other films as well. But, in this case, I think the style fits the substance like a glove. For illness, whether caretaker or sufferer, carries with it a fog, a depression of spirit. I don't think it's a spoiler to inform the reader that you will spend the entire duration inside the apartment of Anne and Georges. You will watch the dull light barely come through, you will find it difficult to distinguish days from nights, you will see a dying woman's bedside accumulate all the sterile supplies of a hospital room. And you will concurrently watch her husband wilt under the sadness and futility of it all. There will be no epiphanies that let you coast out on a wave of false hope. That has little to do with Haneke's cinematic style, and everything to do with the fact that life is temporary. Love, a part of that process, cannot be separated from death.

So why recommend the film? Because about eighty percent of people spend all of their free time disengaging. They avoid all things unhappy or undesirable in the belief that this improves upon their own immediate contentedness. I don't necessarily fault them for the impulse, but, as time passes, I think more and more that it clips their antennae to the human experience. Distraction is fine, but why would we want to live in a constant state of it? This film is not just for those looking to extract its complex symbolism in a classroom. It is for everybody, as it gets down to the very marrow of what happens to all of us. It is beautiful in its depiction of faithfulness, dismissive of made-short attention spans, and lives with you long after the lights come up. Please tell your friends to give it a chance when they say they don't watch ""that depressing stuff."" Tell them that leaving is always depressing, but we all must. There is catharsis in that.",1361577600,54,3756,4.546528803545051

5427596,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes, ""Amour"" is a magnificent masterpiece by arguably the greatest film artist alive in the world today, Michael Haneke.  Uncompromising and devastating in its emotional power, ""Amour"" tells of an elderly woman who falls victim to a stroke and her husband must deal with her illness as their lives move towards their inevitable end.

Haneke displays a full understanding of and compassion for our human condition without resorting to any soap operatic banalities. He directs with his iconic cold austerity, appropriately keeping the camera at arm's length until the fatal if subtle exact moment of the stroke at the breakfast table when his style changes to an appropriate intimacy.  In Haneke, no element or shot is extraneous: like the attempted break-in at the beginning (a bringer of fear that perhaps brings on the event as well as being a harbinger of fate) and the pigeon who twice intrudes into their apartment, Haneke is certainly aware of its religious significance. This -- and his last masterpiece, ""The White Ribbon"" -- are two films that lay claim to him being the Austrian Bergman, and this is his ""Winter Light"".  It is harsh and cruel, but it is also compassionate.  It is also one of the great stories of love.  (One interesting point is that Haneke deliberately designed the apartment of the octogenarians to mirror the apartment of his own parents.)

The film strikes me as formally perfect, as perfect as Michelangelo's Pieta, Mahler's Ninth or Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"".  A diamond without one false shot, one strained movement, one element of sentimentality, bathos or fraudulent emotion.  Seeing it was for me a journey of discovery: painful, even unlikable, and revelatory. And having seen it, my life has been altered, I am a different person, and it will stay with me as long as my memory remains.

My highest recommendation to intelligent viewers.",1361404800,5,1912,5.022151898734177
5427597,5,B00AIBZLR8,"I don't often care for reviews that give away entire scenes, but the best and most helpful way for me to describe the experience of seeing this film is to describe briefly two small moments that happen very early in the story (they do not give away plot or surprises):

1)  There is an extended take from the point of view of a stage looking directly at its auditorium's audience as they settle down before a concert.  In this moment, we are one and the same with the audience onscreen, looking into each other from our theater seats like two mirrors.  This feeling and the communality of it never quite go away as the story unfolds.

2)  In a subsequent scene that takes place the next morning, the married couple eats breakfast (both are music teachers, their student having been the performer the previous night).  The husband reminisces about a powerful film -- a love story -- he saw as a young man that, when attempting to describe it to a neighbor, led him to weep intensely.  When describing the film to his neighbor, he says, he'd wept harder than he already had during the actual experience of seeing the film.  The feeling created by the love story was so powerful for him, he could not hide his tears from his neighbor, which he had feared happening.

The filmmakers of 'Amour' created a love story of such intimate, tremendous power, that the audience may very well react to it as the elderly husband reacted to the love story he'd seen as a young man.  This Amazon.com reviewer certainly did, and will carry 'Amour' with him for a very long time; it is engrained in my memory and heart.

Director Michael Haneke, his actors, and all the film's collaborators created a masterpiece in 'Amour,' a film so real, so intense, and so authentic.  I dare not give away any more scenes or instances; in fact, the story is so personal, I'd feel as if sharing more about the film's characters is similar to sharing about something so intimate in the lives of actual people, namely something that we can and will all relate to that it is heartbreaking in its universality.",1361232000,6,2073,4.57027027027027
5427598,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Written and directed by Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke, Amour is an elegant, beautifully acted and painfully unflinching look at an elderly couple dealing with the challenges of decline in old age where one partner becomes increasingly debilitated and the other must shoulder the ever-increasing responsibilities of being the caregiver. It is given even greater gravitas by the extraordinary performances of the two main actors, each a legendary veteran of French cinema with over sixty years of experience to their name, Jean-Louis Trintignant (A Man and a Woman) and Emmanuelle Riva (Hiroshima, Mon Amour).

Georges (Trintignant) and Anne (Riva) are retired music teachers. Now in their eighties, they have over fifty years of married life together and live quite comfortably in the apartment they have shared for the last half-century.  Their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), who is also a musician, is grown and living abroad with a family of her own.  One morning, while eating breakfast, Anne suddenly goes catatonic, staring blanking ahead and not responding to Georges' increasingly worried attempts to rouse her. She recovers a few minutes later when Georges is about to call for an ambulance. At first Georges accuses her of playing a prank on him, but it soon becomes clear that Anne has no memory of the episode. When Georges tries to tell her what just happpened, she in turn tells him he must be losing his mind, refusing to believe what he's telling her.

A trip to the doctor, which Anne resists but finally gives in to, reveals that she is suffering from a blockage of the carotid artery. Surgery is attempted but is unsuccessful, and worse, results in her suffering a stroke which leaves her partially paralyzed and dependent on a wheelchair.  Upon returning home, Anne makes Georges promise not to send her back to the hospital or into a nursing home. She is adamant that she doesn't want to live that kind of life.  Georges is uncertain about the wisdom of this, but he nonetheless promises to abide by her wishes and he takes on the role of caregiver. At first, it seems like they may be able to carry on somewhat as before. A visit from a former pupil of theirs, who is now a famous concert pianist, seems to go well, but when he leaves them a cd of his music and Georges begins to play it, Anne suddenly becomes melancholy, realizing that she herself will never again be able to play the way she once did. As time passes her condition deterioriates, particularly after she apparently suffers another stroke that leaves her face half-paralyzed and makes speaking even simple words an arduous effort. Georges keeps his promise, looking after Anne in spite of the increasing strain her care puts on him. He hires a nurse to help out three days a week, but eventually even that assistance is not enough and he has to hired a second nurse. Eva, their daughter, worries at what she sees when she visits and wants her mother to go into care, but Georges refuses, saying he will not break the promise he made to his wife. At the same time, Georges has no illusions about where things are heading. When Eva asks what will happen next, he bluntly replies ""Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over.""

It is to the film's credit that it does not turn away from Anne's increasingly painful-to-watch decline or from the increasing stresses it puts on Georges, on their relationship, and on the family dynamics between Anne, Georges and Eva. Some scenes are particularly difficult to watch, but are unflinching in their realistic depiction of the kind of things that occur to people in these situations, in the way they have to deal with limited options, with chronic pain and the confusion of advancing dementia, with frustration over the simplest things like feeding and communicating. But that said, it does make for painful viewing, particularly for anyone who has ever had to deal with a spouse or parent experiencing that kind of debilitation and decline.

Both Trintignant and Riva are supberb in their performances. Riva's Anne, for which she was nominated for the Academy award for Best Actress, is a masterpiece, utterly convincing at each stage of her decline from her normal pre-stroke self to the painful-to-watch trapped self she become as her body and eventually mind fail her. In one scene where Anne stubbornly refuses to drink the water Georges is coaxing on her, Riva is limited to conveying Anne through her eyes and the hard set of her stroke-afflicted face. Wordless, it nonetheless speaks volumes. Trintignant's performance as Georges is more subtle in its delivery, being in many ways the more sympathetic role, but he does it very effetively, going beyond the obvious cliches associated with caregivers and raising questions about Georges' motivations. Is his stubborn shouldering of his burden due solely to his promise to Anne, or is there perhaps something else at work, something ultimately selfish in his refusal to have her go to a nursing home where she could perhaps get better care but which would mean his having to live without her? Isabelle Huppert's performance as Eva is also excellent, showing the frustrations both of a daughter having to watch her mother decline and knowing in spite of her protests that there must be _something_ that can be done, that in fact the medical options have been exhausted and there is nothing that can be done. And the frustrations of, in spite of being an adult, she is still the child of the family and cannot undo the decades of parental authority that have preceded this moment. Again, anyone who has gone through a similar experience in the family or with a loved one will strongly relate to the story that unfolds in Amour.

As writer and director, Haneke (The White Ribbon, Cach and The Piano Teacher) brings a masterful hand to the project. Though slow-paced in the beginning, it proceeds nonetheless at an appropriate pace, every scene having meaning and purpose in bringing out the story taking place on the scene, filling in little but important details about the characters, making it possible for the actors to give them their full depth. Nominated for five Academy awards including Best Picture, Director and Original Screenplay, Amour also won the coveted Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA and European Film Awards.  It is truly a work, not only of great performances, but of great craftsmanship as well.

Highly, highly recommended.",1361059200,11,6483,4.889899909008189
5427599,1,B00AIBZLR8,"Lovely film for 90% of it, about an elderly couple in which the husband takes care of his wife after she has a stroke and her health deteriorates after that, but stupidly manipulative at the end. SPOILER ALERT (honestly, how can one give an honest review of this film without revealing how it ends?): He kills her, takes a pillow and suffocates her at the end of the film - this when she she's so close to death that she would have died in a week or two's time ANYWAY - and then presumably commits suicide. But ""he looooved her."" If he loved her, he would have respected her wishes (about not being sent to a nursing home) as long as he could and when he really couldn't go on caring for her had her taken there and _visited her_ for the remaining _week or two_ of her life. And when she died, he would have asked GOD: ""I'm still here, You must have a reason. Please tell me now what I should do...""

5427601,5,B00AIBZLR8,"I had seen the trailer for ""Amour"" a number of times at my local art house theatre here in Cincinnati, and for whatever reason it's taken until this past weekend for them to finally start screening this.

""Amour"" (2012 release from Austria/France; 127 min.) brings the story of Georges and Anne, both in their 80s and living a comfortable life, enjoying each other's company as retired music teachers in Paris. The very day after they go to a concert in which one of Anne's pupils, now a big classical music star, performs, Anne seems to 'fade away' for a bit during breakfast. She comes back to herself after a few minutes but this is the start of a slow and devastating process in which Anne's physical abilities deteriorate. Meanwhile we see Georges doing all he can to take care of Anne. Their daughter Eva (played by Isabelle Huppert), who lives in London, stops by a few times in the movie and with each visit grows more scared and worried about the state of affairs. I don't want to give away more of the plot, but let me just say there were a couple of scenes in which the audience in the theatre (a packed house, I might add) let out a huge gasp of surprise, if not shock.

I don't know where to begin first with giving accolades for this movie, but let's start with the top: writer-director Michael Haneke, now 70, who was a late bloomer and started delivering great movies only in his late 50s, starting with The Piano Teacher, which he then followed with Cach&eacute; and The White Ribbon. This is surely his masterpiece, confirming all of the great things he has done before, and then some. Haneke brings this movie with dignity and compassion, but never turning sentimental or going for the easy tear-jerker. I just LOVE how Haneke lets a scene develop, taking his time and regularly with a single camera view. Kudos also to the two lead performances from Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. While I am very happy that Riva got nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress, it is baffling that Trintignant, a giant in the French movie industry, was left out entirely from the Oscar nominations. Bottom line: I see well over 100 movies each year in the theatre, and I can unequivocally tell you that this is one of the very best releases from 2012, period. I will be pulling for ""Amour"" to win all of its 5 Oscar nominations in a few weeks. ""Amour"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1360022400,9,2396,4.582750582750583
5427602,4,B00AIBZLR8,"This is a small production out of France, written and directed by bleak-focused filmmaker Michael Haneke.  Both he and his movie along with 85 year old Emmanuelle Riva are all up for Oscars.  I suspect the film has a good chance at Best Foreign Film but little else.

The story and the filming is pretty straight forward.  Anne (Riva) and her husband Georges played by another octogenarian, Jean-Louis Trintignant, are retired musicians and teachers living out their years in an apartment in Paris.  After Anne suffers a stroke, she is sent home after a brief hospitalization.  Paralyzed on her right side and confined to a wheelchair, Georges promises her not to institutionalize her again.

Haneke puts the audience through the despair, pain and suffering that the couple must endure.  And he does it in great detail, taking his time with the camera focused on simple tasks like feeding, drinking and normally routine habits.  While he clearly wants to impact the viewer of the consequences of aging, it becomes almost intolerable and frankly unnecessary.  When Anne suffers a second stroke, she becomes helpless and uncommunicative.

Riva's performance is especially gut-wrenching.  Other notable performances this year including Naomi Watts in ""The Impossible"" and John Hawkes in ""The Sessions"" focus on characters bedridden for most of the film.  Add Riva to the list.  The film has no soundtrack to speak of, relying on the solemn events in front of us.  The only other significant character introduced is the couple's 40-something daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert).

While busy with her own life (also a musician) and marital difficulties, Eva's efforts to put Anne back in the hospital are rebuked by Georges, recalling his promise.  The film's conclusion is startling but perhaps not unexpected.  ""Amour"" (Love) is one of those movies that is important to see, but you won't want to watch it again anytime soon.",1359331200,2,1918,5.132258064516129

If you are someone that truly appreciates great, honest, true film then you must see this.",1358899200,4,436,4.675324675324675
5427604,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Michael Haneke's ""Amour"" may be the best film ever made about the ravages of old age. But for anyone who has ever lost a loved one to them, it is extremely painful to watch.

The film is simple in structure, yet superbly nuanced. Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva play Georges and Anne, a couple in their eighties, both retired piano teachers. One evening they go to hear one of Anne's former students in concert, then go backstage to congratulate him. The next morning they are having breakfast in their comfortable old Paris apartment when Anne suddenly becomes unresponsive and stares blankly into space. From there, the inexorable horrors begin: an unsuccessful operation to unblock Anne's carotid artery, followed by advancing paralysis and dementia. Georges cares for Anne tenderly in their apartment, helped by nurses of varying competence. Eva (Isabelle Huppert), Anne and Georges' middle-aged daughter, fights with Georges about what constitutes the best care for Anne. Then one day, after Georges returns from the funeral of a friend, Anne looks sharply at him and says, ""I can't go on like this.""

""Amour"" is unflinchingly honest about the suffering of Anne and Georges, and all the more moving for that. Trintignant and Riva, two of the greatest actors to come out of France's ""Nouvelle Vague"" movement of the 1960s, give performances that may fairly be described as flawless. The opening scene--which I will not reveal--telegraphs an ending that some may find too bitter, some too sentimental, and some just right. ""Amour"" won the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and is one of the relatively rare Palme d'Or winners that unequivocally deserved the prize. It is far from fun, but it is a moving, exquisite work of art.",1358640000,5,1752,5.0588235294117645
5427605,5,B00AIBZLR8,"Occasionally, a film is made so well, it transports you into the story and makes you a living, breathing part of it. And when these films depict realistic or real-life events, the effect is both exhilarating and horrifying. On the one hand, you are happy to be in the hands of filmmakers who are at the top of their game and extremely passionate about the story. On the other hand, the place they transport you to might not be so great.

This is what film is supposed to do, transport you to a time and place, and I love it when this happens. But it doesn't happen often. In the last few months, it has happened twice.

The winner of the Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, ""Amour"" tells the story of two elderly Parisians (Jean-Louis Trintingnant and Emmanuelle Riva, two veteran actors), retired music teachers, who live a comfortable life in their Paris apartment. One morning, Georges notices that his wife, Anne, blanks out at the breakfast table, apparently unresponsive for a number of minutes. Just as he is about to rush out and get a doctor, she comes to and doesn't seem to realize what has just happened. This is the beginning of her mental and physical downward spiral. ""Amour"" paints an almost painful picture of this journey and depicts what her husband goes through while trying to care for his wife, the love of his life.

Michael Haneke, the writer and director of one of my favorite films ""Cache (Hidden)"", has been creating a series of highly regarded films, each of which seems to be more emotional, powerful and critically applauded than the last. His latest features two veteran French actors painting a quiet, emotional story of the end of their lives.

Basically, there are two characters in the majority of the film, Georges and Anna. Occasionally, a care worker or their daughter (Isabelle Huppert) pop in for a few moments, but the majority of the film is set in their Paris apartment and concentrates on their lives. This concentration does a few things. First, it shows us how isolated they have become from the rest of society. They seem to realize and acknowledge this, but to also accept it. They go out to watch a former student perform a concerto, Many weeks (months?) later, the student comes for a visit. It is obvious this is a well-meant, but isolated incident. When their daughter comes to visit, it is clear she is there primarily to see how her parents are doing, to check on the health of her mother. She never visits in a social manner leading to an emotional moment between father and daughter late in the film.

The couple's isolation also allows us to focus only on them. We learn things about them while watching them, while listening to them, while observing. The beauty of this film is that these things are never revealed in a grand manner. In fact, if you blink, or go to the bathroom during the film, you might miss some of them. But because we are watching a film about the two characters, and they are virtually the only people in the film, your attention is always on them. And as you watch, you realize something. Although they don't say it, in fact I don't think they say it once during the entire film, Georges and Anna really do love one another. They have had a long and full life with one another so when the time comes for one of them to care for the other, the partner jumps into the role wholeheartedly.

It quickly becomes clear that Georges will have to care for his ailing wife. Because they have been together for years, he knows that she doesn't like doctors or hospitals, so he observes her wishes and cares for her at home. As the story progresses, you see Anna's deteriorating health and the lengths Georges has to go to in order to care for his wife. It is heartbreaking because it is so difficult and so different from their lives before, when they were younger. How do I know about their earlier life? There are no flashbacks. Haneke gives us such an intimate portrait of this couple, you can almost imagine their earlier life. The trip to the concert at the beginning of the film, gives you an idea of the type of outing they must have had on a more regular basis. You can imagine them going to a concert and then sharing dinner at their favorite bistro. Now that they are older, they take the bus home. But as soon as they return to their apartment, they move like a well-oiled machine, anticipating each of their needs and wants.

Jean-Louis Trintingnant is an actor I am not overly familiar with; he seems to have made a number of Jean-Luc Goddard films including ""A Man and a Woman"" and appeared in ""Three Colors: Red"". Trintingnant brings a quiet passion to his role as Georges. He doesn't express a lot of emotion, but this doesn't mean that Georges has no passion. Because they appear so natural together, you imagine the passion this older couple once had and you respect their long lives together. When it comes time to care for his ailing wife, he simply does it and does it in a way that he knows would respect his wife's choices and likes, even when the care is extremely demanding and physical.

Emmanuelle Riva is also an actor I am not overly familiar; one of her notable films is ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" and she was in ""Three Colors: Blue"". Her role as Anna is heartbreaking because we don't really watch it progress slowly. Haneke allows us into the couple's life for a period of time, cuts, and then thrusts us back into their life a few days, weeks or months later. It is difficult to tell, because there is never any warning when we are going to make one of these time jumps. But each time we return to their lives, it is clear that Anna is continuing to decline. And the jumps between each state are jarring. Riva's performance is mesmerizing and riveting because she seems to fully inhabit Anna's deteriorating state. It is a difficult role to pull off because she has great difficulty speaking and can't communicate with her husband, daughter or us. And there is a lot of sadness in her performance as she tries to cope with a failing body.

The two actors seem completely natural with one another and their performances complement one another perfectly. Trintingnant is quiet, intense and impassive. Riva is loud, distressed and very vocal because Anna is in so much pain.

Isabelle Huppert pops in a few times to check on the state of her mother. Her reactions are the reactions I think we would all have. We would want our parents to be cared for in the best way possible. And she reacts in the way most of us would react, as though we know what the best way is. The role is handled perfectly, adding punctuation to the portrayal of this couple's life.

Haneke has crafted another emotional, intense film that is sure to have you grabbing a hanky at least a few times.

I know many people only want to go to films to ""feel good"" which means they probably go to a lot of comedies or romantic films or films with uplifting messages. But anytime I go to see a film that is as good as either of these is, whatever the subject matter, that makes me feel good. I enjoy seeing filmmakers working at the height of their crafts, creating films that will stay with me and that I will remember for a long time to come. ""The Impossible"" and ""Amour"" are both extremely well-made and transport you to dark places, places that you probably will not want to go to every weekend. But if you miss these works, you will be missing two of the best films of the year.

And now that I have seen this film, I will be very happy to never see it again. Instead, I eagerly look forward to the next film from Michael Haneke.",1358294400,9,7610,4.501810282404055

Love endures here, but not in a way that most will find ""inspirational"". The attachment to a certain kind of sensibility is very stron: voices aren't raised, stories are told coherently, the music is a gift and, if you're from anywhere in Europe but watching this in the US, this movie will probably feel like a gift and will most likely make you feel a certain nostalgia for your grandparents' generation. Fluency in French helps because of the precision of expression and the beauty of emotion captured in the language, the hesitations, and the distant politeness that are among the many nuances that make this movie devastatingly beautiful.
I subtracted a star (very meanly) for what I perceived to be somewhat heavy-handed product placement. Because the movie is so intense, brave and raw, the constant, relentless presence of an Evian water bottle/carton of Evian stood out as a false note.

8552074,5,B00AIBZLR8,"""Your paintings are just like my films.  About nothing.  But with precision."" - Michelangelo Antonioni  to Mark Rothko  How might have Antonioni addressed Michael Haneke then?  Perhaps, reflecting upon snatches of review comments thus far, like as follows:  ""About atrocity, but precisely distilled to extent of resembling nothing.  Haneke runs his great predecessor conspicuously close at times here.  Driving Miss Daisy, on the topic of aging, fair in its own right is on emotional and aesthetic levels, kind of college glee club up next to Amour.

Much about life is for sure tedious, listless, banal, mundane, but still it indeed is life, all foibles aside with its innate virtues, pleasures in even the smallest, most simple of things.  In comparison with the passion, delivered with heightened simplicity, unleashed by this film,  it is ironically then the escapism, the immediate indulgence of too easily achieved thrills that then becomes most mundane, ordinary about most cinema.

Amour as title here not only concerns the couple at the very heart of this film.  What brief flashbacks and reminiscences occur do so in an acute manner across as comparably bleak a  landscape as the Shostakovich Fifteenth, Alfred Schnittke Fourth String Quartes present, with also what odd breaks occur during at least the Shostakovich.  Perhaps this movie could have spent a little more time on what pleasures this couple, perhaps through reminiscence, would still be able to derive out of life.  With that however the sense of loss might have lent Amour psychological properties that could teeter emotions displayed in this movie too easily over the edge for those places during which reality must set back in.  As 'Making of Amour' (documentary) explains, Haneke, Trintignant, and Emmanuelle Riva all walk a very fine line here.  Their mastery of their resources is entirely solid in delivering what they must convey. Were it not for Haneke's genuine love for people, though, this easily could have been an utterly impossible film to make, even with incredibly how much craft is always evident.  His demands up on his performers would have then simply been too much.  At the end of the day, what indeed constitutes the cruelty of human existence, how can one portray it, using cinematic language in the most honest, candid and open-ended way possible?  Only perhaps, just for starters, the cinema of Robert Bresson , by example, can help provide us some answers to such an enigmatic dilemma, what issues are raised.

Isabelle Huppert plays the couple's daughter a little defiant regarding what are all the grueling circumstances.  The relative brevity of her part this time is deceptive as to how important or not her role is.  It is certainly at ones own peril that one might underrate the very brief but still more crucial Principressa in Puccinis Suor Angelica, for instance.

The euthanasia, however, there is no getting around it, does occur however as a little of a stain on the film. With how it is handled here, is it a real esthetic requirement of film to avoid any to all hint of contaminazione, as the Italians call it?  Most probably not.  Haneke completely defers from making any judgment call, then discreetly goes on to depict how Georges, the husband, goes about coping with what act he has just committed.  Coming down then too hard on one side, or for that matter, on the other, then becomes absurd and thus outside of keeping with the spirit of this film, which to its bitter end, remains intact.  Haneke helps his audience down from the trauma that he has necessarily put us through only in as good way as he responsibly can, it then being unavoidable the numbing effect of his effort at doing so.  The manner in which Antonioni closes the last two films of his great trilogy fleetingly comes to mind.  The issue of trauma and memory, how the two both complement and clash with each other, is confronted is confronted in Amour as well.  Even with what we know concerning all this, we deal with a work of art here, such that carries with itself its own needs and requirements.

Many among our elderly, especially end-of-life, are incredibly stoic and courageous about what lies ahead, but to err on the side of caution, this is not something for the majority of those approaching the end of life to watch. It is just for all the rest of us instead. So much dialogue that goes on in a skilled nursing facility, experience teaches me,- tends toward the banal, superficial, in place sometimes of what is most necessary to say, what should be heard by our loved ones, making something then artificial about how we amongst ourselves communicate, then abetting the industry of caring for our aging loved ones becoming more of a factory than it is already.  The adamant plea of Anne to always be able to remain at home to be cared for could not have been put more earnestly than do Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) and Michael Haneke, against the fastidiously prepared, oppressive but unobtrusive sets before us.

Sonys packaging of Amour is annoyingly cheap, as though we might be dealing with something mid-cult, very B-rated here. That includes inflicting on the viewer four unsolicited previews as well. One should hope that Criterion will before long secure the rights to Amour.  No doubt this is a very sad film.  On a highly intimate, quiet level Amour compels  its viewers to work at engaging with this film There are no easy answers to come by here, nothing posted on any wall nearby; one then must be left to find ones own.  Ingmar Bergman's The Silence and Cries and Whispers come to mind, perhaps Winter Light too,, with what issues get raised.  One watches Cries and Whispers however with a little more obvious strain than one does Amour, as long esteemed a work as  it is, but perhaps in such an unwitting way Bergman spares us a little - also with his highly stylized set designs;  Haneke hardly ever does at all. Haneke interviewed makes very clear mention of form, such concern that lends this film, with much resilience, give-and-take that internally lends Haneke's work very intense focus.  Frequent silences mixed into the dialogue begin to hint at intermittently the dystopian world of Samuel Beckett.

The first work, Amour being the second, I've ever seen of Michael Haneke is of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte  (Teatro Real,  Madrid).  Most of the Beaumarchais derived contrivance, including disguises, get stripped away.  William Shimell, the Don Alfonso in Cosi, makes a cameo appearance in Amour.  One could never guess, watching Cosi, that this may be anybodys first stab at directing an opera.  Just imagine now, then if you will, what Haneke might be able to do at producing Wozzeck (or Lulu), Pelleas et Melisande, or Kat'a Kabanova? I'm off out on a limb here, but even with one arm tied behind his back, I'd entrust Haneke with La Scala's new Ernani (Verdi) this season over whom they have chosen - in a heartbeat  if only one could imagine.

Be prepared for an unflinching, quietly relentless evening of cinema, especially for a first time to watch Amour, even with still how lyrical and nuanced a manner it handles much of its subject matter and dialogue, such as one more normally characterizes good or great chamber music.
