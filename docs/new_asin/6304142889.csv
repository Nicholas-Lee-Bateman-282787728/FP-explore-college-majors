809918,5,6304142889,"A brilliant comedy with John Turturro, Samual L Jackson, Steve Buscemi, and many other notable actors.

It got fantastic reviews at the time, but it didn't stay in theaters long & somehow got missed by the mainstream. Now it's somewhat rare, and not yet on DVD. I definately suggest checking it out.",1117411200,2,299,4.75
809919,5,6304142889,"As a Brooklynite, I may be a bit biased here.  But this was the only movie I've ever seen in my life that truly nails Brooklyn to the T.  It reminds me of the streets I grew up on... but the accent was a bit underexaggerated for my liking.  Otherwise, I'd say A freakin' plus! Ay-o! Fuhgeddaboudit!",1083801600,,298,4.192982456140351
809920,4,6304142889,"if the cast doesn't warrant giving this one a look, the laughs surely will.  my theory is that the simpson's ""disco stu"" was created thanks to this one.  basically some knuckleheads help a worried mother find her alcoholic son with some slick dectective work.  the amateur sleuths basically waste time until they all end up at the same place where they continue to diss eachother.  topped off by, perhaps, one of the best fight scenes ever caught on tape outside of a deli and a supporting cast now so familiar, this one is a knee slapper. not bad at all.",1033948800,3,555,4.52
809921,1,6304142889,I have read the other reviews and I don't think I saw the same movie they did. I had to watch this movie in four sittings as I kept falling asleep while watching it.  It was far from funny.  It moved slow and had one funny character in the whole movie and that was Jimmy's dad who barely appeared.  I am shocked that so many known actors would even consider to appear in this movie.  ...,1003881600,,387,4.052631578947368
809922,5,6304142889,"I have seen this movie many times and, after several people helping me search for it, I have finally found a copy to own. I must say that I am disappointed in the lack of availability as it is a great movie, extremely funny with a remarkably talented cast of critically acclaimed actors. I would recommend this film to anyone. Everyone I have forced to watch it has agreed that it is hilarious and I hope it is re-released so lots of people will be able to enjoy it without having to ""search"" for it.",983232000,2,500,4.273684210526316
809923,4,6304142889,"This movie was really cool, it started out a little slow, but took off.  If you like a movie with a twist this is for you.  If you are not up to a truly bizarre movie do not to attempt to watch.",961286400,,194,3.5952380952380953

810021,5,6304142889,If you've been in a funk and just need to laugh a lot this is the movie to watch. I laughed so much tears came out. This is a simple and am assuming low budget movie from 1993 and it was just the perfect movie for us. Just absolutely loved it!,1517616000,,243,3.784313725490196
810022,3,6304142889,"If you're looking for a way to pass an hour and a half that's not too abysmal, you could do worse. Recommended for nostalgia buffs and fans of indie actors who made it big. Practically every Turturro you can name is in this one. Episodic, skit-ish ramble that yields some laughs and knowing smiles.",1517529600,,298,4.537037037037037

810055,1,6304142889,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Given the cast members (Steve Buscemi, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro) I thought it had promise, but frankly it was just horrible. It seemed more like a high school film project than an actual movie, and you got the impression that people were reciting lines rather than acting. Not sure how that's possible with such a high caliber cast, but somehow they managed it. I'm all for low budget indie films, but this one's really not worth the time.",1452729600,,504,4.611111111111111

810100,5,6304142889,"In Ray Mancini's book, the good son he devotes a lot of time talking about the production of this movie. He was a very integral part of this film getting made and he also has a small role in it. But he is deathly not the highlight of the movie, so if there's nothing to do after you finish the book, and the documentary and it's raining and you're all by your lonesome I suggest you watch it, I also suggest you watch a little documentary called Youngstown still standing Johnny Irish has strong connections to the Youngstown, Warren, area so all these topics hold a special place in Johnny Irish heart peace out and go Penguins respectfully Johnny Irish",1389657600,,654,4.458333333333333

810208,5,6304142889,"This oddball film isn't for everyone, but it is one of my favorites for its cast of great actors in wacky over-the-top character roles. The plot is silly, the soundtrack is a bit hokey, and the cinematography is not big-studio grade, but this little film has a lot of heart. I used to dust off the old VCR from time to time to share this film with friends, and it always gives me major laughs. I'm so glad that it is finally being released on DVD!",1347926400,,447,4.209302325581396
810209,5,6304142889,"One of my favorite movies! In my top 10 comedies of all time, for sure! I can't believe how long it took to come out on DVD, especially with the star power it has. I can FINALLY throw out my VHS copy of this.",1335830400,,208,3.75
810210,3,6304142889,"This blu-ray edition is a huge disappointment. I have loved this movie since I first saw it years ago on VHS. I purchased a VHS copy from a local video store and when I had the means I made a DVD transfer of it so I could be rid of my VCR. I pre-ordered this blu-ray out of unabashed fanboy excitement as I wanted to support the filmmakers. I hoped beyond hope that the blu-ray would offer a cleaned up, high-resolution version of the film that I love so much, but I was wrong. My gut told me not to go through with the purchase and I even tried to cancel the pre-order several times before the release date of March 6th. Each time I tried to cancel I got an error message from Amazon. The blu-ray disc came yesterday (March 10) and from the first frame I was disappointed. It looks just like the VHS to DVD transfer I made using Elgato's first generation EyeTV. With each set of cue marks (a.k.a. ""cigarette burns"") on screen the growing sense of buyer's remorse became larger and larger.
If you do not own this movie on VHS, then by all means purchase this blu-ray edition as it is worth having because the film is a great under-rated comedy, but know what you are getting! If, like me, you expect a high-definition transfer out of this blu-ray edition prepare for disappointment. If I could return it to Amazon for a refund I would, but more than likely this disc will end up on eBay in the very near future. I still love the movie, but the quality I have come to expect in a blu-ray disc is not present in this edition.",1331424000,,1523,4.255172413793104
810211,5,6304142889,Very funny movie!  Laughed the whole way through.  So glad it finally came out on DVD!! It's about time! - Sequel perhaps?????,1328832000,2,126,4.681818181818182
810212,3,6304142889,"The VHS tape arrived in a timely manner.  The box was in fairly good shape.  The video itself was a little fuzzy, but watchable.  The movie, however, was not as funny as I remember when I first watched it thirty years ago.  I am a huge fan of the characters, but in this movie I thought they were a little silly.  They have since developed into wonderful stars.",1275868800,,361,4.25
810213,5,6304142889,"This movie was a hoot the cast was awesome and a zinger of an ending. Each cast member had there own stupid brooklyn querks and I loved them all. From the ""DISCO BEAN, the Barischnicoff of Brooklyn"" to the ""subscription eye glasses."" You can appreciate the underbelly of the Brooklyn guitto in this gem. It was the type of movie that was with low budget characters and they all fit into the low budget movie. Even Paulie Walnuts from the Sopranos is in this one and he had an ""unusual"" part that was right up his alley. Just like in old Brooklyn, they snap on each other and give each other stupid names like in a mobster flick(JIMMY HEAD, LEFTY, THE WHALE, AND OF COURSE ONE EYE JIMMY). Like I said real funny. In the first minute of the movie you'll start to laugh",1241136000,,766,4.326388888888889
810214,5,6304142889,"I'm from Australia and I agree with the other reviewer wholeheartedly! The cameo performance of Jennifer Beals is a classic, but he forgot to mention the great Steve Buscemi. His is really the central role, but the whole film is so clever and hilarious!",1234483200,,253,4.7727272727272725
810215,4,6304142889,"This is one of those great films that you've probably never heard about.

When college film student Les comes back to his old Brooklyn neighborhood he stumbles on an opportunity to make a documentary: One-eye Jimmy has gone missing. With Joe Head (Michael Badalucco) as his guide they wander the streets, encountering all kinds of crazy characters, like Jimmy's brother Ed (Steve Buscemi), Disco Bean (John Turturro), Jimmy's mother (Anne Meara), and a hairdressing sketch artist (Jennifer Beals), but the two most outstanding performances come from Samuel L. Jackson as a burnt out Viet Nam Vet named Colonel Ron and Nick Turturro as Junior, the neighborhood theif.

While the DVD box attempts to capatalize on Jackson's recent popularity, his part in this film is actually rather small albeit hilarious. Nick Turturro has a much bigger and funnier part but the whole cast is excellent. Also present are Ray Mancini,Tony Sirico and Holt McCallany.

Sam Henry Kass, who also wrote the script, proves that a lot can be done with a low budget.

Unfortunately this DVD transfer leaves much to be desired; it looks no better than a VHS version that I bought several years ago. On top of that you need a multi-region DVD player to play this region 2 PAL disc from Australia. You would think that with all of the big stars, great acting and funny script that some American distributor would remaster this film and release it in a region 1 NTSC North America friendly version.

Still, it's fortunate that this movie is available at all. If you don't have a multi-region DVD player, try to find an American VHS tape of this movie - it's worth the trouble.",1187827200,3,1647,4.826241134751773
