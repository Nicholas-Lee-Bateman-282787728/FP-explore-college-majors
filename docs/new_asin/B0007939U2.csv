2205623,5,B0007939U2,"First I would like to say that this is by far some of the manliest anime ever made even though that Kawajiri had only produced 3 OVA's.

So from what I could make out about these three installments, the episodes appear to have some elements from Die Hard (Data 1), Predator (Data 2), and Alien (Data 3) all supported on the platform settings of Blade Runner and The Running Man. All set in Cyber dominated in the Japanese capitol metropolis of Oedo (formerly known as Tokyo, and prior Edo).

And what better to do those ""high risk jobs, nobody else wants"" than three mastermind criminals that are serving a sentence weighed more than their lifespan? Rather than violate the terms of your parole and your parole officer waste time with paperwork, their collars that are locked around their necks (as seen in The Running Man) can explode at the detonation of Hasegawa (The Police Lieutenant). Now that's what I call putting your neck on the line.

In most anime, you have characters fighting for someone that is personal to them, something to gain. These three men are masterminded criminals born in a utopia dominated by criminals, they don't have anybody to fight for except their freedom by catching other criminals! Which because of their timed collars, they will work even harder in catching them.

And like most anime stories, we always have the little guy, fighting against the big bully. Just watch Data 2 of this series and you'll find the bigger guy fighting the even bigger and tougher guy.",1458864000,,1499,4.753846153846154
2205624,4,B0007939U2,"I wish this set had come out before Manga UK lost their license to the series. This release of the classic Cyber City Oedo 808 series has the best video quality due to the medium, but suffers from some production issues that keep it from being a must-have, in favor of the older VHS releases.

For starters, as many have noted, the brilliant UK soundtrack is not present on this version. This is the first and only time the English dub has been made available with the original Japanese soundtrack, but I don't consider this a positive since the original music doesn't seem to match the action on the screen most of the time. There's a lot of europop-esque instrumental tracks that don't evoke the hardcore cyberpunk atmosphere. Audio options are ""English with sign and song subtitles"" and ""Japanese with subtitles"". These tracks do not mix. That is, you cannot watch the dub alongside a full subtitle track to compare the scripts, which are fairly different between English and Japanese. None of my players would give me the option of swapping the subtitles between audio tracks. They're either on the predetermined subtitles, or off entirely.

The mixing process also ended up somehow removing some dialog and created some sound fade errors in the English track. Where the mix clearly faded out in the UK version, the same dialog continues at normal volume in this new version, ending abruptly at odd points (because it was supposed to fade). One character has his lines entirely muted from the dub for no apparent reason in the second episode. A female character has a minor echo effect added to a scream in the same episode that makes it sound even more ridiculous than it already did.

The video looks decent but isn't a remaster or direct-from-film print. There is a fair amount of aliasing. It's a step up from the VHS releases for sure, but not by much. I was hoping for a copy of the original film print. Since this is labeled as the ""final collection"", I will assume that will never happen.  There probably isn't a lot of profit coming out of these old series' to warrant a remaster job.

Extras include commentaries (in Japanese with subtitles), original preview clips for the episodes, and some art galleries. A bit more than I would expect in a cheap DVD release, so there's that.

In the end, get this if you haven't seen it already. Even without the great UK soundtrack, there's still a lovely series here that any dedicated anime fan should sink their teeth into, even if just for the few hours of entertainment it will grant.",1451433600,4,2542,4.701123595505618

If you are a youth into the gifs or the webms on the tumbles or the imageboards and you like the cyberpunks you have probably seen some slick hand animated dark pastel computer 80s looking graphical candy.

Well here is the long form version of those tumbling pages with detail packed into every frame.

2205649,5,B0007939U2,"In America this dvd has a different name, and is known as Cyber City OEDO 808 in Australia, which is the first in the series called Cyber Punk. The other two are A.D. Police and Geno Cyber.

This dvd is about three men doing time and given the choice of serving their 100 years plus sentence or do odd jobs for the cyber police. There are a few conditions, they have to wear an electric collar and are given an alloted time to complete the job, or their neck is made redundant from the rest of their body. With the completion of each mission their sentance is reduced a few years.

Sengoku, Goggles and Benten are so tough any mortal would kill to be able to take what is dished out to them. Sengoku has to deal with a systems programmer who hooked himself up to a computer 15 years earlier when his partner tried to kill him. His body is long dead but the computer still works and is finally taking revenge for happened long ago. It is Sengoku's job to sort out this mess before his time runs out.

In the second episode Goggles gets to play with a new indestructible cyborg being tested for the army. The pain he endures from all manner of things is REALLY beyond any human endurance, but he wins out with a few seconds before the collar does it's work.

The last episode sees Beten taking on a vampire, who can rejuvenate himself, with almost fatal consequences. The vampire thinks he is immortal, but he learns every quick that everything that exists must sooner or later come to an end, that is the law of the universe.

As with most manga, this one is no exception, and I give it five stars as I am a manga nut. I would recommend it to any other manga junkie out there, and to tell them to get the others in the series as well. This would be a much welcomed addition to any collection, but overseas people should be aware of the titles as they are different in America.",1357344000,,1875,4.270422535211267

2205651,3,B0007939U2,"Cybercity Oedo 808 is a very difficult anime to review, because depending on which version you watched, your impressions will be wildly different. There are three versions of the show, only two of which are available on these DVDs. The first is the original Japanese version (available here), the second is the English dub with the original Japanese score by Kazz Toyama (also available here), and the third is the English dub with a revised score recorded by Rory McFarlane (not available here). The three versions are so different that my first thought before I began writing this review was, ""So...which version should I be reviewing, exactly?""

To explain the differences will be quite complicated, so let's start with what's similar. The story is the same across all three versions. Several centuries into the future, due to the abundance of crime, most criminals are now stored in off-planet space prisons that orbit the Earth. However, the lawlessness is so severe that the Japanese government decided to revive an ancient practice called homen, in which imprisoned criminals are recruited into law enforcement agencies and given limited freedom, with complete freedom guaranteed to them eventually in exchange for apprehending other criminals. Essentially, for every criminal they apprehend, the government subtracts a few years from their sentence until such time as they no longer have a sentence left, at which point they are freed. In the mean time, a collar rigged with remotely-detonated explosives--controlled by the Police Chief--is wrapped around their necks as leverage to ensure that they follow their orders.

The story of ""Cybercity Oedo 808"" follows three such criminals, who are freed from their space prison in exchange for working in the Special Service section of the police. Police Chief Hasegawa recruits Sengoku (the guy with the black hair), Gogl (the guy with the mohawk) and Benten (the guy--and yes, that is a guy--in the pink armor). Spanning three forty-minute episodes, each episode focuses on one of the criminals (Sengoku, Gogl, and Benten respectively), although all of them appear in each episode.

Episode I, Sengoku's Episode: A skyscraper's central computer is hacked, and Hasegawa sends the three anti-heroes to try and rescue the fifty thousand people trapped inside the skyscraper when the hacked computer locks down the building. While trying to figure out who's responsible, Sengoku uncovers a chilling tale of murder and betrayal, with all clues mysteriously pointing to a dead man as being the one responsible for the hacking...

Episode II, Gogl's Episode: Hasegawa suspects illegal activity in the military after a strange murder, and sends Sengoku and Benten on a covert operation to infiltrate a military HQ and investigate. Meanwhile, Gogl's old partner, Sarah, seeks his help in running from the military after she steals classified info from them. Unfortunately for Gogl, he is an unknowing pawn in a military plan involving a deadly new weapon...

Episode III, Benten's Episode: The three anti-heroes are told to investigate a series of mysterious murders where the victims are found with bite marks on their necks, much like a vampire. Benten's research leads him to a pharmaceutical company, its corrupt CEO, and an enigmatic female test subject...and when he becomes emotionally attached to his case, he is forced choose between his eventual freedom and his personal beliefs...

All three episodes are done very well in that they are half-mystery, half-action, rather than committing solely to either. The creators of this series have a wonderful way of setting up a situation so that the viewer can get emotionally invested in the characters, which always makes the action scenes much more intense. If anything, the greatest accomplishment that works across all three versions is that this show is proof that stories with good twists and turns are not incompatible with good action.

The animation, while outdated by today's standards, is not bad by any means. The character designs are unique, the battle scenes are very fast-paced for an early 90's anime, and some of the imagery is very dark and unique. So while not particularly excellent, I would describe it as solid. It's never glorious, but it's never bad.

That's about where the similarities end, though.

The English dub for this series was produced by Manga Entertainment in 1994, and was recorded in the UK (initially for TV, and then later released to VHS). This is rather unusual given that almost all English anime dubs are done either in the US or in Canada, but perhaps even more unusual is that the British actors decided to feign American accents (although--and I say this as an American--they do an exceedingly good job at it for the most part). Furthermore, the adaptation of the English scripts was not exactly the most loyal adaptation ever produced. While it was not terrible by any means, and while it most certainly didn't extend to a complete re-writing of the plot like some other dubs did, the English script was a reflection of Manga Entertainment's business methods at the time. They were very much trying to appeal to the late teenager/young adult crowd with every anime they dubbed, and re-wrote the script to be much darker than the original Japanese script, most notably through the addition of many, many, MANY four-letter curse words that were not at all present in the original version. For this reason, I would feel comfortable showing the original Japanese version to anyone in their young-to-mid teens and give it a PG-13 rating, but I would only show the English dub to people in their late teens or early twenties and give it an R rating.

Perhaps most importantly, though...when this series originally aired in Britain in 1994, the original musical score by Kazz Toyama, consisting of slower, jazzier, synthesized music was tossed aside in favor of faster, more rock and heavy metal-oriented score composed by Rory McFarlane. This was, much like the adaptation of the English script, a reflection of Manga Entertainment's policy at the time of appealing to an older audience.

...And I'd be lying if I said I didn't think the English dub, with the revised score by Rory McFarlane, was easily the most superior of the three versions.

It really pains me to say that. I'm normally of the belief that an English dub should be a faithful adaptation of the original Japanese material. I don't mind subtitles, but I don't prefer them because I want to have the original Japanese experience emulated in English. In Japan, the Japanese audiences don't need subtitles to understand anime--they can just sit back and experience the show rather than read it. That, in my mind, is the point of a dub. It allows English-speaking audiences to sit back and experience the show rather than read it, much like how the Japanese enjoy their anime in Japan. So I am normally a strict believer in the idea that an English dub should be a faithful adaptation of the source material, and not re-written to pander to a different audience.

As much as I hate to admit it, though, the version that was not a particularly faithful emulation of the original material, and the version that was produced to pander to an older crowd...is so much better (in my opinion, of course)! While the original Japanese cast is composed of very competent actors, there's no sense of difference in personality between the three main characters at all. They're all just lower-voiced, slow-talking tough guys. In the English dub, the three voices are all very different both in sound and in attitude. Sengoku, slow-talking and lazy-sounding when voiced by Hiroya Ishimaru in Japanese, is turned into a fast-talking, brash, enraged, curse-spewing loudmouth when voiced by Bruce Martin in English. Gogl, slow-talking and lazy-sounding when voiced by Tessho Genda in Japanese, is turned into a tough-sounding, confident, and intelligent observer when voiced by Sean Barrett in English. Benten, slow-talking and lazy-sounding when voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa in Japanese, is turned into a soothing, melodious, soft-spoken poet and warrior when voiced by Daniel Flynn in English. In the English version, there are distinct and memorable characters, rather than voice actors who sound like they're phoning in their performances. To put it in less official terms, in English, it really feels like Sengoku, Gogl, and Benten, whereas in Japanese it simply sounds like Guy #1, Guy #2, and Guy #3.

The exact same concept applies to the music. The original Japanese score, which seems slow and uninspired when put up against the action scenes that it was composed for, pales in comparison to the loud, high-octane, rock-based English score that truly helps to establish a sense of urgency where the Japanese score did not. A perfect example of this is one of the opening scenes of Episode I. Sengoku, in an attempt to catch a criminal fleeing on an airship, raises a drawbridge so that he can drive his car up the raised drawbridge at a high speed, catapult his car into the air, drop out of his car as he flies over the ship, and apprehend the criminal. In Toyama's score, a rather monotonous synthesizer-based tune drags on throughout the entirety of this event, with a light, slow-paced electric guitar solo towards the end. At no point does the music adjust to the on-screen action. In McFarlane's score, a thundering tempo of bass and drums begins as soon as the drawbridge is raised, slowly building up in intensity until Sengoku puts the car in gear, at which point a blaring loud electric guitar solo shoots through the speakers. Toyama's score made Sengoku's maneuver seem like an every-day, unimpressive occurrence, whereas McFarlane's score emphasized the speed and danger of Sengoku's (highly unusual) maneuver.

Most unfortunately, this very memorable combination of acting and music is not available on these DVDs. Or any DVDs, for that matter. Why is that? To put it bluntly, legal issues. Manga Entertainment eventually lost the rights to this series, and this series did not receive a DVD release until the early new millennium, at which point it was licensed by Madman Entertainment for the UK and Australia, and U.S. Manga Corp for North America. Rather than produce a new dub, they bought the rights to the '94 dub recorded by Manga Entertainment. They did not, however, buy the rights to McFarlane's score, opting instead to stick with Toyama's score. You can still get a great (if not particularly loyal) English dub with Toyama's less-than-stellar score, or a less-than-stellar set of performances on the Japanese end with Toyama's less-than-stellar score and English subtitles. The only way to watch the English dub with McFarlane's superior score is to buy the old VHS release from 1994. Unfortunately, VHS degrades in quality with time. So the only way to see the English dub with Mcfarlane's score AND in pristine quality...would be to have been watching British television in 1994 when they aired it. A high-quality digital release of the English dub with McFarlane's soundtrack will, it seems, never be available.

I will close on one last observation, since it seems to sum up the entire situation. In the 1994 Manga Entertainment release, this show was uncensored, but technically not unedited. All instances of Japanese letters were replaced with English letters, so all writing in that release appears in English rather than in Japanese (all Japanese writing is restored for the DVD release). I honestly couldn't tell, because the editing was so seamless. It truly helped to draw me into the story, even if this story was essentially a story with a different tone than what was originally intended. This new tone, and this new presentation, was a much more fun, unique, and enjoyable experience than the original Japanese version ever was. Unfortunately, without Rory McFarlane's score, that experience will never see the light of day on DVD.",1335484800,61,11974,5.079816980172852

Was plesantly surprised.  **Minor Spoilers, nothing that will ruin your viewing**.  This short series focuses in on 3 criminals with rediculously long criminal records.  Well not so long, (I work in law enforcement and there are people you could literally run outside and wrap their criminal history printouts around the building, if you printed it on Dot Matrix paper...)  Anyway these 3 badassess are offered a reprieve.  Work for the police and get out of their space prison they are marooned on.  They all three accept.  The bad catch for them is they have collars on their necks like in The Running Man that will blow off their heads at any time.  The ""Probation Officer"" gives them missions they must complete, and complete in certain time limits he sets.  With theirs clocks ticking literally they have to go in and resolve back situations...and fast.  Each episode focus's in on a different of the three.  So each episode has a slightly different feel.  I bought mine for under 10 bucks off Amazon.  Recommend you not pay anymore than this, as this is rather short, around 60 minutes.  Still good viewing though

Secondly, people complain about the swearing.  Personally, that's what I think adds to the fun factor of this show.  The swearing is so over-the-top and unnecessary and overdone, you just gotta laugh at it.  This show has some great one liners, including, ""I'm downloading you straight into hell!"" and, ""You wouldn't recognize a goddamn vampire if one jumped up and bit you on the end of your ****ing dick.""  Now how can you not want to watch this show when you know that lines like that are in it?

There are three episodes, and 3 main characters.  Each episode focuses on one of the three men who are prisoners who get collars put on them so that they act like police, going after criminals and doing what they're told by the higher-up, all for the sake of having their sentences reduced.  Each episode has all 3 characters doing a specific assigned mission, but each episode basically has one guy doing the most work, hence the main character for the episode.  I thought the first episode was the best, as each episode afterwards got more and more over-the-top unbelievable, and not in a cheesy way, mainly in ways where characters survive against too much unbelievable stuff, more and more suspension of disbelief is required, etc.  For example, in the last episode, the main character goes to a structure in space through an elevator connected from earth (the ground) all the way through the atmosphere and into space and to a connected space station.  Just that alone outta let you know how unbelievable it gets, but then there's the main character surviving in the elevator shaft after a conflict.  But despite all that, the show is still good fun.

That said, the last episode didn't feel like a final episode.  All it did was get us familiar with the final character in the main trio.  There should've been one more where all three character become the focus, where they are all directly put into a big conflict that shakes the foundations of the series, such as going on an assignment to protect the guy who put the collars on them, or finding a way to get the collars off, or none of the above but still giving us something else.  But alas, it's not meant to be.  Was tempted to give this show 3 stars, but decided it was entertaining enough for 4, especially with the price it currently has, and for the great foul-mouthed lines.

This is a hidden gem that everyone is surprised by upon their first viewing, due especially to what I would describe as western graphic novel-like pacing and narrative than something most would consider Japanese. Can't beat the price, this disk is as featured as the most elaborate Akira tin (in all except packaging) with a plethora of language and subtitle features. It is well worth the >$5 it can readily be acquired for on Amazon.",1308787200,7,513,4.711111111111111

The English dub is also fantastically hilarious with its strangely amusing curse words that bring a smile to my face every time I hear it. The show also features great animation, (not surprising since it only has 3 episodes) when i ask people if they remember this show they say they dont, REALLY? its one of the craziest shows in the universe!

8046055,5,B0007939U2,A series that was cut way too short.  The minds behind Ninja Scroll bring the same buttery smooth animation to the story of a trio of cyber prisoners turned begrudging policemen.  Profanity abounds in the 80s in your face style of movies like 48 hours with some interesting characters that really should have seen a full 24 episode series.,1501632000,,339,4.728813559322034
