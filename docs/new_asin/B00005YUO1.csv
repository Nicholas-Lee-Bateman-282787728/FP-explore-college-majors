1678658,5,B00005YUO1,"Absolutely one of the finest films of the year (okay, that may not be saying very much, but give it a shot, you won't be sorry).
Chilling chamber piece: brilliant script, flawless performances all-around -- particularly Kenneth Branagh who is sublime.
Also one of the greatest historic dramas ever made.  If you like great flicks, great acting, great screenwriting, movies about World War II, movies about the Holocaust, movies about anything really -- you'll appreciate this one!",1017100800,2,480,5.233766233766234
1678659,5,B00005YUO1,"This is possibly the greatest movie ever made showing the true proficient management evil of the Third Reich with regard to genocide. Immense power is demonstrated by General Heidrich hosting the meeting by the S.S. Anyone doubting the existence of true EVIL in this world will now see it depicted in this movie.
  The efficiency, attitude and businesslike approach of all participants in this conference to agree on the ""Final Solution"" is appalling professional and each character depicted by the various actors participating in the conference is memorable.
  This movie is truly outstanding and its depths are chilling.",1017100800,2,622,5.316326530612245
1678660,5,B00005YUO1,"Television doesn't get much better than this. A superb film with top notch performances with Branagh, Stanley Tucci and David Threlfall standing out. Do not miss this under any cicumstances.",1017014400,,190,5.366666666666666
1678661,5,B00005YUO1,"I saw this when it aired on HBO, after hearing the rave reviews some friends gave it.  The film is exceptionally well-made, with precise attention to every little detail.  You almost feel like you're there in 1942.
The performances all around are simply superb, most especially from Kenneth Branaugh, who once again establishes a strong screen presence.  He's just a joy to watch.
What's great about this film is the creepy sense it gives you watching it.  This is a meeting that actually took place in 1942.. while there are no doubt a few of the usual Hollywood refinements, this is all-around a true story.  Considering the subject matter.. It's a little spooky to see these fifteen men sitting around a table discussing a chain of events that would scar history forever, in such a lackadaisical way, as though they were discussing the weather over a cup of tea.
Because of it's true-to-life subject matter, this could almost be viewed as an educational film, and I intend to show this to my children as part of their education concerning the German atrocities committed during WWII.  ""Never Again"", as the plague before the walls of Auschwitz states.
But all around, this is a must-see.  Rent it if you can, buy it for your collection, or catch it the next time HBO airs it.  You'll definitely want to see this one.  You'll remember it.",1016496000,12,1340,4.741379310344827
1678662,5,B00005YUO1,"I saw this movie on an around the world trip in Nov. 2001.  It was so good I watched again and again on each flight it was offered.

1678687,5,B00005YUO1,"Engrossing and well acted re-enactment of the now infamous board meeting of top Nazi officials faced with what would be notoriously known as ""the final solution"".  This is a wonderful addition to the history of WW2 and a thoughtful insight into human nature, which could turn on a whim of a 90 minute meeting to construct the ultimate fate of millions of people.  I didn't realize so many of this high level officials were lawyers: a wonderful line in this story is, when one of the lawyers is asked a question he states that as a lawyer he no longer trusts language!!  How true.  Semantics can cover heinous activities by calling these activities another name!  Wonderful film.",1515888000,,678,4.760683760683761
1678688,5,B00005YUO1,"This is a chilling movie, adapted from the only copy of notes and the agenda left from the meeting known as the ""Wansee Conference."" It is a view of the meeting chaired by Reinhard Heydrich discussing the ""final solution"" to the ""Jewish problem."" And that's why is so chilling: the casual discussion over the issue, the universal acceptance of the eventual deaths of millions, and how to dispose of their remains: they talk about it like they're discussion next year's farm crops... Kenneth Branagh is amazing as Heydrich: he seems like your best friend until you disagree with him, and though the smile never fades, the eyes go cold and hard, and you know your life is now at stake. Stanley Tucci as Adolf Eichmann shows how he was just an underling, a ""faceless bureaucrat,"" worried more about keeping in budget and being a sycophant to his superiors more than anything else. The whole cast is superb, but Coilin Firth is the another standout as Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, more concerned that everyone is keeping within the letter of the law while killing the Jews than any regard for life. Finally, the fact that they filmed it in the actual house in Wansee where the original conference took place - a house formerly owned by a Jew, I might add - just lends more credence to the movie. All in all, a must-see for any student of history in general, and WWII in particular.",1515888000,,1370,4.6419753086419755

The acting is really superb and I was left just staring at an empty screen wondering how evil at this level existed so close in time to us. If you are seeking to better understand how a people can become so callous and cold, this movie is a glimpse into the architect of the Final Solution and his control over the party and people. Super. Follow it with Anthropoid to see the demise of the same man months later. Also a superb film.",1515715200,,559,4.283018867924528

1678694,5,B00005YUO1,This movie was very interesting to say the least. It's so unreal that these people at the time actually talked about these issues like they were in a board meeting with no emotions what so ever just this and that needs to be done.

Research had me finding Klopfer was known as a gentlemen, and not obese as well. He most assuredly was a Nazi, and collaborated with the Final Solution, but McNeice was poorly cast as Klopfer..  Nit picking; Daniels is not a dead ringer for Buhler - but played the role excellent.  Firth, Tucci, Threlfall - top of their game.  Much is not known as to what exactly was said here; Luther's notes and record were not that copious. But, the tone and nature of this meeting were I believe  - well done.

I was probably inspired to watch this movie by Charlottesville and by the rise of Nazi's and the KKK in our politics. This movie crystallizes just how dangerous this ideology is and clarifies that there are no ""good and fine people"" among them. It is truly frightening that there was a whole country consumed by this ideology and outcome of it is horrifying. This movie depicts the casual plotting of the holocaust and everyone should see it.

It is actually fiction marketed as historical fact, and few people after watching any films, let alone those about WWII, the facts behind the film and where the film diverges.

1678755,5,B00005YUO1,"I recently purchased from Amazon Video what turned out to be one of the most absorbing and fascinating historical dramas I have seen in a very long time.

The film is Conspiracy, a 2001 made-for-television docudrama from HBO. It tells the story of the Wannsee Conference of 1942, a notorious gathering of senior Nazi government officials who finalized plans for Hitlers Final Solution  the extermination of six million European Jews. Conspiracy stars, among others, Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci, Colin Firth, and David Threlfall. Based in part upon the sole surviving transcript of the Wannsee Conference, it is an extraordinary film that both educates and entertains.

In January 1942, a group of high- and mid-ranking Nazi SS officers and civilian government bureaucrats gathered around a massive conference table at a villa in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee, to discuss ways of implementing Adolf Hitlers long-planned Final Solution. Reinhard Heydrich (Branagh), one of Hitlers most senior Nazi officials, called the meeting at Hitlers behest.  Lt Col Adolf Eichmann (Tucci), of later international infamy, organized the conference and served as its recording secretary.

As Conspiracy shows, these men discussed the Final Solution in great detail  personnel, logistics, the building of extermination camps, and the mind-boggling numbers of Jews to be eventually exterminated were just a few of the topics. Whats especially chilling is how these men talked about these subjects with a complete lack of conscience, or even an awareness of the enormous crimes against humanity they were conspiring to commit. With very few exceptions, every conference attendee spoke enthusiastically in favor of the proposed plan. Only one man  Dr. Wilhelm Kritzinger (Threlfall)  expressed any moral or ethical reservations about it, and he did so only in a private conversation with Heydrich.

Although Conspiracy is strictly a dialogue film  the only action scenes are of a waiter dropping a stack of fine china dinner plates, and of a snowball fight among enlisted soldiers  it is far from dull. The acting is first-rate, the screenplay moves the story forward at a fast pace, and the subject matter is utterly fascinating.

Watching Conspiracy, I learned a lot about how the Nazis planned for and implemented the most heinous and horrific crimes ever committed against humanity.  Conspiracy is a film that should be seen by everyone. Most highly recommended.",1499472000,2,2448,5.360313315926893

1678771,5,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is an outstanding 2001 movie from HBO Studios, which depicts the top-secret 1942 Wannsee Conference of Nazi leadership, conducted at a beautiful lakeside villa in the Wannsee section of southwestern Berlin. The picturesque setting for the conclave belies the evil purpose for this surreptitious gathering of high-ranking SS and government officials, which is to debate the merits of the proposed ""Final Solution,"" a plan for the extermination of the entire Jewish population of Europe. In actuality, and unbeknownst to some of the participants, the ""Final Solution"" is basically a done deal at this point, and has already begun to be implemented, albeit on a much smaller scale than the sinister plot that is being proposed. ""Conspiracy"" is an interesting, intelligent, and decidedly chilling film, which features excellent writing and superb acting. The ensemble cast is absolutely stellar, and is led by such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci, Colin Firth, David Threlfall, Ian McNeice, Kevin McNally, and Brendan Coyle, and includes the rising star Tom Hiddleston, in one of his first film roles. ""Conspiracy"" is a highly thought-provoking and compelling historical drama, which portrays the details of the strategy meeting that set the stage for the Holocaust, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1496016000,7,1358,5.502392344497608

The efficiency of the SS was impressive but clearly through intimidation as there was resistance in degree more than in magnitude among the attendees.  This is depicted upon meeting notes found after the war and if accurate, it was noteworthy to see the dissension within the meeting brought to order despite morals....clearly Nazi intimidation implemented through the SS was key.

1678819,5,B00005YUO1,"I watched a movie last night that was very well done. It was rather painful, in a very non-melodramatic way. You see a dozen men in a room, politicking and networking their way through a dinner party. By the end the three men with integrity have been tested, threatened, strained, and broken. It all happens around a table, with mahogany and crystal and salmon.

I cant recommend it enough. I think it does a good job showing the best and worst in people. You see the courage of the men before they crack, all hemmed in by Babel and its darkness. Something about this movie reminded me of Paul Scofields A Man for all Seasons. Its a small story of a human conscience.

Every twenty-year old in the country should be required to watch this. It is about when society goes bad, when our civilization erases our humanity, and you are called to the test. This one is sad: they strain and they crack. And yet, you see their struggle. And you find yourself praying that, at the end of time, they will be forgiven for the evil they have done.

And their surrender to evil does not seem inevitable. As you watch the dinner party, you keep thinking, perhaps it could have gone another way. They had something, before they went belly up. But it isn't despairing, Because we have their inheritance, the good and the bad. And every generation falls like a new layer of fresh white snow.",1487980800,5,1373,4.484

It's a shame that very little proof or dictation of this event remains today, most is hypothetical and highly dramatized, but if your a WW2 buff or a Nazi enthusiast most definitely study this movie and compare to what is provable and what is hypothetical, the true conclusion anyone can come to, logically, is there is NO possible way the numbers that Germany is blamed for killing Jews is easily proven to be false..
 Stalin and the Soviets killed 5x more than the Nazis ever did, so why don't we are movies, books and studies on those events? Why you wonder??? Because history is written by the victors, which will always look like the good guys. The allies commited just as many war crimes and atrocities if not more than Nazis Germany ever did.

1678990,5,B00005YUO1,"I gave 5 stars because of the documentary, 0 stars as I did not like what they did.  The movie claims they did not have enough food and Americans would not take them and the war already started.  They talked about sterilization but the strong hands wanted the death camps.  Mainly it was just an order by Heydrich, with Hitler secretly agreeing and knowing about it. Sad part is you see the qualities of these people on both sides of the aisle and our internment camps could have turned out the wrong way with the wrong leader.  The world balances on a pin.  That is why leaders must not only say they are for peace they must show they are in their actions including things like having small deficits.  They even mentioned some of the hated came from ruining of the money.  Sad part almost all raised hands saying they were lawyers.",1485648000,,832,4.434210526315789
1678991,4,B00005YUO1,"This is the second version of these events I have seen on film.  A German film made perhaps 20 years, ""The Wannsee Conference,"" covered the same territory.  Given that there is reportedly but one copy of the minutes of this world-historic meeting, at which the ""final solution to the Jewish issue"" was proposed and developed, the German film was more sparing in its characterizations than the English-language film is.  In the film under review here, Eichmann's closing comment as the planners departed, listening to a Schubert quintet that had been put on the record player by Heydrich, to the effect that Schubert was too sentimental, seems gratuitous.  It surely would not have been part of the minutes on which the film was based.  But it does add a small interpretative texture to what was a meeting of bureaucrats, lawyers, party hacks, and SS men.

All that said, the film is riveting.  How could it not be?  It depicts in the birth, not of the Hitlerian effort to kill huge numbers of Jews -- that was already well underway when the Wannsee meeting took place  -- but with the decision to inflict systematic torment and slaughter on all Jews that fell into the hands of the Third Reich, and to accomplish this in industrially, by the creation of murder factories.  Nevertheless, Kenneth Branagh's decision to cast himself in the role of Reinhard Heydrich detracts somewhat from the overall effect.  He mouthes the monstrous Heydrich's words ably, but he does not display much hint of the profound menace conveyed in photos and accounts of the SS's no. 2 figure, the Protector of Bohemia & Moravia.  In any case, this film is well worth seeing; what's more, and more important, the depiction of this snowy winter afternoon at a lodge on a Berlin lake is well worth contemplating.",1485648000,3,1786,4.819672131147541

Not to say there is no death and mayhem in this movie -- that is all they talk about. It is a compelling examination of the Wannsee Conference that determined the direction of total extinction of the Jewish population in Europe. While the subject is disturbing, you can see how even highly intelligent men who did not agree with the total annihilation could find themselves agreeing in the end (watch the movie to understand that).

1679224,5,B00005YUO1,"all-star cast and great acting all around. A story very vital to be told. Based on the only surviving notes fom the real meeting. What strikes me most is how a few brave nazi souls try in vane to argue reason against the ""going with the flow"" proposition manipulated by the SS Elite for the final solution of the Jews.  They are outnumbered and realize the monster created by the Nazi movement is snowballing to a level beyond humanity such that Germany and its' more reasoned people could never recover from.  As you watch, contemplate how many situations you have observed or been involved in (at home, friends,  or especially at work ) where ""getting with the program""  or ""going with the flow"" is the writing on the wall facing you.  This is one meeting where that context had consequences unimagineable. Learn and be brave when you really want to speak against.

This film also serves to juxtapose a German / Nazi period of ellimination against our current history and test of wills toward largely middle east refugees that Germany has stood up to take in while other nations (like Hungary ) have re-enacted the very  Nazi actions in the 1930's that formed the base for this dark period.  There can be some hope when future generations from barbaric societies take seriously the burden they must carry "" to never repeat"" such a crime. And that in such dark periods, there are lights of reason and hope even amongst the ranks of the enemy.

Only too easy to see how too much power in the hands of a few can do something so unimaginable and it can happen again if not as you read this. I know Obama can't keep his lips off of the mirror but on his watch the last year alone some 90k Christians have been systematically targeted in the middle east for extermination.

Didn't have to worry about falling asleep watching this one late at night. They say ""truth is stranger than fiction"" and this movie shows how it just can be.

1679308,4,B00005YUO1,"Surreal, knowing people actually thought like this and did this just boggles the mind. Realizing it is a pretty close approximation of what happened is even sadder. Even those advocating against genocide where still advocating strongly torture, slavery, castration, imprisonment, ext. Perhaps though as the story suggested they had been coerced into accepting actions as some where into these actions.

They did and show that disagreement could lead to horrible consequences. As a way of explaining what could make a human being agree to such things. But honestly I don't know I just can't see such horrible actions ever being justified. I mean, they agreed to genocide. Does it matter why? Even if it was to protect their family... what is that 50 people, compared to the murder of millions of people.

It was depressing at the end to see how many of the people who attended that meeting and that few received any significant punishment, if any at all. Really made me tear up at the end. Death penalties really should have happened, for all of them.",1483747200,,1050,4.893258426966292

Will radical religious terrorists treat us (meaning Christians) the same if they had the chance?  Would we Christians treat non Christians in this way?  I worry about the rhetoric of the present day edging closer to this all the time; ban them, bomb them, annihilate all those who don't think the way we do.",1483574400,,478,4.448275862068965

This included a surviving transcript and Adolf Eichmann's testimony at his 1961 trial in Israel. The film does a good job of giving an idea of the thought processes and parochial perspectives of the Wannsee Conference attendees. There is some dissent among the attendees regarding mass murder of the Jews yet the dissenters were easily persuaded to go along even if they kept their individual doubts, perhaps not unlike how the populace at large permitted such horrific acts to be perpetrated by the Nazi government.",1483315200,,650,5.1415094339622645

I cannot comprehend how difficult it must have been for the actors to put themselves in their roles, acting so despicable and at ease with the topic of the film. I commend each one of them for performing their roles to such an end that it makes the subject matter come alive. The Holocaust was real and sickening, at best. The real men at this conference were only some of the horrid men who made the death of millions of Jews possible. It took many thousands of soldiers and others to carry out the plan. I am not sure how these people could have gone on and survived without a conscience. They are just about all gone now, since it's been over 75 years since the war's end. I can only hope their families can deal with the unspeakable horrors which their relatives undertook, whether as a duty or enthusiastically.

This is a film which everyone needs to see, especially those who disbelieves the facts of the Hitler era and how he and his staff created one of the most inhuman and despicable campaigns to kill people.",1481500800,2,1287,4.4491525423728815

It would have improved the narrative if there were more scenes outside the confines of the one room where the discussion took place.

Lange came across as some sort of thinking man and he was as bad a Naz1i ideologue as they came.  What can you say about Heydrich?  He had a deep appreciation for Schubert, was a family man, was skilled in the fine arts and was Adolf's murdering henchman.  Kenneth Branagh just seems too nice a guy, despite is ability to act.  Eichmann deserved worse than the Israeli hanging he got.  Still, this HBO film appears to follow the spirit of what went on at Wannsee.  I think it important and historically significant to get a feel how low humanity can go as you watch a group of men casually discuss murdering 60,000 people a day over a light lunch.",1475884800,2,792,4.4825174825174825

The meeting adjourned and participants left saying. Bye, see you again soon. Clearly an important but seemingly routine gathering of administrators to formalize the plan for extermination of millions.

Die Wannseekonferenz showed Eichmann in a more realistic servile manner, Heydrich as far more powerful, Lange as far less sympathetic, as well as the others closer to their historical images.

1680056,3,B00005YUO1,"I didn't watch this movie to the end. Because frankly, it's boring. Maybe if I had watched the rest my opinion would be different.

The movie is about a real-life meeting that occurred during World War 2, where a group of Nazi leaders discussed how to kill all the Jews. And I get the point: These men are meeting in a luxury conference center, a beautiful building with fine furniture, surrounded by parks and a lake, eating gourmet food, well-dressed and well-mannered ... while they calmly discuss how to murder millions of people. I think it was C.S. Lewis who said that the worst sins today are not committed in dirty back alleys, but it air conditioned offices with plush carpeting by people wearing expensive suits who don't need to raise their voices.

The problem is that after about the first ten minutes, they have nothing more to say. It's a profound point, and I feel a little guilty about dismissing it. But you get the point in the first ten minutes, and then they basically just keep repeating that same point over and over.

Indeed, I think the actors ruined the point a little by being actors. I mean, the whole point is that these men just calmly discussed how to murder people in the same way one would discuss how to fix a broken chair or invest for retirement. But actors like to show their acting skill by demonstrating great emotion, and so every disagreement is played up dramatically. There are points where they have little turf wars -- my department should be responsible for this, not yours -- and disagreements over technicalities -- like what is the definition of a ""Jew"". The movie would have made the point more effectively if they had calmly discussed these like people will debate the relative merits of investing in stocks versus bonds. Instead they get very emotional at points. I suspect much more emotional than the real participants got.",1469923200,2,1877,4.699088145896656

1680401,5,B00005YUO1,"Ok, I'm getting the feeling here that Hitler was indeed being kept in the dark on some of this stuff. Not that he would have been sad that all the Jews in Europe had vanished, mind you. Furthermore, though they may have thought they could and hoped to  kill and cremate 10,000 or more Jews a day in Auschwitz, the process time took allot longer than expected. The numbers even today are highly exaggerated. I always thought it strange that the Nazis did not build a more efficient gas chamber with a slanted floor where the bodies could be rolled onto a belt that dropped bodies into a giant blast furnace. Instead, they have a few living skeletons who were weak from starvation drag the bodies by the neck with canes, throw them seven at a time on an elevator, hoist them to an upper floor, and throw them into crematoriums that took at least 3 hours to burn a body. Sorry, but the numbers don't add up and that was so out of character for Germans who are known for their ingenuity. Even modern crematoriums take 90 minutes to burn a body.  Overall, great movie.

In one afternoon interrupted by three breaks for refreshments every opinion is stated but by  an almost unanimous decision the vote approves the use of gas in the  camps -- faster and less expensive than firing squads.,1464307200,,348,4.596774193548387
1680489,5,B00005YUO1,"So much accomplished in an afternoon that the world should be boggled by the injustice done over a meal. At first I was reminded of another great move ""12 Angry Men"" in how it very effectively captured the sentiments of those around the table. As much as I realize Hollywood had it's artistic license, so much was unveiled during the trials that it seems hard to imagine much embellishment was necessary.

This meeting was so mundane, yet so calculatingly accomplished one of the world's greatest sins ever known...And this is how evil is accomplished in the world today...Without remorse or conscience.

I will add this movie to my top 10 of all time...And top 5 of my favorite war movies...

So simple, so powerful...Never boring...You would do well to watch and learn about the history of the Final Solution.

1680551,5,B00005YUO1,"A most interesting and intriguing movie which is non-fiction since the minutes of the meeting at the Wannsee Conference were found by the U.S. Army after the war.  At first, I had watched a number of times; then it dawned on me that the entire lot of attendees at the conference were all for the elimination of the Jews.  I had thought that maybe 2 men had deep in their hearts pity or humanity.  I was wrong.  Germany, meaning the SS, should have spared the male adults and put them to work as slaves in the military industry.  Then, after Hitler had beaten Russia, they could have done away with the remaining Jews.  The movie describes the initial pitiful operations to eliminate the Jews by shooting or inside trucks with the exhaust pumped in.  Then we find out commercial ovens could accommodate 60,000 Jews per day via the gas in the showers and total elimination by commercial ovens with very little ash left over.  That premise did not hold up well since body ashes blanketed the entire area.  There is nothing said about the fate of the hundreds of thousands (probably in the millions) of Russian POW's.",1463702400,,1113,4.6091370558375635

1680600,5,B00005YUO1,"It is hard to believe this was a made for tv movie. It is filmmaking at its finest. With its excellent cast, the film tells the story of the infamous Wannsee Conference of  January 1942, which was attended by  the fifteen highest ranked Nazis.  This conference was  called for by Reinhard Heidrich, the SS Chief of Security, and organized by his deputy, Adolf Eichmann. At this top secret meeting, Hitler's plan for the ""Final Solution""  for all Jews in German occupied territories was discussed and agreed upon.

The cast is superb, overall. Kenneth Brannaugh was cast as Reinhard Heydrich. Stanley Gucci played the role of Adolf Eichmann. Colin Firth was cast as Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, the architect of the notorious Nuremberg laws. All three actors received Emmy nominations. Kevin Brannaugh actually received an Emmy, and rightly so. His was a beautifully nuanced, masterful and absolutely chilling performance. Kudos also go to the director, Frank Pierson, for extracting such fine performances from the entire cast and creating a noteworthy made for television film.

It's hard to put into words this subject. The movie humanizes those involved and at the same times shows them to be the monsters that they were. A young(ish) Stanley Tucci plays Adolph Eichmann, assistant to Reinhard Heydrich (Kenneth Branagh). Tucci's acting in this piece is first rate. He is neither over the top nor under the radar.

This evangelical great-granny just took a sad trip down memory lane watching ""Conspiracy."".
I was born before the war commenced.  The male enlistees in our family were in the Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, & Navy.  They took lots of photos.  An uncle & a cousin died in Europe: an AF co-pilot & an Army infantryman.  There were Purple Hearts & one bronze star,
The most horrific photos we have were taken in Germanyof gas chambers & the associate camps.  An uncle took photos of a huge pile of human skeletons (flesh burned off) at one camp; plus, stacks of both eyeglasses & gold fillings.
Watching this film, it was tough to hear how the Third Reich forged alliancesor demanded allegiancesw/their various department heads, Latvia, and so on.
The first half of the movie was upsetting; the last quarter gut-wrenching and brought tears.  Memories of WW II still hurt.
Back in the olden days, 4th-6th graders were shown true-to-the-facts war movies.  Wish this were still done as too many youngsters, today, don't know the history of our nation or the world.  Today, too many across the globe say there was no holocaust.",1457913600,,1272,4.719457013574661

Any student has learned of these horrors in classrooms since the end of WW II, but how many know how this came about?  Was it something that just occurred or even spontaneously happened?  Nothing this monstrous could have happened without dedicated individuals who planned this in minute detail, and this movie documents that planning.  In the span of a meeting that lasted only about 90 minutes, the entire ""Final Solution"" was planned and marching orders given, based on the wishes of Adolph Hitler and the diabolical plans of the SS, embodied by Rheinhart Heydrich, Minister for State Security, and a deputy named Adolf Eichmann.  Functionaries whose names are only known to historians discussed these plans much like a board meeting for any major company anywhere in the world.  Watching this, you could almost believe they were readying a new detergent to be offered to the public.  And lest you think that this was a condensed version of the truth, you have only to research that this meeting was, in typical German efficiency, documented with notes and transcripts, which were to never see the light of day, but for one attendee who failed to destroy his copy as ordered.

To think this is how the fates of millions of human lives were decided - in the brief meeting that makes up this movie - is so sad. If you are looking for scenery, this is not the movie for you - nearly every moment of the movie took place within a single room of a home.  But if you are seeking content, moral conflict, sincere and realistic delivery of historic information, please watch this. I felt sad and empty at the end - which I think is appropriate for the performances of this true to life situation.

You would think that a movie made of a business meeting would be boring, but that assumption does not hold with ""Conspiracy"". All of the actors in this movie are exceptional and they speak in plain English instead of speaking English with a phony German accent. You would think that a committee appointed to plan out the Holocaust would be a bunch of Nazi thugs with a low education level, but nothing could be further from the truth. The men on this committee, chaired by SS Leader Reinhard Heydrich, were all well-educated, with the majority of them being law school graduates, and some with doctorate-level degrees.

The first change was from an emigration strategy to one of physical elimination.  The second change was from bullets and mass graves to one of much more efficient gas chambers and furnaces.  We take for granted, in retrospect, gas chambers and furnaces as part of Western history.

1681170,5,B00005YUO1,"A factual ,chilling story wherein the German SS plans and take over the extermination of all Jews during WWII. If it were not for a rediscovered transcript of the meeting, this tale would not have been told. The movie picks up at a point in Germany when Jews are feeling uncomfortable about staying in their country and suspect the worst is coming. Many have already fled when the meeting takes place and yet many more cannot or will not evacuate. This meeting seals the  fate of those left behind  over the opposition of the German Government  civilians in the National Socialist (Nazi) Party .Hitler wanted to get military and civilian factions on board without appearing to endorse the plan himself. The Jewish people were in the cross hairs at this time but the blueprint for extermination of any humans in the future  was drawn up at this meeting hopefully never to be put into play again. The cold bloodlessness of this Military  Regime is beyond belief when lives are cruelly  bartered away as if they are game markers.
This is an older production and I had not seen it for a number of years. The SS General is the actor that plays ""Wallender"" in the TV series about a brooding detective.

The acting is superb, but with most of the ""action"" occurring around a conference table, you must be ready for intense dialogue, not battle scenes.  If you have ever wondered how the Germans got to the point of approving the systematic destruction of the Jews, this film offers one historically-based possibility.  I'm unsure how much artistic license was used in adapting the surviving notes from the Wannsee Conference into a screenplay, but this film certainly captures the basis for the Nazi's cold and brutal treatment of the Jews through the Final Solution.",1447027200,,689,4.973913043478261

1681254,5,B00005YUO1,"For me, this movie answered, in large part: how did it happen?! I also read up a bit on Martin Luther's antisemitic vitriol. (Martin Luther isn't mentioned in the film; I had caught a bit on NPR recently, about how his writings were used to lend legitimacy to Hitler's hate. As an aside, I was baptized a Lutheran and grew up among Lutherans. The NPR segment was the first I had heard of a shameful part of Protestant history.) Between this film and reading about Martin Luther's writings, I finally have a sense of how the Holocaust could happen. Most films of the genre seem to focus on the horror. While depicting the horror has its place, I don't see how a nearly exclusive focus on horrific acts can help prevent recurrence. But read a bit on a country's history and an influential mind, and I begin to see how the slippery slope starts, how a people is primed to rationalize, accept, and even embrace, hate. And what strikes me as interesting is, you didn't have to fully buy in, because once you're in too deep, it doesn't matter. It's a done deal.",1446076800,,1055,4.471502590673575

Movie only about that meeting which was not fully documented for obvious reasons(no culpability). However the story claims a found document of the highlights of the meeting(and the only document found as there were to be burned) was the basis of the movie.

Shockingly laughable as they sit around a table casually discussing how to annihilate the Jewish people just as businesslike as a corporate board of directors might plan a new product line.  What I found most interesting was at the end when the fates of those involved was stated, noting that very few of the attendees were convicted, most were released for lack of evidence, Heydrich was assinated in Prague the following year, Eichmann was captured by the Israelis and hanged in 1960, and so on.",1445472000,,767,4.9765625

Kenneth Branagh is riveting as SS General Reinhart ""the Butcher of Prague"" Heydrich who browbeats the other participants to consensus during the 85 minute meeting (the same length as the movie).

The meeting in this DVD which the ""final solution"" was agreed upon was based on the actual transcript of the meeting that occurred.
In other words, it depicts the exact dialogue that was spoken. It is not ""dramatized', it is not ""inspired by""; this is word-for-word exactly the conversation that decided on the transportation, the showers, the ovens and on the daily production numbers needed to exterminate all the Jews they could.
The tone is monstrously matter-of-fact, and satanically self-congratulatory.
In one meeting of the German High command you get to peer into the filthy and remorseless heart of the Holocaust.

1681449,5,B00005YUO1,"The absolute best movie about the Hitler era ever. It has a stellar cast and a restrained mood. But do not be deceived by the quiet, explosive silences behind Kenneth Branagh's (Heydrich's) intense gaze. He means to have unanimity from these strange knights of Hitlers 'round table' or the objects of that murderous look will be left with knives in the back.
  The truthful story of how, in 1 1/2 hours, these men agreed to the Final Solution for all European Jews. The leaders represented the dept of railroads and transport and various ministers from all the subjugated territories: each played an integral part in building the machine that was the death knell of 6 million Jews.
  Superb plotting, perfect dialogue, relentless pacing. Unbelievable characterizations by all the actors, notably Colin Firth & David Threlfall , and especially Branagh, who was by turns ruthless, charming best friend, sympathetic, implacable, then most of all immovable.

The film is shot in such a way that as the viewer you really feel like you've pulled up a chair at the table, down in the nitty-gritty, while simultaneously being a fly on the wall, able to survey the broader context. The script was fantastic with acting to match, which was never in doubt given the heavy hitters in the cast. Three personal faves- Branagh, Firth, Tucci (how have I not heard of this movie before now?) all turn out stellar performances. I actually liked how we as the audience, just by reading the brief plot synopsis, are clued into the conceit before things ever get started, so we're barreling down the road to this awful inevitable conclusion just like the men at the table are.

1681654,5,B00005YUO1,"Kenneth Branagh is outstanding as the ice cold manipulator and madman Reinhard Heydrich. It's disturbing watching the meeting evolve and to watch Branagh show his authority with steel control. Stanley Tucci is the most disturbing as Eichmann, the subservient toady to Heyrich, always trying to curry favour and willing to wield his power on anyone lower than him. He's so reserved, but in control of proceedings. The meeting is filled with subtle digs at eachother, insults and threats. Eichmann smirks to himself and Heydrich tolerates it until he pulls people aside and reads them the riot act in a subtle way, but leaves no misunderstanding who is in control and how it will be. Watching this DVD is utterly disturbing as it slowly goes from expulsion to outright extermination. Heydrich spells it out when asked if shooting the Jews in Latvia was evacuating them. It's totally absorbing watching these vile people slowly twist the screw until the whole ghastly reality is put in front of them all and there can be no dissent. Branagh's slowly brooding anger tempered by his ability to be reasonable and sociable are terrifying. When you forget it's Branagh and you see him as Heydrich your skin crawls. Tucci as the desk bound murderer sycophantically creeping about is just as terrifying. Although this is an adaptation of the actual minutes of the meeting and is open to interpretation it still couldn't have been far off the actual atmosphere and intent of all involved. You must see this and understand what the film is about. A good understanding of all involved and the Holocaust helps the whole scene come to life in the most hideous disturbing way.",1432684800,,1660,4.932142857142857

Minimal dramatization -- real spoken words from the real-time recorded transcript.

1681688,4,B00005YUO1,"The title is a little misleading. One might think the film involved some kind of cabal within the Nazi hierarchy, say, to assassinate Hitler. But the subject is the Wannsee conference, at which, at least according to this movie, the plan for the ""final solution"" to the ""Jewish problem""--the systematic extermination of the Jewish people--was a foregone conclusion to which various upper-echelon Nazi leaders were pressured to sign on by Reinhard Heydrich (Branagh). That virtually the entire movie takes place in the country house known as Wannsee (could have easily been a stage play), and there are no graphic scenes whatever, it nevertheless has its chilling moments--indeed, made more chilling because of the calculating and matter-of-fact way in which mass murder is discussed over lunch with wine. Splendid cast--Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci (Eichmann!), Colin Firth (!), David Threlfall, and even Downton's Mr. Bates ( Brendon Coyle) (SS officer!).",1431302400,,958,5.47972972972973
1681689,4,B00005YUO1,"Stagy but extremely effective portrayal of the Nazi mentality leading up to the Holocaust. This might be Branagh's best performance, after Henry V--he perfectly captures the kind of cheery certainty that was necessary for a horrible crime like this to happen. Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth also put in commanding supporting performances. This would make a great double feature with Inglourious Basterds--it's a more serious take on the kind of Nazi character study Tarantino features so prominently in his film.",1431302400,,511,5.4

1681723,5,B00005YUO1,"One of the most astonishing films you will ever see. This movie recounts the 1942 Wannsee Conference in Berlin where the ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" was ratified by members of the Nazi government and the SS.

Filmed in a style very similar to the 1957 film 12 Angry Men, the story carefully chronicles how just a few men in power can agree to a plan that, even after seventy-five years, is today still unbelievable in its horror. The methodical and almost business-based analysis that they use to reach their decision is astonishing to watch as each man, willingly or not, succumbs to the pressure of one man, General Reinhard Heydrich. Kenneth Branagh's performance as Heydrich who rises from humble beginnings as the son of music teachers to become Hitler's architect for the Final Solution, is powerful and thoroughly convincing. Stanley Tucci's performance as Lt. Col. Adolph Eichmann, ranks as one of his greatest performances and is especially compelling after watching the actual trial video of Eichmann in 1962 in Israel, where he was executed for war crimes. Individual character story lines run throughout  as the view tries to understand how consensus could be reached on such an unthinkable plan.

The film is beautifully-shot with excellent editing and continuity, especially considering the amount of overlapping dialogue and reaction shots from the actors as the Final Solution unfolds in front of them.

1681914,5,B00005YUO1,"This film gives us a realistic and frightening view of human nature and the ways in which human beings can construct a complete ideological mindset that denies the humanity and worth of other human beings. When prejudice and bigotry become efficient and technology driven, watch out.

The film is dialogue driven and small segments of action add just enough movement to help the viewer remain both engaged and entertained in a relatively complex and intelligent script. The actors are superb with Stanley Tucci stealing the show with a cold efficient underplay of his role.

This slice of history kept me entertained from beginning to end as I watched the complex swaying of the Nazi Reichs leaders in the military, industry, and judiciary engage in a group think process that outlined a plan to exterminate the Jewish people from Europe. This 1942 meeting or conference marked a turning point in the German assault on the Jewish people since the no longer supported the movement of Jewish people out of German territory or their use as slaves in the labor force but rather moved toward extermination with Co2 gas chambers for mass killings.

Kenneth Branagh is great as SS Officer Reinhard Heydrich, whose masterful art of arm twisting ensures that those who have any objections to the extermination of the Jews are forced into line with the rest of the group. Stanley Tucci underplays the role of Adolf Eichmann, whose efficiency and use of the machinery of government supports this awful genocide.
 Colin Firth plays legal Scholar Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, who drafted the Nuremburg Laws, often discussed in the film, which are the codification of racial purity upon which the policy of extermination was based.

The film is frightening in the manner in which is shows the banality of evil, the ways we can convince ourselves and our reference group that some other group of humans are less than and thus deserving of death and extermination.",1425254400,,1941,4.978395061728395

1681994,5,B00005YUO1,"The problem with movies today is that many directors think you need a huge budget and A-list celebs to tell a story. Maybe true to a point when making a fictional story, but that's the beauty of historical dramas. The stories are already written, and interesting to begin with. Two things did it for me in this move. First-- the dialogue was brilliant. While they tend to speak rather fast, I've always been a quick witted person, so this was right up my alley. But more so, the back and forth between the characters had so much ""read between the lines"" that you often found yourself what certain people were thinking regardless of they were actually saying. The other thing that REALLY did it for me with this film, was the fact that these men were formulating possibly the most heinous crime in human history and they debated it like they were trying to figure out the best restaurant in town to eat at. Needless to say, it was chilling and very eye opening to see just how little the Jews were thought of during this era. Don't let the ""cheap"" budget and lack of notoriety sway you, this is easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long while.",1423612800,2,1150,4.429245283018868

1681997,5,B00005YUO1,"I really liked this film. Ever since I watched Band of Brothers I have found myself learning more about WWII, especially the Holocaust. I find that Ive gained a much deeper understandingcompared to when I initially learned of it in the grade school history. Sure back then learning about the mass murder of millions of people sounds terrible. But this film (and others that I have watched) really paint a completely different picture. It makes it seem that the Holocaust wasn't just some blunt and savage forced extermination that a whole nation participated in. Sure racism against Jews was omnipresent, and yes Hitler hated Jews, but I bet there were people back then that hated Jews more than Hitler did. The context and politics seemed to set the stage for the Holocaust.

I am not one to just say there is evil in the world because of just some bad apples, but I think the context is more important. The Holocaust was carefully planned and coordinated, and many small decision by word of mouth and paper were made. This film just portrays that nebulous side of politics, information control, and bureaucracy so well. I think that is very important insight to have in addition to knowledge of the depraved and visceral violence that occurred. The message I gained from this film seems just as important as the images of mass graves, gas chambers, the starved and the murdered.

Just ugly men in regalia sitting around a table in Wannsee talking details of genocide with cold precision, administrative items, legalities, clauses and war gossip, all over buffet food, fine wines and cigars. Horrifying in its clinical detachment and sense of inevitability. Kenneth Branagh is great as Reinhard Heydrich, who thinks he'll live in the Wannsee mansion after the war (he doesn't even survive to see the next year), Stanley Tucci is awesomely cool as Adolf Eichmann, and Colin Firth is also great as Dr Wilhelm Stuckart, Reich Ministry for the Interior. In the beginning, there's a flurry of awful greetings as each man greets the other... mortifying.

The film is beautifully shot, which is probably needed, as there's no action and way too much dull dialogue. Given the evil detachment of these Nazis, there isn't even a real sense of emotion or urgency that we can call a climax, although Firth's character does get whipped up into a near-frenzy at one point.

The DVD does come with two featurettes, that have a bit of discussion by the actors, but is more packaged as an infomercial for the show.",1422835200,,1260,4.8018433179723505

Now, If Eichmann asks a soldier: ""Have you understood?"" and the private answers: ""Sir!"", it still sounds unreal, no matter how good an actor Tucci is. However, when Eichmann asks: ""Haben Sie verstanden?"" and the man shouts back: ""Jawohl!!"", it immediately rings true.

Heydrich is one of the most terrifying of the SS as I recall from my time in Prague, where my office was a few doors down from his.

It is so amazing that such intelligent, dashing and dapper men could come together and discuss murdering a race of people in such a cold and detached way, as if they were discussing fumigating rats. Himmler himself described the Final Solution as a matter of racial hygiene.

It humanized the characters in a way that is so much more disturbing and realistic than if they had simply been psychotic monsters. It demands a degree of introspection that I think is helpful to our own ethics. How could such intelligent intellectual logical people be so twisted to do such things. Perhaps intelligence and logic are no defense from committing or at least justifying brutality on even the grandest of scales. That is a lesson so relevant to the modern world as for instance we consider the treatment of prisoners in time of expediency. I recommend this film.",1419811200,,716,4.736

Not only was I left feeling absolutely horrified and literally nauseated, I learned something of our past. This movie is so brilliantly acted and shot, it should be required viewing for a high school history program. I had no idea the behind the scenes goings-on with the Nazis because quite truthfully, I think they are the scum of the Earth and never wanted to know. My mother was born in 1939 and I in 1966 and growing up I knew she was interested in history, recent and ancient. I too am finding a newfound interest as I get older. Watching this movie only confirmed what I knew...these men were heartless, cold, murdering bastards driven by an insane leader.

1682161,5,B00005YUO1,"Several points that jumped out at me were the presentation was apparently based on one document that survived the meeting and thus I assume the presentation was a very real presentation of what happened and how the decision were arrived at regarding the extermination of  millions of people.  The presentation is well worth watching in that clearly such an historical meeting did take place in that we have the facts to support the extermination of millions of people.(film footage of the dead and the death camps themselves).  Can any of us actually image sitting in a meeting discussing the best way to exterminate millions of people simply because we have the power to do so.  ???

Kindly note these men are thought to be normal!  Otherwise perfectly normal human beings actually sat down and discussed how to exterminate millions of people as if this was a perfectly appropriate thing for them to be doing!  Kindly note these men are not thought to be insane!

Our own government respects the truth in that as a general rule they do not cover  up felonies committed by people within our government!  We now have a most reasonable basis for concluding that flight 77 did not go into the Pentagon as our official government would like us to believe.  The fact that they have released only one small snit pit of film of a cruise missile like device going into the pentagon tells us all we need to know.  In other words a full fledged cover up is in play by the President, the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. .  One report indicates that there are something like 70 cameras around the pentagon and yet no film coverage of a plane going into the pentagon is available.  Also it would be easy to prove that no plane went into the pentagon simply by interviewing the fireman who went to the pentagon.  It certainly looks like no honest truth telling fireman saw any plane parts and the answer to this point is easy in that no plane went into the pentagon.  However, there was a flight 77 that was hijacked.  And thus the terrorist would have eventually crashed the plane into something. According to at least one eyewitness flight 77 did pass near the pentagon but went around.  Mostly likely our air force shot it down because they could not stop the terrorist from crashing the plane into something.  THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT ONCE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND PRESIDENT WHO IS IN CONTROL OF THE FBI, THE CIA, NSA AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS DECIDES TO COVER OF CRIMINAL ACTS THE GAME IS OVER.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH 911.  (NOTE:  THE MAIN STREAM PRESS ALSO IS ALSO CONTROLLED IN SOME MANNER IN THAT THEY TOO WILL NOT REPORT THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!)  OUCH ON ALL OF THIS!

 The result of our governments cover up led to a totally unnecessary war against Iraq!  Surely the leadership in the House and Senate knew that flight 77 did not go into the pentagon.  All they had to do was interview the fireman at the scene and look at Pentagon film footage to make this determination.  This decision to cover up this event led to the deaths of thousands of our service men and women and at least 100,000 Iraqi deaths and probably hundreds of billions of dollar's of property damage to the country of Iraq.

In conclusion I would like to relate the extermination of millions of people by Hitler to our own government in that cover up of truly tragic events are a routine part of human life on this planet.  Hitler's government did it and our government does it as well.  Our government however does deserve credit for eventually allowing the truth to be presented without censorship and without sending the truth tellers off to a gulag in Alaska!

1682247,5,B00005YUO1,"a wrenching recreation of the infamous Wannsee conference where the mechanics of the ""Final Solution"" were worked out.  Apparently it was filmed in the actual house, (I am not certain but it looks like it) and uses for its base a typescript found in the German archives after WWII.  SS officers, party and government officials and a variety of technocrats, administrators, sat around a table and hashed out who gets murdered and how it is to be accomplished.  Eichmann is present and is credited with running a good meeting. All in all, it disabuses one of thinking that even the smartest, best educated people in a country also have some human feeling for members of their species.  They believed in their program even though some doubts were raised by conscientious lawyers about the legalities as well as the ethical nature of their program.
  I personally am now convinced that we humans are similar to a herd animal capable of being driven in any direction and liking it.
  The films actors are uniformly excellent, believable in the positions they take, and lead one to worry about any government that can exercise so much power over the minds and lives of its citizens.",1416700800,,1176,4.8159203980099505
1682248,4,B00005YUO1,"This movie is very well done, and effectively captures the contrast of just another ordinary day in a beautiful suburban mansion with the staggering evil of the meeting that took place there with such casual businesslike structure.  This is more recent take on the formula established in the 1984 effort ""Die Wannseekonferenz"", which was recorded in German with mostly German actors rather than British or American actors.  The German film gives a better view of what it would have been like to be a fly on the wall at the real meeting, but Conspiracy is still very much worth your time if interested in WWII history.

The biggest flaw is that the actors don't capture the essence of the main players, either in appearance or manner. The ""banality of evil"" has often been used to describe Nazis like Eichman and Himmler, although the same can't be said of Heydrich.  He was a sort of dark rock star among the Nazi elite, one of the very few who embodied many of the ideals of the Party with his tall, blonde Nordic appearance, considerable athletic and musical capabilities, genuine bravery (he often flew air combat missions before he was grounded by Hitler for fear of losing him), shrewd intelligence, ruthless determination and a rigid work ethic.  He was a sort of Ultimate Nazi who inspired fear more than respect among his colleagues and even his superiors; especially Himmler, who was clearly far less talented in most areas than his fast-rising underling, and was threatened by him.  Heydrich's true drive was not belief in the the Fuhrer or the Party itself or Germany, but his own quest for personal power, and he ultimately fancied himself as the rightful Fuhrer in time.

Knowing this background, I was very interested to see how he would be portrayed in Conspiracy.  I must say that Kenneth Branagh did an excellent job of portraying a ""smug, arrogant Nazi general"", but he didn't portray Heydrich as he really was (likewise for Tucci's role as Eichman).  If you look at photos and footage of the real Heydrich, you will see that he towered above most of the Nazi elite at 6'3"" and had the coldest, most remorseless gaze imaginable, with beady, close-set eyes and a cruel, avian face that made him look like some sort of terrible humanoid eagle, especially when walking slightly crouched with hands behind his back as he reviewed assembled troops. He was known for having rather wide hips and narrow shoulders and an oddly high voice, which was undoubtedly a part of his intense self-loathing and insecurity along with his knowledge of his semi-secret partial Jewish ancestry.  But he directed most of his hate outward, unfortunately for the world.  Branagh's Heyrich was thousands of miles behind the menace of the real one.  In fact, I've never seen anyone fully capture Heydrich in a movie. After many decades of trying, Hilter was only finally portrayed convincingly in my opinion in recent years in the now legendary ""Downfall"".

In spite of having more or less ""standard stock"" Nazis rather the dead ringers for the real men who organized this meeting, this movie is excellent and will inspire deep reflection about the depths of man's inhumanity to man.  It is still captivating during repeated viewings as well.  No action or special effects are needed. Even things as subtle as the servants nervously setting the table in perfect order for the much-feared officers express the mood of the day.  Truthfully, the smug, lawless, god-like attitudes of the attendees aren't really that far from what you can often see in a modern corporate boardroom, where the only word that matters is money, regardless of moral considerations. I've often seen witnessed this in person while attending manager's meetings myself.  But this meeting, of course, was about far more than that. You can't help but reel at the thought that men like these would (and still do, even today) think of those beneath them as nothing more than subjects to be manipulated with no regard for their lives. The only thing that can keep them in check are laws and universal standards of decency, which are ultimately backed with warfare when everything else fails. And it took a tremendous effort to stop these men....so it is important to never forget that this happened....",1416614400,12,4259,4.893055555555556

1682250,5,B00005YUO1,"An absolutely brilliant movie.  One of the most chilling things I've ever seen in my life.  It's such a perfect illustration of the ""banality of evil.""  The two ""stars"" of this movie are SS General Reinhard Heydrich (also known as the Man with the Heart of Iron, the Butcher, the Hangman, the Blonde Beast of the SS, and the God of Death.

This movie is ""on the surface"" extremely dull stuff.  Not explosions, no blood, no sex, no car chases...  Just a group of men sitting around a conference table, talking.  A few conversations happen in a bathroom.  Some take place outside the building.  This should be very dull stuff.  Most of these men are middle-aged, over-weight, not very bright, middle-managers of the kind you could find in any corporate management meeting in the world.  The meeting lasted less than two hours.  It sealed the fate of millions though.  The thing that these middle-manager types were discussing was the Nazi ""Final Solution.""  The term they used at this meeting was the ""complete solution.""  That term was eventually replaced with ""final solution.""

The sheer ordinariness of these men and their matter-of-fact regard for the idea of genocide is absolutely horrifying.  There were a few who clearly found the idea of the ""complete solution of the Jewish problem"" distressing.  They all caved in rather quickly though.  All that was needed was a few private asides with Reinhard Heydrich to bring people around though.  By the end of the short meeting, everyone is on board with the plan.  The meeting is set-up and managed by Heydrich's right-hand man, Lt. Colonel Adolf Eichmann.  After Heydrich's death, Eichmann become the leader of the ""Final Solution.""",1416528000,,1686,4.946428571428571

1682690,5,B00005YUO1,"I had the opportunity to track down and fortunately view this movie after taking a tour of the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Museum in Los Angeles. During the visit one of the staff members mentioned the movie while visiting the exhibit pertaining to the ""The Final Solution"" and ""Wansee Conference"". When I began watching this movie I was immediately drawn in by the cinematography and setting. I new this this would be a great movie.

The movie progresses more like a play rather than a typical motion picture. The actors and their characters truly come to life and really draw you into the dialogue and interactions that take place during the conference. At times I was in awe with how charismatic and ""methodically evil"" Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of ""General Heider was. The casualness and ease with witch the members of the conference discuss the mass killing of the Jewish people and ""cleansing"" of Germany is chilling. During a scene in the movie, one of the characters made mention to the members of the conference doing what they have to do like members of the company, I believe was, ""IG Farben"". How appropriate a statement since, aside from knowing the malevolent designs of this conference and it goals, it was organized and being carried out just like any strategy/planning meeting of the heads of any large organization.

The movie gives you some insight into the fact that all high ranking members of the German government and Nazi party did not agree with the ""evacuation"" and ""purging"" of the Jewish people from Germany and Europe but were simply ""caught up"" or ""intimidated"" with no perceived way out. This is no excuse for their silent approval and inaction but it does cause one to think where they would stand if put into a similar predicament.

All of the main actor/players in the movie are I believe English, except for Stanley Tucci's who portray Colonel Adolf Eichman. The acting talent is superb and it is obvious the actors are classically trained professionals. I am happy the director went ""across the pond"" to find the talent for this movie since the US is incredibly deficient with respect to highly skilled and trained actors of this caliber.

I would definitely recommend anyone interested in history, good acting and excellent film to see this movie.",1411689600,,2285,4.896640826873385

I do not know if this video is totally correct, but having read a lot about Heidrich, it fits perfectly his total commitment to Adolph Hitler and the elimination of ""unsuitable"" populations.  Heidrich was the epitome of the perfect NAZI.  I recommend the video to anyone interested in WWII. I think it's plausible because right now ""unsuitable populations"" are again being eliminated and the reasons behind it are similar, e.g.,  ""I DISLIKE YOU BECAUSE  I DISAGREE WITH WHAT YOU BELIEVE OR STAND FOR"".",1409011200,,993,4.699421965317919

To eliminate any resistance to an agreement on the way to proceed with eliminating ""the Jew"" Heydrich buttonholes each of the men who pose a threat to a unanimous acceptance of murdering the Jews of Europe.

1683060,5,B00005YUO1,"On January 20, 1942, 15 high-ranking Nazi Party and German government officials gathered at a villa in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee to discuss and coordinate the implementation of what they called the ""Final Solution of the Jewish Question.""

Representing the SS at the meeting were: SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt-RSHA) and one of Reichsfhrer-SS (SS chief) Heinrich Himmler's top deputies; SS Major General Heinrich Mller, chief of RSHA Department IV (Gestapo); SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann, chief of the RSHA Department IV B 4 (Jewish Affairs); SS Colonel Eberhard Schngarth, commander of the RSHA field office for the Government General in Krakow, Poland; SS Major Rudolf Lange, commander of RSHA Einsatzkommando 2, deployed in Latvia in the autumn of 1941; and SS Major General Otto Hofmann, the chief of SS Race and Settlement Main Office.

Representing the agencies of the State were: State Secretary Roland Freisler (Ministry of Justice); Ministerial Director Wilhelm Kritzinger (Reich Cabinet); State Secretary Alfred Meyer (Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories-German-occupied USSR); Ministerial Director Georg Leibrandt (Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories); Undersecretary of State Martin Luther (Foreign Office); State Secretary Wilhelm Stuckart (Ministry of the Interior); State Secretary Erich Naumann (Office of Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan); State Secretary Josef Bhler (Office of the Government of the Governor General-German-occupied Poland); and Ministerial Director Gerhard Klopfer (Nazi Party Chancellery).

The ""Final Solution"" was the code name for the systematic, deliberate, physical annihilation of the European Jews. At some still undetermined time in 1941, Hitler authorized this European-wide scheme for mass murder. Heydrich convened the Wannsee Conference (1) to inform and secure support from government ministries and other interested agencies relevant to the implementation of the Final Solution, and (2) to disclose to the participants that Hitler himself had tasked Heydrich and the RSHA with coordinating the operation. The men at the table did not deliberate whether such a plan should be undertaken, but instead discussed the implementation of a policy decision that had already been made at the highest level of the Nazi regime.

At the time of the Wannsee Conference, most participants were already aware that the National Socialist regime had engaged in mass murder of Jews and other civilians in the German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union and in Serbia. Some had learned of the actions of the Einsatzgruppen and other police and military units, which were already slaughtering tens of thousands of Jews in the German-occupied Soviet Union. Others were aware that units of the German Army and the SS and police were killing Jews in Serbia. None of the officials present at the meeting objected to the Final Solution policy that Heydrich announced.

Not present at the meeting were representatives of the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) and the Reich Railroads (Reichsbahn) in the German Ministry of Transportation. The SS and police had already negotiated agreements with the German Army High Command on the murder of civilians, including Soviet Jews, in the spring of 1941, prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union. In late September 1941, Hitler had authorized the Reich Railroads to transport German, Austrian, and Czech Jews to locations in German-occupied Poland and the German-occupied Soviet Union, where German authorities would kill the overwhelming majority of them.

Heydrich indicated that approximately 11,000,000 Jews in Europe would fall under the provisions of the ""Final Solution."" In this figure, he included not only Jews residing in Axis-controlled Europe, but also the Jewish populations of the United Kingdom, and the neutral nations (Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and European Turkey). For Jews residing in the Greater German Reich and holding the status of subjects of the German Reich, the Nuremberg Laws would serve as a basis for determining who was a Jew.

Heydrich announced that during the course of the Final Solution, the Jews will be deployed under appropriate supervision at a suitable form of labor deployment in the East. In large labor columns, separated by gender, able-bodied Jews will be brought to those regions to build roads, whereby a large number will doubtlessly be lost through natural reduction. Any final remnant that survives will doubtless consist of the elements most capable of resistance. They must be dealt with appropriately, since, representing the fruit of natural selection, they are to be regarded as the core of a new Jewish revival.

The participants discussed a number of other issues raised by the new policy, including the establishment of the Theresienstadt camp-ghetto as a destination for elderly Jews as well Jews who were disabled or decorated in World War I, the deferment until after the war of Final Solution measures against Jews married to non-Jews or persons of mixed descent as defined by the Nuremberg laws, prospects for inducing Germany's Axis partners to give up their Jewish populations, and preparatory measures for the evacuations.

Despite the euphemisms which appeared in the protocols of the meeting, the aim of the Wannsee Conference was clear to its participants: to further the coordination of a policy aimed at the physical annihilation of the European Jews.",1407369600,,5531,5.5129716981132075

1683235,5,B00005YUO1,"At once both riveting and chilling.  Branagh is outstanding as Heydrich, steering the participants at the notorious Wannsee conference to endorse what became known as the Final Solution - the merciless strategy to exterminate the entire European Jewish population. Tucci supports well as the meeting's facilitator, Eichmann. The basis of the storyline is the transcript from one of the conferences participants, Martin Luther (Kevin McNally), although this is no dry documentary (or botched History Channel effort) and is threaded together with one-on-one conversations between various participants that build the over-arching dramatic tension.

The film follows the meeting, punctuated with refreshment breaks whenever tempers flare or discreet pressure needs to be applied to recalcitrant participants.  Heydrich is a master of soft power, avoiding browbeating threats while still delivering ultimatums with a smile and genial attitude that nevertheless leave his target in no doubt as to what their next step needs to be.

The discussion starts by dancing around the subject as interested parties gripe about the impact of what in the early stages of the conference is referred to as the 'evacuation' of the Jews.  Will the economy suffer from the loss of slave labor? Wouldn't sterilization achieve the long term goal of a Jew-free Europe? And then there are the legal arguments: State Secretary Stuckart (Firth) in particular is very indignant that the existing, and a personal labor of love, Nuremberg Laws pertaining to Jewishness will be undermined by Heydrich's course. Only Permanent Secretary Kritzinger (Threlfall) comes close to any moral resistance, though that in itself is based mainly on the assurance from the Fuehrer himself that wholesale slaughter of the Jews would not become official policy - a detail that Heydrich uses cunningly to underline the Fuehrer's position of plausible deniability.

The central dilemma is that the Reich does not have the resources simply to sequester the millions of Jews throughout its ever-expanding territories, especially now they have invaded Russia.  Heydrich outlines tested small solutions to the problem such as the carbon monoxide poisoning of Jews in specially prepared vehicles and cleverly allows the meetings participants to do their own math to realize this is not a workable solution.  This allows Heydrich then to move onto details of test camps that are using gas chambers disguised as showers.  Then on to more efficient poison gasses in development for these camps.  Then onto mass disposal of the bodies at these camps, this last item delivered almost as a footnote.  And so within a very short space of time, the meeting has repositioned itself from the 'evacuation' of Jews, to the practical logistics of mass extermination, with all the meetings participants as willing endorsers.

The supporting cast is also excellent with many a familiar face in an uncharacteristic role (Brendan Coyle as SS Gruppenfuehrer Mueller and Peter Sullivan as the gung-ho SS Oberfuehrer Schoengarth, for example).  Ian McNeice is particularly brilliant as the revolting SS  Oberfuehrer Klopfer representing the interests of Martin Bormann and the Nazi Party.  Jonathon Coy excels too as the pathetic Neumann, a mere State Secretary from Goering's office of the Four Year Plan, and humiliatingly trumped by Klopfer's representation of the Party's 'Thousand Year Plan'!

We know the terrible outcomes of this meeting and what frightens is the sheer matter-of-factness of the conference.  It could almost be a corporate discussion on the topic of lay-offs.  It is also  a master class in how the individual can subordinate their conscious will when absorbed into the collective.  Then there is the bad-faith element: Heydrich makes sure that all information from the meeting is controlled by him (through Eichmann), so that it can only flow up the chain of command and not down.  There is the tacit acknowledgement that the content would be deemed unacceptable were it to be laid out before a broader audience.

Finally,it is also frightening to consider the number of this little gathering that escaped justice in the post-war period due to 'lack of evidence'.",1406505600,,4214,5.362670713201821

The cast is superb - Kenneth Branaugh, Stanley Tucci, and Colin Firth, to name the three with whom I am most familiar - turn in splendid performances as always, and the other cast members are convincing in the support (or lack thereof) of the proposed solution.

This meeting would have been lost to history were it not for the meticulous Nazi record keeping and the one surviving copy of the final memo outlining the use of concentration camps for both labor and human extermination.  It is mind boggling that a small group decided the policy that became world changing.

Walking away from the movie I was particularly impressed by how it conveyed the pressure on the high ranking officials to agree with the Final Solution, and also how they talked about the actions based on statistics.

Saying that these were bad guys seems inadequate to the task. Watching the movie 'Conspiracy' increases some of that understanding.
Originally I watched this  because of Kenneth Branagh but the story of the Wannsee Conference is a fascinating one because objectively, dare I use the word, a group of men over lunch in a 2 hour secret meeting determined the Final Solution and the death of millions of people. It is more accurate to say that they legitimized a plan that was already in motion. The meeting starts with organizational infighting on which department has say over the plan and ends with the application of technical data on how many people they can kill per hour. It is stunning how quickly and callously  they could come to chart the death of 12 million people and still have an appetite for the buffet.
The center role is Branagh as Reinhardt Heydrich, prototypical Nazi uberman. Blonde,urbane, charming, cold and heartless. He is there to deliver the agenda and gain complete acceptance. Stanley Tucci as the fawning martinet, Adolph Eichmann. Both actors brilliantly portray their characters with the confidence that history and culture are on their side.
The end result is never in doubt. It is the journey that bewilders and offends.

It does help to know something about the Nuremberg laws regarding Jewish heritage (i.e. how  ""Jew"" was defined in Nazi Germany)  in understanding the discussion; however, it is not necessary to appreciate the caviler attitude by the men involved.  It is a realistic illustration of how extreme evil can decide to take a horrific course of action without fanfare, but in an icy, somewhat tedious, bureaucratic meeting.

Definitely worth watching.  Kenneth Branagh plays Heydrich - one of the most infamous characters in history - brilliantly.  Heydrich was a charming and lethal personality, and Branagh brings those two qualities together with chilling success.

Watching this film, I took it as an allegory for the evolution of Hitler's Germany - how the force of will of a few individuals could wrangle and motivate the petty rivalries, pangs of conscience and reasonable opposition of other men into one unthinkable action.

I thought Branagh's Heydrich to be a little more reasonable and human than I would have painted him, given his later actions in what was to become the Czech Republic.  However, it was Tucci's performance as Eichmann that resonated in me the later argument of the ""banality of evil"" surrounding the architects of one of the most terrible campaigns in history.

1683512,5,B00005YUO1,"This is a chilling movie about an actual historic event where the SS convened a conference of assorted officials to determine what to do with the Jews. It is hard to know with any real certainty just what happened at this conference. As I understand it, a single copy of the transcript of the meeting was found after the war. It is hard to know just how edited what that transcript said was from what was actually discussed at the meeting, given that the SS controlled the meeting and the transcription.

The movie seems to go to great lengths in some respects for realism. The uniforms, the cars, the villa, even clothing seems very real for the period. Yet, the SS officers are never referred to by their SS ranks. The movie uses the equivalent army ranks. This had to have been deliberate on the part of the film makers, but seemed a bit odd to me given how hard they went to give realism to the rest of the movie.

The movie makes it clear that whatever decision was being made about how to deal with the Jews had already been made and the problem placed in the hands of the SS to implement. The meeting was the way the SS used to tell the rest of the officials to comply.

There are no American big name stars in this movie, but just about all of the characters are played very well. SS Obergruppenfuhrer Heydrich comes off as a polite, personable, and intelligent psychopath.

The movie portrays what little opposition there was to the SS plan as being mostly issues of administrative and legal problems for the bureaucrats and courts to deal with along with the issue of labor shortages. The only alternative even seriously considered was sterilizing the Jews instead of killing them.

The whole thing is creepy to watch as you realize that everyone there wants to get rid of the Jews, but some are a little squeamish about just killing them.",1404086400,,1849,4.507462686567164

I had some problem keeping everyone's name straight but that didn't detract from the grim decision that was being made. Coercion was the replacement for Robert's Rules of Order. Determination was Heydrich's modus operandi, determination to get this meeting over and to get the result he wanted. (Heydrich supremely played by Kenneth Branagh.) ""Suck-up"" to Heydrich was Adolph Eichmann, ably played by Stanley Tucci. These two choreographed the conference to dance around the question of what to do with the Jews since they wanted to 'cleanse' Europe of them.

1683663,5,B00005YUO1,"Imagine the play 12 Angry Men...in the end, they come to a conclusion that's just.

...this is not that play.

Surviving the efforts to destroy such evidence, a single transcript of the conference of top military leaders, legislators, and political appointees of Hitler's Germany met in secret to assemble the single largest engine of destruction, and agreed to set it in motion.

The result, millions of people murdered; even those who were openly reluctant to follow the military's direction were reminded that they too would be more than welcome to join the dead for non-compliance.

Of course, those people too paid a price for their choices...some on the battlefield, and others, in a war crimes tribunal later on.

This production is set in a beautiful lakeside house in the middle of a long, cold winter (at that time when Germany was trying to finish their war with Russia), and were losing. They have an elaborate spread of the best food, drink, and even cigars.

On one side, you see and hear the inner monologue expressed of each person, and within the confines of the smaller conversations. You quickly see who are the bullies, the quiet ones, the persons with nothing but buzz words, and the two men (one a judge, and the other, the vice-counsel) who made the effort to remind the rest that this would be catastrophic.

It's a character study that will make your skin crawl (when hearing some of the dialogue), and at other times, wince at the reality that this actually happened.

One moment of minor humor is worth pointing out (in that it's only relevance to the story is that it showed the strictness within this horror show of a conference), was a worker at the house falling, and breaking some dishes. The Stanley Tucci's character said to the butler:

"" Itemize the cost...he pays, and make out a separate report to me...and whatever else you do today, keep that person where I can't see him! ""

The humor died at the look he gave the butler.

It's not for the queasy. The subject is hard to listen to at times, and it's language about race is terrible. But it's trying to tell you (from that surviving transcript) how it came to be.",1402099200,,2153,4.669312169312169

This film is rich, entertaining, disturbing, all at once and has a respectably unique pace which adds to the experience since on the surface a 90 minute movie depicting a dozen men sitting at a table for a few hours doesn't sound too exciting, but the writers and film makers fixed that brilliantly.

Conspiracy is particularly brilliant because watching from start to finish and knowing it's based on a very important event in history which is arguably shrouded in mystery, you say to yourself, wow, they must have had some great source information when writing this.  Not so, only one heavily truncated copy of the minutes survived the war, an entire movie born from 2 paragraphs of B.S. that Eichmann went through with a fine tooth comb ensuring it was B.S.

Not sure about the history of the investigation of the Wannsee Conference after the war, especially with those at the conference who survived and were interrogated, particularly the Israeli's interrogating Eichmann many years after his capture (just how much did he fill in the gaps from the watered down ""minutes"" he himself created?), but the bottom line and my main point is, with such little information to go on, to create an entire film from a few paragraphs from a highly coded document is just fantastic.  I will say though I am obtuse to the other films that came out on the Wannsee conference, I think one in the 80's and one in the 60's, so I guess about every 20 years the Wannsee conference will get a new treatment.

The dialogue is brisk, so one must be an attentive listener, or you will be replaying parts.  However, what I learned about the planning for the Holocaust and how it evolved from Evacuation to Termination is horrifying and chilling because this meeting of men is historically accurate and documented from the minutes of the meeting that were uncovered at the war's end.  The epilogue catalogs what happened to each of these men (who were participants at the meeting) at or before the war' s end, and for the most part was very satisfying to this reviewer.

Not a shot fired, no war scenes but extremely scary because of the coolness in which this group of Nazi leaders discuss and agree on how to handle the ""Jewish problem"". Hydrich (Branagh) makes it clear that the issue is already decided. I could go on, but it is worth watching to see how low humans can actually sink in their regard for  their fellow human. Even if it is dressed up in luxurious surroundings.

Only one real dissenter, but he was put down when, after telling the group Hitler had personally assured him the Jews would not be killed, was told that Hitler would of course, deny this fact and would continue to deny it while making sure others carried out his true plan.

The film was taken from a stenographer's record of the meeting found in 1948. Typical German / Nazi efficiency. A stenographic record made of a meeting that ""didn't happen"", ""no one attended"", from a ""record that didn't exist"" and in a home that wasn't confiscated from its Jewish owner (It was ""donated"").

It is  fascinating, gripping, compelling and then, almost without our noticing, horrifying.  The usual tendency is to present evil as a villainous, glowering, almost slavering beast.  That's how we want to see the world.  We can tell the bad from the good at a glance.  But that's not reality.  Branagh portrays Heydrich as even-toned, polite, even affable at times.  Colin Firth's character seems to have a fundamental sense of justice; a humanitarian voice or two is raised during the discussion... as one of my friends put it, these men could have been talking about erecting a new ball bearing plant somewhere.  and then the horror, lurking underneath the calm, is suddenly there, confronting us.  We are left stunned.  How did ""evacuation"" become ""elimination""?  Are they really talking about, not concentration camps (which had been used for years; the British established such camps during the British-Boer war), but the best mixture of gasses to use in death chambers?  Did we just hear plans to eliminate  --to kill-- an entire race down to the last child?

1683752,5,B00005YUO1,"First of all, it's a pity that some may think of this film as ""for history buffs only"". The element of truth therein lies in the fact that this was perhaps the most defining moment of the twentieth century. If not for Wannsee and the ""final solution"", how many millions might have survived the awful years of the second World War? How much greater would the possibility of German victory in Europe have loomed? Would the nation of Israel otherwise have come into existence? On these questions could go, and this is enough for the lovers of history, but there is much more to this film, both from an sociological aspect and as a work of art. It is obviously chilling to ponder the effects of hatred on a grand scale, but this movie (sans over analysis) reminds us of those consequences- that we cannot hate just a little...that one cannot be ""a little bit pregnant"". It also reminds us of the dangers of too much centralized government power, and does so via stellar performances from the entire cast, especially Kenneth Branagh. Along with Henry V, this little gem reaffirms the notion that Branagh is a genius. If his portrayal of General Heydrich, the man with no soul behind his blue eyes, doesn't send chills up your spine, you're not paying attention. With A directing and A+ acting, it's a shame that this HBO production has flown somewhat under the radar. If you cannot enjoy a movie without gunfire and sex scenes- the usual stuff of Hollywood fare- you likely won't enjoy this.

1683773,5,B00005YUO1,"HBO's 2001 film ""Conspiracy"" is an important film about the bureaucracy of the Holocaust and the indifference to human life that fueled it.  Kenneth Branagh is brilliant as Reinhard Heydrich, the domineering SD general charged with coordinating the Holocaust between the various party and government organs.  Stanley Tucci offers a chilling performance as Adolf Eichmann, the man who would ultimately be charged with the day-to-day operations of mass murder.  As an historian whose primary field is Nazi Germany I have visited the Wannsee Conference House in Berlin on a few occasions, and the recreation of this event feels very accurate for the most part.

The film is based upon the only known surviving minutes of the conference, and so much of the dialogue and character choices are fictional.  For instance, the film portrays Wilhelm Stuckart, representative of the Interior Ministry, (played by Colin Firth), as a man who objected to the mass killing of the Jews, though was afraid to oppose the scheme.  Instead, he offers legal and bureaucratic objections as a way to voice his protest.  In fact, Stuckart was a member of the SS, and it is difficult to believe that he had any real objection on moral grounds to the killings.  Other characters don't play entirely true to their historical basis either.

Despite these flaws, ""Conspiracy"" largely succeeds in setting the tone and atmosphere of what the meeting must have been like.  These men were bureaucrats, not soldiers or professional politicians, and their willingness to buy into Hitler's lies contributed tremendously to an unimaginable human suffering.  This is a film about men sitting around a table and talking for 90 minutes, and yet it is absolutely riveting- a wonderful, dramatic interpretation of a truly ghastly moment in history.  I only hope that we will soon see the release on DVD of the 1984 West German film ""The Wannsee Conference,"" which is superior to ""Conspiracy"" in many ways, and as a German language film offers a greater sense of authenticity.",1390694400,,2033,5.090361445783133
1683774,5,B00005YUO1,This movie is very educational and really tells the story of how the Gestapo and the German officers planned for the demise and extermination of the Jewish people during WWII.  It is a serious drama and true depiction of who and what took place in a house confiscated from a Jewish family like a business conference that lasts for a little over an hour.  The fate of the Jewish people lied in the hands of these men.  Very intense.,1390262400,,431,4.430379746835443
1683775,1,B00005YUO1,"The reason movies Conspiracy and Die Wannseekonferenz have different dialogues  is the lack of the transcipt of the discussions. All the dialogues are loosely based on the only document that survived, some say fabricated after the war when official letterhead papers, stamps etc where stolen.

This document was discovered in 1947 and introduced as evidence at the Nurenberg trial by Robert Max Wasilii Kemper, the US Prosecutor of Jewish descent who emigrated from Germany in 1935. Another version, with the handwriting copied from the original document and superimposed on another typed text was published in Kemper's book Eichmann und Komplizen. Publication of photomontages instead of the original documents prompted some to suspect foul play.

The protocol details the only legal solution considered at that time, deportation. There is no mention of intentional killing. In fact, the transports were stopped because it was too dangerous due to Allied bombings. While nothing can excuse the deportations, there is a huge leap from deportation to extermination. To infer one from the other is irresponsible. Those who live in dictatorial regimes want the comfort of law, secret if need be. They need to have a higher justification later on: it was the law or a written order, etc. The claim that the Germans reacted en masse at the wink of the Fuhrer shows poor understanding of the German bureaucrat and is a clumsy attempt to cover the lack of material evidence. Actually, Hitler complained that the administration is too punctilious and lacks initiative or flexibility. There is nothing in the Wannsee protocol that protects the Germans against the crimes they were accused of.

The problem with the movie is that it is supposed to represent a grave moment in history. This is not another Indiana Jones movie where one can improvise. The lack of respect for accuracy undermines the message this movie tries to convey.",1390262400,30,1923,5.173633440514469

1683822,5,B00005YUO1,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I've never been impressed with ""made for tv"" or cable movies, but this one changed my mind, and I bought the dvd as soon as it was released.  The plot centers on the Wannsee conference of 1942, when plans for the Final Solution were put in place.  Before this time, the killing of Jews (and others) was widespread, but haphazard.  This was the meeting that officially created the vast, state sponsored engine of death, and the casual attitude with which it was done is chilling.  As Kritzinger (the only participant who had any real moral objection) says: ""Purge the Jews, yes.  But to annihilate them...that we have undertaken to systematically annihilate ALL the Jews of Europe?!?  That possibility has personally been denied to me by the Fuhrer!""  Heydrich replies coldly: ""And it will continue to be.""  I don't know enough to comment on historic accuracy, but since the filmmakers had access to records of the meeting, I'd guess it's fairly close.  The movie was filmed at the actual house where the conference took place, and a nice touch is when Pierson gives us a synopsis of each participants' fate at the end of the war, just before the final credits.

This is an excellent 16x9 transfer, good enough that if it's ever released on Blu-ray, I probably won't bother (unless the studio goes for an in depth restoration and more extras).  There are three special features: a cast/director bio, Featurette #1 (interview with Kenneth Branagh), and Featurette #2 (interviews with Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci, Colin Firth, David Threlfall, and Frank Pierson).  Both features combined are maybe ten minutes long, and I thought they were interesting to watch.

1683867,5,B00005YUO1,"I was deeply shocked but also absolutely IMPRESSED by this extraordinary British film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

This is an extremely faithful reconstruction of the meeting of senior officials of the Nazi German regime, held in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on 20 January 1942. The purpose of the Wannsee Conference was to inform administrative leaders of departments responsible for various policies relating to Jews in III Reich and occupied territories, that Reinhard Heydrich had been appointed as the chief executor of the ""Final solution to the Jewish question"". During the meeting the participants were verbally informed, that this ""final solution"" meant extermination of all Jews in Europe, without exception, women and children included.

To be absolutely clear, it is important to precise, that Jews were already grievously persecuted by the Nazis from the beginning of III Reich in 1933 and that total extermination of Jews by the Nazis began already in June 1941, but was first limited to territories conquered in Soviet Union. This first stage of Shoah was carried from June to December 1941 by special death squads of SS called Einsatztruppen which used firearms to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews in Ukraine, Belarus, Western Russia and Baltic countries - this first stage of extermination is sometimes called ""Holocaust by bullets"".

But somewhere around 15 December 1942, maybe because of the defeat suffered by Wehrmacht during the battle of Moscow, Hitler decided to launch immediately the extermination of Jews in all Europe, by creating real ""death factories"" in which people would be killed in large gas chambers and their dead bodies incinerated in industrial sized crematories.

Therefore it is NOT correct to say that Wannsee Conference was the meeting during which it was decided to launch the Holocaust of Jews in all Europe - that decision was already taken earlier by Hitler himself. The conference was a co-ordination and communication meeting organized to inform all parts of III Reich bureaucratic maze about Hitler's decision of charging the SS with the task of extermination of Jews and make certain that everybody will co-operate. It was therefore still a crucially important meeting and for that reason with time it became a symbolic event marking the beginning of Shoah.

Made in 2001 ""Conspiracy"" is a remake of German film ""The Wannsee Conference"" from 1984. Both films are based very strictly on the only surviving copy of the minutes of the meeting. German version was in fact so faithful to the real story, that it even lasted only 85 minutes - as long as the original meeting. At 96 minutes ""Conspiracy"" is slightly longer as it shows also the preparation of the meeting by cooks, waiters and secretaries under the supervision of Eichmann, eager to please his boss (Heydrich), who clearly terrifies him... But other than this introduction, let's s stress it again that this film is a very faithful reconstruction of the real events.

The one and only visible difference I could notice was in the casting of Ian McNeice, a very corpulent actor who was at this time aged 51, as SS Oberfuhrer Dr. Gerhard Klopfer from Nazi Party Chancellery, considering that the real Klopfer was aged only 37 in 1942 and was thin and in shape - but it is a minor thing.

All actors did a TERRIFIC job in this film, but the gold medal goes to Colin Firth, who plays Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, a highly educated and brilliant lawyer who nevertheless was an ardent Nazi and a pathological Jew hater. When one remembers that this is the same actor who played Mr Darcy and George VI, it is impossible not to be awed by his talent - because here he plays a creature from hell. Frankly in my modest opinion his character is maybe the most evil in the room, even worse than monsters like Heydrich and ""Gestapo"" Mller...

Stanley Tucci, who plays Eichmann, is another star of this film. His character is clearly an underling (his direct boss is ""Gestapo"" Mller, who is a subaltern to Heydrich, who himself answers to Himmler), scared to death by his lethal superiors, but in the same time obsequiously eager to please them and ready to do ANYTHING to advance his career. In the same time he compensates the fear of his hierarchy by bullying and brutalizing all those unfortunate enough to find themselves under his command...

A special mention goes to Jonathan Coy who plays SS Sturmbannfhrer Dr. Erich Neumann from the Office of Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan (one of titles of Goering), a somehow pathetic and ridiculous guy, so clueless that his presence adds a note of grotesque humour to this otherwise extremely dark and macabre event.

Finally, last but not least, there is Kenneth Brannagh, the biggest star present in this film, who plays the most important of the protagonists - Reinhard Heydrich himself. There is no doubt that Kenneth Branagh did a great job in this film and his Heydrich, shown as a polite, astute, charming, charismatic, educated and well-spoken monstrous beast, is a REALLY scary dude! But from what I read about Heydrich, I believe he was even scarier than that and no matter how charming he could be if he wanted it, his very face (and especially those eyes!) revealed the monster hidden inside. And Kenneth Branagh simply couldn't portray this, because he is a human being with the face of a decent guy and not a cold blooded mass murderer... But still, I think he did the best he could.

The action of the film occurs mostly in just two pieces of a large villa and consists almost exclusively of dialogs - but I guarantee that you will not feel the time pass. Also, the atmosphere of bone freezing terror which permeates the second half of the film is more intense than in most of horror movies I saw...

So bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT and TERRIFYING film, which explains more about III Reich and Nazi regime than dozens of long books. I sincerely think it should be a recommended viewing as part of history cursus in high schools. I will keep my DVD to show it to my children, one day when they are big enough to understand it. A film to see ABSOLUTELY!
------------------------------------------------------
Here, if you are interested, you can find the complete list of people present, with the mention of their future fate.

1) SS-Obergruppenfhrer (three star general) Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), organization which regrouped Gestapo, Criminal Police and SD (counter-intelligence and intelligence agency of SS). Heydrich called and chaired the meeting. This extremely ambitious and dangerous man was in January 1942 amongst the most powerful people in III Reich, just beneath the first circle of power made of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Himmler. He was however also the first of participants in Wannsee Conference to die. Grievously wounded in an attack by Czech resistance fighters in Prague on 27 May 1942, he succumbed to his wounds on 4 June 1942.

2) SS-Obersturmbannfhrer (lieutenant-colonel) Adolf Eichmann, Head of Referat IV B4 (Jewish Affairs) of the Gestapo, he was the organiser of the meeting and also its secretary, in charge to prepare the minutes. Later he was one of the main co-ordinators of Holocaust, in charge of the transport of the Jews to death camps. Captured by Mossad in Argentina in 1960, he was tried, sentenced to death and hanged in Jerusalem in 1962.

3) Dr. Josef Bhler, State Secretary in General Government of occupied Poland. Extradited to Poland in 1946, he was tried, sentenced to death and hanged in Krakow on 22 August 1948.

4) Dr. Roland Freisler, State Secretary in Reich Ministry of Justice. Later famous for presiding the court which send to death thousands of people following the 20 July 1944 attempt to kill Hitler, Freisler was killed during an American air raid on Berlin on 3 February 1945.

5) SS-Gruppenfhrer (two star general) Otto Hofmann, Head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA). Imprisoned in 1945, sentenced to 25 years of prison in 1948, he was ultimately released in 1954. He worked as an office clerk until retirement and died in 1982.

6) SS-Oberfhrer (one star general) Dr. Gerhard Klopfer, Permanent Secretary in Nazi Party Chancellery. Imprisoned between 1945 and 1950, he was never tried and ultimately released. He worked until retirement as tax advisor and died in 1987, as the last surviving participant of the conference.

7) Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger, Permanent Secretary in Reich Chancellery. The only participant who ever showed remorse for Nazi crimes, acquitted at his trial for crimes against humanity, he died from natural causes in 1947.

8) SS-Sturmbannfhrer (major) Dr. Rudolf Lange, former commander of Einsatzgruppe A, Deputy of the Commander of the Security Police and the SD for the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Promoted to Standartenfuhrer (colonel) in January 1945 and named head of SD and SS in Poznan (Posen), he was killed in action (or committed suicide) on 23 February 1945 during the last day of defence of the city against advancing Soviet Army.

9) Dr. Georg Leibbrandt, Director in Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. Imprisoned by allies between 1945 and 1949, he was ultimately released and never tried. He died in Bonn in 1982.

The commander of Gestapo was last seen alive on 29 April 1945 in Berlin when preparing for escape from besieged city - he then vanished without trace. It is considered almost certain that during his attempted escape, as thousands of other German soldiers and civilians, he was killed by massive artillery barrage unleashed by Soviet Army against centre of Berlin between 30 April and 2 May, and his unidentified body was buried with other anonymous casualties in a mass grave.

13) SS-Sturmbannfhrer (major) Erich Neumann, State Secretary in Office of the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan. Arrested in 1945, but never tried. Released from custody in 1948 due to sickness, he died later the same year.

1683909,1,B00005YUO1,"Conspiracy purports to be a dramatization of the Wannsee conference.  Its content, however, is pure imagination.  The basic framework - that at Wannsee the extermination of the Jews was planned - is completely unsupported by the text of the so-called Wannsee protocol.

Even in incidental matters, Conspiracy shows a worrying disregard for accuracy.  For instance, two of the Germans are shown talking about their expectation of conquering America.  The idea that Germany aimed at such conquest was a mainstay of war propaganda (disseminated by British agents seeking to drag the United States into the war, and promoted by the Roosevelt administration), but no serious historian believes it today.  Clearly the filmmakers did not consider factual accuracy to be as important as inculcating the politically correct attitude.

Amusingly enough, Conspiracy actually contains a piece of information which discredits the very claims about gas chambers that it makes.  When discussing the gassing of Jews with engine exhaust, one of the officials comments that ""the Jews come out pink"" as a result of the carbon monoxide.  This is indeed correct: lethal carbon monoxide poisoning causes the skin to turn pink or red (""cherry red"" is the typical description).  This red coloration is very prominent, but the key ""witnesses"" who are the foundation of the gas chamber extermination legend don't mention it!  Instead, they describe the corpses as blue or yellow - clear proof that they never saw bodies that had been gassed with carbon monoxide.

However, the viewer should know that: 1.) the only record of said meeting are hand written notes of one participant, and 2.) most of the Nazi's allegedly present at the meeting, were arrested for war crimes but released for lack of evidence. In regards to this last, bear in mind that Germany surrendered unconditionally and the Allies were free to hold war criminals accountable any way they wished. That the Allies could not marshal evidence of any nature to sentence most of the Nazi's allegedly at this meeting to even a brief jail terms speaks volumes - it's one thing to imagine, for dramatic purposes, what might have occurred in history, and who participated, it's another to conform to fact and evidence.",1356825600,,1168,4.898989898989899

Based on real documents from the 1942 Wannsee Conference in Berlin, this is a fascinating and chilling glimpse into those times.

1683933,5,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is an HBO/BBC produced docu-drama recreating the January, 1942 Wannsee Conference where the Nazi Final Solution phase of the Holocaust was devised. Scripted from the actual official minutes of the meeting as meticulously kept by Adolf Eichmann, it's nothing short of a miracle that the actual record of this gathering ever saw the light of day. (Nearly all written evidence of this meeting was destroyed as Hitler's Third Reich collapsed. Nuremberg prosecutors were able to locate one copy of the minutes in attendee Martin Luther's papers after the war).

This film depicts the ice cold detachment of the architects of the Holocaust as they plan for the systematic ""resettlement"" and the murder and forced sterlization of millions of European Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill and physically handicapped, and anyone else deemed undesirable or enemies of the Reich.

This is not a war movie in the traditional sense. It's similar to the film ""Twelve Angry Men"" in that it largely takes place in one room. The entire cast is superb, particularly Kenneth Branaugh as SA chief Reinhardt Heydrich and Gestapo clerk Adolf Eichmann, played by Stanley Tucci.

1683937,3,B00005YUO1,"The Wannsee conference--as horrible as it was-- was merely a high ranking coordination meeting, nothing more, nothing less. It was to announce to the bureaucrats of the Third Reich that the Furher had given the order for the SS to oversee and take responsibility for the resolution of the so-called ""Jewish Question"".
If you read the only surviving copy of the minutes, you can see that it is IMPOSSIBLE to claim that it was the basis for the movie. Like most minutes of any meeting, it is concise, boring, and neutral. As such, one can't know what side-bar discussions took place, or how attendees reacted to each others comments. To this day, Jewish Holocaust scholars can't claim that the meeting proved the Holocaust was a deliberate and intentional action or an unintentional action, driven by a serious of ever more unsatisfactory decisions, based on a government policy of antisemitism and megalomania. Although very well written, the script is pure fantasy and total conjecture.
Moreover, the portrayal of Eichmann and Heydrich is really ridiculous. Eichmann was a petty, insecure, little man, who was a lackey to Heydrich. He, like so many other pre-Nazi era men, was a no body. A loser. He throw himself into his work because it satisfied his sense of self worth;being an SS lieutenant colonel gave him social status and a sense of belonging. He sold his soul to the Devil for recognition and status in the ""new order"" of the Third Reich--as did so many millions of other German men.  Heydrich was a bully, and a man who wanted to be powerful and to be feared. He would have killed his own wife and family if he thought it would benefit him. He was not the sophisticated smooth talking gentleman portrayed by Branagh. Not at all. He was an intelligent, hardworking, unscrupulous, obnoxious, overbearing and pretentious bastard.

1683938,3,B00005YUO1,"This movie is well acted, and masterfully produced and directed.  The script is first rate.  As entertainment, it succeeds brilliantly.  But as history, it commits grievous sins of omission.

The movie implies that the Holocaust was wrought entirely by the evil of the Third Reich.  While it was indeed a major player, there were other villains at work in this atrocity.  The other ""conspirators"" behind the Holocaust were the Zionists, intent on securing, populating and financing a homeland is Palestine (soon to become Israel).  Edwin Black's enlightening work, ""The Transfer Agreement"", is a breathtaking expose' of the efforts world Zionist organizations made to expropriate the wealth of German Jewry, and with it build their Zionist utopia.

According to the Jews Against Zionism website (jewsagainstzionism.com), the Zionists who headed many ostensibly Jewish benevolent organizations during the Nazi Era, were far more concerned with the Judaization of Palestine than they were with the lives and welfare of European Jews, often refusing to render aid or or attempt save their Jewish brethren, even when the consequence of abandonment and betrayal was certain death.  Together, the cold, hard hearts of the Zionists and the Nazis seem to have formed a hammer and anvil upon which the masses of European Jewry were crushed when they would not or could not accede to the demands of this most heinous and grandiose extortion.

While the movie only concerns itself with the action of the Third Reich, there is a treacherous implication that they alone were culpable.  That does not appear to be the case, and conscientious viewers should bear in mind that this film, as excellent as it is, does not even hint at the larger truth.",1341532800,3,1734,5.1571428571428575

It has been a movie I enjoy watching time and time again, I always seem to pick up on a line or two I missed in previous viewings and it's a perfect compliment to the WWII movie marathons my wife and I do with friends.",1339632000,,537,4.104761904761904

However, this movie about an actual event that determined the lives of the unwanted population by the nazis brings the mind set of that gov't home again about what did happen and what can still happen if we do not pay attention to what is happening in the world today.
 The cast was excellent and the aura of contempt and horror was portrayed very very well.  Several days after viewing the DVD, the assasination of SS Chief of Security Reinhard Heydrich was shown on our local PBS station.  Although I was interested in his fate and glad in a sense about his demise, it was also shown the extent that the nazis retaliated mercilessly against the community where he was killed.  They not only captured and killed the brave men who committed the deed they annialated an entire village, men, women children and razed the village!!!",1339459200,,909,4.65625
1683941,5,B00005YUO1,"Conspiracy is an amzing movie. And the acting is amazing.
-The reviewer who stated you don't need Explosions & special effects & MTV types to deliver a solid mvoie that will easilly stand up to the test of time. IMO in 20 years this movie will still deliver the same impact..
--The acting is so well That it deserves some extra breaking down.
--Kenneth Branagh portrays such a PERFECT Reinhard Heydrich. Everything i've read about Heydrich was that it's a FACT that he was Hitlers choice as successor. And i learned why after i launched a campaign of curiosity in the Party's hierarchy. And my conclusions are that Heydrich BRUTAL, CLEVER,STRATEGIC,CALCULATING,INTELLECTUAL,AND olite & propper. I did say ""Brutal"" And this movie, this Final-Solution drama nails it perfectly..And i had no idead who Kenneth Branagh was, but i do now..impressive! And i do believe this to be similar to the way Heydrich handled the conference..
---Stanley Tucci--Adolf Eichmann- WOW! Stanley Tucci nailed Eichman! Cool,commanding,confifent,respectful & most of all= CALCULATING & ORGANIZED. Guys/Gals, im not pro-Nazi. I'm reviewing the movie & the conference. I don't want some reader to read this thinking i'm all up on Nazi-Sacs. I'm not. But i am/was very curious about the regime. It's obvious they we're all evil monsters. But that doesn't mean they can't be clever or acknowledged for other administrative attributes. If not then whats the point of the movie or reviews.. But The role of Eichman is played flawlessly. A powerful servant. Confident,to the point,ruthless and cunning. Very VERY similar to the movie ""Eichman"". So with that movie's portrayal of him, i think he was what i mentioned and this movie showcases that well..
---Owen Teale-as Dr. Roland Freisler --Man was i happy to see the Judge Freisler in this movie. I had always seen him in the videos of the trials of enemies of the state/assasination plot etc. Always screaming & being an arse. So it was a welcomed surprise/shock to see him outside the courtroom. Esp cause i was familiar to who he was..And i did reckognize the actor..
--Side note--Another reason i loved this movie was because i knew who 75% of the Nazi's who we're @ this conference, so it was interesting for me to see them outside of the common,popular settings. war,administrative roles etc..
----Brendan Coyle-- SS Maj. Gen. Heinrich Muller--Wow! what a welcomed surprise to see the HEAD OF THE GESTAPO there. and played by Coyle. Cause i had just watched him in Heroe's & Spock in STarTrek.. Man did he play Muller exactly the way all the literature describes him. cold,boring,radiating power, and soft spoken. Coyle,Muller,the conference, the movie, all together is just awesome..i mean, what other movie has Muller in it. none that's worth anything. And that's not old or black & white..

---Readers- i could list all the members with my opinion but i think that's going to far. I want to. Leibbrandt & the guy who wrote the anti-Jewish Nuremburg laws we're both popular Party members whom are popular figures to anyone who's read any of those huge 1000+ page biography books from library etc. But that's what makes this movie so awesome. It's all powerful & popular party members & popular SS leaders as main characters. Popular i obviously mean their names are common with reading material & the war & regime as a whole..

---I fealt there coulda been more ruthless table-talk..It's a F--A--C--T that these guys all regarded the Jews as vermin & had hate. If they didn't hate for WW1,, they hated form the never ending propaganda, or because it was The law to hate them and be a part of their destruction, not their survival..
-i learned through reading that Anti-semitism was very VERY common back in early 1900's. And after all the years and lawss and careers of anti semetic P.O.V's. It was to the point that it was casual table talk..And i know for a fact that the movie DID tone-it-down. if it didn't tone it down, then IMO it woulda offended most Hebrew viewers & many more who woulda said it was uneccessary & it could encourage anti-semitism..i disagree..And it woulda been cannon to have them laughing more about the Jewish fate & to just have the behavior & mentality that would go hand -in-hand with what they we're trying to achieve. Lets face it, they we're organizing GENACIDE! And they we're doing it casually & with anticipation. The German version of this movie shows some of what i'm complaining about. That movie seems to be 20-30 years older,,but same conference and situation..
---So that it my neutral NEGATIVE..
~~~~~If anyone has seen it or has heard of ~Undersecretary Martin Luther~ He strongly disliked Hebrews and his personality really showed it & he was eager..I woulda thought the rest of the group woulda been colder.. All the jokes @ the Jewish expense and the intentions etc shoulda just been tripple as ruthless..
--Instead they we're ruthless but with such a calmness..They seemed to just want it over with so they could get on with something else..

---SO if you are interested in a good movie about HOW & WHY the FINAL SOLUTION started and the players involved etc, THIS IS THE MOVIE TO ANSWER ALL THAT. And the acting & script/plot etc IS BETTER, not worse then the story..IMO the story is what attracts most to consider this movie and they are concerned about the cast. Well i was & you will too be surprised at how clever & perfect the acting is....

-----------FIVE STARS---------
--I want more movies about how major historic events get planned...There's a popular Himmler broadcast which he 1st announces to the German people about the concentration camps. This meeting/broadcast was attended by 50 bery high ranking party memeber..IMO WORTHY OF A MOVIE...

----A MOVIE ABOUT Reinhard HEYDRICH and his rise to power is easily a obvious story that MOST history fans or most educated people would want to see. The guy is just interesting. there's boring VILLAINS from history & facinating ones. Heydrich is intruiging.. Every book ive read portrays him as super clever and always plot withing plots..
---Even the WW2 FICTIN books with him ( The Man with The Iron Heart) was awesome and portrayed him as ruthless..

--The Munich conference--Attended by Mussolini,,Hermsn Goering,,Hitler,British prime minister right before Churchill,Chamberlain,,,Himmler,Generals,Ribbentrop, and many historical figures...The Munich agreement might not be as powerful as the Wannasee Conference because of the 6 million+ jewish deaths,,,but it did give the Nazi's part of Czechoslovakia...And that's where all the Czech defenses we're. SO Hitler just walked in and took over the hwole country LOL. I'm NOT laughing at the horror of it,,but of how retarded it was to give a meglamaniac the keys to a country and act surprised when he wlks in and stays..It opened up him wanting Austria,,then Danzig,then Poland and then,,,and then,,, wtf we're the British & Italians thinking..man, if only we had JFK as president then. or his dad was president then instead of ambassa...

----I'm sorry to anyone who was like ""wtf is all this about? it is very derailed form the review.."" It's teh very 1st time ive talked/typed about this movie and the Nazis at all..and it is part of the impact of this GREAT MOVIE...BUY IT! it's a keeper,,not a torrent..

1683942,5,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is an HBO movie about the Wannsee Conference, a meeting of senior Nazi officials held in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on January 20th, 1942, to discuss the ""final solution"" of the fate of Jews in Europe.  Starring Kenneth Branagh as Reinhard Heydrich and Stanley Tucci as Adolf Eichmann, the movie is a very good example of how a dialog-driven movie, without any violence (except for a single face slap) or computer generated graphics, can captivate and horrify you.

The movie is spot-on with regards to the period, from the uniforms of the era right down to the mannerisms of the ""Germans"", which include their love of supporting documentation and their rapping their knuckles on a tabletop to signify approval.  (I lived in Germany for five years, and saw these mannerisms first hand.)  The acting is superb all around ... particularly Branagh and Tucci in the leading roles.

This movie is based on a surviving copy of the ""minutes"" taken from the conference (which were edited immediately afterwards by Eichmann).  The dialog in the movie is based on what documentary evidence is available, although it is in large part fictionalized.  If you actually read the minutes, they are intentionally vague, and don't include the dramatic conversations and tensions of the movie, nor do they mention mass murder at the concentration camps.  (They do include Heydrich's proposal to evacuate most Jews to the east to be worked on road projects, where a large part were expected to die due to ""natural causes"".)  It wasn't until Eichmann's interrogation in Israel in 1962, that he filled in some of the gaps in the minutes and explained what was actually being discussed both during and immediately after Heydrich's initial presentation.  As an interesting side note, the film matches, minute by minute, the actual time of the conference.

Overall, this is an outstanding movie about a terrible time in history, where the fate of millions rested on the decisions of 15 men.  Five stars.",1337558400,,1993,5.006060606060606

1683944,4,B00005YUO1,"This movie is not for everyone...

BUT if you enjoy political dramas, conspiracies, the history of Nazi Germany and WW2, etc etc, you will probably come to appreciate this one. It will probably be the definitive (non-documentary) movie made on the conference itself.

Pros:
The acting is excellent, and I disagree with reviews that dislike the English accents. The actors all looked the parts they were trying to portray, and the accents didn't take away from it at all in my opinion.

The setting, uniforms/clothing, and props were well done.

The movie properly portrays Heydrich's manipulation of the conference members (thus ensuring their 'buy in' or at least reducing them to public silence), and the fact that Hitler would not issue a direct written order on the ""Jewish question"".

Cons:
You will likely need some foreknowledge of the characters to follow who-is-who, and understand their positions as the conference argues the case. I suggest looking up Wannsee Conference on Wikipedia before watching it.

The details of their round-table conversation can get a bit tedious as the movie progresses. You may wish to view it more than once to follow the details.

Despite the military nature of the movie, it is not an action film, so understand that up front. (Thats not really a 'con', but I offer it as a bit of warning).",1332028800,,1332,4.946188340807175
1683945,5,B00005YUO1,"This is by far the best example of how barbaric Hitler and his subordinates really were. It's a meeting primarily shot in a single room (ala 12 Angry Men). This was more like 12+ sadistic men. The reason for the meeting was clear to the SS leader played superbly by Kenneth Brannagh and his subordinate brilliantly played by Stanley Tucci before it began, eliminate the Jews. Through a series of round table discussion, Brannagh bullies everyone into supporting his (and Hitler's) idea of a Final Solution. This is a must see for anyone remotely interested in history,WWII or trying to understand how people can do such horrible things to each other.",1331856000,,650,4.864864864864865

The new thing for me was learning that Hitler's Final Solution went through several iterations before it ended up as execution. I'll get into that more on this blog when I start posting my responses to that depressing book. He recommended the HBO movie, Conspiracy (2001), for a compelling dramatization of the 1942 Wannsee Conference outside Berlin where Heydrich and Eichmann sought consensus from several Nazi government and martial leaders.

The notes of the meeting were supposed to have been destroyed, but one copy, that of, I'm not kidding, Martin Luther, was found, after the war by the Allies. Screenwriter Loring Mandel wrote a dramatization based on those notes, adding the dimension of what the pressure must have been like on those who still held onto shreds of their humanity and were repulsed by this decision from Hitler. The job of SS General Hydrich, portrayed wickedly by Kenneth Branagh, was to get everyone's approval, whether they had reservations or not. The earlier versions of Hitler's ""solution"" was to exile the Jews to Madagascar, not too different from Stalin's methods of exile which had a byproduct of high mortality. Then it was just exile to the Soviet Union, when it was an ally against Poland. Then it was evacuation out of Poland, but no one would take them, not even the United States, to our shame. At this conference, evacuation became a euphemism for elimination for execution.

This movie is a ninety minute board room meeting. This may sound boring, but it is the subject matter, the potential execution of 10 - 20 million Jews in contrast with the tedium of such a meeting that provides the drama. You watch aghast as Himmler goes over the latest methods developed to execute more humans in less time, as if he he were discussing widget production. It is a terror of the sublime. I empathize with the cast who were able to inhabit the world of the Nazis so fully that they can maintain no sense of the horror in their lines, just business. I almost wish they didn't do such a good job, they won Emmys and Golden Globes. If you are a fan of Downton Abbey as my wife and I are, you'll be delighted to see Mr. Bates, Brendan Coyle, as SS Maj. Gen. Heinrich Muller, but then you are disgusted with Muller, and wish you never associated him with Bates.

1683954,2,B00005YUO1,"This was an interesting depiction of that tragic meeting - BUT - what ruined it for me was the casting of Branagh as Heydrich. Completely unbelievable. And also the casting of Stanley Tucci as Eichman. Horrible.
 First of all - Branagh is just not tall enough to be a believable Heydrich. Secondly, he was completely incapable of conveying the psychopathic air that Heydrich exuded. Branagh had a little twinkle in his eye throughout - and a somewhat smug and bemused comportment. Anyone who has ever seen film footage of Heydrich knows there was no ""twinkle"" in his Killer's eyes - and ""bemusement"" was a character trait utterly foreign to him.  Branagh never seemed, in any way, scary. Heydrich never seemed anything but. Anthony Hopkins was able to get ""the look"" with his Lecter role. Branagh never even comes close.
 As for Tucci - a totally unbelievable depiction of Adolf Eichmann. And if you've seen Thamas Kreschmann's absolutely brilliant and riveting performance in the 2007 film ""Eichmann"" - then Tucci becomes unwatchable in this role.
These two men are both excellent actors. And maybe they should be glad they are incapable of pulling these two monsters from somewhere inside themselves. But for us - the audience - the failure to do so is painful to watch.
I'd pass on it.",1310860800,7,1288,4.872146118721461
1683955,5,B00005YUO1,"I don't know why my previous review of this film was deleted, but here we go again.

Whether or not this movie is truly historical in all the details I feel is unimportant. Several historical films have been made which were not historically accurate to one degree or another but were nevertheless very good as drama. You can argue the merits or demerits of a film which is not truly, perfectly, historically accurate (e.g., Valkyrie, John Rabe, Amadeus, etc.). Other films are poorly made and the historical innacuracies just add to the dismal quality of those films.

What I like about this film, which portrays a conference of high ranking Nazis in early 1942 on how to solve the ""Jewish Problem"" is the burearucracy. Bureaucracies is a subject which rarely gets the treatment in movies that it deserves, usually a passing comment. Nonetheless, they are a fascinating subject. This movie shows different types of bureaucrats with their own personal agendas coming together to solve a ""problem,"" bickering all the while, not realizing until the end that the decision/the solution was already made prior to the meeting taking place. The Jews, up to that time, had been seen by the Nazis, as being parasitical and corrupting and should therefore be segregated or expelled from territories controlled by the Nazis. By 1942, the decision had been made to engage in mass murder of the Jewish population. Some of the bureaucrats agree, others don't care, some object, but in the end a consensus is agreed to. The dynamics displayed in the movies can be seen in any university, any government bureaucracy, any corporation and that is why this movie is so good.",1309219200,,1654,4.924731182795699
1683956,5,B00005YUO1,"The movie ""Conspiracy,"" reenacting the Nazi hosted conference at Wannsee on the outskirts of Berlin, Germany is riveting.  It is here that the plan was forged to annihilate the Jews of Europe.

The cold, calculating way in which Nazi Chief of Security Reinhard Heydrich presents the manner and methods for exterminating Jews is like nothing seen on screen before, at least by me. Many of the men attending this conference were trained as lawyers, which made for interesting arguments for and against the methods proposed. While hearing these arguements you must remind yourself that they're discussing the killing of human beings on a grand scale. Yes, its a cold conference in a cold climate both inside and outside the mansion its being held at.

The acting is convincing but more effective is the tense setting of powerful men around the table. It is here where these men who support Aryan Supermacy must come face-to-face with the adoption of a final solution for their country's so-called ""Jewish Question."" Mostly all show some strain of balancing their support for the solution with their conscience for upholding moral law.  Its a movie that even the best review cannot fully capture its essence. I saw as much fear of power as I did hunger for it.

It was also a lesson in semantics: Emigrate, Expel, Eradicate, Excommunicate, Exterminate, Eliminate Evacuate

Quote from movie:  When one government minister asks one of the SS Commanders responsible for the death of 30,000 Jews at Riga, Latvia, who also happens to be a lawyer, how he applies his legal education to what he does, the commander answers as follows:  It has made me distrustful of language; a gun means what it says.",1307404800,,1690,4.926056338028169

SPOILER ALERT:
This review does contain plot elements, but, seriously, it's history; we all know what the Germans did during WWII.

The Holocaust was, quite simply, the industrialization of murder. Well, the Wannsee Conference was the board meeting, and the attendees were the directors. The chairman of the board: Reinhard Heydrich, played by Kenneth Branagh in what must be one of the finest performances of his rather distinguished career.

This is not an action movie. There are no explosions, no gunshots. Very little actually *happens* in its 96-minute run time. But it is no less compelling for this. As a dialogue-driven movie, the script and the casting are both vitally important, and in both aspects this film is excellent. The film is riveting, chilling, and poignant, and should be considered a must-see, especially by anyone with an interest in history.

""Conspiracy"" is a virtually minute-by-minute recreation of the meeting that took place on 20 January 1942, at Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin. At that meeting, the fate of millions of people was decided, but to those who attended it, it was essentially no more or less than a board meeting, as if they were discussing whether or not to build a new factory somewhere. Jews had been dehumanized so successfully in Nazi Germany that throughout the meeting, they are reduced to numbers, mere statistics; at the bottom line, 11 million Jews have presented a bit of a ""storage problem"" to the Reich.

These people, the attendees of the conference, took about 90 minutes to decide on a solution to the problem. In truth, the decision had already been made, and indeed, the ghastly mechanics of the 'final solution' were put into operation on a limited scale months before the conference even took place. The real purpose of the meeting, as the movie illustrates, was actually to take these people and get them all on the same page, and to make it clear to those who might not agree to support the extermination of the Jews that, to paraphrase Heydrich, ""this is how it's going to be, and you'd better get on board. Or else."" Heydrich, for his part, is quite a charismatic fellow, even when he's bullying somebody else into agreement, and Branagh brings a performance to the role that is at once both intimidating and chummy, and entirely chilling in all aspects.

The other attendees (who, without exception, are brilliantly cast, though Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci are the standouts) approach the discussion with a variety of views on the subject, some even with a creepifying levity, but at the end of the day, even the ""good guys"" (in a relative sense) who oppose outright extermination still are vocally expressing their disdain for the Jews and are at the meeting to decide the best way to remove an entire ethnic group from the human race.

And it's all dealt with as though they were making a business decison. In truth, that's exactly what they would have told you they were doing.",1304467200,3,2958,4.868787276341949

The movie manages to discuss openly - the NAZI racial ideology, without adhering to political correctness of the year 2000 - and without descending to profanity as a means of absolving the director of NAZI sympathies.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s a group of Englishmen, recorded for posterity, the Art of English Rhetoric, in a series of movies - Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Conspiracy, Shackleton and others.

1683962,5,B00005YUO1,"A brilliant made for TV movie about the Wannsee Conference, where Nazi bigwig Reynhard Heydrich informed about a dozen mid level Nazi bureaucrats of Hitler's decision to annihilate all the Jews living in Germany and under its occupation. The meeting itself lasted about an hour and a half and took place in a cold day of January 1942 on a pretty lake side mansion on the suburbs of Berlin. The movie follows the conference in real time. As the bureaucrats begin to realize, this was not a conference arranged to discuss the issue of extermination but to inform about it, and to bring to the line of the genocidal goals of the top Nazi leaders all the relevant ministries. As the last part of the film makes clear, the issue of the gas chambers was already decided before the conference. Heydrich can be a charming and persuasive host, and at the same time, as a brilliant manipulator of men, will not be swayed at all by any objection, and he will get all the other bureaucrats into line. I came to see this with some trepidation, because I have read and have some interest in the era, I am distrustful of movies set in Nazi Germany spoken in English. Kenneth Branagh is not one of my favorite actors, but here he portrays Heydrich superbly. Also good is Colin Firth, as Wilhelm Stuckart, a Nazi lawyer who devised the racial laws in the 1930s, but who realizes the monstrosity of what is being proposed here. Yet he knows he has no power to object, and only ends up putting legalistic arguments against the plan, not ethical. There was a previous film about the Wannsee Conference, made in Germany in 1984. You can watch it in Youtube, and is clear that this movie follows it very closely. Any objection to this movie is necessarily minor: Stanley Tucci is brilliant as Eichmann, but he doesn't resemble very much the Nazi criminal. And one wonders if Dr. Kritzinger (great performance by David Threlfall) did really initially object so much to Heydrich in the conference. But these objections are very minor: this film is flat out excellent.",1298764800,3,2043,4.6464088397790055
1683963,4,B00005YUO1,"Conspiracy boasts a wonderful cast whose acting is superlative and very convincing. This is one of very few movies to tell the story of what was going on behind the scenes inside the Nazis regime and they argued, bickered and at times disagreed with blatant hostility as to what to do about the Jewish ""storage problem."" The Nazis had, of course, rounded up many Jews and/or degraded them in any way possible; and the Holocaust had already started with many European Jews being killed simply for being Jewish. However, this portrayal of the early 1942 Wannsee Conference, when Nazis gathered in a Berlin suburb to officially determine ""the final solution,"" shows with such clarity just how brutal--and patently evil--the Nazis truly were as World War Two raged on. In addition, the choreography and the cinematography shine; and the script was very well written--I appreciated that they based the partially fictionalized script on the actual notes of the only surviving copy; this was a copy of notes intended only for Nazi leaders above the rank of any Nazi member or officer present at the meeting.

The plot is really rather simple enough; when the movie starts we already know what ""the final solution"" concerning the Jews will be. However, it's the way the actors play it out that makes the film dynamic; and that's special. Look for brilliant performances by the great Stanley Tucci as Adolf Eichmann and Kenneth Branagh as the true leader of the meeting, Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich attends the meeting to lay down the law to the others that there will be no tolerance in the Nazi regime for anyone disputing the extermination of as many Jews as possible. Colin Firth also does a tremendous job of playing Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, co-author of the Nuremburg Laws and Ian McNeice gives a flawless performance as Dr. Gerhard Klopfer who is willing to let all the Jews die so long as the Nazi party doesn't lose any power to the SS. I was also very impressed with David Threlfall, who plays Dr. Wilhelm Kritzinger, Secretary of the Reich chancellery--and some of what he says at the meeting may surprise you! Also look for Barnaby Kay as Major Rudolf Lange, a cold-blooded Nazi who takes pride in having killed many Jews.

If the film has any drawback, it would be that at times it drags. They should have edited it down a few minutes to keep up the pace. This, however, isn't a major problem as the actors portray their characters so well.

Overall, I recommend this film for anyone studying World War Two; and of course fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",1298419200,2,2603,4.754424778761062

The only surviving copy of the minutes leaves abmiguity about just how far this discussion went, but Branagh unerringly captures the essence of Naziism -- an unstable mix of psychopathic anti-semitism, ruthless bureaucratic politics, self-delusion, and orderly, businesslike German behavior.  Branagh himself turns in a star performance as the courtly yet implacable Reinhard Heydrich, one of history's most fascinating monsters.  Within the ensemble cast of brilliant actors Stanley Tucci absolutely nails the obsequeous Adolph Eichmann, and Barnaby Kay is compelling in the role of Rudolph Lange, a hardened SS veteran of the Eastern Front who exhibits no conscience but some curiousity over the business in which he finds himself engaged.  Colin Firth is utterly brilliant as Wilhelm Stuckart, author of the infamous Nuremburg Laws and a man who tempers his pathological hatred of Jews with an equally obsessive need to see the elimination of the Jews done in a legal fashion.  Ian McNeice steals scene after scene as the oafish yet jolly Nazi party hack Gerhard Klopfer.  The remaining cast members deliver convincing performances in a beautifully recreated setting.

I return to this film over and over in an attempt to understand. And it may well be the best effort that film can muster toward that understanding - but only in the context of Schindlers List or the documentary, Auschwitz. Still, despite our best efforts, we come down to the reality that there simply is no understanding to be had. Kenneth Branagh's Heydrich is subtly menacing and arrogant. Stanley Tucci""s Eichmann is brilliantly understated - appropriate to the officious little functionary. The screenplay manages to touch on much of the push and pull surrounding the Wannsee conference that day in February of 1942: Operation Barbarosa, the assault on the Soviet Union, was mired in a deep freeze for which the Wehrmacht was ill-prepared; the American industrial juggernaut was about to be introduced into the mix; for the first time, the National Socialist vision of a world dominated by Germania was in doubt; and the Gestapo was determined to be the dominant agency for the final solution to the Jewish question.

Of course it was a tragic and cold blooded story, and the film does a great job of showing how the Nazis approached this is a mechanical/business-like manner, as if they were discussing how to meet the yearly quota for beer.

1683993,5,B00005YUO1,"An eclectic group of fifteen men gathered in a former Jewish residence, at distance from the fighting, in order to solve a most troublesome, petulant quandary, the Jewish question. Called upon by Hitler, as the German army became sessile in their drive toward Moscow, the conference concludes in the creation of legal framework designed to remove the Jewish population. Interrupted by smoking, gorging and underhanded, persuasive techniques they determined the fate and solution to the Jewish problem and lead ultimately to the demise of millions of innocents. Over two hours, and with ample supply of spirit and fare, the techniques for excision, eradication, and extermination of the Jews became a reality.
Although the Germans were meticulous in their obsessive record keeping, the Wannsee conference was documented in short; the only surviving manuscript the basis for this film. However, it is the meticulous cold hearted recording of laws establishing Jew from non-Jew which communicates the depravity of the Nazi mindset, portraying them as a true species of brutality.
Long sequences of dialogue restricted to a small set comprise the majority of the film. The one break in the dialogue is a wide panning shot across a cold desolate landscape capturing the approach of General Heydrich, who called the meeting under the pretext of deporting the Jews from Europe. While the film does not flash mutilated corpses in hopes of stirring some sense of sympathetic guilt, it instead casts a calculated demeanor on the faces of the characters. Sitting at the center of the table Heydrich announces to the group the number of Jews remaining in German controlled territory. Displaying charts and figures of the Jews still in need of ""transport"" the dehumanization becomes vividly apparent. Before such accommodations are finalized they calculate with cruel subjectivism the specific traits and relationships which denote a Jew. From this conversation the audience learns that a small majority of Germans and German families are to be disassembled and dealt with in a manner comparable to an animal to the slaughter. Those who object to the ""evacuation"" of the Jews, namely Kritzinger and Stuckart are humored, for the decision to build camps and gassing facilities is not truly dependent on the proceedings of the confrence but rather the available labor to construct such infrastructure. The gas chambers and sterilization methods have been proven through rigorous trials on the mentally defunct, and they joke turning the bodies pink.

""Conspiracy"" is not only an amazing historical account but also chilling in the unconventional mathematically cold faade employed by the cast.

1683995,5,B00005YUO1,"In January 1942, at an elegant villa at Berlin-Wannsee, a group of Nazi officials from various ministries and departments, the majority educated, cultured men, many with higher degrees, came together under the chairmanship of SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Reinhard Heydrich, head of the RSHA (Reich Main Security Office, which covered all of Germany's police forces). In a few hours, which included some elegant dining, they basically decided the fate of European Jewry. It was as if they were deciding on a programme of vermin extermination, which, in the eyes of fanatical Nazis, it was. No consideration of the humanity of these people was given. Herr Dr. Stuckart, lawyer and proud author of the Nuremburg Racial Laws, was concerned with their proper, meticulous observance. This was his sole bone of contention, not the basic fact that an entire group of humans was to be marginalised and deported from the Reich, not because of anything they'd done, but because of who they were. Indeed, the only minor concessions were those who had ""German"" (non-Jewish) spouses and ""Mischlinge"" (mixed race people). Of all the many inhumanities of man to man, this surely ranks as one of, if not the, greatest iniquities ever perpetrated.

This meeting was not only to decide on the Final Solution, but also to establish the supremacy of the RSHA over all other German departments in the matter. And Heydrich, with the help of his Hebrew-speaking time-and-motion man Adolf Eichmann, got what he wanted.

Having recently read Mark Roseman's ""The lake, the villa, the meeting"" and now knowing how little we know about what was actually said at Wannsee (only one protocol survives and the accounts of the survivors are probably self-serving and justifying), I was curious as to how one produced a dramatised version. The answer is, very impressively. Naturally nobody knows what was really said, as all notes and records were destroyed, but the whole production has the ring of truth about it.

In the middle of it all was ringmaster Reinhard Heydrich, chillingly played here by Kenneth Branagh. Heydrich works his potential opponents, sometimes in the meeting, sometimes in quiet asides over food. The geniality of the Branagh character was probably much more that that of the real Heydrich, who had the reputation of being somewhat of a cold fish and a thoroughly nasty individual, but it's a wonderful performance, with steel under the geniality, rapidly emerging at the first hint of resistance to his ideas.

All in all, a nicely-acted, chilling production of a monstrous misdeed, and it all happened within living memory in one of the world's most civilised, cultured countries. If that doesn't scare you, nothing will. Could it happen again? Of course it could, so we must always be on our guard against people who know all the answers.

One minor irritation for finicky me. The opening scene has a view of Heydrich's plane coming in to land, taken from above. The wings bear swastikas, instead of the Luftwaffe's ""Balkenkreuz"" (the swastika was placed only on vertical tail surfaces). Perhaps the producers saw the need to use the symbol of evil to set the scene right from the start.",1241654400,3,3173,5.059273422562142

If you would it may be similar to those Nuremberg Trial movies but here is an open free debate where the Jews are consider a thing or an illness that they need to get rid off.

1683997,5,B00005YUO1,"This film is simply outstanding.  It's an admittedly strange experience to sit through two hours of the Wannsee Conference, the moment when the Nazi leadership decided on the ""Final Solution,"" but if you're interested in the subject matter, the film is extremely well done.

Watching it was unlike watching _Downfall_, which I thought was totally dull and never even finished watching - we not only know how it ends, but most of us probably don't shouldn't care for those down in the bunker in Berlin - so I never really had any investment, other than hoping the end (of the movie and of the cretins cowering in the bunker) would come sooner rather than later.  In contrast, _Conspiracy_ is a fascinating exercise, even when we don't care about the individuals - we still wonder, ""why did the Nazis decide on the Final Solution?, how did they justify it?.""

The film makes one wonder about all kinds of issues, from moral to legal to political.  Colin Firth, who plays one of the characters, says it best in the featurette - if it was a meeting where everyone agreed to ""kill them all,"" it would somehow be less shocking - evil people do evil things, no problem understanding that, even if we don't agree with it.  But, at Wannsee, or at least in this film portrayal, the attendees debate and discuss everything from military needs, the German social order, various assessments of Jews in Germany and other parts of Europe, and, yes, the methods to solve what most in the room considered to be a problem (although for various reasons).  So, if I started the film wondering, ""Why am I watching a film depicting a decision made to kill Jews?"", I finished astounded at the variety of influences that went into the decision at Wannsee, and at the prowess of the filmmakers and actors who pulled off a totally engrossing film in _Conspiracy_.

Which leads me to my only criticism of the film - its title seems utterly inappropriate and insufficient.  Perhaps a ""conspiracy"" could describe an attempt to kill Hitler, but the only conspiratorial part of the Wannsee conference was to keep it quiet (although why that should be or from whom they wanted to keep the conspiracy wasn't discussed in the film - the characters sure seemed to be all for it, even if they argued over timing, leadership and method).  Perhaps a subtitle - even just ""the Wannsee Conference"" would help.  After all, who would want to just watch this movie for its acting and directing - there must be better/easier subjects if you just want a nice movie with a tight plot, great acting, careful directing and tense psychological drama, all of which _Conspiracy_ has.

What this film does so well is bring history alive; perhaps even more so because we, the audience, are forced to sit with some of the most ""evil"" characters in history and watch as they work out their plan (or really, as Haydrich - played by Kenneth Branagh - pushes his way around and threatens all of the participants to comply with what seems to be an already-worked-out plan of mass extermination through gas chambers.  I found myself hoping someone would speak against the plan (knowing that probably no one would); I think it was the excellent craft that went in to the film that enabled me to continue to look for cracks or a way out, or at least to try to understand or even to challenge the participants at the table - all of which kept me wrapped in the film for the duration.

In sum, it's a fantastic film for history fans, helping to dramatize what could otherwise too easily, and perhaps incorrectly, be seen as a bunch of evil guys doing evil just because they're evil.  This film shows the complexity of viewpoints, actions, beliefs and statements made in specific situations with various participants representing multiple interests, over banal issues like supplies, timelines, and political maneuvering, and thereby makes the appearance of evil thereby even more shocking.",1237161600,2,3924,4.766961651917404
1683998,5,B00005YUO1,"This film is another relatively unknown HBO made for TV gem. It is based on the minutes of an actual meeting in 1942 of Nazi Department Heads. All the notes were to have been destroyed but one copy survived. This was a meeting convened by Adolf Eichmann in a suburban mansion outside Berlin. The agenda: what to do about the Jewish storage problem. With the Nazi war machine devouring the German treasury, they had to make a decision about all the Jews in work camps that were becoming very expensive to maintain. Until this point, there had been no overall German plan for dealing with the 'Jewish problem'. This meeting determined the fate of millions of Jewish citizens. The film does not try to sensationalize or over dramatize this event. In many ways, it comes across as a corporate board of directors meeting or cabinet level meeting for government. Evil can be so cold and calculating and seemingly rational. This is a reminder that evil does not always or often come in frenzied, worked up packages but often through the distorted worldview of 'normal' people like all of us. A well done, tightly scripted movie with excellent performances by the cast that will give you chills when you consider the ramifications of one hour of time with these 15 men. The setting (basically one room) and intensity remind me of 12 ANGRY MEN. Watch a piece of history that changed our world forever.",1236988800,2,1392,4.732510288065844
1683999,5,B00005YUO1,"This movie is surreal, true and weird to watch. Am not from Europe, and my country was not affected by the Nazis. So my views may be unclouded with emotion, but may also sound harsh to some. My apologies in advance.
1) The movie is how the Nazis view the Jews. Period.
2) The General heading the conference states that Germany has exhausted all options to ""purge"" europe of all jews, ""from Belfast to Belgrade"". No Free country in Europe is willing to take jews. Not even USA. So, if USA had agreed to accept the expelled jews, would not millions have been saved? Probably USA has that guilty conscience today?
3) Hitler's constitutional inability to decide comes to the fore when he authorises a person to talk about the question of purging of jews, but gives authority to the General to annihilate them. This leads to a major clash. The chancellery representative clearly states that Hitler told him that Purging was the only option, not annihilation. His words: ""Purge the Jews, yes. But annihilate them...that we have undertaken to systematically annihilate all the Jews of Europe? No. That possibility has been personally been denied to me by The Fuhrer! ""
to which the General coldly replies: ""and it will continue to be."" That left me stunned.
4) Many of the SS and Nazi party members are clearly unsettled with the prospect of annihilation. They want the jews to be pushed out of sight, not mass-murdered. But they support the person who killed 30,000 jews in Krakow. Weird. Very Weird. The Reich must have been a surreal land.
5) Martin Bormann's  representative, a jowled old idiot is every bit the Nazi partyman: ruthless, idiotic and smug.
6) The Germans are very careful in following laws and making the whole purge as lawful as possible. They study the Race laws of Nuremberg and make sure it is followed. So the myth of lawless nazis is a clear lie. The ""imposition of ad-hoc law"" as the nuremberg laws creator states.
7) First-degree Jews will be sterilized forcibly. If you watch the movie Nuremberg Trials you will see the Germany lawyer arguing in favor of Judge Ernst Janning that sterilization of a particular witness was done because of his lack of mental ability and NOT due to race. So...
8) The General clearly states that deciding who is a jew or not (3/4 blood, blah, blah) will decide solely with SS: thus sealing their fate.",1235433600,2,2353,4.711165048543689

Their lives and their families' lives depend on it.  Kenneth Branagh leads the meeting with an iron fist in a velvet glove.  His sharp eye convinces each attendee that this plan is perfectly rational and in the best interest of the Third Reich.  Each man was given a copy of the minutes of the meeting and instructed to destroy it after reading.

1684003,5,B00005YUO1,"This film takes place in one place only and with a limited set of characters. It revolves around the Wannsee Conference, a meeting held at the highest levels of the German government and the Nazi Party. The conference brings together lawyers, technocrats, military (SS), and bureaucrats who, after being skillfully guided by Reichsprotector Reinhard Heydrich, set the stage for the mass extermination of the Jewish population in Europe. The issue is settled much as a trade treaty or a new public relations campaign might be. The scariest part of the story is how mundane all this was. The decision was made and carried out and that was the end of it, just a lot of numbers and trains and changes in official policy to these people.

1684004,5,B00005YUO1,"I'm not certain what I can add that hasn't already been said -- so eloquently -- about this film.  After seeing a film with someone, you might be tempted to ask that person, ""Did you enjoy the movie?""  This isn't a movie to be enjoyed; rather, it is an experience to be remembered and talked about.  Needless to say, the acting is superb, as is the script.  For me, I take note of what is said non-verbally...

When Heydrich tells Kritzinger that the Fuhrer will ""continue to deny"" any planning or intent to commit genocide no matter how many times Kritzinger broaches the subject with Hitler -- the look on Kritzinger's face is one of a man who has just had his rose-colored glasses ripped torn off and crushed in front of him.  There could be no more rationalizations, no more putting on blinders.  They weren't there to discuss anything.  Kritzinger was there to listen...and obey.

A scene near the end -- mentioned by other reviewers -- where Heydrich gives Kritzinger his, ""Oh, you'll answer now or you'll answer...later"" ultimatum, you can see that the latter is totally deflated. He has become useless as a voice of reason.  And his previously role as such a ""statesman"" was perfectly described by Heydrich when he told him, ""And your philosophy is what -- hound them, improverish them, exploit them, imprison them, but do not kill them.  And you are God's noblest of men.  I find that very remarkable.""  Although Kritzinger murmured a feeble objection, he had to realize that he had been an instrument in the Nazis finally descending to the point of industrial age barbarism, complete with busload-sized ovens.

Finally, Klopfer's reaction to Eichmann's revelation that their latest version of ""evacuating the Jews"" would kill 2,500 defenseless men, women, and children per hour was...riveting.  You could almost see in that pig's expression his attempt to visualize the slaughter.

The symbolic act of knocking on wood took on a whole new meaning for me after watching this movie.

For an entire film taking place (for the most part) in one room, it is amazingly riveting. Watching these Nazi's sitting around the table eating, drinking, and joking while they discuss the ""final solution"" is quite chilling. Those familiar with the Wansee Conference will respect the accuracy of the portrayal of events while those new to this will simply be shocked at the casual discussions about the most serious of subjects.

Kenneth Branagh stands out in a superior cast in the role of Reinhard Heydrich. He comes across as the coldest and most unfeeling of the lot with frightening effect. Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Adolph Eichmann is good, if somewhat out-of-sync with historical perseptions of his role at the meeting.

1684009,4,B00005YUO1,"A ninety minute dramatization of the infamous ""Final Solution"" meeting where a little over a dozen high-ranking wartime Germans got together and talked, in euphemistic, statistical, and theoretical terms, about mass murder.  The film spices things up by showing the rivalry behind the usually monolithic-looking Nazi Party, but the lesson to take from this one is, indeed, the dryness.  Here is a bunch of mere men talking about killing millions of people with no more morality than a board meeting talking about advertising strategies.  The most impassioned argument against murder comes not from any sort of love or compassion, but rather as an argument of the primacy of -already blatantly racist and anti-Semetic- laws.  The most conscientious member of the panel is reduced to arguing that should all the Jews be killed, what else will there be for Nazism to work for?

History has shown that the Holocaust and crimes like it are not fantastic, extraordinary things.  Once it gets to the point of systematic extermination, it is absolutely banal.  Once things become banal, even normal bureaucratic mooks, such as Eichmann, can involve themselves and still sleep at night.  This movie exemplifies that; the awe and shock comes not so much from what is portrayed as what is wholly missing: the better points of humanity.",1213228800,,1324,5.125581395348838
1684010,5,B00005YUO1,"I know it's been said before, but I have to say that it's amazing what you can do when you get an outstanding cast of actors together with an outstanding script.  This film is basically like a one act play.  Very simple, no scene changes, no special effects, but boy does it work!

This film is a dramatization of the meeting where Hitler's leading men decided the fate of six million jews.  Probably, the most disturbing thing about the film is that everything seems so commonplace, like an ordinary business meeting.  These men, apart from their politics, seem like ordinary men that you meet and work with everyday and yet their plans resulted in the death of six million people.

Dr. Stuckart is an interesting character.  He objects to the plan because it goes against the established laws which he devised.  He favors sterilization as opposed to death because he believes, perhaps rightly, that the world would not condemn such milder measures.

Dr. Kritzinger is perhaps the one person at the meeting who had courage enough to object on humanitarian grounds.  At the Nuremberg trials he was the only one who openly showed regret and remorse over the mass killings.  But when the SS General Heydrich threatens him he grudgingly gives approval at the meeting.

The movie serves as a sharp warning to us.  If we do not fight to preserve the principles that our society was founded on such as the inherent value of each individual, the rights outlined in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, and loving your neighbor as yourself then these principles probably will not be preserved.  It would be to easy for some megalomaniac to come along and lead people down the wrong path.

My only wish is that the writers and director might have aimed for a PG or PG-13 rating and thus make the film more accessible to a wider audience.",1211155200,,1845,4.739811912225705

1684012,5,B00005YUO1,"'Conspiracy' is a rare thing, a TV movie that only gets better every time you watch it.

Not that you want to watch it very often, as it's essentially a dramatisation of how the Third Reich came to make its decisions about how the extermination of European Jewry should be planned and carried out.  The Nazis called a conference in a villa in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee; after it was over, all those who attended were sent copies of the minutes, and they were supposed to destroy these copies fairly swiftly.  However, one attendee failed to do so.  This last remaining copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference is one of the (many) major pieces of evidence that the Nazis planned the destruction of the European Jews at the highest level, and that it was not merely something that just sort of happened.

'Conspiracy' is a beautifully conceived and intelligently executed movie.  The genius of it is that it's basically a movie about a committee meeting.  We see the preparation of the buffet (the food looks truly yummy); we see everyone arriving and making small talk; we get a tantalising glimpse of the office politics; we get little glimpses of who has high status and who has low.  The SS men (Barnaby Kay and Peter Sullivan) are tired, battle-hardened and cynical.  The guy in charge of planning the economic future of the Reich (Ewan Stewart) is a naive and hopeful drone, constantly introducing himself to people and being snubbed in return.  The lawyer who drew up the Nuremberg laws regarding the legal status of German Jews (Colin Firth), laws that this conference is about to consign to the dustbin of history, is simmering with barely-suppressed anger and resentment.  Not because he's angry about the way Jews are being treated, but because he can see that all his hard work is about to be brushed aside.  The only person in the room who appears to have anything resembling sympathy for the Jews is the representative of the Reich Chancellery (David Threlfall), and he's too pussy to do anything about it.

The acting honours go to all, as this is a real ensemble piece.  But it's worth mentioning Stanley Tucci, who presents Adolf Eichmann as a classic kiss-up-kick-down middle management guy, nodding and smiling at his leader's taste in music and then dismissing it with contempt once the boss has left the room; and especially Kenneth Branagh as the top man at the conference, Reinhard Heydrich, who was at the time the head of the SS Security Service and one of the most feared men in Europe.  The light-hearted way in which Branagh warns Firth not to try to stop the SS from doing whatever the hell it wants (because, he casually remarks as he lights a cigarette, 'there is no shortage of meathooks' in the Third Reich) is truly chilling.  Branagh never scowls, never grimaces, never gets angry, never bullies anyone, never loses his glamorous cool.  He smiles and smiles and smiles, but the implicit threat is always there.  It's a great performance.

The script is incredibly economical, and expands on the historical evidence in a way that I (who have read quite a bit on the subject) find to be a respectable balance between the historically plausible and the dramatically effective.  The direction is subtle and intelligent.  Nobody here is presented as a spooky evil villain - the film is about the many ways in which they convince themselves that they're doing the right thing.  And the acting, like I said, is top-notch.  I would recommend this film to be shown in schools.  It shows what happens when people think that their cause is so righteous that it justifies any kind of behaviour.",1210636800,2,3624,4.7616

I went to the Wannsee Conference House outside Berlin in Spring, 2008, and the head librarian told me that the scenes outside the villa were shot on site, and that the filmakers measured the inside of the house so that the movie sets would be as close to the real villa as possible.

1684016,4,B00005YUO1,"This film tells about the secret meeting in Wannsee near Berlin that occurred in 1942. It is based on a surviving record. The beginning shows the rituals that preceded this meeting. The minutes of this meeting are to be kept secret. The problem is how to eliminate the Jews from Germany. They can't be exported to other countries. There must be a solution to this storage problem. The first step is to evacuate the Jews from Germany controlled Europe to ghettoes in the East. They will work, many will expire of ""natural causes"". Heydrich runs the meetings to finish on schedule, he rolls over any questions. By deferring them until later. They will operate strictly according to their Nuremberg laws. The SS will determine the treatment for those of mixed blood. A lawyer objects to the proposals as they violate the laws.

One proposal is to sterilize all the Jews. One person asks about the need for workers. Heydrich says death is the sure method of sterilization. The lawyer points out the legal problem of inheritance. Sterilization is justified as ""racial hygiene""! Heydrich makes veiled threats to any objector. Some worry about the loss of labor in industry. They plan a new law to automatically divorce marriages. This may cause dissension at home. Shooting many people causes morale problems for soldiers. Their solution is use a poison gas for mass slaughter; its cost-efficient and hidden from the public. They discuss mass murder as if talking about vacation schedules. They pick Auschwitz because it is isolated. Deaths are plotted like some production schedule on an assembly line.

And so the top-level decision is given to the attendees, they all agree to obey. The trains will start rolling with people to the evacuation centers. Few records will be kept of this meeting for total secrecy. [What were they afraid of?] The ending of this film says many of the attendees were ""released for lack of evidence"". Only one copy of the minutes was ever found. If there was no written documents the secret would be concealed. [But the plot could be inferred by a deduction of the activities that followed this meeting.]

Michael Crichton's ""State of Fear"" has an Appendix on the dangers of pseudo science like ""eugenics"". This philosophy was derived from the ideas of Darwin, who was never a scientist in a laboratory like Pasteur or Koch. It was just a form of politics that sought to oppress certain kinds of people. Corporations like the Carnegie Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation backed sterilization as part of their attack on ordinary people. This same philosophy was used by the Nazi party. Crichton doesn't tell how these ideas came from Darwinists. Darwin and Lysenko both depended on the ideas of Lamarck where ""acquired characteristics"" are passed on to descendants. Darwin is infamous for ideas on ""evolution"" that can't be duplicated in a laboratory or observed by a scientist.

But on a cold day in January of 1942, ninety minutes was all it took to perpetrate one of the greatest crimes against humanity at the Wannsee Conference. Here, a handful of men from the different military and political factions in Nazi Germany made the final plans for the ""final solution to the Jewish question.""

""Conspiracy"" is a dramatic reenactment of the Wannsee Conference, based on the only surviving copy of the minutes taken at that fateful meeting. The cast and crew do an excellent job of recreating the conference. While there is no blood or violence, this is indeed a horror film, because all of the men talk about the extermination of the Jews with glee in their eyes, and smiles on their faces, as if it is no big deal.

Ken Branagh is sinister as Reinhard Heydrich, a member of the SS and head of the  conference. What makes him truly evil is how he smiles as they discuss how to handle the ""storage problem"" in Europe. Equally as good is Stanley Tucci as Adolf Eichmann, the mastermind behind the final solution. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.

""Conspiracy"" is a powerful film about how a handful of men planned the Holocaust in less than two hours. This is a film that every man and woman should see, so that they could see how evil men nearly wiped out the entire Jewish population in Europe.

Tough to hear?  In the corporate world that now ravishes our planet, the evil broods in secrecy around oak tables with those surrounded by power and wealth.  I hate to say these things, but it is the truth of our society.  That is why I felt a sense of overwhelming horror as I watched ""Conspiracy"" unfold before my eyes.  There were no explosions, no CGI, no eloquent speech made by some overpowering madman - it was a business meeting.  A meeting like no other that raised hairs on my neck and demonstrated the power of language.  HBO has done it again with this amazingly short film (running at around an hour and a half) about the birth of evil and the construction of genocide.  Like no other horror or suspense film, ""Conspiracy"" draws from the unknown, but is purely historical.

""Conspiracy"" is a talking film, so to make sure audiences do not fall asleep through the eloquent words, it is helmed by two masters of the cinematic trade - Kenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci.  Together, these two plus a cast that had to be hand selected as the ""best of the best"", give us one of the scariest moments in our world's history - the planning of the death of millions of Jews.  In a boardroom, not unlike ones we have seen in nearly every film, director Frank Pierson gives us faces, language, events, and decisions made leading to the most hideous moment of our history.  As mentioned, helmed by two masters, we are taken back to a world filled with hared and laws, and through the course of the two hours new laws are created and a new ""evacuation"" process is decided.  Our players, all facets of the German government, enter through lavish doors, eat elaborate meals, drink fascinating wine, and smoke elusive cigars as they argue laws, rules, Hitler's wish, but never humanity.  Enemies are made, men are instantly transformed from typical followers of the government into monumental evil-doers of history - all through the course of a meal.  Rather an average day for a very non-typical gathering.

The story is simple.  The words are the true leaders, while those speaking them gives performances of a lifetime.  This is not a light film in anyway.  The gorgeous scenery (or what little we see of it) sets the mood of the day, while the meal - to me - gives us the sense of cannibals, or animals, after a major defeat.  What appealed to me the most of this film was the genius - and I hate to use this word - behind Heydrich and Eichmann, from the beginning of the film they knew who they were working with, what they day would entail, and how to make sure that each of their constituents would agree on the final solution.  It was a forum of power, an expression of the truth, and a simple two hours that would result in decades of horror.  I enjoyed this film, not because of the true historic overall result, but how it was put together, the players, and the raw energy that emoted from this simple hour and a half.  I apologize for over-emphasizing the time frame, but it was shocking to me to see the history pages written in just this short amount of time.  As stated before, Branagh was nothing short of amazing, the eloquence of his words (again - words were important in this film), the sharp intellect, and strong ability to sell anyone into anything coupled well with the quiet, pencil-pushing man that Tucci portrayed as Eichmann.  These two carried this film, but not without the help of Ian McNeice, Colin Firth, Owen Teale, or Kevin McNally to name just a few.  This was an ensemble feature, and everyone pulled their weight to create this devastatingly shocking film.  This film, the style of the camera that Pierson used, reminded me of a retelling of ""Twelve Angry Men"".  That too was a wordy film, creating the tension with nouns and verbs, instead of the over-hyped CGI.

My only complaint, isn't with the film at all, but the lack of special features.  HBO typically doesn't go too overboard with their special features, and this is a prime example.  I would have loved to have an audio commentary or two to discuss the true historical elements or to hear how Pierson was able to control his actors and bring out so much from them in such a small area.  I think it would have benefited viewers further to get a ""history"" lesson, instead of the typical interviews with actors saying how ""honoring"" it was to play such a character.  I could have used without that.  Nothing else included, but maybe it would have overshadowed the power of this film ... hmmmm?

Overall, I cannot say this enough, but this was a spectacular film.  Whether you watch it for the historical element or for the sheer brilliance of the actors, you will not be disappointed.  This was a dark two hours for the world, which engulfed a race for a very long time.  This was the boardroom of evil, equipped with a full supply of wine, cigars, and a plan for ""evacuation"".

It just terrifies me that it all began with just a simple ""storage"" problem - how could we do it?

Obviously, decisions were already made and some actions were already underway (gasing of Jews) while talks were still going on at the meeting table.
A very shrewd move by Hitler to justify his immoral intention by coercing parties from all sides to approve it.
Hitler and his henchmen certainly knew how to highjack democracy to their advantages.
Personally, I feel the movie was very fast paced despite zero actions.
Exchange of words was fast so watching it a few more times is necessary.

1684031,5,B00005YUO1,"Just in case the preceeding reviews don't settle the question, I'll add my unqualified rave to the list.

The subject matter of this film is important for many reasons and is equally full of dramatic potential - this movie makes the most of both.  The screenplay is constructed like a Beethoven symphony - logical, constantly moving forward, boiling with energy.  The script, presumably, is based on the original transcript of the conference.  The acting - well - how can one praise it enough?  The human drama - the constant interplay of personal politics, intellectual fencing, bestial attitudes and genuine emotional reactions to the subject matter being discussed - it's captivating from first to last.  And the last scenes are superbly poignant - the final intimate focus on both Heydrich and Eichmann as shallow men and profound monsters, the use of Schubert (as both reference and musical score) to underline the moral desolation and irony at hand, the final roll call to enumerate the sober injustice of the participants' ultimate fate.

This is yet another HBO movie which raises the bar for American cinema, proving that one can still make a great statment on film without either large budgets or avant garde methods.  I can watch this over and over and always get something new out of the experience - which, of course, is the very best recommendation for actually purchasing a movie on DVD.

Credit must be given to Kenneth Branagh who propels the entire piece with one of the best portrayals on screen in memory. He is utterly convincing in the role of a man who epitomises the classic definition of evil: not just the doing of wrong, but the perversion of the human spirit so that it no longer has any perception of the good.

1684034,5,B00005YUO1,"""Dead men don't hump, Dead women don't get pregnant.  Death is the most effective form of sterilization.""

This movie shows the cumulation of Hermann Goering's infamous ""War Quote.""  Goering asked Gustave Gilbert in the Nuremburg War Trials this: ""Why would some slob on a farm want to risk his life in war when all he will hope to get out of it is to come home in one piece if he survives.""  Goering reiterates the point to Gilbert that it is the LEADERS of a nation who guide the people into a war, whether in a democracy or a facaist state.

Conspiracy is a movie that portrays the leaders of the Nazi State planning and putting into operation the Holocaust (Shoah) that Hitler, Himmler and Goering so carefully planned and demanded.  It is the factual portrayal of the infamous ""Wansee Conference"" where death and murder are shrouded in such words as ""Relocation and Elimination.""  What was so incredible is that the conference was like a Family Reunion for the Nazi brass, including cigars, exquisite food and brotherly comeraderie.

In my opinion, Stanley Tucci should have played Heydrich, because he looks more like Heydrich than does Kenneth Branach.  Yet the performance of Branach is perfect.  Some may have felt that Branach may have ""humanized"" the monster Heydrich by portraying him as so suave and debonaire.  Yet those who have studied the Nazi's tell of a Heydrich as leader of occupied Czechoslovakia as a man with a carrot on a stick in one hand and a knife in the other hand.  This quality of Heydrich is perfectly reinacted by Branach.  Cool, pragmatic, yet with a heart of stone and the eyes of a snake.  And ALWAYS interested primarily on his position and how to enrich it and finding ways and means of skimming more power for himself.

Tucci plays an excellent Eichmann, plotting with a bureaurocrat's precision on how to manipulate Eichmanns plan by rerouting railroad timetables to produce the desired result: ""relocating"" the European jewish population to the planned ""old age camps"" in Poland to eliminate the ""Jewish sphere of influence.""

It didn't matter that factual and ghastly details of those ""camps"" were openly and candidly discussed among cigatette smoke and the spectacle of that fat ""Kloffner""-the mouthpiece of Martin Boorman-stuffing his mouth with food all the time and disgustingly always exusing himself to the ""little boy's room.""

In this age of ""Preemptive, preventative wars"" plotted by American leadership, it gives one reason to ponder Goering's quote, and the crisp businesslike approach of killing .  And it leaves one to wonder how many of Today's ghastly headlines are birthed and nurtured in such rich comfortable surroundings, with the food, wine and cigars shown in this film!

1684040,2,B00005YUO1,"I have no issues with the substance of the film; its interpretation of the intentionally vague surviving record of the Wannsee Conference is as plausible as any other. However, especially when compared to the earlier German production ""Die Wannseekonferenz"" (available in this country only on VHS), it is seriously defective as a historical reenactment. It starts with the silly overflight scene at the beginning and the waiter dropping the dishes at the beginning and then gets worse. Many of the characters are ridiculously overacting  and become almost caricatures, especially the vulgar, pork-faced Klopfer, but also Kritzinger, who would be great playing an English aristocrat, but fails utterly at the portrayal of a faceless German bureaucrat. To add drama, the meeting seems to be interrupted constantly by food breaks, and Eichmann puts more effort into his role as catering manager than anything else. The breaks, none of which seem documented during what was a very short meeting, also give the director plenty of opportunity to add more fictional tension, bathroom discussions, and interaction between characters. There is little indication that there was as much interpersonal conflict as depicted here. The German version has some of the same weaknesses, but much milder; in ""Conspiracy"", they become much too distracting.",1148342400,17,1336,5.454106280193237
1684041,5,B00005YUO1,"This movie is a depiction of the now famous Wannsee conference at which high ranking Nazi and German government leaders met to coordinate and implement the genocide of the Jewish people within the borders of the lands they controlled.  We know about the conference from an eight page summary of the meeting that was in the papers of one of those officials, Martin Luther, from what other attendees said about it before they died, and also from what we know was actually done to implement this ""Final Solution"".  None of the gassings, shootings, executions of all types, forced labor, or medical experimentation happened by chance, well maybe some did, but the majority of the effort were the carryout of the direction began at this meeting in 1942 in a wealthy suburb of Berlin in a villa by a lake.

What a chilling film!  It is so bureaucratic that they could be talking about munitions for the war, or supplying soldiers with boots and blankets.  Yet, they are talking about their noxious racial theories and the problems they are having removing the Jews from civil society, housing them, and even killing them in volume.

The interpersonal dynamics and especially the techniques of dominance and manipulation used by the leader of the meeting, Reinhard Heydrich, is a stunning depiction of a monster pushing and prodding others into implementing his nightmare by ""choice"".  Everyone has to sign off, but he masterfully anticipates and suppresses any public objection.  This should be used in b-schools everywhere to stimulate discussions in interpersonal dynamics and groupthink.  Of course, the horrible subject matter would probably prevent it being used, because it would be almost impossible to separate the discussion of the interpersonal dynamics from the chilling goal of the meeting.

1684057,3,B00005YUO1,"CONSPIRACY is a 2001 HBO movie that chronicles the1942 Wannsee Conference, a meeting of Nazi, Gestapo, SS, and German military officials to discuss and solve Germany's ""Jewish problem.""  Kenneth Branagh stars as Gen. Reinhard Heydrich, the moderator and driving force of the conference.  Stanley Tucci co-stars as Heydrich's right-hand man, Adolf Eichmann.  It's a movie that allows the horror of its contents - the planned elimination of up to 11 million European Jews - substitute for the dramatic interplay of personalities.  Almost all events take place at the conference table and the great bulk of the dialogue is spoken by Heydrich.  In fact, it could almost be described as a 90-minute monologue by Heydrich punctuated now and then by a call for clarification or a quibble that hasn't the nerve to rise to dissent.

  As Heydrich lays it out for us, with America's entry into the war in 1941 the `Jewish problem' has changed.  Resources are becoming scarcer for Germany and emigration of undesirables is no long an option.  Clinically and bloodlessly the conversation moves from talk of forced sterilization to removal to ghettos to mass extermination.  The great strength of CONSPIRACY is its mundane portrayal of institutionalized subhuman inhumanity.  Its great weakness is its lack of dramatic friction.  Issues such as, for instance, relocation, are recited rather than debated.  Nobody at the table thinks it a wrong policy, or questions its essential immorality.  Rather they wonder how to relocate most efficiently and at lowest cost.

There is a lot of loose talk, of course, about the banality of evil and ""evilduuers"" as a stage villain on whom we can project our unavowable desires. The trouble is that there isn't, anymore, any loose talk about Fascism as a lens for examining our own society's mechanisms, in particular the way Fascism manages stupidity, cowardice and fear.

To use the word ""Fascist"" in reference to America today is to fall out of the grid.

A book by William Pfaff on the mismanagement of Iraq since 9-11 is called ""Fear, Anger and Failure"" yet to name it thus seems somehow, today, to scream in a vacuum like a spaceman. This is because while we cannot know Fascism from the outside (it being a thing of darkness which we like Prospero must acknowledge ours) we sure as hell can when honest identify with the surface order (the terrorized waiters: the snappy meals: the preparations perfectly laid on, in Barbara Tuchman's phrasing, in the German style, only to miss the crucial points, such as compassion), as contrasted with the underlying chaos.

Thus the bodies coming home from Iraq are known by insiders to be completely irrevelant and the chaos named in an Atlantic article two months ago by William Langieweische (the circling to land and the failure of the flight attendant, in otherwise following procedures at Baghdad International, to bid the passengers have a nice time, in Baghdad) is known by insiders to be permanently off the Power Point agenda.

Even on the system's own terms, the underlying mess is real although only named and narrated by the subaltern, the *Gauileiter* charged with preventing cholera, who is no longer,on pain of career stasis, permitted to make empirical generalizations. But the participants realize that for all their heel-clicking Enlightenment they are in chaos (represented by Klopfer's bulk).

I do not wish to overdraw parallels yet somehow the parallels cannot be overdrawn at this point, as when Euclid tried to master the geometry of Hell.",1106438400,4,2206,4.980978260869565

One can tell why from Branagh's performance. His Heydrich is chillingly ruthless, on one hand, yet charmingly idealistic on the other. He captures the Butcher of Prague's chameleon-like personality perfectly -- threatening when muscle is needed, yet able to inspire a distressed lawyer-turned-SS extermination squad leader with poetic homages to ""a better time, with German culture triumphant"".

Overall, this made-for-cable film, more than any other Holocaust-related feature manages to capture the meaning of Hanna Arendt's term ""banality of evil"". With few exceptions, none of the mid-level Nazi administrators and SS officers gathered at Wannsee seem sinister by themselves, yet as a group, under the maestro-like direction of Heydrich, they set aside their petty bureaucratic turf wars, and ultimately provide ""unanimity"" to a wholesale extermination of an entire race of people.",1104278400,3,1087,5.587878787878788

1684064,5,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is a brilliant reenactment of the fateful meeting that implemented the logistics of NAZI genocide. The film shows how easily an idea as horrific as one of mass murder can be politely discussed by a committee having a nice lunch on a quiet day.

 The peaceful surroundings of the chateau where members of the NAZI apparatus met parallels the ease with which most of the individuals contemplate the mass homicide. Most members seemed disturbed not at all with the concept, but simply the logistics of its implementation: firing squads vs. gas? If gas, what kind? Carbon monoxide or cyanide; Xyclon-B perhaps? How large should the facilities be? How many undesirables can they ""evacuate"" per day? How to dispose of the bodies? Should they be used for work?

 Kenneth Branagh plays SS Chief of Security Reinhard Heydrich convincingly; showing his cool resolve and functional outlook in carrying out the will of a madman. Colin Firth shows more the hippocricy of party members who esoterically intellectualized the advacement of racial hatred with moral gusto but soon found their morality at odds with the all too obvious political ramifications of what they preached. Stanley Tucci also renders an exquisite performance of Adolf Eichmann, Heydrich's devoted disciple and ultimate successor in implementing The Final Solution.

 The movie is as concise and to the point as Reinhard Heydrich's sinister oversight of the committee's progress. Staying on track and keeping the listner focused on the morbid task at hand, the audience is mesmerized by the bureaucratic dryness of the proceedings until its chilling end. There's obviously some poetic license as to the dialogue of the characters outside of the meeting minutes, but it's believable in every way.

 A great film that everyone must see so as to be warned about human nature. This film doesn't only show the horrors of NAZI Germany, it also shows how easily the human mind can rationalize and trivialize the large scale implementation of amoral if not criminal policies; it's interesting to note that most of those attending that fateful meeting were attorneys or had a legal professional background. Finally, as the film reveals the logistics of bureacratic function in general, it is perhaps an ominous portent as to how our corporate establishments (or any other human institution)can both rationalize and trivialize human life when evaluating loss and profitability: a common symptom when such entities are deciding to market or dispose of goods they know are dangerous or even deadly: it's just on a smaller scale and less discriminate.",1091404800,4,2608,5.20763723150358

I believe that the film was either filmed on location or at a place that was very much similar to the Wannsee House.  I had the opportunity to travel there this past summer with a group of teachers.  I was struck by how much the movie prepared me to think about the house and it's importance in the creation and implementation of the ""Final Solution"".  If you are thinking of showing it to students, you may need to explain to them how the conference was conducted and give them some background -- it has lots of dialogue and plenty of ""under currents"" that can be hard to follow if you are not familiar with the ""power plays"" that were going on at that table....lots of ego at that table.  It is important to remember that many of these individuals were sent by the ""major players"" in the Nazi regime to attend the conference.  By not attending the conference himself, Hitler and his administrative members could claim ""plausable deniability"" (so they thought) if anything were to go wrong with the plan.  It is hard to believe that this beautiful house that is located on beautifully-decorated ground and of of a spectacular lake could have played such a major role in WWII.

I will start with a sad and perplexing comment.  Many Jews I have asked, and most non-Jews, do not know what the Wannsee Conference IS.  This is an abomination and an indictment of--of what?  Our secondary education?  Jewish education?  Religious education?  I do not know the answer, but I do put this event in the class of many distinct ones that led to the death and maiming of millions upon millions of men, women, and children worldwide.
In the space of about 90 minutes (the length of each film), Reinhard Heydrich, head of the SD and SS (which when I ask many Americans, I find are acronyms that draw blank stares).  One transcript survived, ironically, that of attendee Martin Luther, found in a file (according to official records) evidently having nothing to do with The Final Solution To the Jewish Question (Endlsung der Judenfrage).  This, despite Heydrich's admonition that all copies are to be destroyed, and the contents discussed only with superiors
This should be an relatively tolerable introduction to the horrors of the period amongst the aspiring cognoscenti (even those who would not watch a gritty portrayal of war such as ""Glory"".  This will stimulate discussion and further reading and viewing of equally important works (all available right here on Amazon.com).  It was produced in the year 2000; anyone who does not know its content (whether one considers actual numbers, portrayals, and proposed Final Solution techniques used intellectually debatable) cannot purport to be knowledgeable of the issues underlying the War on Terrorism.  It should lead the view to a better understanding of what Fascism is, why it flourishes and why it should be feared.  Hopefully, it can also lead to a deeper understanding of the foundations of the American Republic, so hotly debated, which are supposed to protect us from such ignoble forms of government.",1073088000,3,2185,5.089635854341736

I have read the Wannsee Conference minutes and there certainly was a tremendous amount of creative liberties taken with the script, but just the same, it was well done and I am drawn to it like a moth to a flame.  I suspect the power of the performances is the greatest draw but I also think the topic adds a sureal and unexpected weight to the performances as only genocide could.

1684069,4,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is based on the original minutes of the Wannsee Conference held on January 20, 1942 in Berlin where the Nazi worked out ""The Final Solution.""  The of this HBO production is something of a misdirection, because this hour long meeting that would result in the death of 6 million European Jews might have been secret, but it was not exactly clandestine.  This is not a meeting where the participants made their plans in hushed whispers, but something that eerily smacks of a board meeting at a large company.  These men were going to become mass murderers on a scale rarely seen in human history, but they seem more like bureaucrats than anything else, which is just another level of the horror involved here.
""Conspiracy"" goes beyond the recreation of this infamous meeting for the 1984 documentary ""The Wannsee Conference,"" both of which are based upon the lone surviving record of the gather of 15 Nazi officers head by General Reinhard Heydrich (Kenneth Branagh).  Included in the group are Lt. Colonel Adolf Eichmann (Stanley Tucci) and Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, Interior Ministry (Colin Firth), and within an hour they come up with their solution to the ""Jewish question.""  However, this is a sense in ""Conspiracy"" that they are not so much debating what it to be done but being asked to sign on to the plan that Heydrich is revealing directly and indirectly throughout the meeting in his quest for ""unanimity.""
This time around the horror is in the details, as these men try to come up with the most efficient way of killing and disposing of that many people while one guy does the math.  Given that we know what is going to happen what stands out are not those who cannot wait to start the killing as much as those who have ""reservations.""  Stuckart, who wrote the Nuremberg codes, is aghast at what these new policies will mean for the rule of law in Nazi Germany, as the courts are filled with divorce cases separating Jewish and Aryan spouses.  However, Struckart makes it clear he hates Jews as much as the next person at that table.  Then there is Dr. Wilhelm Kritzinger (David Threlfall), Permanent Secretary of the Reich Chancellery, who obviously has misgivings on moral grounds, but ultimately can offer no more obstacle than a story, which serves as the final statement on the proceedings when related by Heydrich to Eichmann after the meeting.
The end of the film, where we are informed as to what happened to the participants, is particularly interesting.  I was surprised how few of these 15 Nazis were actually executed for war crime.  Several of them would die during the war while others would be imprisoned, but a surprising number were released for lack of evidence.  I was also interested to find out exactly who failed to destroy their copy of the minutes, although there is nothing particularly insightful about the revalation beyond satisfying my curiosity.  In terms of Holocaust films ""Conspiracy"" a footnote to the mass exterminations, but of interest for what it provide in terms of rare insights into what the Nazi bureaucracy was actually thinking as it launched the ""Final Solution.""",1069977600,6,3126,4.864406779661017
1684070,5,B00005YUO1,"CONSPIRACY serves as a reminder of the banality of human evil, even at its most horrific.
On January 20, 1942, with Nazi armies stalled in the snow at the gates of Moscow, a lakeside mansion in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee is the venue for a conference. Fifteen government bureaucrats and high ranking officers of the SS gather. History is advised to remember these otherwise appallingly ordinary representatives of the human species: SS General Reinhard Heydrich (Reich Security Main Office), SS Lt. Colonel Adolf Eichmann (Office of Jewish Affairs), SS Lt. General Heinrich M&uuml;ller (Gestapo), Gerhard Klopfer (Nazi Party Chancellery), Wilhelm Kritzinger (Reichs-Chancellery), SS Lt. General Otto Hofmann (Race and Settlement Main Office), Dr. Georg Liebbrandt and Dr. Alfred Meyer (Reichs-Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories), Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart (Reichs-Ministry of the Interior), Undersecretary Martin Luther (Foreign Ministery), SS Major Rudolf Lange (SS Taskforces in Latvia), Director Erich Neumann (Office of the Four Year Plan), Dr. Joseph B&uuml;hler and SS Colonel Karl Sch&ouml;ngarth (Government-General of Occupied Poland), and Dr. Roland Freisler (Reichs-Ministry of Justice).
Even after coerced emigration, 132,000 Jews remain in Germany. As the Wehrmacht gobbles up  territory, millions more - potentially 11 million - will come under Nazi control. As it's put in this film, there's a burgeoning ""storage problem"", and the chairman of the meeting, Heydrich (Kenneth Branagh), is calling for unanimous agreement on a ""final solution"".
As the viewer sees, it's not the concept of the eradication of the Jews from Germany and the occupied territories that fuels the debate, it's the modus operandi, and which individuals, particularly those of impure blood resulting from a confusing variety of mixed marriages, are to be targeted. At one point, even the semantics of the process - ""evacuation"" vs. ""execution"" - are at issue. And, of course, it all must be done legally as proscribed by the Nuremburg Laws. Finally, after the group dances around the issue of method, Heydrich and his deputy Eichmann (Stanley Tucci) get to the crux of the matter. The Jews are to be gassed in special camps established for that purpose. At the current stage of technology, the gold standard is apparently 60,000 exterminations a day.
The impact of CONSPIRACY derives from the chilling ordinariness of the conference and its tone. These fifteen might just as well be the top management of a large corporation discussing the eradication of rats from one of its manufacturing sites, or the construction of an assembly line to produce more and better widgets. As a note of interest, nine of those present were lawyers by training.
Branagh renders a positively brilliant performance as the ultimate devil's advocate, who steers the meeting to its foregone conclusion with a mixture of charm and quiet menace. When Kritzinger (David Threfall) objects that Hitler has declared to him personally that execution of the Jews is not his intent, Heydrich cooly reminds him, ""Yes, and he will continue to do so."" Plausible deniability, you see. And later in a private conversation when Heydrich demands Kritzinger's full support, the SS General remarks that the latter would be a difficult man to bring down - but it could be managed.
At the film's conclusion, the fate of all involved is provided in text overlay. Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans. Eichmann, B&uuml;hler and Sch&ouml;ngarth were tried and executed. All the rest either went free for lack of war crimes evidence, served time and were released, died of natural causes, were killed in the closing months of the war, or just disappeared. Indeed, Klopfer sold insurance after the war and presumably died in his bed.
The Final Solution took planning. As Eichmann angrily berates an Army chauffeur for engaging on whim in an undignified snowball fight with his fellow drivers awaiting their masters, ""Things just don't happen.""
The record of the Wannsee Conference which served as the basis for CONSPIRACY came from Luther's copy of the minutes discovered after the war. Ironically, Luther himself was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1944 for plotting against his boss in the Foreign Ministry.",1059868800,205,4281,5.3328402366863905
1684071,4,B00005YUO1,"""Conspiracy"" is a perfect example of what happens when you pair a first-class cast with a first-rate script. You discover (or re-discover) that you do not need explosions, MTV-style editing or gimmickery to tell a good tale. This movie has all the budget and movement of a play, and is entirely dialogue-driven. But it works. Oh boy, does it work.
It is generally credited by historians that the infamous ""Wansee Conference"" of January 1942 was the real beginning of the Holocaust, i.e. of the Nazi Reich's all-out effort to exterminate the Jews of Europe. Prior to that, the Reich had contented itself with kicking them out of public life, taxing them into beggary, subjecting them to every form of humiliation, and essentially negating their status as human beings. When the war started, however, this policy, known as the 'emigration solution' (i.e., solve the ""problem"" of Jews living in the Reich by forcing them to emigate) became obsolete. The inefficient and corrupt Nazi bureaucracy was ill-suited even to handle the relatively small population of German Jews; and Nazi conquests, however, quickly increased the number of Jews in German-occupied territories to around eleven million. In other words, the very success of the German military effort in Europe had actually increased the size of the 'Jewish problem' a hundred times over. And since forcible emigration of 11 million people outside the German sphere of influence was not possible, something else had to be done to tackle this 'problem.' But what?
""Conspiracy"" is about the bureacratic genesis of the Holocaust. It shows, in more or less real time, a fictionalized version of a real-life conference of 15 officials from the SS/SD, Gestapo, Railway Ministry, Interior Ministry, Government General, and Ministry of Justice, which was chaired by Reinhard Heydrich and organized by Adolf Eichmann. As a movie, however, it is really a study in the essential amorality of bureacracy and, to use a tired phrase, the banality of evil.
First off, the performances are superb. Kenneth Branagh gives probably the best turn of his career as Heydrich, a man who has absolutely no philosophy, ideology or morality other than a Terminator-like determination to carry out his orders, whatever they may entail, and to crush any obstacle in his path. You get the feeling he would be just as content to kill everyone with brown hair or webbed feet if that was his assignment, and if a few fellow Nazis happen to oppose him, then he would be just as happy to 'evacuate' them as any Jews. In fact, the description that Dr. Stuckart uses for the Jewish people in the film, ""arrogant, self-obsessed....(but) sublimely clever, and intelligent as well"" is actually a very good description of Heydrich. Branagh portrays him as a man with no human qualities himself, but excellent instincts about human nature. He knows when to condescend, when to bully, when to threaten, and when to appeal to self-interest, and he can shift from one to the other and back without a trace of discomfort.
Stanley Tucci, as Eichmann, is also very good. Like Heydrich shifts his personality around like a revolving door depending on what is required of him, but he is also a true-blue bureacrat in the worst sense of the word. To his superiors, especially Heydrich, he is utterly subservient; hovering about like a dog, laughing politely at jokes he doesn't find amusing, attempting with limited success to be 'one of the guys' when Nazi vulgarity rears its head. But to his subordinates he is a coldly arrogant bully, slapping one soldier in the face for throwing snowballs outside, telling another he will pay for a dish he broke by accident. In fact, he reminds me of a couple of schoolteachers I had growing up....and at least one boss.
Colin Firth is brilliant as Wilhelm Stuckart, the lawyer who drafted the Laws for the Protection of German Blood and Honor (better known as the Nuremburg Laws), and who is perfectly content to see all the Jews of Europe sterilized and shipped off
to be used as slave labor, possibly even exterminated wholsesale, so long as it is all done within a 'legal framework' (HIS legal framework). Eichmann characterizes the bureaucrat from hell, then Stuckart is certainly the lawyer from hell; a person who has no gods before the law, and simply cannot abide the idea of the whole crazy scheme being perpetrated without benefit of a legislative blessing. Eleven million murders? That's nothing. But without enacting a law first? Unthinkable!
Ian McNeice, as Stuckart's nemesis Dr. Klopfer, a corpulent Nazi Party bigwig with a disgustingly smug and vulgar way of handling himself. .... He's a raging anti-Semite who is all for killing the Jews, so long as the Party doesn't lose any administrative turf to the SS in the process. He has no respect whatever for the law despite being a lawyer himself (as is almost everyone in the room....go figure that one....); and unlike the brilliant but rather naive Stuckart, Klopfer has no illusions about rule of law in Nazi Germany. We have the power to do what we want, he says; we can always re-write the laws afterwards.
""Conspiracy"" was written by Loring Mandel, who deserves special praise for penning a movie that is nothing but conversation but which is still very gripping. I'm surprised some people would quibble with his dramatic interpretation of what happened; how could you make an entertaining about what the actual conference was probably like -- fifteen Nazi lawyers drinking wine, eating canapes, and reading figures about mass deportations and what does or does not constitute a Jew? Mandel's script gets to the heart of the mentality behind the Holocaust, which was that despite being at war with the British Empire, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, despite being outnumbered six to one in manpower and 20 - 1 in industrial capacity, despite fighting on multiple fronts and lacking most of the natural resources necessary for war, and despite the unspoken consequences to themselves and their country's reputation if they lost the war and their 'secret' was exposed, the mentality of WWII Germany was still open to the idea of diverting massive resources into slaughtering defenseless civilians by the million. If that isn't the bureacratic blindness from hell, what isn't?",1059264000,480,6310,5.01047619047619
1684081,4,B00005YUO1,"Yes, it is difficult to get the most accurate information available with regard to the Wannsee Conference. Primarily, because the Nazis destroyed some of the documentation for it.  However, as one who has read the available documentation about the Conference (thanks to collegiate professor of social history w/regards to the War Periods) the overall structure of the  dramatization holds up the minutes of the Conference. Though we can never really know what was discussed, it is likely that the content is rather accurate.
Besides the accuracy of this dramatization, the basis of this 90 minute film is dialogue...both spoken and unspoken.  The two major peformers, Stanley Tucci and Kenneth Branagh perform their respective parts with chilling accuracy. Tucci as Eichmann is a phenomonal thing to behold. Branagh's Heydrich is also chillingly accurate and a wonderful thing to watch unfold.  The secondary cast performs well, with emphasis on Colin Firth's part.
Once again, HBO does a fabulous job with Conspiracy. Wonderfully written, splendidly acted, and approaches a diffucult topic (not only to discuss but to research) with as much accuracy as possible.  Dark and haunting, Conspiracy is probably one of my favorite Dramatizations of Nazi policy and WW2.

Of course, these are not merely business men, and what they are discussing is mass genocide.  We hear these mens names in documentaries on the History Channel and in history books, but it is quite fascinating to put a face to them in this film.
The script is solid and the acting is terrific. While there isn't much in the way of physical action here, the dialogue is riveting and thought provoking.
Brannagh is perfectly calm, cool and collected and Tucci is wonderfully understated.  Colin Firth all but steals the show with his monologue in which he basically says ""treat them like animals and history will martyr them and view us as the evil one."" Interesting perspective indeed!

If you doubt such things are still possible, watch this movie and see how easily and nonchalantly these men sentenced to death so many people, and the utter contempt they had for them.

I have read elsewhere, and concur that this meeting could easily take place regarding another subject matter, in any board or conference room in the world.  I have personally known people with all of the personalities and agendas that are portrayed here.  Generally the attendee or moderator that comes the best prepared to present his or her case will prevail, in this case General Heydrich.  Of course it doesn't hurt that he has support from ""upper management"".  Once you can strip away the connection with the Holocaust, I am sure you will see the point I am making.
Excellent cast and direction; the ability to seal the fate of millions in just over an hour is chilling indeed.",1035676800,5,849,4.596026490066225
1684100,5,B00005YUO1,"This movie was thoroughly fascinating.  The characters were portrayed as real men, not as some sort of horrible hobgoblins  that history tends to pretend they were.  While much historical liberty is taken by the directors in recreating the controversial event, it is done within the confines of probability.
I was also surprised to see the way the directors handled Hitler's involvement (or lack thereof) in the Final Solution.  While Heydrich and Eichman assure everyone that Hitler ""will not ask about it"" they never say that Hitler knows.  Many historians will argue otherwise, but its good to see that the directors didn't try to rewrite history themselves.  Overall a superb movie that should be watched by any World War II/Nazi Germany Buff.",1031270400,2,747,5.132231404958677
1684101,2,B00005YUO1,"Let's begin with the positives:  the acting is superb, and the costumes and sets are surprisingly accurate (note the bronze swastika-emblazoned napkin holders being polished in the opening scene.)  Now the negatives:  as a film, it drags.  It is the story of a meeting of bureaucrats; how could it not?  As history, it is largely speculative.  The minutes of this infamous conference, from the ""one surviving copy"", are barely 8 1/2 typed pages, including the list of attendees.  Three of those who attended spoke on the conference after the war, when their recollections were somewhat hazy & their commentary geared towards pleasing their Allied captors.  My point is there is not enough documentation available to build a movie on the subject of Wannsee.  The director et al attempted to make both an entertainment and a documentary, and failed at both.",1028592000,19,855,5.05
1684102,5,B00005YUO1,"When people ask why did so many millions of Jews die in the Holocaust, the next question is how.  A question of this sort lends the questioner and his audience a sense of the quantitative.  Numbers, statistics, and data become matters of import.  CONSPIRACY attempts to illustrate the mechanism by which six million human beings were killed.
  By the end of 1941, the war was starting to go bad for Germany.  Hitler's invasion of Russia had bogged down and for the first time since 1939, there were doubters in his High Command that his thousand year Reich would last the decade.  Much of the problem of transport priority overlapped the concommitant problem of what to do with the Jews.  Reinhard Heydrich, second in command of the SS after Reichsfuhrer Himmler, called the Wannsee conference on January 20, 1942 to finalize the elimination of Europe's Jews.  One of the members of this conference, Martin Luther, kept a transcipt that survived the war (Ironically Luther himself was tossed into one of these camps where he died in 1944) and it is this transcript that provided the dialogue for this movie.  What is astonishing is the tone taken by all fifteen attendees.  In their sense of blase, this meeting could have been held to increase market penetration of their company product.  Heydrich made it clear that their product was an ideology that the Fuhrer Adolph Hitler had commanded to be transformed into reality.  All fifteen were in agreement that there was a Jewish 'problem,' but they disagreed as to what should be done to solve it.  Heydrich insisted that euphemisms like 'evacuation' should be used instead of 'killing.' At the beginning of the conference, the Nazi party's legal advisor, Dr. Stukart, insisted that whatever the solution might be, its implementation had to conform to pre-existing German law.  Others were concerned with the day to day operational details of classifying half-Jews and quarter-Jews.  Still others really thought Heydrich meant 'evacuation' in its literal sense, moving Jews from one ghetto to another.  By the meeting's end, Heydrich clarified his point by detailing the proposed construction of huge gas chambers and crematoria that could evacuate 60,000 Jews every day.  This impossibly big number got both the attention and approval of the others, and as the meeting broke up, each returned to his power base to implement and oversee the coming genocide.
  Kenneth Branagh as Reinhard Heydrich is the chilling image of a man who uses humor, intelligence, and intimidation to get his way.  Stanley Tucci as Eichmann is the very personification of the corporate flunky whose true evil nature comes out not so much in the conference where he plans death wholesale by the millions but in his personal malice toward a waiter who drops a tray and a driver who has unauthorized fun throwing snowballs.  Colin Firth as Dr. Stukart is seen as a man who opposes the slaughter not because of his love of Jews but because such killing breaks his laws that he himself helped to draft.  What emerges from CONSPIRACY is a portrait of very ordinary men in extraordinarilly evil times conducting a business that we now call genocide.  The 'how' then of the killing can now be seen as the flip side of the 'why.'",1028332800,16,3248,4.928308823529412
1684103,5,B00005YUO1,"I can only say that anyone who sees this and is not affected by it is not human-- it is a terrifying masterpeice.  This is the most horrific and nightmarish programme i think i have ever watched-- and should be mandatory viewing for everyone. You will be glued to the screen, not because of the special effects (none --excluding the fake snow and suspect mud sprays on the cars -- mud in winter? hmmm) but watch the scene where the waiter breaks a plate and tell me your did not tighten every muscle in total fear...If you want to see a film of perhaps the most catastrophic 90 minute meeting in history -- HERE IT IS.
Watch the manipulation and discussion on the 'legality' of murder, the business discussion and statistics where they 'prove' how many they can kill per hour....awful, so terribly awful.
I have since watched this film several times and it never ceases to make me feel uneasy and remind me that the world is full on monsters and we need to be watchful, that everything is not guaranteed -- and we OWE a debt to people who fought for us.
I can honestly say i think if i met Keneth Branagh -- i would now be afraid of him!!  Incidently -- the interview with him about the character was almost as disturbing -- you can see that Branagh finds this character a disgusting vile man with absolutely no morals at all..
THe final sequence where we find out what happened the people at the conference was equally nightmarish-- but perhaps on a brighter note, that is why we are different...
my recommendation -- get this",1024876800,7,1527,4.469534050179211
1684104,5,B00005YUO1,"Not much to add to the other comments except to say that Kenneth Branagh turns in a masterful performance as Nazi head honcho Heydrich.
The film also avoids the usual pitfalls, i.e. stereotyping all the Germans as bloodthirsty monsters (see Saving Private Ryan). A film, in other words, that doesn't treat the audience like total idiots.",1024272000,,337,5.035714285714286
1684105,5,B00005YUO1,"This is exactly what television should be like: intelligent, thought-provoking, brilliantly written and acted. The Wannsee Conference, held on January, 20, 1942, was convened by Reinhard Heydrich, Himmler's second in command of the SS (Kenneth Branagh), chillingly assisted by his deputy Eichmann (Stanley Tucci), near Berlin: it gathered 15 top Nazi bureaucrats to coordinate the Final Solution in which the Nazis would attempt to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe. The attendants  kept minutes, so that this teleplay is based largely on historical fact. The genius of the actors, director Frank Pierson and writer Loring Mandel is to make us understand how ordinary top bureaucrats could be pushed into accepting the ultimate horror - and to make this into an entertaining, and sometimes even very funny movie. The writing is so crisp you want to remember every line.",1024012800,65,886,5.374100719424461
1684106,5,B00005YUO1,"This was the consummate business meeting. They simply had a job to get done seems to have been their attitude.
The truly chilling thing about this is that many of us have sat in this sort of meeting, but, well, we weren't Nazis and didn't want to exterminate people... except perhaps for the accounting folks holding up our expense checks but we really didn't mean it, we just wanted American Express to stop calling.
Kenneth Branagh again shows his brilliance as a Shakespearean actor, and I find the movie very Shakespearean in its pacing, characters, and drama.
I'm rather disappointed that it has an R rating. It's the sort of film that should be shown to children to educate them about how this sort of thing actually happens.
I'm also reminded that most evil (which this obviously was) occurs with a buffet lunch.",1019865600,9,819,4.734265734265734
1684107,5,B00005YUO1,"Although this movie is not your action powerhouse full of car chases and digital FX, it is full of powerhouse acting. This movie is a little uncomfortable to watch. It chronicles the Nazi's plan to annihilate the European Jewish population. Pure evil at work. To watch as they plan there final solution is bone chilling. There lack of humanity is unreal.
If you have any interest in history this is a very interesting movie.
Stanly Tucci is excellent as is the rest of the cast. The acting is superb.",1019606400,,500,4.629213483146067
1684108,5,B00005YUO1,"That's how I would rate this film overall, and for any serious student of World War II or the Holocaust in particular, I believe this dramatization comes as close as possible to the events at Wansee in 1942 given the fact that nearly all documentation of this meeting was destroyed before the end of the war.  I happen to believe that although it's a film worthy of praise, the prospect of this being a film you'd watch over and over again, and by extension worthy of a purchase, is a little more debatable. I recommend the film only to those who are bona fide war film buffs looking to add to their collections. Otherwise, I think that once you've seen ""Conspiracy"" it will forever stick in your mind if not for the quality of the performances, definitely for the sheer horror and tragedy it attempts to recreate.",1018396800,4,814,4.537414965986395

Branagh brings to the screen an unbelievable performance.  The absolute coldness of his character towards the Jewish people...it is able to transport the viewer back in time to see the harsh reality of what took place during this meeting and the mindset of the Nazi Party.
HBO delivers a powerful a film that takes the viewer into the thought process of those who brought horror of the Final Solution.
