2769617,5,B000NJI3JI,"This, to me, this ranks up there as one of the best vintage motocross videos available, right with On Any Sunday. Extraordinarily good footage, editing, with great production - you are watching a very professional product, not a remasterd version of some guys 8mm badly shot 30+ years ago. Highly entertaining interviews of the greats from the most popular era of motocross - Jim Pomery, Marty Smith, etc. sharing stories and anecdotes.",1229299200,4,436,5.069444444444445
2769618,5,B000NJI3JI,"There is some extremely rare film footage in this show!  You can see Marty Smith, Jim Weinert, Billy Grossi, Kent Howerton and all of the guys from the 1970's at tracks like Hangtown, Saddleback Park and lots more.  The interviews are really good...these riders really tell it like it is...was, I suppose, in some very candid interviews.  Highly recommend.  I got mine at the website [...].",1178668800,3,390,4.863636363636363

8178334,5,B000NJI3JI,"It was a real thrill to see my old heroes race one more time and hear their stories. After watching this DVD a few times and then watching current motocross, it seems to be that something is missing in todays sport. Maybe because the bikes today are that good and back in the 70s, it was expected to have break downs and most teams ran on a shoestring budget. Even Marty Smith who many said was the best in that era had break downs riding for Honda.

I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed watching this video.",1395532800,,508,4.183673469387755
8178335,5,B000NJI3JI,"grab a beer or soda with friends and see who can name the most riders,and enjoy the film,oh ya ya",1392249600,,97,3.9
8178336,5,B000NJI3JI,"Great,great footage of Pomeroy and other Legends, Love the story Maty Smith relates bout entering a DirtRally car race with a rental car, Brilliant!!!",1364860800,,150,5.291666666666667
8178337,5,B000NJI3JI,"If you're someone that raced, rode, or even was a spectator during the grand heyday of motocross in the 70's, then you will love this DVD.  It was filmed when Jim Pomeroy was still alive  killed in a car crash in 2006  and if you only got to hear from the 1st American ever to win a Grand Prix and his stories of his first year on the GP circuit it would be worth owning. But you get to hear stroies from Bill Grossi, Kent Howerton, Marty Smith and many others that will jolt you back to that place in time...as well as show you an appreciation for modern Vintage Motocross. I have several other vintage MX films, but I like this one the best.",1318377600,2,643,4.128
8178338,5,B000NJI3JI,"I just loved this DVD. It's a complete flashback for me, seeing some of the motocross motorcycles of the 70's was a real treat! The only thing that was missing was the smell of 2 stroke oil. It was a wonderful time back then and seeing some of the riders from that period was a gas. If you raced motoX, then buy this dvd.",1309305600,2,321,4.03125
8178339,5,B000NJI3JI,"Probably the last interview with Jim Pomery, great video of many of the other greats of ""our"" time. Excellent video, one to watch over and over! Highly recommended.",1302134400,,164,4.892857142857143
8178340,2,B000NJI3JI,"Although I loved the interview segments with the motocross heros, especially Pomeroy, the footage of racing was lacking something.  The camera work was unimaginative.  Just a bunch of shots taken from the sidelines.  It wasn't telling a story.  Nothing to indicate where the footage was taken.  No slow motion ""art"" shots.  Just boring documentary type filming.  I expected this film to come close to ""On Any Sunday"", but was completely let down.  I will probably give this DVD to my older brother, because he is such a Palmeroy fan.",1293235200,,533,4.910112359550562
