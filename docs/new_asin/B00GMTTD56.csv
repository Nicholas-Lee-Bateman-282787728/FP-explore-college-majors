6087298,3,B00GMTTD56,"This is supposed to be a double feature package. There is only ONE dvd and it is not a double sided dvd. The ONE dvd says on it ""The legend of bagger vance"", not mentioning Tin Cup. Tin Cup is NOT on the Bagger Vance dvd. If you are buying this to get both movies, you will be as disapointed as I am.",1472774400,,300,3.7777777777777777

6087301,5,B00GMTTD56,Legend of Bagger Vance is Excellent. Tin Cup is a waste of time. Don't even bother watching it.,1453593600,,95,4.333333333333333

6087312,4,B00GMTTD56,"Both movies are good entertainment written around golf - while being very different in theme. Tin Cup is a fun romantic comedy with some good character development that moves the story along and uses some of the usual comedic bits - just adapted to golf. ""Bagger"" is a good mythical story moved forward by Redford, good cinematography and a good cast that deals with some serious themes without rubbing the viewers nose in them.",1433980800,,428,4.797297297297297

6087315,5,B00GMTTD56,"Don't let any of the negative reviews keep you from watching this lovely story. - I don't understand or agree with the criticism.  Let me stress I don't like golf - the chauvinism and arrogance I've experienced with the sport are ridiculous.  I also don't care much for Robert Redford - was very disappointed with The Horse Whisperer (I kept waiting for the story to begin....) and I don't care for his acting, either.  Also not much of a fan of Matt Damon and had never watched Charlise Theron.  So, all in all, I'm not sure why I watched the movie.  But I was enchanted and it is now one of the few movies I'll watch over and over again.  One of my favorite movies for when I'm tired and just want to lose myself in a beautiful story.  The characters are well-acted (I was particularly impressed with Theron and Smith) and the story is uplifting.  Give it chance!",1409788800,3,865,4.39622641509434

8624815,5,B00GMTTD56,Two terrific movies for a great price!!,1495497600,,39,4.714285714285714
8624816,4,B00GMTTD56,Its about the game. Double feature at that. Tin Cup is R rated to the point of losing the game for the story.  Bagger Vance as become and all out family favorite should be rated P-17 but anyone can fast forward through those scenes and miss nothing of the story!!,1494374400,,263,4.26
8624817,5,B00GMTTD56,Two classic golf movies - one great price!,1487203200,,42,4.375
8624818,5,B00GMTTD56,I love both of these movies.  They are classic movies to add to your collection.  You can't get better than Kevin Costner and Will Smith for an entertaining evening at the movies at home.,1484956800,,187,4.470588235294118
