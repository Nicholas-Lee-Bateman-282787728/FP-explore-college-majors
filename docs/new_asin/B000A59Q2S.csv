2359327,4,B000A59Q2S,"Sir Richard Fordyce returns to his home after staying in London with his newly married wife. Upon his arrival the people of his estate greet him rather strangely. As it turns out while Fordyce has been away people have sworn that they have seen him at his home, there have also been several young women who have been killed. Fordyce also sees ghostly figures on the grounds of his estate. Is Fordyce slowly going mad or is there something more sinister at play.

This one is a dark drama and doesn't offer any humor. It's still great though and John Turner's character here reminds me quite a bit of the one he played in Behemoth the Sea Monster (1959) (another Compton Films production). If you like the other Robert Hartford-Davis (Incense for the Damned (1970), The Fiend (1972)) adaptations, don't miss this one.",1261008000,2,816,4.706293706293707
2359328,4,B000A59Q2S,"I love this film. Reminds me of the classics, ""Nightmare Castle"" and ""Castle of Blood"". It has that same eerie feel to it. However, I really hate Redemptions intro to their dvds. It's so cheesy and pointless. That ""gothic"" chick with contact lenses is so awful!!! I always fwd through her. They picked such a stupid design/logo/mascot for their production company.",1217548800,,364,4.983606557377049
2359329,4,B000A59Q2S,"This is a Hammer style gothic made by another production company. However many Hammer actors are to found in this film (the blacksmith is the doctor who employs Peter cushing in Hound of the Baskervilles). Great plot that kept us guessing until the very end.

Loaded with Hammer style atmosphere.  Any fan of Hammer will want this in their collection.  I am suprised I did not hear about this before but this is its first release on DVD. We do not get a 16x9 transfer here. Too bad as this movie deserves the best.  Much too our suprise the print used is not too bad at all.  It looks like a pretty clean theatrical print.  Colors blur a bit and there is grain/minor print damage. The image did not stretch to the point of distraction at all on our 16x9 monitor.  Actually I really liked the look of the film. It does not distract. This is how it would have looked on VHS orTV before DVD. We collectors have gotton spoiled on Anchor Bay and Blue Underground DVD releases using orignal negatives and elements on Hammer/horror releases.  Hats off to them but Image has put out a solid product using a mid grade source.  What is most important is this is a classic gothic story that stands up their with some of Hammers better work.

Sound is quite good in Mono. Clear and powerfull.  Extras are some stills nothing of real note.

A welcome addition to our collection.  Hammer fans take note.

One star taken off for the lack of anamorphic enhancement and lesser prints used. Total 4 stars..",1128729600,15,1488,4.483271375464684
8074396,2,B000A59Q2S,"Dull, endlessly talky and almost ludicrously predictable gothic horror movie has Sir Richard Fordyke returning to his estate after three months away with a new bride--but multiple people claim that they saw him while he was far away in London and many of the tenants on his land believe he raped and murdered a young woman several days earlier even though he was nowhere near the estate.

John Turner's performance as Sir Richard Fordyke mostly consists of him scowling and shouting with frustration and/or contempt at his bride, his servants and anyone else that he encounters since everyone keeps claiming to have seen him where he wasn't.  I'm guessing that what's going on and who is behind it is meant to be a surprise since the movie takes so long to officially reveal it but the viewer would have to be an idiot not to figure everything out long before Sir Richard does.  The movie would have been better off acknowledging what was happening much earlier and allowing the person behind it to be an actual onscreen villain.

The Black Torment delivers no suspense whatsoever and lacks the atmosphere of a Mario Bava gothic horror movie like Black Sunday or Kill Baby Kill or the lush production values of a Hammer film.  It also moves at a snail's pace, is filled with painfully stupid characters and features a conspiracy that pretty much any fool should be able to stop.  If two people are seen riding through the village at the exact same time every night (the superstitious villagers think the female rider is a ghost) and the man who is riding is a murder suspect how is it possible that the local magistrate doesn't catch the man before Sir Richard and his wife even arrive from London?  And (spoiler alert) if Sir Richard's secret brother is an insane imbecile how can he even take an active part in such a carefully executed plot that would require him to appear at specific times and places, speak and act exactly like his brother and then completely disappear from sight until he is needed again?

The Black Torment is almost impossibly boring and predictable and unless you are a sucker for any horror movie that features castles and horse drawn carriages you should do yourself a favor and not waste your time watching this.",1502323200,,2242,4.716112531969309

8074401,4,B000A59Q2S,"BLACK TORMENT was a movie I read about in books on British horror films but it was one which I had never seen until I was recently able to rent it locally. I was so impressed that I went out and bought it. It's not a classic but it is very well done. BLACK TORMENT was made in 1964 by a small production called Compton headed up by Tony Tenser who would eventually start one of Hammer's main competitors Tigon Films (makers of WITCHFINDER GENERAL, BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW) later in the decade. Compton produced some interesting films in the mid-1960s including Roman Polanski's REPULSION, The Sherlock Holmes meets Jack the Ripper thriller A STUDY IN TERROR and George Harrison's WONDERWALL. BLACK TORMENT was obviously an attempt to cash in on the success of Hammer Films and the film turns out to be not such much a horror film as a Gothic one like those being produced in Italy with Barbara Steele (CASTLE OF BLOOD, NIGHTMARE CASTLE) although not as gruesome. In fact it was of the few true English Gothic movies that I've seen as it comes straight out of the tradition of Ann Radcliffe and Horace Walpole.

The plot is standard Gothic stuff. An 18th century nobleman returns to his family estate only to be told that he's been there before and committed murder. He begins to see the ghost of his first wife and starts to doubt his own sanity. Meanwhile more murders are occuring. If you're a fan of Gothic literature you'll have a pretty good idea of how this all turns out but I won't spoil it for you. The film is beautifully shot which comes as no surprise since the cameraman is Peter Newbrook who would later direct the atmospheric Victorian shocker THE ASPHYX. The real surprise is that the director is Robert Hartford-Davis who would go on to make CORRUPTION and BLOODSUCKERS (INCENSE FOR THE DAMNED) two very different films in terms of style and content. All were photographed by Newbrook so there is that connecting thread. Although there are no major genre stars, the costumes are appropriate, the settings atmospheric (inside and out), and the music is effective. A good, old-fashioned Gothic thriller that really entertains if you're into this sort of thing. This Redemption DVD of BLACK TORMENT looks very good but I'm sure there's a better print out there somewhere.",1384214400,7,2283,4.7075
8074402,3,B000A59Q2S,Not bad thriller about a lord of the manor who is being tormented by confusing allegations by the local populace and strange happenings on his estate.  Not exactly a horror film.  This Redemption release as far as I can see is excellent quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.,1379635200,,281,4.6938775510204085

8074404,3,B000A59Q2S,"Reading the product review on Amazon coupled w/ other reviewer comments, and being familiar w/ Redemption films in general, I figured this one was a no-brainer, and snatched it up immediately, only to be terribly disappointed. A British Gothic masterpiece? Hardly. Plenty of heaving bosoms and swashbuckling swordfights? Please. Impressive and chilling? Wrong again. It IS in the tradition of Hammer and early 60`s Italian horror, though it isn`t as good as most offerings of either. I found it to start out OK, but it was too easy to discern who or what was behind the nasty proceedings, and the film lacked any true chills for my tastes. And I`m a big time fan of Hammer and Italian horror. And the soundtrack sounded like it was from another film entirely, it wasn`t dark, compelling, underlining any of the film`s crucial scenes, and so added nothing to the atmosphere of the movie. Redemption Films needs scolding for this release (AND it`s a re-release of theirs, so they`re twice shamed) and director Robert Hartford-Davis was also responsible for 'Bloodsuckers', another even more dreadful abomination from the early 70`s. The only genuinely disturbing thing here is that the other reviewers praised it as highly as they did - go figure...",1266019200,12,1247,5.028985507246377
