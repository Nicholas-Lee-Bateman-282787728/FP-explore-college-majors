2397838,5,B000AYEL4C,This is a really good film it has many good lines as well as a surprising cast.  It is an oldy but a very enjoyable easy to follow film and one that I recommend highly.  I saw it some years ago and was able to obtain a copy finally.  Will be interested hearing other views.,1250208000,4,273,3.9272727272727272
2397839,5,B000AYEL4C,"This is one of Cannon's more fun and yet lesser known films.  What starts out as a sort of buddy comedy eventually turns into a blast of an action film that is also part war drama.

Peter Weller (RoboCop) and Robert Hays (Airplane!) play well off one another, and make for convincing action stars.

The dvd is bare bones and it would've been nice to have at last a commentary track, but the movie is still very enjoyable.  I highly recommend.",1240012800,5,442,4.419753086419753
2397840,4,B000AYEL4C,"This film is fun if your into, silly heroic macho type films, like me. Weller and hayes are good, nice to finally see hayes in something other than airplane. Sort of a light hearted action comedy. If you like watching  the A-Team you'll probably like this.",945388800,7,256,4.565217391304348

8080827,4,B000AYEL4C,"FIFTY-FIFTY is a very enjoyable, intelligent action flick with some depth, heart & humor.

Though it's essentially a genre war movie, it transcends the genre to some degree. Essentially a 'B' grade war flick with an 'A' movie budget, it has a good cast, including Peter Weller, Robert Hayes & Charles Martin Smith, who also directed. Cinematography is first-rate. Plus, a very nice score by Peter Bernstein that goes a long way to making 50/50 feel more like an 'A' movie. The standard war-movie pyrotechnics are also well-done & add to the realism.

It starts out as a typical buddy action comedy then slowly evolves into a more serious story about the dark side of mercenaries & the CIA. But it works & actually gets batter as the story builds to a satisfying conclusion.

However, if you want to see this sort of film done better, check out MEN OF WAR, a film by director John Sales (Robert Altman's assistant director, who also directed the tour-de-force film, MATEWAN). MEN OF WAR is also about mercenaries, but it's an 'A' movie with better production values, great script, & a better cast. Dolph Lundgren proves he's a serious actor & gives the performance of his career. Then of course there's the box-office blockbuster BLOOD DIAMOND, with Leonardo DeCaprio, which won many awards including two Academy Awards & three nominations.",1448928000,3,1339,4.889867841409692

8080830,4,B000AYEL4C,"I'm not a huge fan of the movie, but bought it as a gift for my brother who swears it is hilarious. Even so, I wouldn't say I hate the movie, even though it;s not my speed I am still willing to watch it.",1396310400,,203,3.6363636363636362
8080831,5,B000AYEL4C,"Have seen the movie before several times and have always enjoyed it. A good action/comedy. If you're looking for outstanding acting performances, skip it, but if you're looking for something enjoyable for the evening, this should fill the bill.",1364774400,,244,5.282051282051282
8080832,4,B000AYEL4C,"I enjoyed this film and the mercenary/combat theme.  There were some realistic battle scenes in it, but some were just too difficult to believe.  Overall Weller and Hayes are pretty much the Odd Couple if mercenaries and this made for quite a few good laughs.  Well worth the money spent and the time watched.  It made for a great evening after a long days' work!

This one actually came with the audio when I downloaded the digital product.",1364515200,,441,4.602564102564102
