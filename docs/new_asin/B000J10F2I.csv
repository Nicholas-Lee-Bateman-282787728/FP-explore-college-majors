2664686,1,B000J10F2I,"I went into this with high hopes, as I'm sure did many who grew up with the stop-motion original.  But what a bitter disappointment.  The tone was COMPLETELY wrong.  I was hoping for something that would recapture some of the joy and innocence that the Christmas season can hold, but this film most certainly did not.  The entire opening was very unpleasant in the extreme, with an adult, bitter, cynical tone.  (If anyone wanted to know why Santa became disillusioned with the Christmas season, well, he probably watched this film!)

Also, with the first few minutes of the film featuring a very brief (but vivid) clip of a video game in which a character is decapitated amid buckets of blood, and a fellow singing a song all about how ""Santa Sucks,"" I really don't think this film is appropriate for very young viewers---which SHOULD have been the target audience, for goodness sake.  As for the bikini-clad dancers in the Heat Miser musical number----well, this isn't the sort of charming fare that brings the feeling of Christmas to the heart.

Again, I'm very, very disappointed.  With the wonders that can be worked with modern visual effects, this could have been a totally magical story.  Something that kids and adults alike could enjoy---but the tone seemed totally misdirected.  I can't imagine ever wanting to watch this again.",1165795200,19,1339,4.906666666666666
2664687,3,B000J10F2I,"A remake of this Rankin/Bass classic was finally made using an idea that I suggested over 5 years ago in an Amazon review (see my review from 2000 under the original Rankin Bass title). In my original review I suggested John Goodman as Heat Miser but then thought Danny DeVito would be better.
It's obvious this one was on a very tight budget and probably a tight deadline to get completed. (Production started in July of 2006).

Beyond the cheese factor, the real problems with this project involve some of the casting. Ironically, in this new 2006 live action remake, John Goodman is Santa Claus ... He was cast adequately. He plays a Santa that even adults can believe in and Delta Burke is also cast well as his cherubic Mrs Claus.

Chris Kattan of SNL fame plays supporting role and through most of the movie, he seems to be suffering from a bad case of conjunctivitis (pink eye) that is annoyingly attemped to be hidden by camera angles, lighting, props and motion.  It turns out to be a very distracting part of the movie. He plays a good Mango (old SNL character) but this character just doesn't work for him.

Carol Kane plays a freakily scary Mother Nature but then again I can't imagine Carol Kane playing any normal role, so that one works with her.  Although Michael McKean and Harvey Fierstein  do ok as the Miser brothers, Jack Nicholson and Danny Devito would have ROCKED in those roles and turned this live action project into blockbuster that people would have gone to the movies to see. In this remake, the replacements for the little mini misers were ok, (I won't spoil it for ya, you'll have to just check it out), but I think using dwarf actors like the Oompah Loompahs in Willy Wonka would have worked better.  Besides dwarf actors need work too. I hope they have a union.

Some other cameos by fitness guru, Jack Lalanne and a few others don't seem to add much to this miscast mess.

..anyway this adaptation adds a few modern elements to the old classic without losing the real message of Christmas that the original conveyed. I'm sure Rankin/Bass would have it no other way. The sets and new costumes were a bit hokey but worked ok, and a few scenes are worth a chuckle or two. It's a remake the kids and some adults will enjoy but I hope it gets remade again in a few years with the proper casting.

This movie, could have .. and should have been much better.",1165708800,5,2386,4.489607390300231

2664714,3,B000J10F2I,"A good movie which is loosely based on the stop animation cartoon  Year Without A Santa Claus (1974). The cartoon is my favorite Christmas cartoon, so I can only base the review upon comparison between the two. The movie is more like good versus bad rather than Santa skipping Christmas as the cartoon does. This movie is not really good for children, especially those who still may believe in Santa Claus. It contains sarcasm against Santa Claus and commercialism towards Christmas. It is a cute movie more for adults rather than children. I would only recommend the movie for an stranger look at Christmas rather than a must-have for Christmas.",1421193600,,646,4.872727272727273

2664722,1,B000J10F2I,"Ok, recently I watched the original ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"".  Unfortunately, it was just too dated (it was made in 1974), and it wasn't like what my memory thought it was. Well, that's OK, even tho it was good fun then, not all things age well. If you do watch it, just skip to the Heat Miser/Snow Miser song part (still great) and just remember it fondly.

So yes, despite it's original greatness, maybe it was time for a re-make. Hey, John Goodman looks to be great casting, right? Sure, I saw the bad reviews but thought it was likely just ""bad to the point of being campy good fun"" bad.  Like maybe ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" or The Star Wars Christmas Special. Not so.

Now, you guys know I don't like to write bad reviews. Well, this is one of the rare exceptions.

 It was ""bad to the point of being soul-destroying, mind-numbing, stomach-churning"" BAD. It was so horrible that for a while my mind could not even order my fingers to hit ""fast forward"". Every copy of this travesty should be destroyed, every one involved in it should have their stars jimmied out of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and their SAG cards burned in Effigy (which is a small town right outside Salem). The Producers should be have a sprig of holly hammered through their hearts- which should be a nice trick, since I doubt if you could find them, being smaller than the smallest Grinch heart.

John Goodman plays this as if he had a shotgun aimed at him, forcing him to read his lines- whilst meanwhile going through a very bad day of coffee withdrawal.

Even the ""Heat Miser"" song is almost ruined. I admit the scantily clad dancers did distract me for a minute.

I found one thing interesting- a ""ad"" for  Goth doll, and oddly there's a doll almost exactly like that flying off the shelves even as I type this.

Please, for the sake of Jolly Old St Nick and your sanity- do not watch this. I did -so you don't have to.",1324425600,4,1915,4.38135593220339
2664723,1,B000J10F2I,"I'm 48 years old and I admit I still watch the Rankin/Bass Christmas shows EVERY year. So when I saw this last night in a discount bin at the store (that should have been my first clue)I thought, ""Oooh the same story but with real people!""

I grabbed my blanket and hot cocoa and settled in for what I hoped to be entertainment.

What I got was a permanent gaping jaw for the course of the movie because I kept thinking ""You have GOT to be kidding me!""

This is one of the DUMBEST shows ever made. I can't believe John Goodman even gave his time to it. And for him being the ""real"" Santa -- his beard looked more fake than the homeless man who was collecting money as Santa. I think Mall Santas have better looking beards! The homages to other Christmas shows are LAME at best. And Heat Miser and Snow Miser had potential... but fell short. (At least they kept the song, but the dance was less than interesting).

The dialogue was awful. Jokes fell flat. There was a GOTH elf trying to launch a Goth doll line... PUHLEEZE!

2664724,4,B000J10F2I,I have read some very critical reviews of this movie from people expecting academy award viewing from a made for T.V. production.  This is an enjoyable film for the family to watch during the holiday season. John Goodman makes a creditable Santa Claus and the rest of the cast does a good job in their roles. Delta Burke even makes a good Mrs. Claus.,1297209600,2,350,4.46875
2664725,1,B000J10F2I,"Save your time, money, and electricity and avoid this one at all cost.

Well, the two films have the same title, and that's about it.  If I could have given this film -5 stars I would.

I turned it off after sitting through ten minutes of horrible acting, poor writing, and a poorly promoted film that does not earn it's claim to be ""a live-action version of your childhood favorite"".

It's a shame that this is what is considered ""family entertainment"" in the 21st century. What ever happened to good humor, quality writing and acting?

When I heard they were doing a live action version, I'll admit I didn't expect greatness.  I thought it might be laughably bad, maybe a cute homage to the original, but that was it.  Instead what I got was a movie so completely awful that I couldn't finish watching it.  The flaws in the first half hour were too numerous to count, but the one thing that I consider to be the absolute worst was the way Iggy's father is represented.  In the original movie he's a nice man, a good father, and he still believes in Santa Claus.  In this version he's neglectful and more or less a jerk.  It was around that part when I decided that I had better things to do.

2664730,1,B000J10F2I,"The original version of The Year Without a Santa Claus may not have been one of the very best Christmas classics.  It must not have been terribly popular: it took quite a while to come out on DVD, and was packaged with a couple of other obscure holiday titles when it was eventually released. Even so, it deserved better than this ""remake.""

John Goodman as Santa was about the only good casting choice.  Some (Delta Burke) others are okay.  Others (Chris Kattan -- ""Mango"" as an elf?) are just awful.

Jack LaLanne plays a retired Hercules.  He and some other non-Christmas-related mythical figures appear in the movie. Maybe it was an homage to The Santa Clause, which featured the mythological characters such as the Tooth Fairy.

Carol Kane (the abusive Ghost of Christmas Present from Scrooged -- ""the b**** hit me with a toaster"") plays Mother Nature, and does basically the same character. She abuses Heat Miser, Snow Miser, and Chris Kattan's elf character in the same way she abused Bill Murray's character in Scrooged. Come to think of it, maybe that was an odd homage.

Examples of ""updates"" to the plot and lines, from my notes hastily scribbled during the show:

* The plucky mayor of Southtown is faced with a couple of slick salesmen trying to sell a big retail center (WalMart or large mall) in the town, but refuses them because ""this town has a history"" (the shysters' reply: ""ghost towns have histories, too""). The town must hold a Christmas festival to raise money for their ""endowment,"" so that they don't have to let the retail center into town. (""Hollywood has no agenda,"" part 1)

* In the remake, Iggy is the neglected child of the too-busy Mayor. In the original, Iggy had a non-dysfunctional family and the mayor was unrelated. In the original, the snow in Southtown is for the sake of convincing the Mayor of the elves' sincerity; in the remake the snow is intended to shut down the town so that the Mayor will have to spend time with his son. (""Hollywood has no agenda,"" part 2)

* Jingle: ""What are we doing here?"" Jangle: ""It's a school; it's where kids hang out. Don't you watch South Park?""

* Heat Miser (attacking Snow Miser): ""How's that for Shock and Awe?""  (That line certainly hasn't aged well.)

* In the original, Heat Miser and Snow Miser's ""minions"" were smaller versions of themselves. In the remake, they're scantily clad dancers.

* In the remake, Jingle and Jangle end up in an arcade playing, among other things, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. The elves can break the laws of physics: they jump high a la The Matrix, and get astoundingly good scores on video games. In the original, they were lost and stranded, but in the remake their super-powers make it harder to believe that their predicament is dire.

* Heat Miser vs. Snow Miser in a boxing match.

* Instead of Mrs. Claus going to Snow Miser for help, Santa Claus confronts the Miser Brothers over shooting down his elves. Instead of going to Mother Nature as a last resort, Santa summons her into the boxing ring to deal with her problem children.

* When Santa goes to pick up Vixen from the dog pound... Santa: ""I remember you from when you were young."" Dogcatcher: ""I'm still waiting for that BB gun, Santa."" Santa: ""You'll shoot your eye out."" (An homage to A Christmas Story?)

General thoughts about the remake:

* The original plot is essentially gone.  In the original, Santa proves he is real by making it snow in Southtown. The Mayor declares Christmas a holiday for Santa -- sanctioning him to skip Christmas deliveries for a year, as he wished to do.  All the kids around the world send letters and presents to Santa, reversing the usual pattern. Santa is moved to not skip Christmas by this outpouring of Christmas spirit. In the remake, Santa is moved by the mention of how the kids in the homeless shelter will miss him. (""Hollywood has no agenda,"" part 3).  Christmas spirit as a motivation is replaced by guilt.

* The second-best original song (""I Believe in Santa Claus"") is missing from the remake. The best original song (""Heat Miser / Snow Miser"") is butchered. The best ""borrowed"" song (Elvis Presley's ""Blue Christmas"") is missing as well.

* In the remake, Chris Kattan's elf character tries to take over Christmas delivery, in the absence of Santa (""Sparky was my slave name; I'm Extreme Santa now""). He's the head elf -- ""the CEO"" of the toy-making company. But he is picketed by several elves who demand the real Santa make the deliveries, and then threatens to fire all elves who don't cooperate with him. (""Hollywood has no agenda,"" part 4). Apparently the remake is not ""The Year Without A Santa Claus"" so much as ""The Year With A Substitute Evil Elf Santa Claus."" I wonder why they didn't go with that more honest title.

Maybe I'm approaching it with the wrong attitude, and this was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek romp with homages to several different Christmas specials.  But why sully the memory of the original by taking its title, and then not even having an actual year without a Santa Claus as part of the plot?

My recommendation: if you're looking for a DVD, buy the original version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Year-Without-a-Santa-Claus-Nestor-The-Long-Eared-Christmas-Donkey-Rudolph-s-Shiny-New-Year/dp/B00004VVPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Year Without a Santa Claus / Nestor, The Long-Eared Christmas Donkey / Rudolph's Shiny New Year</a>&nbsp;instead, it's a fraction of the cost (as of the time of this writing) and about a thousand times better.

2664731,5,B000J10F2I,A great addition to my Holiday Collection. Goodman is outstanding as Santa and the story line does follow the cartoon enough to remind you of the original. The supporting cast made it interesting and entertaining! Recommend for the entire family!,1168905600,,246,5.175
2664732,4,B000J10F2I,"Originally a claymation holiday film made almost forty years ago, THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS gets remade into a live action movie.  THe plot is simple and the solution is relatively simple as well, but the fun of this film is getting through the story.  Sure, you know everything will work out in the end, but that takes some of the worry out of the entertainment process.  You can sit back and enjoy the lighthearted festivities just in time for the holidays.

John Goodman delivers a solid and entertaining version of Santa.  Delta Burke plays Mrs. Claus with dignity and grace, and an understated love for her husband.  Chris Kattan stars as an obnoxious elf.  Ethan Suplee and Eddie Griffin star as Jingle and Jangle, two of Santa's favorite elves.

The plot stays much the same in the remake as it was in the original version.  Santa is tired of the commercialization of Christmas and thinks of going off to retire.  (In the original he got sick.)  Where Mrs. Claus saved Christmas in the first movie, Jingle and Jangle are largely responsible for the events that pull Santa back to the Christmas spirit.  The movie has a lot of funny bits, especially with Jingle and Jangle as they try to prove they're elves to Iggy, the mayor's son.  He wants to believe in Christmas and bring it to the people in his town, but he's struggling with his own doubts.  Vixen, Santa's reindeer, is also on hand to bring a few laughs.

Although the movie can keep the adult attention, it's too simple to do justice to that audience.  But that isn't the audience THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS is going for.  The movie is for the kids, and it succeeds well.

THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS is a good addition to the family DVD collection.  It will become a holiday favorite that the kids will want to see again.  And again.",1167955200,2,1812,4.516923076923077

Really, really bad. When puppets from the early 70s have more charisma than the actors do, something is really wrong with your movie. This could have been good but it never quite figures out if it wants to be an homage, a parody, or a ""hip"" update.

2664734,1,B000J10F2I,"Make no mistake we are in ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" territory here.  This is about as bad as Christmas movies get. I don't know where to start.  Th bad CGI effects, the sets that look like they were built for a middle school play or John Goodman playing ""Jolly Old St. Nick"" like a grumpy coke addict going through detox.  Just say no!!",1167868800,6,346,4.375
2664735,3,B000J10F2I,"There's no way that any movie could possibly be as awful as people make this sound. I can't believe all the moaning and hating and overreacting. The original can be neither outdone nor ruined, so they didn't even try. This is just fun. Just a new version. A tribute if you will. No one may harm, change, or spoil the brilliance of the original, or its memories; that's nonsense. It's untouched.
Now I'm someone who ADORES the original with a passion. It's my favorite special. I own every single Rankin/Bass holiday special, and not just the Christmas ones. I watch the entire marathon every year. I am a serious fan. But am I offended by this? No! It's harmless.

That said, I knew not to expect too much; The Year Without a Santa Claus was always begging to be done in live action, but this was much too quick and small-scale of a production to begin living up to the full potential it had. There were very funny parts, and things I didn't understand the reason for. Why exclude the wonderful songs? I watched the Snow Vs. Heatmiser clip dozens of times and wow, it got my hopes up for an outstanding film. Of course the rest didn't have that musical feel. And why did they combine likable Mr. Thistlewhite with the Mayor, completely changing Ignatius and producing the far-too-familiar plotline: ""busy parent doesn't spend enough time with family, ends up with disillusioned kid for holidays""? There were things I thought should've been kept from the cartoon that weren't.

And yes,  Santa really is portrayed a bit TOO mean, cranky, disgruntled and un-merry from the start. You can see where this was adapted from, but then there are times it totally shoots off in its own direction. Few, it appears, appreciate all the departure from the classic. I personally didn't either. But there's nothing truly wrong with this if you treat most of it as a light-hearted good time (unless you have a bad time with it, in which case we can't help you, just watch the masterpiece of an original because everyone loves that.)

And just as in the original, the Miser Brothers are the indisputable best part of the whole shenanigan. Should they have been given their own classic holiday special? Absolutely. Who doesn't adore them? They just have that something that makes them probably two of the best characters ever. So, so classic...you could go on and on about their greatness in the original. But about the new one: thank goodness they didn't have the nerve to think of omitting the Miser songs. The movie really would've helped itself to focus more on them, and for whatever reason it dragged everything else out and made far less use of the good ol' boys than I'd hoped to see. Their first scene is still by far the best in the film, so far ahead of everything else it's not funny. No wonder that was the preview.

As to their depictions; Harvey WAS sort of an odd choice for Heatmiser, though I can't say he didn't do a fine job or looked wrong. I'd confidently say that Michael was the best cast person in the movie; he just does a darn good human Snowmiser. Now, I know everybody was shocked at the absence of the Mini Misers, and furthermore the presence of-GASP!-girl dancers helping each of the Misers. While I understand that they might not have wanted the whole `Mini Me' thing going on in live action, I too missed the Minis. But you know what? They totally took my idea with those ladies! XD For years I've said that when the Brothers sing their excellent, mighty songs, they ought to have showgirls to dance with them. They created almost exactly what I imagined in this movie--fiery style girls and icy style ones. Amazing. I know the skimpiness of the outfits strikes many as inappropriate for a family flick, but honestly, it isn't really that risqu of a scene. Snowy and Heat only dance with the girls, nothing more. ^~ I loved all the costumes, and the dance moves, and loved the songs and characters to begin with, so overall I completely love that scene.

The rest of the cast? No real problems. The elves could've looked more elflike. Delta, Carol (great Mother Nature), and mostly everyone else did very well even if they differ a bit from their ""old selves."" So what's so bad about it to deserve all the bad-mouthing? Well, to remake such a classic is kind of daring. And it surely could have been a few hundred times better. [But they never attempted to change, spoil, ruin or outdo the cartoon, and I don't know why that's so hard to understand. These things can just as easily be ignored.] I can see where critics could claim that it lacks heart. A lot of it does. The original overflows with it, and hoping for something that good will lead to nothing but disappointment. And perhaps, it seems, outrage.",1165881600,4,4725,4.605700712589074
2664736,3,B000J10F2I,"Did people seriously go into this expecting it to be as good as the original cartoon? Haven't we learned any thing from Christmas' past, that brought us torturous movie versions of old cartoons, such as The Grinch? Ewwwww[...]

Fact is, I saw this on TV last night, and I figured the movie was going to be awful. I wasn't as dissapointed as I thought I would be (3 stars).. John Goodman did a good interpretation of Santa... sort of portraying him as an old biker type. A stern old man with a big heart, and the only guy around with the guts to ride on a blistery Christmas eve. I think there is a scene where Santa gets decked in the eye... (I went outside to smoke a butt, and when I came in he had a shiner.)... some of the characters get switched around... its Iggy who asks Santa for the snow in Southtown. Not the mayor, like in the cartoon.. and the mayor wasn't Iggys dad in the cartoon, like he is in the movie. Delta Burke plays Mrs. Claus, who is far less intregal to the plot than she was in the cartoon... but I gotta say that for a woman getting on in the years, Delta Burke is still sort of sexy.

Other roles were filled ok... except Heatmeiser. Harvey Firestein? C'mon man, I haven't seen him since he did his short stint on the Boku commercials like fifteen years ago... and he was a hack then. Who decided to cast him? He couldn't even sing the song right. Booooo! As far as everyone complaining about Chris Kattans added role, I thought he was pretty funny actually. A new side plot about him trying to become a new ""Extreme Santa"".

My biggest complaint is that, for a movie, that was based on a cartoon that was full of songs, this movie could've tried to incorporate some of them, and just went for a way more toungue in cheek approach. It was already in a silly mood, but it got a little too serious in spots and ruined everything. I think that when Iggys dad (the mayor too) started making his speech at the end, John Goodman should have barreled onto the stage and performed a blues-rock version of the ""Snow,Ho Ho Down in Dixie"" song, from the Rankin Bass cartoon. That would have changed my opinion of the whole thing for the better. But of course they didn't do that. The mayor just made some sap-tatstic speech, about how he was foolish to disregard his son. Oh well.

For a modern day, made for TV movie.. I can't complain too much. I don't own cable you see, and this was the best thing on TV last night, and I got a few laughs, but I would have rather had watched the original.",1165881600,2,2510,4.266806722689076
2664737,1,B000J10F2I,"If it was possible to give this a negative star rating I would do it. It is difficult not to compare this with the original animated special but even standing on its own it was just terrible. Mrs. Clause is supposed to be the driving force behind this story but is assigned to the roll of semi-frustrated camera takes. Santa is a hot tempered jerk. Both Miser brothers were just unlikable (though Michael McKean was better than Firestein) and ALL of the elves were annoying. Nothing funny here, nothing cute, nothing genuinely touching, poorly acted, poorly written, bad special effects, etc etc.

The attempt here was to modernize the story, including a new character, 'sparky', player by Katan with typical Katan creepiness, as the requisite villain who tries to supplant Santa while pretending to be a loyal employee. Obviously the producers felt that adventure; problem solving and lessons about the season were not enough and added a 'bad guy' to defeat.

The little 'miserlings' who accompany the Miser Brothers in the original have been replaced by dancing girls in metallic bikinis (ok, that part isn't so bad :)).

Overall this was a poorly conceived and executed piece that accomplishes less in two hour than the original did in 40 minutes. Stick with the original.",1165881600,5,1275,4.9485981308411215
2664738,1,B000J10F2I,"A charmless live-action remake that is a waste of time.  From the lackluster opening credits (really, they couldn't have done better than that?) to the unfunny attempts to be hip to a wasted cast (Delta honey, wake up, the cameras are rolling!), this TV-movie blows colder than the North Wind.

The worst thing this remake does is to fill the movie with all kinds of contemporary references and jokes.  This will date the movie forever and will not allow it to age well although considering the DVD is available the day after the network broadcast, the powers that be seem to be hoping this will become a quick buy. Don't bother.  And I find it ironic that Santa is horrified by all the new violent video games and toys out there when these are the types of gifts real kids will be wanting this year. A Christmas special really isn't isn't going to change anybody's mind.

One of the dumber moves is to have a scene where characters watch snippets of old movies/specials that feature Christmas such as ""Auntie Mame"" and the original ""Year Without a Santa Claus."" This comparison only shows how bad this new special looks.  Do yourself a favor and buy those movies instead and skip this one.",1165881600,15,1190,4.61611374407583
