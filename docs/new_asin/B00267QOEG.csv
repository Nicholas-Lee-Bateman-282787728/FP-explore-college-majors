3853113,3,B00267QOEG,"I am late to the Power Rangers RPM game and missed it when it aired originally on tv.  Because I do not have the ability to catch reruns I happened to decide to view the DVD.  There seems to be a nice fan following for this show online so I decided to jump onto it.

In order to enjoy the show one must embrace several things with Power Rangers.  Power Rangers started its first season with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the ninties.  During that time it prided itself on cheesy graphics using models of mechas and didn't do anything to hide the fact that these were fake models.  In todays age the same thing is apparent in RPM, so the animation of the scenes looks extremely aged.  Second, the actual CGI they try to incorporate looks goofy (vehicles that look really juvenile, less than the lower 8year old and less sect of viewers is probably whom the style appeals too).  Lastly, you can clearly tell that the fighting is as fake as ever.  The difference here is that they finally abandoned the use of sparks emanating from everything when it is hit and eliminated the use of enemies who shake and jiggle on the ground when they are defeated.  However, the fighting is fake and inimaginative and you have to accept this fact to move on.

Storywise, the show has this rediculous premise of being the only safe haven from this computer virus that caused the computers/robots to take over the world all except for the city of Corinth. It is hard to believe but that is the premise.  The villian himself is rediculous and over the top, however, the amazing Taneya7, who is introduced in this volume, is a great assest to the villain cast and has the most memorable parts.

The rangers themselves are spot on and people will have their favorites.  I will not say whom they are since that will spoil a twist in this volume.

DVD wise, the set is quite on the cheap side, meaning the features are lacking with nothing more than just a few Disney DVD/Blu-Ray previews.  The menu only spans one page, the set is only about the first five episodes and leave you begging for more at the end. There is nothing at all that hot about the DVD box itself either, just a simple black case.

Ultimately, I would say to buy this set if you can get over the same problems with the show.  With the sketchy past of the Power Rangers DVD releases, one probably needs to get these fast since there most likely will not be a collectors edition released.",1252627200,,2435,4.4337078651685395

3853115,5,B00267QOEG,"Not for several years have I seen a Power Rangers series worth dragging in non-fans for. This is hardcore post-apocalyptic sci-fi wrapped in spandex and made child-safe without pandering to that audience.

I won't waste time going into story details laid out in the synopsis except to say this is a real break in style from even pre-Kalish PR. This show does not deserve to be shown at 6:30 AM or left off the schedule like it is in some markets. So you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD. Support what may be the curtain call for Power Rangers.

The catches? No special features at all. Nothing. And as a previous reviewer mentioned, we got the ABC Kids version of the credits for Handshake. But hey, that's life.",1247356800,11,714,4.484615384615385

8352308,5,B00267QOEG,"This DVD was delivered on time- about the middle of the 'expected delivery' dates. It was a good value for the price, and even with shipping, it was MUCH cheaper than going to a store. The only thing of note was that since I bought this from a library, there were library stickers on the front, back, and spine of the DVD.",1324339200,,322,4.209677419354839
8352309,5,B00267QOEG,"The mind spins with thoughts on Power Rangers RPM. For one, its the final new series of the Power Rangers franchise for the foreseeable future; maybe that's for the best because they set the bar almost unreachably high in this one.
Whether it was for the fans, whether it was just a new style of making the show - the RPM year is the first since 'Dino Thunder' that I have felt eager to watch. Taking influences from everywhere - from sci-fi, like Terminator, the world created is one post-judgment day where only a shielded city survives.
It seems the showmakers are big 'Lost' fans - RPM is dressed up a lot like it in style [not counting the god awful theme tune] with character origin flashbacks planted throughout the opening run of episodes, throwaway lines throughout every ep building up the mythology subtly and in a way only older fans will notice. Each episode even ends on a teasing cliffhanger before the text title card 'Power Rangers RPM' flashes across the screen like it does in Lost.

Repeated viewing of the series throws up all the (potentially purposeful) references to previous versions of the show; the zords are very much the spirit of the 'Zeo' zords dressed up like the 'Turbo' ones. Fans of the 'In Space' year will find a similar storyline to Astronoma/Karone in Tenaya 7. Storylines involving the city of Corinth is not unlike the ones based in the 'Lost Galaxy.'

But everything is just done so much better than before - the acting, stunts and writing are top notch. Being 'self-aware' like the beginnings of 'Ninja Storm' runs throughout the series. The start of one episode sees the Rangers asking such questions as whether they really need to call out a Morphing call and what's the deal with the big explosions behind them everytime they morph?

In sum, RPM is a great finish to the show's epic run, and one fans should feel proud of.",1263427200,4,1868,4.654545454545454
