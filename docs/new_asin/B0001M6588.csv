Here's hoping it includes some nice extras (behind the scenes, interviews, even D&M interviews with Mike Douglas, Johnny Carson and Barbara Walters) ...extras  that show a new audience how hot this duo was during this series run.  I've already decided that the day I receive this box set, I'll call in sick and watch them all back to back!  Can't wait for this release...but I guess I'll have to!!!",1154390400,8,551,4.525252525252525
8014790,5,B0001M6588,"I am happy to report that Donny Osmond has announced that plans for a compilation of the Donny & Marie show has been scrapped and instead they will be releasing the shows in their original one hour form ...show by show..YES..This was one of the greatest Variety shows on TV during the 70's. It ran from 1976-1979 for 4 wonderful seasons. While Donny was every girls dream Marie was every guys. I being one of those guys. The show was wholesome but it was at an age when things were more innocent and with only 4 TV stations to choose from, major stars appeared on the show to promote their songs and movies. John Wayne, Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, Olivia Newton John, The Welcome back Kotter kids, and who can forget the great spoof of Star Wars. Yea,  people have knocked Donny & Marie.. but why? They gave us so much entertainment and still do today. There will never be another team like them. ABC was great to D&M. The only mistake they made was canceling the show while still at its prime in 1979 and creating The osmond Family show. I love the whole family but that show was a disaster. They should have stuck with D&M and Im sure their show would have run at least another 2 years. By 1979 the age of the Variety show was gone anyway. Poor Marie got her own series in 1980 but because people were tired of variety shows she was not given the chance and was axed after only a few months. Her show was good but it was not given a chance. I mean anything with Marie Osmond cant be bad.

Anyway when D&M comes out on DVD, in what appears now to be October, you folks have to buy it so we can get the whole series released and if anyone is listening maybe we can throw in special extras such as Maries show for every box release of Donny & Marie. How bout it?????",1153440000,25,1761,4.222551928783383
