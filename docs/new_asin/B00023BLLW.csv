8021149,4,B00023BLLW,"It is unfortunate (unless your kids speak Spanish) that this movie is subtitled because it gives an important message that should be learned by every young adolescent who surfs the Internet.  It is an exciting, even harrowing, story, but one that should make a strong impression.  If your children surf the Internet, you can try to see if they can handle subtitled movies.  Every young adolescent, especially girls, should be well aware of the dangers lurking on the Internet.  There are lots of great subtitled movies that many people miss because they think subtitles are distracting.  I can tell you that, after watching scores of subtitled movies, one can easily forget they are reading as they get involved in the story.",1198540800,,725,4.958677685950414
