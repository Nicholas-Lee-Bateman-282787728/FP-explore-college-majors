Hester-Sue arrives with her wagon. Mary has returned! There is a Christmas feast. The snow falls heavily, their guests cannot leave. Carolyn tells a story from her past. Her father died when she was young and her mother remarried. [Quite common in the 19th century when death parted married couples frequently.] Young Carolyn reconciles to the change. A young man tells his story. The older brother told his younger brother the truth about Santa Claus. But his father explained Santa's delivery system. [Outsourcing.] Outside the wind howled.

Laura tells about their first Christmas in Kansas. [Crossing a stream in winter can kill.] Mr. Edwards brought the girls presents for Christmas. Their own tin cups. Sweet potatoes too. ""It was the best Christmas ever."" Someone must stay up to watch the fire overnight. Hester-Sue remembers her past on a plantation. [Did they have toy trains in those days?] What presents will they get? ""Thanks, Santa."" They are snowed in the next morning. Snowshoes allow a trip to the barn. ""Merry Christmas!"" The presents are retrieved from the barn.

Could such a show be broadcast today? Why not? You will find the original books are better than a Hollywood recreation.",1348099200,,1259,5.043269230769231

7851467,5,6303625932,"Excellent ""Little House"" video with great music, sensitivity, love, and family. This video has everything. =) When the family gets snowed in on Christmas Eve, they pass the time by retelling stories of their most memorable Christmases in the past. Each flashback was touching and entertaining. My favorite stories were those of Almanzo and Hester Sue. Almanzo was just so adorable, I laughed, and Hester Sue had an extremely bittersweet story to tell. Yes, the flashbacks are short, but they're enough to give you a fairly good background on the individual character. Don't miss this ""Little House"" edition--it's a great video to watch, both at Christmas and throughout the year.",1009411200,12,679,5.181818181818182
7851468,5,6303625932,I have seen all the Little House On The Prairie Shows. You can't go wrong  with these. It shows how families & friends stick together through  thick and thin. Teaches good family values that have been lost over the  years. It shows how hard it was to make a living in the 1800's and how  family and friends pull together to help one another. You will cry and you  will laugh.,968198400,8,375,4.225352112676056
7851469,3,6303625932,"I love everything that is connected with Laura Ingalls Wilder, and was looking forward to this video.  However, it was just filled with reflections and short flashbacks.  I would prefer to see a movie that  actually developed one of these flashbacks rather than this.  I was also  hoping to give the Ingalls bug to my daughter.  This video doesn't allow  you to watch any particular character long enough for that.  I probably  would have bought this eventually but only after I purchased the other  available videos.",949795200,,517,4.906976744186046
