7319846,5,B0112HPXA6,Trust me. It is an awesome movie but you must have incredible patience to sit through it and tolerate the horrible acting and dialogue delivery. In the end you will be amazed. This movie has fabulous opening sequences and a great Tex-Mex background score that even has some Indian Tabla beats blended in as well. The California-Mexico landscape is beautiful as usual and the unpredictability of the characters and the story simply adds to the mystery of this movie. It does slowdown in the middle but there is a point to it. See it.,1445126400,12,532,4.670212765957447
7319847,1,B0112HPXA6,"The story sounded promising (drugs/guns/dirty cops) with a decent cast but this ended up being a really bad movie. The typography and graphics, which freeze the frame when a new character is revealed is distracting and leaves nothing to the viewer's imagine of who this character is -- coupled with exceptionally bad dialogue...and the dialogue is trying to hard, like in a Pulp Fiction kind of way.

I was able to get through 30 minutes of the movie before turning it off. Watch the trailer and move on.",1445040000,4,504,4.7272727272727275
7319848,2,B0112HPXA6,"After a drug exchange has gone bad and there are bodies laying all around as the Sheriff (Michael Par) and his deputy (Michael J Long) show up. We know he is the sheriff because the car and badge say ""sheriff"" and they throw a font by him that says ""sheriff"" as a way to impress us with a grindhouse style that didn't make it. Not to give too much away, but there is a lot of money and drugs there and one guy is still alive.

The sheriff manages to survive but goes throw the movie with a large covering where his ear used to be. Brian Barnes (Johnny Messner) is the outlaw who escaped with the money. Unfortunately the son of drug lord Perez (Danny Trejo) was shot and he wants justice. Dolph Lundgren plays a DEA agent with glasses looking more like Rick Perry than himself. Vivica A. Fox played ""The Skirt"" while Natassia Malthe had a less flattering role as ""The Braud."" [sic]

They managed to get some of the top name ""B"" listers but the script was so bad, they couldn't save it. Nice play on words in the title, although I am not sure how it connected to the film. The CSI show up, look at the scene and by a visual are able to recreate every shot, who shot them, who got hit by friendly fire and the order in which the bullets were shot. I don't know why they were waiting on ballistics.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, near nudity.",1445040000,,1329,4.203921568627451

8723317,3,B0112HPXA6,"This film is filled with bad, heavy-handed, and very distracting acting by virtually everyone, including the star Dolph Lundgren, with a surprise ending, and has no setting for viewers who are hearing impaired. It barely reaches three stars; at best, it might be given 2 1/2. It is about a man who wakes up with no memory. He has been shot and is holding a gun. There are many cars and dead bodies around him. A sheriff and deputy pull up, the sheriff finds three million dollars, decides to keep it, and when the deputy balks, he shoots him. The wounded man shoots the sheriff, but unbeknown to him, he just wounds him. He takes the money and drives away.
Now the wounded man needs to discover who he is, who are the dead men, why was he shot, why was three million dollars laying around. Soon he is pursued by a drug lord who is the father of the shot deputy, the sheriff whom he wounded, and the DEA.",1517270400,2,903,4.317647058823529

With so many heavy hitters, so many recognizable names...this had me asleep in my chair. The Sheriff and Mateo sitting not more than 8' from each other shooting with the 'lead' standing there like he was afraid...I woke up enough to laugh.
