8415553,1,B00440FOAS,Not funny at All. really Boring and too much stereotype of Romanians. They try to be funny but is a really lame movie.,1386115200,,118,4.173913043478261
8415554,5,B00440FOAS,"for anyone who has worked in the film business

to work outside the USA
for anyone interested in the behind the scenes
film making drama, this will give it to you",1334966400,2,206,4.048780487804878
8415555,2,B00440FOAS,"This movie is stupid and several of the main characters are completely obnoxious, particularly the director.  If you find stupid movies entertaining you may like this.  It also gives a false impression that Elizabeth Hurley is a significant part of the movie; she is on the screen for all of about 2 minutes once.",1316390400,,313,4.777777777777778
8415556,4,B00440FOAS,"""Made in Romania"" is another in a long line of films that self-consciously looks at Hollywood and the film making process. Some of the best of this genre include ""Bombshell"" (1933), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), ""The Stuntman"" (1980), ""A Star is Born"" (1937, 1954), and ""Swimming with Sharks"" (1994). A bit off beat, one should also see ""Ed Wood"" (1994), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), or ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (2000).

The current film is a semi-documentary in which Jennifer Tilly tries to make a film based on a Victorian novel. We see her putting the team together in California, entering pre-production in London, and then shooting in Romania where tax advantages will result in a windfall for producer Ronnie Krapner (that's right, KRAPner), played with sufficient sleeze by Joey Slotnick.

But all is not well, starting in London when the Director makes a shameful advance on Tilly and has to be replaced with an unknown whose only real qualification is that he is British and conforms to the tax break requirements. More problems surface in Romania - budget cuts, language problems, threats to close down the production, problems with the local law, too many pigeons in the studio, etc.

Jennifer Tilly (1958) can be sexy, funny, and serious, occasionally all 3 together. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Bullets Over Broadway"" (1994) but is perhaps best known for the cult favorite ""Chucky"" films (1998, 2004) or for the popular ""Liar Liar"" (1997). She gives an exceptional performance in this film, playing herself.

Jason Flemyng (1966) plays himself. Flemyng is best known from those marvelous Irish and British films ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000). More recently he's been in ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) and ""X Men: First Class"" (2011).

There are brief cameos from Danny Huston and Elizabeth Hurley.

This is the first time out as a writer and director for Guy Louthan who has more than 20 years' experience as a (mostly) TV producer . He worked with Tilly on ""Seed of Chucky"" (2004).

Although this film isn't going to win any Oscars, it is really good and one of the few films that ""tells it like it is"" about film production. There are more dramatic films (e.g., ""Swimming with Sharks"") but they have the look and feel of a Hollywood film while ""Made in Romania"" looks more like a real case study.",1310256000,5,2342,4.869346733668341
