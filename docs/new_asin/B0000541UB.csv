1392261,5,B0000541UB,if you want a action packed kung fu movie this is it great fight scenes you have the high kicker hero against the ground kicker villian amazing fight scenes the ending is classic if you don't buy this you need a leg kick in the head and are not a kung fu fan.,993340800,,259,3.9056603773584904
1392262,5,B0000541UB,"Two fueding masters of the kick techniques wage war on each other.  A master of ground kicking searches out for the man who killed his brother.  When the master of the high kicks is forced to kill a low kick expert in self defense, the dead man's brother feels he needs to take revenge himself.  After traveling throughout the countryside, and through many towns he finally catches up to the man he searches for.  Now it's time for the Ground kick and High kick masters to find out who's style is supreme.  Never seen anything like it.  The best kick styles, and alot of them.  Fight scenes with amazing replay value, and even some comedy among it all.  A must see.",984268800,3,665,4.43801652892562
7930474,5,B0000541UB,"Kung Fu action, adages, and laughter, and a fantastic beginning and super fantastic conclusion, and a great villian also; as well as a great herion.",1386115200,,148,4.96
7930475,3,B0000541UB,"Since there are many other noteworthy reviews here, all accurate in their own way, I just thought I'd add that the fight choreography was indeed superb (and I practice wushu myself).  They don't called this ""The Leg Fighters"" for nothing -- some incredible kick-oriented fights.  My version, the martial arts theater version, is full screen but isn't bad.  Picture is clear but not ultra-crisp.  I imagine there is an original language version of this, but with this version you only get the English dub.  For many, this will be a deal-breaker, since the dubbing is often laughable and very bad (some of the characters seem to speak a 'pigeon-English,' and one character - Ding Dong - seems to be dubbed by Yogi Bear -- no joke!).  If you look past the dubbing, the story is nothing extraordinary, so you'll want to watch this mainly for the fighting.  Not a 5 star movie (not if we're comparing it to ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The Chinese Connection), but not bad either.  You'll get a ... ahem, kick out of it.",1300924800,,1019,4.622222222222222
7930476,5,B0000541UB,"Excellent video.  I grew up watching ""Boot Masters,"" as they were affectionately known as back in the day.  Still great to watch after all these years.",1235001600,,151,4.769230769230769
7930477,2,B0000541UB,"Super kicking Korean sensation Dorian Tan Tao Ling (""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"") plays righteous Northern Kung Fu master Tan Hai Chi.  He is challenged by a man (Peng Kong) who refuses to admit defeat and tries to slice his way to victory.  In self-defense, Tan kills the man.  The man's cronies go back to tell the departed's brother (Peng Kong, again) that Tan killed his sibling.

Meanwhile, spoiled girl Phoenix (Ha Kwong Li, ""Killer B's"") ignores her kung fu master (Sun Jung Chi, the carnivorous monk from ""Shaolin Vs Lama""), preferring to pal around with fellow student (Chin Lung) and get into trouble.  When the master's wife becomes sick, the master asks Tan Hai Chi to teach her.  She refuses his instruction and (with the help of Chin Lung) tries repeatedly to get rid of him.  When nothing works, she runs away and immediately gets into trouble, which Tan Hai Chi bails her out of.  She decides to accept him and trains hard.  Peng Kong's goons eventually find her new master for the inevitable showdown.

Good production and decent story are marred by too many stupid and unnecessary characters coupled with fight choreography that is interesting and complex but, more often than not, far too slow.  That being said, it's not awful, and it has a bit of an indescribable charm to it.  I did enjoy watching it, but not enough to recommend.  Peng Kong's ground fighting is impressive, and his fight with Sun Jung Chi is a lot of fun.  Phoenix has some pretty flashy and flexible moves herself.

Tai Seng's Martial Arts Theater once again delivers a fullscreened DVD with an English dub and no subtitles.  I'm fine with the dub, but I like having the option of original language.  On the off-chance that I become a huge fan of the movie, I might want to see what I missed in the translation.  Standard issue, I guess.  2.5/5

7930478,5,B0000541UB,"Oh Man, my big brother and I love this movie to death! Back in the 1980's every Saturday afternoon they would always show Kung Fu flick's on channel 5 (NYC). The kung fu moves in this movie is great as well as the story line, along with the characters Tang Hang Shi, Phoenix, Chin Fa (who will keep you laughing), and that Gangsta Villian Bang Pa!  My brother and I got a lot of bruises and cuts trying to copy those moves.  I'm telling you this is one of the best kung fu movies of all times, you will not be sorry that you brought it. I'm 30 and I still get mad excited when I see it...maybe I'll surprise my big brother and get him a copy, cuz he won't be borrowing mine lol.",1169510400,,678,4.014814814814815
7930479,2,B0000541UB,"i bought this movie cuz i thought tao liang tan is gonne be the leading role but instead the movie waste alot of long scenes with the corny servant and mistress.  The movie should have focus more of tao liang tan, his school, and his rival school enemies.  A big dissapointment to this movie with the director wasting a talented actor.  The only good thing about the movie is tao liang tan and his rival enemies.",1168992000,,412,4.394736842105263
7930480,5,B0000541UB,"Tight story line, the fight scenes immense and the dvd trasfer chrystal.  This flick is a must have, especially for the final fight scene alone.  I saw the most amazing villian, with his ground fighting style, then he switched to a mad/crazy bird style,,trust me it is insane.  Yow,,,that scenes alone,,I had to review over, and over!!  This flick is nothing less than 5 stars in my book, and is certainly up there among my top 10 best old school flicks!! Tan Tao Liang is my main man!!",1149897600,,486,4.488636363636363
7930481,1,B0000541UB,"How can any of you give this movie more than 1 star? I bought this movie based on the reviews on here. When i got the  movie i was pretty happy until i watched it. This has to be the worse Kung fu movie i have ever seen. To anyone who hasn't seen it, don't waste your time.",1143849600,,273,3.706896551724138
7930482,5,B0000541UB,"One of the best kung fu movies I've seen this year.  Talking about action all the way through and great kung fu skill.

Delon Tam, one of the best kickfighters in kung fu is no joke! His student, a spoiled and bratty female, learns that although she has great kicking ability, she lacks stamina and strength. In the beginning she thought she was good in kung fu because she often got the best of those with less or no kung fu skills.  After a humbling experience of getting her [...] seriously kicked by a pair of local jerks (Ding Dong and Dong Dong), she submits to his leadership and learns to endure the hardships of becoming a great fighter.  Of course, this movie would not be complete without a real idiot in the picture.  This movie has one of those and he's quite funny.

This flick is action-packed, funny in the right places, well-choreographed, and the overdubs superb.  This is one I can watch again and again.  This is one of the best kick-fighting flicks I've ever seen.  This is surely in my top 5% of all-time old-school flicks.",1127606400,2,1045,4.4867724867724865
7930483,4,B0000541UB,"While this is entertaining, and some of the action sequences are truly outstanding, it is not a five-star film by any stretch of the imagination.  I will give the film immense credit for having a female protagonist of such incredible ability, but the puerile stretches of barely viable physical humour as acted out by a bumbling servant marred a great movie.  And while the same crew did the dubbing on both this and ""Shaolin Vs. Lama"", they were much more successful at the task in the other case: this would have been better subtitled.  I would highly recommend ""The Leg Fighters"", but it really is no five-star film.",1078099200,4,619,4.712962962962963
