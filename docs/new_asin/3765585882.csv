7802241,5,3765585882,"Erich Kstner's ""Das doppelte Lottchen"" has been filmed umpteen times and I like every version I've seen: the German original (1949, available on DVD and with a softer image on You Tube with English subtitles), the Japanese version (1950, available on You Tube as ""the Japanese parent trap""), two Disney versions (""The Parent Trap""), two Hindi versions (""Do Kaliyaan"" is a truly dark version with a truly evil would be future mother-in-law), and now this German version. The basic story is always the same, but the different versions integrate the story and local culture.

Unlike the situation with the other movies, the German tradition (not counting a cartoon which I haven't seen) is to hire identical twins to portray the separated twins. The twins in the present version appear to be a little older than in other versions of the story, but one still feels for their plight.

I have only two complaints: the DVD does not have subtitles. I prefer to watch German movies with German subtitles because my ear is not as good as my eyes, but I also like English subtitles. Second, I am not sure I can continue to look at Corinna Harfouch as the loving mother after seeing her in those horrifying scenes in ""Downfall"" in which she drugs and murders her children...

Since I posted the above the Japanese version has been removed from You Tube. It is hoped that it will be released on DVD with English subtitles as it is a nice version of the story. Also, I have learned of an early British version called ""Twice Upon a Life"" that is not yet available on DVD and should be.",1286236800,2,1570,4.640287769784172
