8375772,4,B002O153YQ,"Its interesting writing this on Cinco de Mayo.  That holiday celebrates a Mexican victory over the French Army.  I can only think of a handful of incidents in which non-Western peoples won a battle against European or American ones.  The others include Custers Last Stand, the Japanese success in the Russo-Japanese War, and the Ethiopians fighting off the Italians.  The Zulus won a battle against the British and its portrayed in the film Zulu Dawn.  This Warriors episode touches on those events during its last nine minutes.
This TV series is really growing on me.  At first, I wondered if this showed a Caucasoid host being an exoticist.  However, I appreciate that he identifies as a warrior and feels kinship with warriors all over the globe and in past times.  His interactions with modern Zulus may make you want to listen to McCartneys and Wonders Ebony and Ivory.  At one point, the host even says, This may be the best time Ive ever had filming this show.  The narrators interactions with modern Zulus may remind one of videos from musician Johnny Clegg additionally.
The program shows some South African children singing and dancing.  This may remind some of the children singing in Hotel Rwanda.  It goes on to show that Zulu warriors didn't just fight and kill, but also danced and celebrated.  I am very surprised that the program had so many people in traditional garb being filmed.  I imagine it could be cost-prohibitive for a non-fictional program.  The American host always wears Western garb; he is never shown in Zulu loincloths or furs.  This may be a gesture of respect and an understanding of the tragic history of blackface.  The narrator speaks of warriors as seeking blessings or even mental healings from shamans after battles.  The narrator doesnt dismiss it as primitive, but discusses it respectfully.
During the late 1980s, Fox (possibly) showed a powerful mini-series on Shaka Zulu.  This program mentions that leader a lot.  The facts say the Zulus were a small tribe that gained intense power via his leadership.  In the TV series, you see Shaka interacting with several British military officers and physicians.  In Warriors, you don't hear of those interactions, but the host said Shaka predicted on his dying day that Europeans would take over the land one day.  They present major British invasion as happening later.  The work is very weapon-focused.  South African weapons are discussed first and mostly, but the guns used by the British are then presented and described.  The work doesnt mention that either an ancestor of Louis XIV or Napoleon died in the scuffle.",1430784000,,2609,4.940229885057471
