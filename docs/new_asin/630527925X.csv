7887571,3,630527925X,"The plot was impossible for me to follow.  But I am still smitten by Ava Gardner, so I wanted to see her in this poor movie.  Perhaps it would help your understanding of the plot if I spoil it a little by tipping you off that the plot is about the leading lady alternately flashing back in time to various passionate affairs with various men while in her younger years, and then alternately back to present time to rebut and deny her aged husbands suspicions of her having had various affairs during their long marriage.  So you go from one vague scene of an affair (a poorly filmed vague scene of an amorous encounter, to the next scene in present time with her denying to her husband the affair that you have just seen with your own eyes, then back and forth and back forth.... but its just not compelling.  I never thought I would ever rate an Ava Gardner movie with one star. but here it is.  It was interesting to me, however, to see Ava in her golden years, how she looked after aging (I wouldn't kick her out of my bed for eating crackers, lol).  She always said she was not an actress, but I always thought she did a better job of acting than most.  And her performance in this movie is good, its just the plot and filming of the sex scenes that are lame.  This might have been a racy movie in its day, but would probably only merit a PG rating in today's movie culture.",1424304000,3,1378,4.232824427480916
7887572,5,630527925X,"-----This movie ""Regina"" is said to be Ava Gardner's last movie. She did some TV shows afterwards, before she died. It is a heavily dramatic movie, with only four characters. It is set around the son bringing his girl friend to have dinner with his parents; Ava Gardner plays the Mother. I think it is a fitting end to the career of this fine actress. I think any fan of Ava Gardner will want to see this movie. It has depth, and significance. Ava Gardner did well in it. It is a serious movie, no ""One Touch of Venus"" here. I enjoyed it. ---Jim",1331769600,8,545,4.25
7887573,3,630527925X,"Actors were good but the DVD has the worst quality I've ever seen. My advice is don't buy it because of the bad quality of the DVD ( a lot of noise on the soundtrack, and the quality of the original that was used to  do the mastering is awfull). Some words about the actors, they're good in  them performance, but all the thing are messed by the bad quality of the  DVD.",937872000,11,370,4.041095890410959
