5471136,5,B00AQHBVXC,This Blu-ray recording reveals how good Miles is. The sound quality is fantastic and gives you the felling of being there when played through high quality equipment. This is music to hear and be seen. I recommend it without reservation.,1404086400,3,236,4.925
5471137,5,B00AQHBVXC,"It is hard to imagine this was a live recording as it is almost Studio Quality.
Plus, Miles plays a lot of his old stuff he hadn't performed live in 30 years.",1389398400,3,158,3.96875
5471138,5,B00AQHBVXC,What can I say that's not been said over and over again by millions of fans. Just Miles Davis.  Love it.,1387843200,2,104,3.9523809523809526
5471139,5,B00AQHBVXC,I saw this performance on public television years ago. Little did I know that Miles Davis would be leaving. I subsequently purchased the compact disc but I'm sure that there are parts of the concert which were not recorded on the compact disc.,1387152000,,243,4.674418604651163
5471140,5,B00AQHBVXC,Magic Miles supported by Wallace Roney (sitting next to Miles to play the notes he could no longer play). I wish I were there but this concert has been out on laserdisc for over a decade and in the Miles Montreux  box set.,1384819200,,222,4.162790697674419
5471141,5,B00AQHBVXC,"Even in failing health Miles does not disappoint as does the introduction to Wallace Roney.
That and what more can be said about Quincy Jones.
Despite being a 1991 production Eaglerock has done it again with astounding video and audio quality.
My only question is why so cheap perhaps the price and vintage are scaring many away.
This BR presents excellent value.
It's a must for any collector wanting a piece of the Miles magic and legacy.",1381449600,,440,4.7272727272727275
5471142,5,B00AQHBVXC,The last look at Miles Davis. The music conducted by Quincy Jones is superb and the music was on a very high level of performance. Kudos to everyone involved in this historic event. The DVD is first rate and exceptional.,1377475200,3,220,4.525
5471143,5,B00AQHBVXC,"Owned the laserdisc since '92, knew it was recorded in Sony HDTV.
So glad its available in all its glory.  Grammy winning performance.",1367280000,2,134,4.826086956521739
5471144,5,B00AQHBVXC,"At long last, it's here! If you love the acoustic period of Miles Davis' career here is a concert that he recorded very late in life and (luckily) at a time when audio/video technology was very advanced. Here is the 1991 concert at the jazz festival in Montreux, Switzerland conducted by his long time friend and admirer Quincy Jones. And at this performance Miles finally relented and went back to the music that made him famous. It's Miles once again with the Gil Evans Orchestra playing from the albums Miles Ahead, Porgy & Bess and Sketches of Spain (plus Boplicity from Birth of The Cool). This blue-ray release is one I've been waiting for all these years and today I received my copy.

I bought a VHS copy of the concert six years ago and played it again yesterday. The song ""Springsville""  (the first song on the album ""Miles Ahead"") which is the second song on the VHS release of the concert is missing from the blue-ray disk and that is my one disappointment. Springsville is a beautiful piece. Also missing are interviews by Herbie Hancock, George Duke and Quincy Jones, as well as practice sessions that precede the concert on the VHS version. But Claude Nobs' interview and seven more that follow (including one by Betty Carter) paint a vivid and delightful portrait of the great jazz trumpeter who died only three months after this historic live performance. You'd think that all of the preceding material on the VHS that was removed to keep the main show here at exactly one hour would be moved into a ""bonus"" section. Alas, that is not so. Hold on to your old VHS copy if you still have it.

Miles did admit that the music performed here was difficult to play, given the logistics required and minor variations in performance can be detected when compared to the studio recordings. But the giddiness on the faces of Quincy Jones and Wallace Roney on stage leaves no doubt at all that they treasured the opportunity to perform. And Miles, at this age, could use the help of trumpeter Roney on stage.

My long wait for this blue ray release is well worth it. The performance is impressive and audio and video quality is equally so. (You'd expect Miles to perform for at least two hours at a concert and that makes me suspect there's more footage of this concert in the vault). Get your copy today.",1363651200,22,2311,4.601941747572815
5471145,5,B00AQHBVXC,"It goes without saying that pretty much all of Miles Davis' work is significant to the world of jazz and music in general, and this concert, recorded just a little over 2 months before Davis' death in September 1991 is no exception. It is especially poignant, not only for the unprecedented performance by Miles of material he had originally recorded more than 30 years before, but also of course for the implied tribute to his friend the great arranger Gil Evans, who had prepared the original orchestrations for the music performed at the concert. Given the precarious state of Davis' health at this time and his well-established disdain for retrospection on his music, it is a joy to see and hear him performing these pieces with such obvious emotion, respect and technical excellence, no mean feat on such a demanding instrument as the trumpet. His support soloists Kenny Garrett on alto saxophone and Wallace Roney on trumpet and flugelhorn perform beautifully also, with great respect both for the music and for Davis. It is also wonderful to see Davis express his affection for the young players, particularly Roney, with whom he trades phrases on several pieces and also playfully mops his sweaty face with a shared towel. Roney himself dressed for the occasion in a suit reminiscent of Davis' classic '50's-'60's Italian wardrobe, an appropriate and touching gesture that just adds to the depth of feeling that radiates from the music. The great Quincy Jones, clearly delighted to be involved in this historic event, conducts the orchestra with his typical skill, and the players themselves perform the Evans charts (expanded to three times the number of original parts for extra depth) very creditably. Timelessly beautiful music, lovingly performed by the master and his disciples, captured and presented flawlessly as usual by the folks at Eagle Vision--simply essential viewing for any Davis fan or lover of classic jazz. The wonderful personal reminiscences of Montreux promoter Claude Nobs are a nice bonus too.",1431388800,4,2026,5.123867069486405

5471148,3,B00AQHBVXC,This rates a 3 because it was a chance to see Miles on Blu Ray at a special event.  However he looks tired and bored and the sound is only good not great. It felt kind of sad.,1421798400,3,175,3.6052631578947367

The picture and sound are outstanding, just wondering why it says 133 minutes. There are a number of interviews that I haven't yet watched but it would be the first time I've seen bonus material included in the running time...",1411171200,2,385,4.661764705882353

I never thought I'd see high-definition video of Miles Davis. That it was captured and translated to Blu-ray some 20 years after recording, with terrific audio, is a gift to all of us.

Miles comes alive in this recording, and the picture quality is so good you feel like you're there.

This is an incredible Blu-ray for the Miles Davis fan. I've never experienced him or his music like this; highest possible recommendation.",1508371200,2,436,4.864864864864865
8556364,3,B00AQHBVXC,Miles is not at his best (I guess not surprising given he soon died after this).  There is another trumpet player on stage to pick up for Miles.  It's Miles but....,1492041600,,164,4.258064516129032
