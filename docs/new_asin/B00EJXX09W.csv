The kids love it and my husband can quote parts of it (if not all). Good family movie. Theres nothing to worry about your children seeing something you don't want them to see. Great buy!
Sword in the Stone is a great movie! Its the story about how King Arthur became a king. Great story!",1484006400,,448,4.1022727272727275
