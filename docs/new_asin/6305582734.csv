1051709,5,6305582734,"This film is a cross between the ""Rocky"" films and Rudy Ray Moore flicks (Dolomite, The Avenging Disco Godfather... and HE does make a special appearance in this Fanaka classic).  With loony character names  like 'Too Sweet"", 'Half-Dead' and 'Seldom Seen', this story-line is  peppered with demented scenes like the scary ""potato salad  scene"", or the dwarf-prostitute pursuit.  A must see for all Mr. T  fans.",949968000,6,410,5.136363636363637

With crazy  character names like 'Too Sweet', 'Seldom Seen', 'Half-Dead', one can't go  wrong.  Go 'Too Sweet', 'Half-Dead' will never bring you down!",949968000,,337,5.423076923076923
1051711,5,6305582734,"What can you say about a movie that has Mr. T as a boxing instructer, smoking a bong, and drinking wine? Well I rank this movie high because the clothes of Mr. T are better than any thing worn to the oscars. I meam He  dresses as a genie....come on the man is a genuis.",922752000,3,269,3.890909090909091

T).Too sweet gets out of jail only to have half dead escape and kill his girlfriend on ther first nite alone. The fun starts when dead's henchmen simple and doo dirty break him out of jail again! how?seeing is believing and when too sweet can't resist fighting again who else but mr. T to help lead him to fighting form for another trip to jail to fight the champ,and here we go again.just remember it's only a movie! it's only a movie!",1256515200,,642,4.4033613445378155
1051805,2,6305582734,"What the hell happened after the first film  was good. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen,but the entire cast just seems to be going through the motions. The heart of the first film is just really missing. I hate how they replaced the original actors of half dead and seldom seen with dudes I didn't care about. This film could have been so much better.",1215475200,,360,4.373134328358209
1051806,4,6305582734,This movie is my favorite blaxploitation flick of all time...the big problem is that the xenon versions of the movie are cut. There's some sleazy video store in the neighborhood that has the un-cut vhs version. I have no idea why xenon buys the rights then cuts up the film.,1194480000,,274,4.5

7892057,1,6305582734,"This release is not the full version of the film that was shown in theaters. For some reason the DVD distributor heavily edited certain parts of the film.

7892060,1,6305582734,"One of the absolute WORST sequels of all time. It's sad, because the original ""Penitentiary"" from 1979 is one of the finest prison films and boxing films ever made.
