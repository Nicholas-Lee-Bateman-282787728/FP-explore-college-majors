8359561,5,B002AJQ7I8,"Wonderful man does not begin to describe the brilliance that was Albert Schweitzer whose life is marvelously depicted in this film.
Schweitzer's life is looked at from young man to his dying year with such aplomb by actor Jeff McCarthy that one can easily forget it is indeed a portrayal.  The film is intertwined with interviews with Schweitzer's actual relatives.  We are relished with beautiful locations of the Serengeti juxtaposed with the harsh reality of the disease-ridden natives and their plight for survival.

All told it is a poignant and touching tale that can be best summed up in the music of Bach playing in the background of the Serengeti.",1376179200,4,656,4.945454545454545
8359562,4,B002AJQ7I8,"Although I hoped this dvd would be the latest movie about Albert Schweitzer, the one with Jeroen Krabb in it as Schweitzer, this older movie gives a very good impression about Schweitzer. Good acting, good filming. Very useable at school for kids 12 and up.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-My-Life-and-Thought-An-Autobiography/dp/0801894123/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of My Life and Thought: An Autobiography</a>",1276387200,5,460,7.381818181818182
8359563,5,B002AJQ7I8,"Dr. Schweitzer was certainly a very noble and extraordinary person. As a professional, he has completely dedicated his life to helping others. However, in many ways he sacrificed his family (an ill wife and a young daughter) for the well-being of the world.

Doblmeier's film successfully highlights this controversy of Dr. Schweitzer's legacy. I strongly recommend it, especially to those who try to find out the right balance between their professional ambitions and family needs.",1248566400,11,482,5.426666666666667
