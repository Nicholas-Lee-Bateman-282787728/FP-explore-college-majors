The Instructor is more interested in making you do complex moves, back to back, that are so ridiculous, I guarantee, you'll cut the video off or just march in place. Jump, raise your arms, pump, do the splits, touch the ground, grab the ball, toss the ball up, grab, scissors, knees to chest, etc.

I wish they cared more about giving you an effective workout than a million complex, compound moves that even the background women mess up on a few times.

BTW: I have gone from a size 18 to 4 in a year doing simple to highly advanced workouts daily. I won't be doing this one again.
