7922234,4,B00004T3AC,I HAD THIS DVD BEFORE AND PATRICK MACNEE  IS GREAT AS HOST. NICE RE-ENACTMENT OF THERE STORIES. NOT SCARY NOR CHEESY.,1415836800,,117,4.571428571428571
7922235,2,B00004T3AC,"I recently purchased this collection to watch for fun.  Overall the stories are well presented and researched but there are some major problems.  The sound quality is terrible; I find myself constantly reaching for the remote so I can hear people speaking, and then turning it back down again.  This is annoying but not enough to give the low mark.

I was watching disk one, and was reviewing the trivia section.  The first question was about the Tower of London and how William the Conqueror had his wife Anne Boylen killed, correct or incorrect.  I selected incorrect, as Anne Boylen was killed by her husband Henry VIII.  Apparantly the producers of these collections know something about history that I don't know, because I was incorrect.  Yikes!  It makes me wonder how many other errors there are throughout these disks.",1162166400,,827,4.892086330935252
7922236,5,B00004T3AC,"I picked this up awhile ago at a local best buy, it was well worth the purchase!

My family, friends and myself have our inside jokes about some of the stories. From Patrick MACKNEE!(MACKNEEEE!) to the tower of london disk 1 (spine chilling tale that one is~ brrr), it's great fun to watch. The stories are really interesting, once you get past the now and again silliness of bad acting and 80's hair.

All of the stories are interesting, and some of their investigation work is also interesting to watch.

I enjoyed it, and most of my friends whom have watched them end up buying them for their own collection. I would suggest purchasing this for your collection, I would also suggest the unsolved mysteries: Ghosts.",1140652800,4,717,4.674603174603175
7922237,5,B00004T3AC,"Ghosts, they haunt us and scare us, they make us wonder about what truly is out there on the other side. If you enjoy the Ghost stories DVD collection then look out for GhostToGhostAM.com-all ghost stories all the time from what I have heard!

This by the way is a great DVD and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this phenomena!",1120780800,2,346,4.323076923076923
7922238,5,B00004T3AC,"I truly love the TV show. I always had a hard time to watch it, because of work, and i would miss almost every show, now, i thank amazon.com for bringing back the show in one collection. If your into ghost stories or are into ghosts period then this is one of the best collections out there so far..worth the time and money!",1090368000,8,324,4.158730158730159
7922239,4,B00004T3AC,"I do enjoy this set of DVDs a lot and watch at least one of the DVDs every week.  The stories on this are very detailed and interesting to listen to.  The only thing lacking is any documentary footage of hauntings of the places they spoke about.  If you're looking for pure documentary footage, this collection is NOT for you because it is completely made up of true stories and no first-hand footage.  For five DVDs, it's a great deal, and if you're dedicated to paranormal studies as I am, you should definitely make that small investment for a wide range of knowledge.  Hope that helps!",1080518400,7,589,4.518867924528302
7922240,5,B00004T3AC,"Before I launch into praise for these DVD's I have to admit that not all the stories related therein are of the bone-chilling variety, though quite a few are. Many stories are of hauntings by friendly type spirits, where the returning entity means no harm to the visitor, and while these may still cause most people to run for the hills, they pale in comparison to the truly frightening stories, namely the ones regarding entities that DO try to harm or frighten.
Hosted by Patrick MacNee (The Avengers), who takes us to various locations famous - or infamous - for it's ghostly activities, we get to visit such places as Hollywood and parts of the Old West (among others) where we realize that the dearly departed are not really departed. MacNee does a good job in setting up the stories, and the ghostly photographs - supposedly real - that usually precede the stories, lend an even more chilling edge to the proceedings.
For ghost story fans, I would also recommend the video collection of the old television show 'One Step Beyond'.",1068681600,23,1035,4.723756906077348
7922241,4,B00004T3AC,"This is a very interesting DVD set specializing in the investigations of the Paranormal Activities mainly in US and England. What I Love the most is the photographs of the Ghosts and Spirits shown at the begining of every case, but it would've been better if they had provided a special section in the ""MENU"" of each DVD containing all the photographs collections including their details (dates, Origin, Etc.). The other good thing about this DVD is that it provided information on the places with the most reported Paranormal Activities and also the name of the Investigators of few well known  cases.",976320000,12,602,4.901960784313726
