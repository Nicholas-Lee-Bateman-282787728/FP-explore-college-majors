8762571,4,B01G91NYI8,"This B-Movie Biblical really only deserves three stars at most but I am giving it an extra star for three reasons. First, this MOD DVD is a gorgeous Technicolor transfer with an incredibly sharp image. Second, the Matte Paintings are stunning and give the movie a sense of scope that belies its cheap budget. Third, Linda Christian is more beautiful than at any other time in her career. She really is stunning in this.",1487116800,2,419,4.675675675675675
8762572,5,B01G91NYI8,It has a good story to it. I loved learning about Cyrus the shepherd.,1481587200,,69,4.0
8762573,3,B01G91NYI8,"Cool Bible epic, telling the story of the Babylonian Captivity and how it ended, rather an improvement on the Bible version found in Ezra and Nehemiah. Elements from the Bible story and the origin legends of Cyrus the Great are used. In Babylon, the prophet Daniel sends Nahum (Richard Conte) out to find Cyrus, a shepherd destined to become a great monarch, one who will free the Jews from captivity. After persuading Cyrus to accept his royal responsibilities, Nahum is sent as ""ambassador"" to woo a hot chick named Panthea (Linda Christian) on Cyrus's behalf, and we know the complications which inevitably result from such arrangements, don't we? As a bonus there is an extended scene with one of those bare-midriff sexy dances which are such an integral part of all Bible movies. The dancer? A young Julie Newmar. Woo woo. (I should note that her entire dialogue consists of one word, but then who cares about dialogue where Julie Newmar is concerned?) Directed by the great William Castle before he got into bone-chilling horror movies (The House on Haunted Hill, etc.) with nutty gimmicks. This too is silly stuff but a lot of fun. It deserves to be better known.",1467590400,5,1170,4.825870646766169
