8194545,5,B000Q6GWZA,"Tanya Dillard does a great job in this workout video.  The idea is some indoor exercises that are appropriate for kayakers.  She uses a Fitness Ball, Rubber workout bands, and a medicine ball (though anything that you can hold that is heavy could substitute).

I found the workout to be really tough.  It is clear that she put a fair amount of research and thought into developing workouts that are kayak-specific.

These are great things for northerners to do during the winter, when we can't get in the water.  Those who travel a lot can also use these workouts in hotel rooms.

Tanya is absolutely beautiful, as well.",1329350400,,620,4.685185185185185
8194546,4,B000Q6GWZA,"The review giving this product one star, has some valid points, but I do not believe those criticisms are enough to drop it to one star.  The exercises are very good, well balanced for the whole body, and well instructed.  The instructor is a little humorless, but humor gets old after the first few times you watch the same DVD.  She is no nonsense, but very good at explanation of the exercise and the form you should use. It is two 35 minute segments that each work different body parts (to be alternated or done in one mega-session).  35 minutes is a perfect amount of time for strength training.  You will need resistance bands, swiss (ab) ball and a medicine or weighted ball (though I think you could substitute a dumbell for the medicine ball.  Being new to kayak, I would have liked more reference to how the moves helped for kayak, but overall I am pleased with this DVD.",1319328000,,881,4.475
