8353234,5,B0026MS3O0,"It is very rare for me to laugh out loud watching a video, but I did so for this charming comedy. It is trite, silly, and fluffy; so are the tales of Boccaccio, and, like Boccaccio, ""The Mandrake Root"" transports the sympathetic viewer to  Renaissance Florence and the eagerness of its residents to make fun of themselves. (The cover art, an allusion to Botticelli, fits the production poorly. This is not quite family theatre, I guess, but nobody is running around without clothes.) Only 75 minutes long and lots of fun.",1467072000,,521,4.725274725274725

8353236,2,B0026MS3O0,"This slightly interesting, ahem, adaptation of Machiavelli's play was decently acted, but was less than I expected.  One ""revealing"" scene came from, not what and where and whom I expected [the ""graphics"" for the cover were more revealing] and didn't do a thing for me. It's basically a story of a young wife, with an older husband, who wants a child and they enlist a young guy to do the business [hope I didn't ruin the ""plot""]. I think a slightly more faithful version came in the 1990's in a series called ""Secrets Of Love"", on Cinemax [shows you how long ago it was].  As the expression goes: ""if I knew then what I know now"" I might have ""rented"" it, rather than bought it [the item wasn't worth what I paid for it considering my disappointment].  To each his or her own.  As an adaptation it was (as stated) ok, which is the reason I didn't give it one star, but that's how it goes. Oh well [more hassle than its worth to return].  Maybe I'll sell it one day.  [Won't probably get what I paid for it, but there you go.]",1312934400,,1026,4.290155440414508
8353237,5,B0026MS3O0,"Please count me among the European Drama company's sincere and enthusiastic fans! I received a copy of the Mandrake Root. With great anticipation I watched the film unfold with a rhythm, tempo, agility, and grace that remained faithful to the text. The direction and skilled actors were able to maintain Machiavelli's wit while updating his humour. A genuine tour de force and a great, great pleasure to watch.",1243468800,5,410,5.044117647058823
