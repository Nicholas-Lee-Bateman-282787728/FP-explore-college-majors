1987533,5,B0001CNQVM,"Great DVD set!  All 4 DVDs have colorful artwork on the discs and they fit neatly in the compact folding case.  The video quality is what one expects from the DVD format but the audio only uses the center speaker.  Although Cartoon network has released some of the original episodes before, this one is a must have for Scooby-Doo enthusiasts.  Whereas the ""Scooby-Doo: Original Mysteries"" only had the first 5 episodes, this one has all 25.  Unfortunately, the Hanna-Barbara DVDs are only in English (audio) with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. The Cartoon network release has English, French, and Spanish audio options.",1079568000,,628,5.117647058823529
1987534,5,B0001CNQVM,"Hanna-Barbara have put out this box-set of 4 DVDs containing every single complete episode of the ultra-classic ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" that ran from 1969-1970. Don't be fooled that the title states ""The Complete First and Second Seasons""; there only were two seasons.
What you WON'T find in this collection (thankfully) are the miriad of spin-offs and bad idea cartoons that were spawned by the original series - such as Scrappy-Doo, Scooby-Dumb, celebrity guest-appearances by Don Knotts, the Harlam Globetrotters and Sonny & Cher.
No, this collection is just all the original, pure, superb ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" cartoons that ran from 1969-70. There are a total of 25 episodes spanning four DVDs, with the occasional extra thrown-in. The extras are fluff and as such uneccesary, but there aren't many and they don't detract from the DVDs much.
The mastering is done well, and the picture looks crisp, sharp, clean, and bright. The colors are vibrant and true. The sound is also very clean and well done. While they could have probably fit all 25 episodes on fewer disks, I'm glad they chose not to as to keep the compression to a minimum, which they've done.
The original ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" series isn't just a silly little cartoon that can be easily modified in any number of ways for marketability [as was obviously thought throughout the 1970s when cartoons went overboard with ridiculous concepts but scaled-back the quality and craftsmanship of great animation].
The original Scooby-Doo is nothing short of art. It is highly-realized quality animation that deserves to be preserved in a respectful manner and appreciated by fans everywhere. I'm glad this level of quality has been finally put into a DVD presentation of the cartoon series that was put into the original.",1079481600,204,1797,5.094915254237288
1987535,3,B0001CNQVM,"The 1970's were a particularly lucrative time for William Hanna And Joseph Barbara; two animators responsible for creating the highly successful ""Tom & Jerry"" short subjects at MGM during the late forties and early fifties. Following the demise of short subjects, Hanna & Barbara launched into television with ""The Flintstones"" - a thinly disguised parody of ""The Honeymooners."" The series - the first prime time cartoon programming in the history of television, was an instant and resounding success. The team followed this rich endevor with ""The Jetsons"" - an equally ambitious cartoon family drama/comedy that unfortunately failed to scale the heights of their previous series. But with ""Scooby Doo"" Hanna & Barbara easily hit pay dirt and, if for no other reason, cemented their place in animated history. The series of comedy/mysteries centers around a troupe of ""meddling"" teens and their canine catastrophy - Scooby Doo who are constantly finding themselves in the middle of some haunted happenings that are all too easily explained in the end.
THE TRANSFER: Warner Brothers gives us seasons one and two (25 episodes) of this trend-setting pop culture phenomenon. But the transfers are riddled with analog artifacts and some obtrusive cell elements that crop up in nearly ever shot. Though dirt and age related artifacts are kept at a minimal, some episodes appear to have faired far better than others. Over all, colors are rich, though flat and very one dimensional looking at times. Okay, so it's not Disney animation. The point is there seems to be a ""pasty"" look to some of the episodes that is absent in others. Contrast and black levels are well balanced but certain scenes, particularly during the opening title sequence, are very dark and require a dark room to be completely enjoyed. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: Some really boring stuff including a gaudy music video, a fan's fav episode featurette which is really a retreading of material included elsewhere, and a disengaging making of featurette that in no way is as comprehensive as Warner's Looney Toons box set.
BOTTOM LINE: Yes, this is one for your library if you are a die hard Scooby fan. But the extras read more like a pile of Scooby snacks.",1079395200,17,2239,5.021505376344086
1987536,5,B0001CNQVM,Well I waited since I was a kid to see scooby for myself as well as my son who is an avid fan. A tough day at work and then watch a scooby cartoon and you forgot about your tough stressful day.  These cartoons rate with and are on par with the looney toons so you won't be sorry as you will watch them over and over again. What a smart dog! Its a great present for your kids as Scooby doo has lasted thru the years.  When you are waitiung for your DVD Scooby will be on another mystery. Enjoy!,1079222400,,493,3.871287128712871
1987537,1,B0001CNQVM,"I've been an admirer of most of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but 'Scooby Doo' is one whose sucess seems a real mystery to me.
The plot of every single episodes is just exactly the same. The gang is working on solving a mystery of a lost treasure supossedely taken away by a monster, ghost, or any other creepy character. In the end the find out that such creature doesn't exist and it's a person in disguise trying to steal the treasure. Frankly I don't understand what is so good about this crappy show.
If you wanna see Hanna Barbera at their highest level of creativity, get 'The Flintstones' boxed set, because by watching one episode of Scooby Doo, you might as well have seen them all.",1079222400,11,690,4.528
1987538,5,B0001CNQVM,I never get tired of this show. I dig how scooby relates to a Problem.scooby is always about a full Belly&having fun.to cool for words. Shaggy cracks me as does the rest of the gang. Scooby Doo is a show that I got into right off the Bat.timeless Entertainment.,1079136000,,261,4.346938775510204
1987539,1,B0001CNQVM,"This is the most over-appriciated cartoon in history. Why a show featuring no-dimensional characters and atrocious writing is still haunting serious animation fans 30 years later is beyond me. Thanks for wasting our time, Warner Bros. Where's our Batman: The Animated Series DVD box set?",1076716800,16,287,5.4
1987540,5,B0001CNQVM,"My earliest and most fondest memory of watching the classic 1969 Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! was in the 70s early on Saturday morning when it was still dark outside. Considering how Scooby is often parodied today, this may surprise you but back then (to my young eyes) Scooby-Doo was kinda scary and creepy thanks to the creepy background settings, the monsters (my favorite: the skeleton-headed spaceman with the crazy laugh) and Ted Nichols' creepy underscore which could build up tension like Bernard Herrmann did for Hitchcock. Luckily, the tension would be broken with Scooby and Shaggy's comedic antics. Antics which typically resulted in the ""musical chase numbers"" which would conclude with the ""monster"" getting trapped, then unmasked, followed by the villain's obligatory ""And I would've gotten away with it too, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids""...[and their dog]. As predictable, or even corny as others deem it be, all of this - the pure 60s/70s fun - is what has eternally endeared Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! to me above all the other versions. Produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Scooby-Doo's mystery-solving format remains one of most often imitated shows to date. Fangface, Clue Club, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Rickety Rocket, Jabberjaw (just to name a few) all owe credit to Scooby-Doo. After the two seasons here in this collection the quality of the show was diminished to rather ""cartoony proportions."" Though, some versions were still interesting to watch such as 1972's The New Scooby-Doo Movies where the gang would team up with guest stars such as Batman & Robin, The Addams Family, Jerry Reed, Tim Conway, Sandy Duncan, and such. There were three versions of Scooby-Doo's opening theme for the two seasons in this collection: One is a rare instrumental only version used in the first few episodes of season one; the other is the classic vocal version performed by studio singer Larry Marks used for the remainder of season one; and then there's the one that has the same music and lyrics as the classic version but was performed by ""chase songs"" artist Austin Roberts for season two. For the grooviest adventures of Freddy, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scoob, this DVD collection is definitely the best buy!

Note: I'm talking about the red trim ""Diamond Collection"" version (which usually sells for less than the Golden collection. If you don't mind my following gripes, look for this version). The DVD is very bare-bones. The menu is just text on a black background with the DVD cover art in a tiny square off to the side. The case has all three discs stacked on top of each other like a multi-disc CD-ROM game. The discs themselves have very cheap pink markings that, with my package, were sticky as if something in the DVDs' burning process didn't set right. Still, the show is there for a VERY good price and I'll binge through it in under a week. I just wish there was at least a commentary with the living cast members.",1505260800,,848,4.47741935483871

Here it is, nearly the 50TH ANNIVERSARY of one of the Greatest Animated cartoon shows of all time, with one of the most beloved characters created specifically for television--and there are no extras! I have Hanna Barbera's HONG KONG PHOOEY Collection but they did all right by THAT ""Canine Crusader"" by featuring interviews with the creators and discussing how the character came to be. What did Scooby get? NUTHIN', ZILCH!

Right now, all we have are two seasons worth of the delightful original cartoon mysteries, in dazzling color and purity of image--but that ain't enough!

I've tried the discs on multiple devices, so the problem is with the DVDs rather than my equipment. I've included several screenshots that highlight the problem.

1987745,5,B0001CNQVM,"For those of you who are looking into buying the Diamond Collection release of this show, here's the straight skinny: It's only the episodes, no bonus features.

The assumed-to-be-missing bonus features are:

Disc 1: No bonus features of note
Disc 2: Scooby-Doo's Ultimate Fans (a look at a couple of memorabilia collectors) and ""Get The Picture: How To Draw Scooby-Doo and the Gang"" (which is basically speed drawing. Good luck following along if you can't draw because of fine motor control issues like me)
Disc 3: Funky Fashion (a look at the fashions of each member of the Scooby Gang) and America Loves Scooby-Doo (a music video)
Disc 4: Scooby-Doo Street Smarts (uh.. okay) and ""Take The Scooby-Doo Challenge""... okay.

So, really, if you're a fan, you're *probably* not missing all that much, especially with this set, where there was literally no excuse for the bare bones extras you got. If you just want the easiest route to the episodes themselves and don't care all that much about the bonus material (which on some of these releases is remarkably scant), then these new bare-bones Diamond Collection rereleases are the way to go.

I'm so happy to have gotten this set and consider it a staple for every home really. I can't wait to share my love for scooby with my kids on weekend mornings!

1988003,5,B0001CNQVM,"This is the Classic Scooby Doo series that my generation grew up with. These are the episodes that aired as 1 hour long (45 min without commercials) and always had a celebrity guest star in them. Unlike everything since, these do not have the ridiculous melodrama or annoying baby personalities. This series is just good old classic mystery solving fun that stretches the limits of probability.
If you find yourself cringing at the annoying franchise releases from the last few decades then these are the Scooby Doo episodes for you. Guest appearances include but are not limited to Don Knotts, The Harlem Globe Trotters, Sonny & Cher, The Three Stooges and Johnathon Winters.
Pros:
Classic Scooby Doo
45 minute episodes
Very Funny
Appropriate for all ages
Celebrity Guests
Cons:
Only two seasons

After opening the collection and watching a few episodes, I found there to be no problems.  At times, I bought dvd's that are horrible quality, but this is not the case.  The Hannah Barbara collections have always been outstanding.  The only problem I have with this collection is that it does not include the third season.  If you want the third season, you will have to purchase it separate.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

And a show such as 'Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!' is proof why.  With superb storytelling and brilliant voice acting, it's a show for anyone to watch, be it adults, teenagers, pets, and of course, kids.  A show like this is bound to make you laugh or smile before you can say 'Jinkies!'

If you want nice old fashioned cartoon to watch with friends or family, then 'Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!' is a great place to start.  So what are you waiting for?  If you want classic cartoons in your life, check this series out.

There still are some parts of the episodes that I cringed while watching. It's sad that an episode can get pretty racist or sexist. I have no idea what HB had against asian americans. It was 1969-70...true...but I had hoped for better.

Whether you've seen a Scooby-Doo episode or none at all, anyone can recognize Scooby when they see him, he is one of the most iconic animated characters more than any Hanna Barbara character, even more than The Smurfs, Fred Flintstone, or Yogi Bear, just as much or more than Bugs Bunney or any Looney Toons character. Out of all the incarnations of Scooby-Doo, be it TV show, animated movie, or live-action, NONE of them (other than Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island) have ever pleased me or made me re-live my childhood like the original 1960's and 1970's original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. I HIGHLY recommend this to ALL Scooby-Doo fans, cartoon fans, animated monster fans, or anyone who has only seen the awful re-boots of the original classic show, this is one of the greatest kids shows that has truly stood the tests of time and has many of the most memorable monsters and characters ever to be seen in any cartoon show.

I grew up watching this show and before the age of DVRs. I was disappointed when episodes became more and more scarce on TV. My solution was to buy the set so I'd be able to enjoy whenever the mood struck. Even though I've seen all episodes, I consider this a classic that gets better with time.

1988229,5,B0001CNQVM,"My young son was watching the new Scooby Doo show on cable. It's terrible (he likes it, but he's 3, so he likes almost any cartoon). I figured he needed to see the original show to know what Scooby Doo was like before they ruined it. He has been watching these DVDs almost non-stop since they arrived. We have seen them all so many times over the past month I know most of the dialog. I remembered most of them from when I was a kid. It's hard to believe these are all more than 40 years old. They have held up well. As a parent, one thing I really appreciate about these is they aren't obnoxious, which seems to be the case for most of the new cartoons out now.

One negative to note, the discs don't always play right in our DVD player. It may be they don't like our dual-region player (it can play DVDs from Europe, too). Sometimes they start up just right, with the menu showing up as it should. Other times they don't and we have to just keep hitting buttons on the remote until it starts to play. I have yet to figure out what combination of buttons makes it go in those situations, but it always eventually starts to play.",1371513600,,1129,4.178899082568807

1988231,5,B0001CNQVM,"I grew up watching this series (I'm not old, mind you...I watched them on VHS first in the early 2000's), and it holds a very special place in my heart. I remember how ""Hassle in the Castle"" was my favorite episode (and it still is) and I would watch it over and over again until it drove my parents nuts.

And then our VHS player broke, and this series couldn't be found anywhere on Netflix. So I fell away from the series. Until earlier this year, I came downstairs and saw my younger siblings watching the newest Scooby-Doo series (Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated), and I got excited. I mean, it's Scooby-Doo, what can go wrong?

As it turns out, everything. After the episode finished, I was very upset. That was not Scooby-Doo that I had just watched. Romance was so overdone...yes there was some affection between Fred and Daphne in ""Where are You?"", but never to the extremes that ""Mystery Incorporated"" took it to. And they also overused Shaggy's use of the word ""like."" He did NOT use it that much in ""Where are You?"" And, most importantly, Scooby-Doo didn't actually feel like Scooby-Doo! The characters weren't lovable!

That's when I marched straight up to my mother and said, ""Mom, you need to by 'Where are You?' on DVD, if you can find it."" We found this disc set, and we purchased it.

And I'm glad we did. I have now fallen in love with the series once again, and my siblings have all but forgotten about ""Mystery Incorporated"" and they too now love this classic series. There is so much to like about ""Scooby-Doo! Where are You?"" It's hilariously funny, and Scooby is instantly one of my favorite characters. The way he tries to get out of things is a big hit in the family. The mysteries are all very unique in their own way, and we all have our own favorite episodes. The characters are so lovable and the things they say are cute and funny...we are often quoting the show. Perhaps the best thing is the animation. Considering this was made back in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the animation is very well done...sure, it's simple, but sometimes that's a good thing. In this case, it's a very good thing. What's pictured on screen is typically very basic and not very detailed, but the animation is so fluid and perfect that it doesn't even matter. This series is a true classic that will continue to live on in my heart.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the series...it has to do with the case. The case is made of paper, and the disc holders are made of plastic. When you open it all the way up, it's split evenly in half with two discs on each side. But since the main case is made of paper, it ripped clean in half within a week of purchasing this product. And the box that you keep the case in broke in a matter of days. Basically, this is a poorly designed case, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with a little bit of tape.

But I won't let the poor case design get in the way of my final score...this is a classic series and it's rating can't be degraded because it came in a poor case. I give ""Scooby-Doo: Where are You?"" a perfect 5/5, because it rightfully deserves it.",1370995200,6,3110,4.4188481675392675

This collection has both seasons packaged in one really nice collection, priced for only $20, when normally a collection like this would cost $40 at least. In my opinion, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? was the best show version of Scooby-Doo with the best and most memorable mysteries. If you're a huge fan of the original show you can get every episode in this collection for a really surprisingly low price. I used to watch this show all the time as a kid, so this brings back great memories watching it again and remembering the first time I saw each episode. The DVD packaging is really colorful and great, and the cartoons look really good in the DVD format.

I love that she enjoys the same cartoons I enjoyed as a child.,1345075200,,252,4.163265306122449
1988308,5,B0001CNQVM,"As several reviewers have commented on, the way Scooby-Doo videos are numbered and packaged is confusing to say the least.  However, this set is THE place to start, whether beginning to buy DVD sets for kids (or yourself!) or to watch on services like Amazon Direct.

This set (Scooby-Doo Where Are You, The Complete 1st and 2nd Seasons) contains the first 25 epsiodes which introduced Scooby-Doo and the gang to the world in 1969-70 on CBS.  My almost 2 year old loves them over 40 years later.  We watched every episode of this collection together recently.  I know he will enjoy them on a different level for years as he grows to understand the plot and dialogue better.  While I was not around for the original run, the episodes are as enjoyable as I remember the re-runs as a kid, and I prefer watching these with my son much more than most other videos he enjoys.

I will not go into episode lists or basic character or plot summaries as others have, but overall, the two seasons are very similar.  One noticeable difference is the opening song and action music of the second season.  Both seasons contain the classic ""Scooby Doody Doo, Where Are You . . . "" lyrics, but you will notice a difference when the second season begins.  Apparently the artist who ""spiced up"" the intro song during season two also sang a ""groovy"" song in each episode which is played in an action sequence - usually with the villain chasing Scooby or the gang.  The dated chase music is somewhat enjoyable (at least the first time), and it allows you to differentiate between the seasons; but, overall, I am not sure it added to the show.

After completing this series, my son and I moved to Scooby Doo Where Are You, The Complete 3rd Season next - because of its name.  I will review it separately, but it is similar to this set with a few things thrown in to spice it up a little and a different into theme song (""Hang Around For Scooby Doo"").

However, apparently the ""3rd"" season contains episodes from 1978, despite the fact there was a lot of Scooby Doo material from 1970-1978.  I assume the relative continuity of the episodes is one of the main reasons reason for the packaging (as opposed to the episodes with stars of the era or those associated with other series such as Dynomutt during the intervening years).  There may be other reasons (legal, etc.).

I believe my son and I are going to try to go back and take the most chronological path we can - which starts with the New Scooby Doo Movies of 1972-73.  Apparently that collection only contains some of the episodes because of disputes over right to the characters and other issues.  I will try to write a review after viewing that set.

Whatever path you take after this first collection, this is THE place to start.",1339372800,2,2767,4.529175050301811

1988318,5,B0001CNQVM,"I ordered this DVD set for my son (5 years old at the time) because he fell in love with the Scooby-Doo cartoons he saw on TV and borrowed from the library. Unfortunately, most of the Scooby you find on TV is the newer movies and versions of the show which, in my opinion, aren't nearly as good as the original episodes I saw as reruns on TV when I was a kid. I was so thrilled to find this collection of those original episodes on Amazon (at a good price, too)! My son loves to watch these and I'll admit that I even like watching them with him; I guess you never outgrow Scooby-Doo! If you've never seen these episodes I highly recommend giving them a try. If you are worried about letting your child watch cartoons because they can be goofy/obnoxious, this is the Scooby you want: there is no ""Scrappy-Doo"" in these (thankfully).

The only issue I've had with this DVD set is that, at least in my DVD player, if you select ""play all"" it doesn't actually play all the episodes on a disc. Instead, it plays the first few. I've since figured out that the best way to watch all is to go to the episode list and just play one after another.",1331424000,,1138,4.220183486238532

1988323,5,B0001CNQVM,"Okay I just  got this  a few days ago ,and I am slowly working my way through the episodes. Now of  course like many people I have seen these episodes time and time again on tv through the  years. But there is something about  finally  owning it for yourself that makes it extra  special.

As for the shipping I  chose the  super savings shipping option and it only took about  roughly about 5 days including the weekend to receive. So i really  can't  complain on that! :-]

I think what I like most is the ability to watch them whenever I want without having to wait  till they come on boomerang to  view. I am almost  done with the first disc and am not  disappointed in the  least.

Yes these episodes have a little wear and tear to them, as any  older cartoon show would that  was produced in the  late  1960s, but to me that  makes them even more  vintage looking.

Besides this show was  never meant to  be viewed in high definition anyways. There are tons of extras that I am as of yet to get into. I will wait till I have watched all of the actual episodes to  delve more into those.

Just being able to see this  show on dvd and owning these first 2 seasons  puts a smile on my face. I honestly  think this was scooby doo at it's best. The stories were well formatted aind  interesting. The  show also knew how to tidy up towards the  end  quite well.

These are definitely  epsiodes that can be repeated. Even the ones i thought originally  I wasn't a big fan of ( such as the  dognapper episode.)

I remember watching these as a kid and really getting  into them and  I enjoy them even more now as an adult.

 Shaggy and Scooby are  as funny as  ever. They  play off  really well with  the rest of the gang's straight  forward approach.

I also own  the  ""third season"" ,but to be honest it is really  the scooby doo show  with  third season labeled on it. It is enjoyable as  well and  pretty much picks up  where the original series left off.

Though  you really can't beat these original episodes. I think i will have even more  enjoyable times with  these in the future.

This is a MUST HAVE for  serious scooby fans that is  for  sure.",1324512000,,2152,4.194513715710723

1988329,4,B0001CNQVM,"Couldn't tell you why but this 'complete' edition of the first and second seasons of Scooby Doo, Where are You? is missing a number of episodes from season two, some of which I would have loved to see again. That aside, this is a lovely collection.
The quad-fold digipak is housed in a plastic slipcase bearing an illustration that mimics an animation cell. When the package is removed from the case, it shows the illustration without color against stylized fingerprint background.
The inner artwork, like all the Scooby Doo collections I have yet to see, is a bit cheesy in quality compared to the actual animation of the early episodes but for what it is, it is nicely done. The initial fold-out reveals 'Scooby Doo Facts', while another fold-out reveals the four discs themselves, as well as a tag fold detailing their contents. The trays are transparent and when a disc is removed, it reveals a similiarly stylized panel of a panoramic illustrated scene featuring nondescript ghosts and/or goblins in silhouette.
As for the quality of the DVDs themselves, I have never seen these episodes look or sound better. In some instances, dialog has been replaced or substituted with alternate dialog, presumably due to deterioration of the original tapes but the difference is hardly objectionable and would only be noticable to a true Scooby Doo connoisseur.
While some of these episodes are still sometimes shown on television, others are rarely seen in this day and age and in fact, many episodes contain elements which may be considered socially objectionable. None of this is, of course, malicious but wholly of its time, which was now quite a long time ago.
While I would have loved to have a truly complete collection, I am pleased with the twenty-five episodes included and am glad to own it.",1311379200,2,1796,4.911184210526316

1988361,5,B0001CNQVM,"Boy, does this show bring back some fond memories of my childhood. Like everyone else, I remember getting up on Saturday mornings and watching the show on CBS. Course, if the truth be known- it was the only channel our TV (at the time) could pick up. Honestly, back then- I watched the show because there was nothing else I could watch. Yet, I've got alot of good memories of those days and, now, I got the chance to relive them all over again with The Complete First and Second Seasons on DVD.

Twenty-five episodes were produced during 1969 and 1971 for CBS. Originally titled The Mysteries Five, and later Who's S-S-Scared?- the show, itself, went through alot of changes before it aired. Most notable is Hanna-Barbera not making the gang a musical group. Don Messick, Casey Kasem, Frank Welker, Nicole Jaffe, Indira Stefanianna Christopherson and Heather North all provided voice-over for the gang during the two seasons.

This is a definite must-own for any Scooby fan.",1281139200,4,974,4.826347305389222
1988362,5,B0001CNQVM,"This DVD contains all the episodes of the pioneer Scooby-Doo Where are You. At that time, Hanna-Barbera wanted to create something unique, instead of a typical hero cartoon. Thus, Scooby-Doo was born. It was a unique plot at first, four kids and a dogs going creepy places to solve mysteries, one might even say they were on pot to do such feat. This cartoon is a must-get, since it is the spark that led to Scooby-Doo lasting 40++ years.

The quality and animation might not be smooth compared to Tom & Jerry, but one must remember Hanna-Barbera were on a tight budget and in order to produce many cartoons, quality have to be compromised. Nevertheless, the cartoon have many unique and intelligent jokes, with the voice actors being one of the most talented group at first. Frank Welker as Fred was amazing, so is Heather North, Nicole Jaffe, Casey Kasem and Don Messick in Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby. Again, the cartoon has a creepy vibe to it, thus making it more like a teen to late-teen type of cartoon.

For me, I like mysteries with a horror element added with a tinge of humour, hence this cartoon fits into my itinerary. I must emphasize again, the voice-acting here is GOOD. No other cartoons can have such suitable voices for the right type of characters. Furthermore, the cartoon shows a good reference to the 60s-70s era, with short scenes of a barn party or a beach party, reflective of hippies' lifestyles.

I strongly recommend this to all Scooby fans to add to their collection, cause it is agreed that this is the one of the better cartoon season so far, IMO, although the Scooby-Doo Show is the best due to much better animation.",1279324800,4,1655,4.6416382252559725

1988388,5,B0001CNQVM,"These Scooby Doo cartoons were the first to be made and that ones that I remember the most vividly because they played repeatedly on BBC TV in the 1970s, at a time when repeats were frowned upon!

Subsequent series introduced unwelcome new characters (mostly Scooby's relatives) and gimmicks such as guest stars from other TV series (like the Harlem Globetrotters and Sonny & Cher!). These first two series, complete in this boxset, are simply the gang tracking ghosts the way they do best. Finding clues and setting traps for ghosts that always turn out to be local do-badders.

The joy is the inventiveness of the creatures and the downright spooky way they appear. The sound effects help enormously to back up the green-glowing ghosts, pirates, skeletons... The voice actors helped the characters become household names, especially the infinitely-hungry hippy slacker, Shaggy.

The animation style was far more limited than the Looney Toons and Disney cartoons which were made with far more money, intended for the cinema. Hanna-Barbera's animation was on a TV budget, which meant plenty of action happens offscreen (with hilarious sound effects) and most action is left-to-right walking or running. But the background art and 'beauty shots' - establishing shots of spooky mansions - are darkly beautiful, for fans of year-round Halloween.

This boxset is a far better idea than getting the four-to-a-disc individual DVD releases.",1261699200,4,1433,5.271929824561403

They cleaned up the ""fuzziness' that *may* have been in the original but the colors are true.  It is also great for the 3 year old before bed, as the episodes are only 15 minutes, so you are not stuck arguing about watching a 90 minute movie.

1988410,5,B0001CNQVM,"I've always loved the original Scooby Doo cartoons.  The first season (1969) and the second season (1970) were by far the best Scooby Doo mysteries ever.  Things started to go downhill when they started to include Scooby Dum and Scrappy Doo, etc. in later years.  The first two seasons are the best.  I used to watch Scooby Doo and other cartoons every Saturday morning before going to my junior bowling league.  Then I'd come home in time to watch The Pro Bowlers Tour on ABC at 3:30, then ABC's Wide World Of Sports at 5:00.  Those were the days when TV had good shows and good cartoons, such as Scooby Doo.  The stuff of today is plain sick and lame garbage compared to the shows of yesteryear.

These DVDs will entertain longtime fans and newcomers alike.  You can't go wrong with a cartoon that features humor, a mystery to solve and crooks dressed as spooks who try to scare their way to a fortune where the setting is often a haunted house.  I love Halloween, so this show has always been right up my alley.  I think Shaggy and Scooby are at their best in these two seasons as far as humor goes.  Every episode has them clowning around in some way.  I like the ever-shifting trajectory of these episodes.  There's a scary moment, then there's a light and hilarious moment.  It's a good mix of humor and haunts.

You get all 25 episodes in this set.  My personal favorites are Spooky Space Kook, Hassle In The Castle, Bedlam In The Big Top, Mine Your Own Business, A Gaggle Of Galloping Ghosts, A Night Of Fright Is No Delight, That's Snow Ghost, and Who's Afraid Of The Big Bad Werewolf?

Scooby Doo Where Are You? is an all-time classic cartoon and far better than anything out there today.  Your kids will love it.  This stuff is 40 years old and has stood the test of time, so I highly recommend it!",1249603200,,1809,4.40785498489426

One episode before bedtime quickly became part of our nighttime regimen.  However, we're a busy family and we were always missing our beloved time slot.  I don't watch enough TV to merit buying a stupid DVR, so the quest for a decent DVD set began.  There are a few different versions of the original series (1969-1970) available, but I found this one to be the best of the bunch.  With no inexplicable and wholly annoying run-ins with Don Knotts or Dick Van Dyke, and no Scrappy Doo to endure- these episodes represent the ""golden age"" of the series as far as my son and I are concerned.  Furthermore, the picture quality is also very good, and the powerful, mono soundtrack is bearable through home theater speakers.  Incidentally, the live action Scooby Doo film does, in fact, acknowledge that Scrappy Doo was a complete stroke and an emotional drain on the entire Mystery Inc. franchise!",1247356800,3,1057,4.806629834254144

1988424,5,B0001CNQVM,"There are a number of reason why I think Scooby Doo is a great series for young children (and I'm referring to the original series, not the movies):

1.  There is always a rational explaination for things.  Ghosts and witches etc are not ""real"".

2.  No one ever physically harms anyone else.

3.  The predictability of the storylines, while admittedly not a great thing for adults, is great for kids for developing literacy skills (anticipating what comes next etc.)

1988579,3,B0001CNQVM,"Like oodles of other GenXers now entering middle age, I spent a half-hour or hour of my 1970s Saturday mornings watching the gang roll around in a cool-looking van; run into a mystery involving an inexplicable monster of local legend; do the 3-2 split of Fred, Velma, Danger Prone Daphne and Shaggy and Scooby; have Shag and Scoob looking for food when they weren't running scared; watch Fred and Velma, the two brains in the outfit, solve the mystery and somehow trap and unmask the monster.

It was a hunk of my youth and I'll still make jokes about Scooby snacks, Shaggy's apparent munchies, Fred's questionable sexual orientation and loved that the bunch saving the world on Buffy the Vampire Slayer called themselves ""The Scooby Gang."" And watching these episodes does take me back to those Saturday mornings.

But doing so after watching the recent ""What's New, Scooby Doo"" episodes on Boomerang (8:30 p.m. Eastern) shows up how weak they really are.

And, as another reviewer noted, the extras are bupkiss. For me, great extras are what separates a true DVD from just being ""VHS on disc."" I want background on the creation of the character, certain episodes and how the creators felt about working with what quickly became a pop culture icon. None of that here. In fact, these extras are the worst of any Hanna-Barbera set I have and I'm not necessarily crazy about the extras on any of the other sets.

Back to the actual episodes. I bought this set because the Boomerang episodes got my daughter hooked on Scooby Doo and I needed Scooby eps available on demand. As I watched these, I realized that the newer episodes showed up the deficiencies of the original in animation, plotting and dialogue.
Stiff animation you could forgive, as the era's technology and television budgets forced Hanna-Barbera into limited animation and they did the best they could with it. But  the plotting was repetitive, the characters two-dimensional and the dialogue stiff with wit that would just get by in a suburban schoolyard (it's almost painful to watch an early Scooby Doo after watching a Yogi Bear, Huck Hound or Quick Draw McGraw cartoon. Maybe because those old Warner writers, Mike Maltese and Warren Foster, didn't do Scoob's adventures).

This DVD set is worth the money to me only because it lets me satisfy requests for ""Scooby Doooo!"" from my two-year-old daughter. For show quality, however, I'd advise setting the TiVo for channel No. 297 on the dish, 8:30 p.m. Eastern time.",1182556800,5,2483,4.872037914691943

1988620,5,B0001CNQVM,"This is some of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's finest work, and in my opinion is the best of the Scooby Doo series. The stories are well written and directed and Ted Nichols suspenseful and creepy underscore blends in to make each episode really wonderful and exciting. Another thing that I also like is that in these episodes it was not really ghosts, phantoms, etc., but people behind the whole thing; which is logical and makes really good sense.
While I love all of the episodes in this collection, my favourites are: ""Hassle In The Castle, A Clue For Scooby Doo, Which Witch Is Witch?, Spooky Space Kook, A Night Of Fright Is No Delight and A Tiki Scare Is No Fair.""
The only complaint that I have is that Warner Brothers should have really restored these episodes and the audio should at least be in 2.0, not 1.0.
However, the transfers and the audio are good and the colors are vivid and bright; which are excellent considering the time and the age (1969-1970) of the original prints; and there are also some special features as well.
If you are a fan of the series, buy it! You won't regret it! I am well-pleased with this collection!",1171324800,3,1146,4.541062801932367

1988653,5,B0001CNQVM,"I'm the last person you would expect to be a Scooby Doo fan (I'm a college-age kid), but as a young kid, I always used to see re-runs of this show as I was getting ready for school.  Scooby Doo, Where Are You! was such a fun show that it still stands out in my mind today.  Sure, it was a bit predictable, but the show was priceless on so many levels.  There have been so many offshoots and knockoffs over the years, but I think none of them can compare with the original series.  This is Scooby Doo at its highest level of quality.

I had to get my hands on this DVD set since it's pretty rare to see the show on TV anymore.  I pop a disc in every once in a while either for the sake of nostalgia or to just enjoy the innocent humor, which is a nice alternative to the sub-par television shows of today.  Scooby Doo brings out my inner child, which would have been long lost if it wasn't for Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

This is definitely the best place to start building your Scooby Doo collection.  Just about all the episodes of the first two seasons are classics that cannot be beat.",1168560000,3,1085,4.15311004784689

My daughter loves to recite the lines and knows all of the episodes.  The best part is not having to press buttons to start a new show every time one ends.  I let it play and she watches it on and off for hours.  My favorite part is that she is not the best sleeper and that sometimes she falls asleep watching and will stay sleeping as long as the discs are playing.

Generation X grew up watching this tripe (along with Superfriends), and they continually obsess about it to this day on how bad it is.  They have yet to admit that it destroyed their young minds with its mediocrity.  The series is ridiculously redundant, tiresome, and about as interesting as a rice cake.

1988724,4,B0001CNQVM,"HALLELUJAH! SCOOBY, in its original 1969 form, STILL LIVES!!! Here, there's NO guest stars with sloppy animation, NO Scooby cousins, NO Dynomutt, NO Laffolympics, and definitely NO Scrappy-Doo (that little runt deserves to be muzzled, since he's always giving Scooby and Shaggy a hard time!) and NO live-action movies (which were nothing but total no-brainers!).

Okay, I admit it: I guess I'm what you would call one of those *purist* Scooby fans, but what else can I (and others who agree with me) say?  The 1969 classic NEVER came without a hitch: the style of animation was pretty flawless, if not top notch; and it's always fun to watch how the gang gets serious and down-to-to-earth while being wacky and cornball all at the same time. In short, since this was a real crowd-pleaser, the H-B guys really knew how to keep it consistent on both levels.  This is a rarity you see missing from most of today's cartoons/kids' shows.

Having had my say about how *great* a cartoon classic the 1969 series was, I do have a major beef about the DVD here:  since Scooby made its debut 35 years ago, it's become a pop culture phenomenom (which isn't bad, don't get me wrong); it's just that the bonus features here don't do this DVD not one bit of justice, which happens to be bogus.  I mean, there's no behind-the scenes info, no audio commentaries, no interviews with the original voice cast, absolutely NOTHING to make the Scooby legacy more meaningful to both Scooby and non-Scooby fans alike, let alone to cartoon and non-cartoon fans.  Instead, we see one feature showing fans' collections of Scooby memorabilia. (One of those fans is the new voice of Scooby and Shaggy, in which he can't even do a dead-on impersonation of neither one of them; he sounds more obnoxious than amusing.) We also get to see other pointless features, such as fans recalling their fave eps., and a ""how to"" draw the Scooby gang.
Why couldn't they have done something like a Scooby's ""video jukebox"" of chase songs or a ""pop-up video"" in which there's captions showing up detailing the background or humor of the gang, or with its pop culture references of the time?  For example, how many people know when Velma goes ""Verrry intereshting!"" in one episode, that she's playfully quoting Arte Johnson's German soldier from the late 60s/early 70s TV variety show ""Laugh-In""?  Or about Casey Kasem(original voice of Shaggy), what drew him (pardon the expression) to cartoon voiceover work? Was it because of the catchy chase songs in this and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (in which he also played Alexander), since he also happens to be a famous radio disc jockey?

Okay, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be spilling secrets here that haven't been disclosed, but the bottom line here is that the DVD bonuses here could do a MUCH better job to the Scooby legacy.

Also, one last complaint, Hanna-Barbera/Warner Bros.: you have almost every H-B cartoon of the 60s (whether it's this, Flintstones, or Yogi Bear) out on DVD. Just when are we going to get to see the Banana Splits soon (and not just on Boomerang in the wee hours of the morning)?  Even if this has nothing to do with Scooby (though they aired neck-to neck between 1968-70 or 1969-71), at least they are a vital part of the H-B legacy.

There. I've said it.  All in all, Scooby IS one of the BEST classic cartoons around along with other Hanna-Babera faves (Flintstones, Josie and the Pussycats, or Jabberjaw) and non-HB faves (Looney Tunes, Schoolhouse Rock, and Fat Albert).  Of course, if you think the lack of DVD extras doesn't make a bit of difference, fine.  I guess there are those of us (including myself) who can still enjoy it, though. Just what are today's kids (under 25) supposed to think?",1140566400,4,3729,4.731481481481482
1988725,5,B0001CNQVM,"Notice I included 'television' in the title because Looney Tunes are the greatest cartoons EVER, but they were created for movie theaters (and they were NOT intended as entertainment for kids). The greatest television cartoon of all time for ME is Dungeons & Dragons, because it had great continuity storylines and slightly more mature themes than Scooby Doo. D&D is not available on DVD yet, but when it is finally released, you might want to check it out. Now, on to Scooby.
  First and foremost, the biggest complaint I have seen from people is the artwork/animation quality. Scooby utilized cheap animation, with a minimum of frames per second and camera zooms/tricks to keep animation costs down. Hanna-Barbara was known for its pathetically cheap animation, and Scooby Doo is no different from other Hanna-Barbara shows in that respect. The animation does not detract from the show, however, because it is part of the charm of Scooby. It is a simple cartoon, art & storywise, from a simpler time. It should be noted that Japanese anime shows which came later (like Voltron & Pokemon)have MUCH worse animation, since they take the 'lack of animated movement and camera tricks to save money' technique to a RIDICULOUS degree. In comparison, Scooby doesn't look all that bad.
  The second complaint I have seen from people about Scooby is the simple, repetitive storylines. Well, there are two things that need to be kept in mind here. These cartoons were created for young kids, of course they are going to be simple and 'cartoony'. Second, these were created before DVD's or even VCR's, they were never meant to be watched altogether. The creators knew that kids would catch an episode of Scooby a maximum of once a week (Saturday morning), and probably wouldn't be able to watch cartoons EVERY Saturday. So they created stand alone episodes with no continuing storylines, so you could watch ANY episode of Scooby and immediately be able to follow the story and the characters. In addition, the show formula worked, so why change the simple plot? They simply changed the monster Mystery Inc faced every week, and it worked beautifully.
  One interesting thing to note is that Scooby Doo didn't have a real 'first' episode. There was no real introduction to the characters or the circumstances of the show, it just jumps right in, just like every episode of Scooby Doo.
  Another note of interest is Casey Kasem. While it is common knowledge that Kasem voices Shaggy, you may not realize just how many other voices he does. Listen to the local sheriff, or the old farmer, or the security guard, etc. Kasem voices A LOT of these bit character types that appear in every Scooby episode. This is done of course to keep costs down by minimizing the number of actors required to voice an episode (a common practice in cartoon production).
  Unfortunately for Scooby, the creators didn't know a good thing when they had it. They kept tinkering with the formula (why fix it when it isn't broken?!) by teaming up Scooby with other cartoons for a ""power hour"" type of show (Dynomutt, Laff-O-Lympics), and creating new inferior characters like Scooby Dum and (shudder) SCRAPPY DOO. The creators also ditched Fred and Velma for a while, prefering Shag and Scoob with just Daphne. NOT a brilliant move.
  This DVD set represents the TRUE Scooby Doo cartoons, before any tinkering began. These are the only original episodes featuring the classic Mytery Inc lineup and only them. All future DVD releases (like the Scooby Doo movies and the Scooby/Dynomutt Hour) feature tinkered with, inferior product.
  Scooby Doo is a CLASSIC cartoon, for the likeable characters, the great simple concept, the scary (for little kids) monsters, great music (who DOESN'T remember at least one of the 5 or 6 musical themes used in the scenes?)and the comedy hijinx. If you grew up with Scooby like I did, you simply must watch this DVD set. It will bring back A LOT of fond memories.",1136764800,6,3958,4.888059701492537

Maybe it's because it brings back great childhood memories, but I think it also has to do with the fact this is simply one of those great, timeless shows.  In fact, the only thing out-of-style with this show is the clothes (what horrible fashion sense we had back then!!!).

For those of you who haven't seen this show, or don't remember it, Scooby Doo was a weekly program about a large, goofy dog (Scooby), and his teenage friends, who go around solving various mysteries - there's usually a ghost or ""monster"" involved, and they almost always find a greedy person behind the mystery.

Millions (dare I say billions?) of kids have grown-up watching Scooby-Doo and I was one of them. While these episodes from the 1960's and 1970's look and feel dated they are still perfectly acceptable and the overall fun of the show is not lessened.

The episodes are as follows.

Season 1
What a Night for a Knight (1969)
A Clue for Scooby Doo (1969)
Hassle in the Castle (1969)
Mine Your Own Business (1969)
Decoy for a Dognapper (1969)
What the Hex Going On? (1969)
Never Ape an Ape Man (1969)
Foul Play in Funland (1969)
The Backstage Rage (1969)
Bedlam in the Big Top (1969)

Scooby-Doo and a Mummy, Too (1969)
Which Witch Is Which? (1969)
Go Away Ghost Ship (1969)
Spooky Space Kook (1969)

Season 2
A Night of Fright Is No Delight (1970)
That's Snow Ghost (1970)
Nowhere to Hyde (1970)
Mystery Mask Mix-Up (1970)
Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright (1970)
Jeepers, It's the Creeper (1970)
Haunted House Hang-Up (1970)
A Tiki Scare Is No Fair (1970)
Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf? (1970)
Don't Fool with a Phantom (1970)

Season 2 is slightly better thanks to the inclusion of one really 70's Danny Janssen song per episode. They are actually quite pleasant, easy-listening songs and it gives the Season 2 episodes a higher nostalgic feel.

Of course all 25 episodes adhere to the strict formula the franchise would soon find it increasingly hard to break away from (and end-up resorting to self-parody instead). Each episode will see the gang going about their ordinary lives before getting involved in a monster mystery. The suspects will all be introduced within 5 minutes. The gang will try to trap the monster but Shaggy and Scooby will screw up and fall into the trap instead. Through sheer luck the monster will be caught and unmasked. The criminal motivations will either be revenge, smugglers dressed up to scare away intruders or townsfolks dressed up to attract tourists. It is very hard to come across a Scooby-Doo episode from any season that doesn't flow this way. But, to be honest, towards the end of the second season the writers did try very hard to put a new spin on things and keep it fresh.

What I like best about the old school Scooby animation is the rustic feel to the backgrounds and settings. The spookyness is painted on in deep purples and blues and makes for surprisingly atmospheric looking environments. While the slick modern nature of the What's New Scooby-Doo TV show is pleasing to the eye there's just something more and better about the old look.

Most of the classic Scooby villains are in here (most of them appearing in Scooby Doo 2) and I strongly suggest that all Scooby-Doo fans buy this box set if they don't have it already. The DVD actually contains some great extras including a cool featurette on Scooby collectors (I must admit I am beaten a zillion times over compared to these guys). Some extras are still fluff tho.

The episodes are presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally drawn, with Dolby Mono sound. The quality between them is fairly average with age only marring it occasionally. Still though, you must have!",1111536000,48,3291,4.681660899653979

1988762,5,B0001CNQVM,"Wow...the great thing about watching these first two seasons of Scooby Doo is the wonderful feeling of nostalgia you get with the fond memories of Saturday morning cartoons.  Remember that time of the 60's and 70's when Saturday mornings were all about cartoons on the three major networks from about 8am to noon?  I remember being so excited when each of the networks would premiere their new Satuday lineups usually on the Friday evening before all the new shows started.  Man those were the days.

And of course Scooby Doo was such a favorite from these earliest seasons to the Scooby Doo movies with guest stars like the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Don Knotts, Tim Conway, and so many others.  That Was SO cool.  This 4 DVD set gives you the 25 episodes from the first two seasons along with a host of DVD extras including new featurettes, Scooby fashions and more...Gosh it seems like yesterday when I was just 8 years old and watching these for the first time with all the great villians and mysterious places the gange visited.  Here are some of my favorite episodes:

""What a night for a Knight""  The episode that started it all!  The gang investigates a museum and a ghostly black Knight.

""Mine your Own Business""  The gang investigate a Ranch where the ghost of an old Miner is frightening the guests away.  Featuring the classic Miner 49er villian!

""Foul Play in Funland""  As the gang looks for clams on a beach, Daphne looks across the beach to the Funland amusement park. She comments about how spooky it looks as it is closed and if on cue, all the lights flick on and the rides begin to operate.  One of my all-time favorites!

""Bedlam in the Big Top""  Another all-time favorite featuring the ghostly clown who is haunting the circus and hypnotizing people with his ""coin of gold""

""Go Away Ghost Ship""  The Ghost of Redbeard is raiding ships and scooby and the Gange must solve the mystery as shag and Scooby are captured by the pirates.

""That's Snow Ghost""  Scooby-Doo and the gange travel to the  Wolf's End Lodge for a skiing trip where its proprietor, Mr. Greenway, warns them of a Snow Ghost who makes the ski trip a scare trip.

""Jeepers it's the Creeper"" - The gang finds an unconscious bank guard who has been robbed by the mysterious Creeper who has been robbing the bank for years.

""Don't fool with the Phantom"" - Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are upstaged by the sudden appearance of a glowing wax phantom during a TV appearance on The Johnny Sands Dance Game Show. After the phantom appears, the audience clears out, and the studio's safe is robbed and the station manager, Roger Stevens, taken hostage.

1988765,4,B0001CNQVM,"I was a kid who grew up in the mid-70s and loved many of the cartoons of the time (as well as those of the 60s). I was very happy to see them put out the first 2 seasons of Scooby Doo on DVD. These are, in my opinion, the best of the Scooby Doo cartoons. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do like the Scooby Doo Movies, as well as the Scooby Doo Show. I thought Scooby Doo went downhill after Scrappy Doo was added. I also like the new shows - What's New Scooby Doo and some of the movies like Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island.

Back to this set - the quality of the DVDs (picture and sound) is very good, a definite improvement over some of the earlier compilations such as Spookiest Tales and Creepiest Capers. My only qualm is the lack of special features. I would have liked some interviews with the great voice talent on the show, as well as some history (where the idea originated, etc.) I would definitely recommend this set to other Scooby Doo fans.",1091059200,3,956,4.195652173913044
1988766,5,B0001CNQVM,THIS DVD IS WAY COOL!IT HAS EVERY SINGLE FLIPPIN EPOSODE FROM THE FULL FIRST AND SECOND SEASON!I LOVE THIS DVD AND I RECCOMEND IT FOR EVERYONE!,1090886400,,143,4.538461538461538
1988767,5,B0001CNQVM,"For a 35 year old cartoon, Scooby is still going strong, so it was a shock that the only episodes that were being released were sporadic, selected episodes on such collections as ""Scooby Doo's Spookiest Tales"" or ""Scooby-Doo's Greatest Mysteries."" Until now.

 THis comprehensive DVD contains every episode from the first 2 seasons (1969-1970, 1970-1971)all beautifully restored and digitally remastered. When watching this DVD in comparison to ""Greatest Mysteries"" (which I also own on DVD) the difference in quality is astounding. Even when compared with the reruns on Cartoon Network, it is obvious that these were retouched. The colors are once again vibrant, but yet, not so vibrant that they would detract from the spooky effect of the show.

 There are 4 discs in the set, and the bonus featuers begin on the second disc. One has all the classics, such as character bios and trivia, but also a special treat on disc 2--a look into the private collections of Scooby collectors. One of the featured colllectors is SCott Innes (the voice of Scooby and Shaggy in the old direct-to-video movies) but for the most part, the people featured are averaga citizens.

 Does the show still work in the 21st century? By all means, yes. It is wonderful to see these episodes finally released on DVD, and perhaps the trend will continue ad we will see the pther seasons as well.

1988768,5,B0001CNQVM,"I grew up watching the old scooby doo cartoons, and well I could not have asked for a more satisfying set of them.  None of the cheezy spin offs that in my opinion ruined the series.  No scrappy doo, no guest apperances by people that I don't care to see on TV so why would I want to see them in cartoon form.
Just simply great, a classic that will always stay in my collection!",1089590400,2,378,4.026666666666666
1988769,5,B0001CNQVM,"There won't be much in this review that hasn't already been said.  I was eight when Scooby Doo first aired, and I've been hooked ever since.
With the advent of video recording twenty years ago, I started to record episodes as they were played by local television stations.  Unfortunately, the series was never run in its entirity (without mixing in the Scooby Doo Movies and the other spin offs, all of which were terrible).  I also taped commercials and there is the occasional severe weather watch and warning scrolling at the bottom of the screen.  But it was worth recording because I worked nights and there was nothing worth watching on tv when I got home.  Later, separate episodes came out as collections on video, but it was impossible to collect all the shows.
With this box set, all past problems are no more.  My kids enjoy these shows as much as I and they also prefer the originals to the other later series.  We now have something we can enjoy together.
I know the plots are all similar but to me it doesn't matter.  There is a charm about this series that cannot be matched.  There are other cartoons that I feel the same way about, Smurfs and SpongeBob are examples, but Scooby Doo is my original favorite and this box set captures the show as it was originally presented.",1087171200,,1289,4.545454545454546
1988770,5,B0001CNQVM,"This was perfect for my kids.  They love Scooby Doo and so do I, but I could do without scrappy and Scooby Dumb.  Thankfully, these episodes are all the originals - No scrappy or Dumb, and all the original voices.  Well worth the money.",1086393600,,236,4.318181818181818

this collection is not avaliable in Germany but you can look these dvd's if your ""german"" dvd-player is region-code free! So, BUY BUY BUY... never seen a good collection full with extras like that!
And like all the other series i love so much... friends, will and grace, sex and the city...
...the original in english is much more better than the synchronic versions from germany...
and all i wanna say to you...
SCOOBY DOO where are you?",1086307200,2,516,4.5
1988792,3,B0001CNQVM,"All things Scooby are big business now. The merchandise, the movies, the constant repeated showings on Boomerang, the video and DVD releases etc. Scooby is certainly deseving of all of this too which leads to the question - why have Warners short-changed him so much on this 'collector's edition' boxed set?
The notion of the Hanna Barbera classic shows getting released by season in boxed sets instead of random episodes being stuck on a disc is cause to celebrate (Scooby is joined by the Flintstones, Jetsons and Johnny Quest in this new marketing idea - with many more to follow, I'm sure) but a little more time should have been spent on the execution. The show itself is as brilliant as ever and requires no more said than that - the first 25 episodes transfered nicely to DVD. The problems begin as soon as you want to play the damn thing! The packaging, although nice to look at, is highly impractical with the sleeve being made of a thin (and brittle) plastic that doesn't seem to want to let go of the contents!
 Once you've managed to remove the discs then you can see how ironic the term 'SPECIAL features' is! The 'animated' menus are the same on every disc with nothing on the main menu to tell you which disc you have got in! Get the Picture and the music video are available on other Scooby DVD releases, The Scooby Doo Challenge is 6 questions of questionable accuracy, Street Smarts is a couple of minutes lazily filled with people saying who their favourite member of the gang is and Funky Fashion is just plain pathetic. The only glimmer of entertainment in these extras is the Ultimate Fan documentary which starts well but after a while ... well, when you've seen one middle-aged man showing you his collection of Scooby Doo dolls and games you've seen 'em all!
I don't wish to seem too negative about this title but I only look at it as what it could have been had Warners spent a bit more time and money on the extras particularly considering the hefty price tag attached to this item. Compared to the recent Looney Tunes boxed set this is a very lazy and shoddy offering. I hold my hopes high for volume two!",1084492800,5,2133,4.525906735751295
1988793,5,B0001CNQVM,"Scooby Doo, Where Are You? four disc DVD set is totally awesome. I've only watched one episode so far, but the picture and sound quality is excellent. I checked out some of the special features, and they're very cool. I just wish they could've come out with this DVD much sooner than it did. Oh well. They did do a good job making them, so I guess it was worth the wait. So, if you're a fan of Scooby Doo, or if you want to be able to watch a television show from the late 60s and early 70s, then I really suggest that you grab a burger and some fries and buy this DVD. Trust me, you won't regret it!",1083024000,3,600,3.9669421487603307
1988794,4,B0001CNQVM,"I've never been a huge fan of Scooby-Doo...except for this series...the ORIGINAL series. You'll find NO Scooby-Dum, NO Scrappy-Doo...NO crappy celebrities. This DVD collection should have been called ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You! The Complete Series"" because after these ran on CBS Scooby and the gang spun-off into ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" in 1972 and the many other equally bad series that followed. In this collection you get all 25 original ""Where Are You"" episodes. The bonus features are a complete waste of time...it would have been nice to have interviews with Frank Welker and Casey Kasem and maybe a gallery of sketches and storyboards. The bonuses are more to entertain the children viewing these DVDs (but isn't that what the show is for?). It's because of the bad bonus features that I'm giving this collection only 4 stars. The bonuses on The Flintstones were much better. All in all, it's a great collection and I recommend it. It's like a trip back into time...when you couldn't seem to wake up for school everyday...but you were wide awake every Saturday morning to see what tricks Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera had up their sleeves.

 *Scooby has been around since 1969.
 *My small cousins LOVE Scooby.
 *I still laugh at all the corny jokes.
 *Its clean simple fun.
Yes, the coloring and writing may not be that good. But for people to STILL love the old Scooby shows speaks loudly. These shows are classics. I am very happy to have this on dvd, FINALLY.",1080000000,,380,4.236111111111111
1988796,5,B0001CNQVM,"Finally! A truly remarkable classic in american animation has finally been released. Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? has finally been released in its classic glory, the original classic that started it all.
This series still continues to be aired to this day showing the complete fanaticism that fans of this series continue to enjoy to this very day. Like The Flintstones, this is one classic DVD set that most of us have been waiting for and with other classics on the was as well, we're about to be handed the entire Hanna-Barbera library to boot.
While there are only 25 episodes in this set, the extra features don't really matter since it's more than worth the money for the episodes themselves and having them on DVD. The set also comes with a free ticket to see the Scooby-Doo 2 movie that premieres next weekend. This is definately the Must-Have DVD set that you have to pick up.
It's also the perfect family entertainment package for parents who are too concerned with too much violence on the television set.
What even nice about this set is that it wasn't until season two when the animators started adding the songs whenever the gang was being chansed by monsters and ghouls. During the first season, all we heard was classical musical scores. It's a nice family gift and showcases the best in family entertainment.",1079827200,2,1323,4.756521739130434
1988797,4,B0001CNQVM,"Inspired by such diverse material as radio's ""I Love a Mystery"" and television's ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,"" the cartoon series SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU was a smash hit for CBS--and when I was a kid Saturday morning was sure to find me tuned in.  Now that the series has been released to DVD, I can indulge in a fit of childhood nostalgia whenever the mood strikes!

In some respects this is a ""best possible"" DVD release.  With no fewer than four DVDs, it includes all twenty five episodes of the original series--stopping mercifully short of the horrific modification of the original concept into ill-advised spin-offs with tiresome ""celebrity"" guest stars and down-right awful new characters like Scrappy-Doo and Scooby-Dumm.  The original shows have been cleaned up, and although time has taken a toll (some look washed out and there are quite a few artifacts) short of a digital restoration this is probably as good as it gets.
Even so, this pricey set falls down tremendously in the bonuses. I don't normally complain about a lack of extras--after all, you're buying the thing for the meat-and-potatoes show, and bonuses are so much gravy--but when you are shelling out some fairly big bucks for a four DVD set you tend to expect something in the way of added value.  And it just isn't there.  No audio tracks, no ""making of"" documentary, no interviews.  Instead, the DVDs offer a little trivia game, a look at the collections of three fans, and some ""man in the street"" type interviews--none of which are particularly worth watching.

Given the sometimes ify picture and sound of the episodes, a total lack of interesting extras, and a rather up-town price for the whole thing, I have to drop my rating from five to four stars.  Still, if you remember those Scooby snacks as fondly as I do, you're likely to this package set the easiest (and most cost effective) way of acquiring the original shows.  Recommended for those of us who never quite grew up!

1988798,5,B0001CNQVM,"This is the real deal, finally done the right way.  All 25 episodes from the original Scooby incarnation are here.  What's most impressive about the set is the quality of the transfers.  Never mind what the previous reviewer is referring to.  I've seen numerous prints over the years of these episodes and WHV did a brilliant job!  Of course, you'll have some imperfections since the series is 35 years old, but the picture quality is far superior to anything you'll see on Cartoon Network.  The extras on the set are generally a waste of time, but rest assured the package was put together very well and should be in your DVD collection if you have a family or like vintage toons.",1079568000,2,681,4.586776859504132

I guess I should have spent a fortune for digital seasons.  Kids (small) may not notice or care that the quality is horrible....but if you are an adult, it will drive you nuts. Example----everytime there is movement...there are jagged lines, including in Scooby's eyes when he blinks.  There's no way to fix it.  It won't matter what device you use to play these in so don't make yourself crazy like I did trying your pc and different dvd players....these are just bad quality period.
