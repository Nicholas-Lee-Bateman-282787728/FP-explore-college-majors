8764055,5,B01GWDGOKI,"In my current quest to catch-up on missed TV/film gems, of the last 15+ years, I have been thrilled to discover many great examples of past missed opportunities--THIS IS-such an example. It is very puzzling to note, that I am the first on US Amazon, to bring notice of this exceptional creation. According to the DVD cover--the production values of the combined  BBC and BBC America was such that, in the States at least, it was felt appropriate to release 'The State within'' for cinema viewing. The shock and awe of the opening 10 minutes makes clear those claims are fully justified. I won't elaborate but given that the events of '9/11' were still very much in the minds of people , when this 'film' was released, the realism was an instant shock. Wonderfully crafted scripts, with top notch actors ,well up to the challenge of making the viewer instantly forgetting their persona--and believing their character's for what they were. ( or appeared to be). Set in the British Embassy (Washington USA) the newly appointed ambassador is immediately caught up in a major international crisis.  Like all good dramas--the viewer is lead a merry dance ,when trying to decipher who really are the villains--and heros. As the title clearly suggests, the main thrust of the story is one of insider politics. leading to Big business led corruption in high places, with serious international repercussions. So the stakes are very big, with a tension to match.",1488844800,,1451,4.918367346938775
