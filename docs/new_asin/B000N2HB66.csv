8528352,1,B000N2HB66,"I'm a big fan of Whose Line.  I've been to a improv comedy club before which is where this takes place.  The quality of acting & comedy didn't match what I've seen from Whose Line.  There were a couple skits that were funny but there were some that just couldn't get off the ground.  The family could have done without the swimsuit model commerical that was in the middle of the dvd.  These are the reasons for the low rating.

The chapters in the dvd were placed at regular time intervals not at the start of each skit.",1231804800,,520,4.255102040816326
