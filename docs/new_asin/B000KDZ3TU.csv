SYNOPSIS--
Ella Peterson (Holliday) is a nosy answering service operator who gets involved in her clients' personal lives. She uses a different identity and voice when speaking with each and offers them unsolicited advice.

Ella knows that playwright Jeff Moss (Martin) has writer's block and sleeps away his days. She goes to his apartment as ""Melisande Scott"" and motivates Jeff to begin his new play ""The Midas Touch."" A romance results. Another service client is an actor (Gorshin) who can't get work because of his shabby wardrobe. Ella dons a beatnik disguise and convinces this Brando soundalike to buy a suit. She also helps a would-be songwriter dentist to compose a hit tune.

Ella's cousin Sue (Stapleton) owns ""Susanswerphone."" She's unaware that her charming European boyfriend Otto (Foy) is running a bookie operation right out of her own office. Two gangsters come looking for Otto when Ella accidentally botches some large bets that she thinks are record orders.

Miss Holliday is outstanding here, Dino is handsome and charming, Stapleton plays her character straight and Gorshin's Brando imitation is spot-on. Watch for Hal Linden (aka ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Miller/dp/B00008EY6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney Miller</a>"")  and chorines singing ""The Midas Touch.""
