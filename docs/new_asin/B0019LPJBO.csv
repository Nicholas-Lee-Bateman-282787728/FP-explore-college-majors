Normally, during the course of a film, I would pause the movie and refill my wine glass before I continued on with the video. In this case, I only paused it to catch up on the subtitle so I could follow the story.
*The story revolves around a man named Elias who has a supernatural ability to hear all the sounds around him. As an example, a drop of water in a pool of water is deafening to him. He could also recognize each voice in a crowd of people and know who was approaching him by the sound of the footstep.
*Elias is a musical prodigy whose talent exceeded that of his music teacher. He was also picked on by his superstitious peers because he was considered a product of the devil. His only friend was Peter who had a homosexual longing for him. But Peter had to compete with his sister Elsbeth in a love-triangle for Elias. Throughout the entire film, I had a difficult time trying to figure out if Elias loved music more than passion for another person.
*During the course of the movie, the viewer will learn why love never sleeps. The story is very fascinating and ends on a sorrowful note. I highly recommend purchase of this video because you will watch it repeatedly.",1223769600,,1261,4.3931623931623935
