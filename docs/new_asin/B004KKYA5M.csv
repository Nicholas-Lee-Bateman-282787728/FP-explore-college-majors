8433060,5,B004KKYA5M,"I loved watching this documentary about a balloon artist, Addi Somekh, going around the world to bring balloon art to the masses.  People from all corners of the earth and every walk of life loved his balloon hats and art.  It is a touching and beautiful document of his attempt to bring out the inner child and wonder in everyone who received his hats.  I love this balloon artist and this documentary deeply touched me at times.  It is a must see.",1401840000,,449,4.439024390243903
8433061,4,B004KKYA5M,"Balloonhat takes you on a creative experimental journey. The main duo travels from the Amazon, Jerusalem & the West Bank, to New Orleans & San Fran., twisting beautiful & elaborate hats & documenting laughter & challenges along the way. Great music throughout and strong main characters (Addi of the TLC show The Unpoppables, and Charlie, a NYC photographer). All very offbeat - but universal at the same time. I found this first feature doc. by a talented director really likeable.",1303776000,,482,5.0375
