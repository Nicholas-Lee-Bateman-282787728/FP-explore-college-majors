8252240,5,B0013N120A,"After years of buying belly dance instructional vides and workout videos, ""Tribal Cardio Belly Dance vol. 2 "" was a welcomed addition to my collection.

I'm kind of a production snob, so the most striking feature, instantly, was the video quality.  Good lighting, a clean studio, and a clear voiceover allows for no distractions. Robin provides an easy to follow voice over though out the workout.  The camera comes from an angle in the back so you can follow the dancers from the back and also see how the moves look from the front through the angled wall mirror.

The moves are non-threatening for a beginning dancer, yet will still hold the interest of an intermediate dancer.  Moves are repeated throughout the video.  The moves are simple, yet because they're repeated and continuous, the workout becomes cardio.

Robin's Tribal Fusion is a nice mlange. Some moves, like the salsa, are familiar and fun, and other moves like shimmies and hip drops are definitely traditional belly dancing moves. One of my favorites is the ""flamenco."" Just keep following and you'll get it.  Things really start heating up with TM Egyptians.

I've bought belly dance instructional/work out CD's where it felt like everyone doing the video (as in the models/dancers) knew how to do the steps but me.  I hate when I have to shut off a video in frustration, but this is not a video where you will feel left in the dust while dancers show off their egos.  With this video, I was able to follow along with all of the moves and improve each time I did it.

There are a few bonus features in end, and it's pretty exciting when after doing the video a few times, you can perform with the dancers.
In short: A visually appealing set, sexy and accessible moves, diverse tribal fusion costumes, and dancers at mixed levels make this video a must buy.  It's also a bonus to see real women dancing.",1264896000,5,1873,4.656534954407295

8252242,5,B0013N120A,"This is an excellent tribal belly work-out DVD<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Tribal-Belly-Dance-Volume-2/dp/B0013N120A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio-Tribal Belly Dance, Volume 2</a>! I just got it and started dancing right away. I'm a beginner but was dancing, shaking, and breaking a sweat from the push of play. The combos are really fun and layered well offering beginners to experienced dancers steps to work on. The instructions are clear and don't interfere with keeping the work-out moving. This is an excellent way to work-out while having fun!",1203120000,6,602,6.632911392405063
