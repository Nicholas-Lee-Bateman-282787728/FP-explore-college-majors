7982516,5,B00008G2ZZ,"I received this tape promptly and it was in great shape, in fact brand new!  There are several companies that produced The Firm video tapes and DVD's.  I find BMG made the best quality ones.  I owned this tape before, but somehow lost it, so was pleased to be able to buy it by itself as I have the ""Hare"".  I'd also like to say that I have a 47"" flat panel TV, and much prefer to watch these exercise videos in their original form on VHS, as the DVD reproductions make all the instructors and students look fat, and that's not what I'm aiming for.",1405900800,,548,4.1415094339622645
