1353853,3,B00004U409,"Threads (Mick Jackson, 1984)

It is probably not a coincidence that Richard Jackson (Tuesdays with Morrie)'s meditation on the aftereffects of nuclear war was the last major made-for-TV picture in the genre. This, especially in 1984, would be pretty hard to top. Definitely not a case of ""seen one nuclear war movie, seen 'em all.""

It is quite similar to others in some respects, though. The first half of the movie is spent building up an ensemble cast of your basic john q. publics for the viewers to get sentimental over. In general it works, because the faces (then, anyway) were less instantly recognizable to most than the casts of The Day After or Testament; they really could pass, for the most part, as your average everyday Briton rather than folks whose trailers cost more than your house. There isn't a main character to the film per se, but the events seem to focus more than most around Ruth (Karen Meagher, recently in Carrie's War and A Good Thief), whose main worries in life revolve around her boyfriend. You know, typical everyday stuff. And, of course, the news broadcasts in the backgrounds of most of the scenes increase in frenzy as the film progresses. First half, though, is Just Another Nuclear War Movie(TM).

Then (you can't really call this a spoiler) the bombs hit, and everything changes. It's this bit, and selected scenes afterwards, that make Threads such a memorable experience (and one that many still have nightmares about, even if they've never seen it after its first broadcast on BBC2 twenty years ago). To say that the images during and just after the war pushed the envelope of televised graphic violence would be understating the case by a country mile. Folks who don't go to R-rated movies because of the violence probably still haven't seen anything else of the likes of this to this day. It's still the outer boundaries of what one can get away with on television, mostly because no one hasn't even tried. The viewer is inundated with about ten minutes, give or take, of nonstop over-the-edge brutality. Jackson and scriptwriter Barry Hines (The Gamekeepr, A Kestrel for a Knave, et al.) obviously wanted to make sure you got the message. (One wonders how recently Steven Spielberg had seen this before he made Saving Private Ryan.)

But that's not the really hard part. Hold on to your seats, folks, because it gets worse.

The bombs dropping change the movie from an episode of Coronation Street into a faux documentary, complete with droning narrator (Waking Ned Devine's Paul Vaughn), charting humanity's fate in the months and years after the war. More disturbing than the outright violence is the chaos that reigns afterwards. A scene set in a makeshift surgery is quite literally painful to watch, while the establishment of martial law should do a fine job in inciting the viewer to a murderous rage. (In counterpoint, perhaps, to the amusing scenes of anti-nuclear protestors in the first half of the film; one wonders whether they were put there as part of the scenery, as a way to more blatantly convey the script's anti-war sentiment, or as a kick in the pants to the anti-nuke movement. Any of the three is quite possible. There is no ambivalence about the martial law officers at the beginning, though. They might as well be wearing pig masks.)

But the real twist of the knife comes only a few minutes before the end of the film, in the scene that stuck with me, albeit in revised form, since the first and only (until now) time I saw them film, twenty years ago. It's a perfectly calculated scene (to name it would provide too many spoilers regarding the second half of the film) ten years after the war, and it sets the film's tone of perfect despair; humanity, according to Jackson and Hines, will forever be humanity. None of this Day After-style pulling together in the face of crisis. It's a perfect ending to a film that's good in parts, bad in others, but worth watching if you've never seen it. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the anti-war sentiment here is overkill, but Jackson and Hines do overkill in the right way; they still let the images tell the story, however hyperbolic that story may be.

1353857,5,B00004U409,"""Threads"" is a profoundly disturbing film of nuclear apocalypse that doesn't flinch from laying out the potential costs of the ultimate human stupidity. I was fortunate (I suppose) enough to see this British-made film on public television in the mid-1980's. Evidently, it has never been shown on television in the United States since.  I have never forgotten it.

The theme of the film is, of course, World War III: the run-up to hostilities, the immediate impact of a nuclear attack on a the city of Sheffield, England, and its immediate environs, the after-effects of nuclear devastation on the survivors, and what ""civilization"" remains after the exchange of thermonuclear pleasantries.

The film is drama/documentary. There are ""characters"" whose fates we follow while a male voice-over that is not overly intrusive or dramatic narrates wider events and their significance.  The casus belli is totally plausible (or was at the time): Iran is the focus of Soviet (remember those guys?)aggression. The rhetoric and the mobilization of military forces escalates and localized conflict begins.  Meanwhile, life goes on in Sheffield, a town roughly the size Seattle and 4th or 5th largest city in the UK. No small potatoes.  We're introduced to a young British couple who are expecting a baby and who are in the process of moving into a new apartment.  We also meet a family living in a council townhouse: a mum and a dad, a gran and a young boy. (I recollect that this family was the pregnant woman's parents, etc.) As the conflict in the Persian Gulf heats up, people in pubs and homes, including our pregnant couple and the family, are glued to their TVs.  Talking heads, ""live and on the scene,"" describe events that are spiraling out of control.  If you recall the Cuban Missile Crisis, you will probably also recall the ennervating sense of helplessness and doom that hung over everything as we faced down the Soviets.  This sense of helplessness is well-captured in ""Threads"" -- the world as we know it, frozen in the headlights of impending catastrophe.  We watch a nuclear detonation in the Persian Gulf ""live"" behind a TV reporter on a naval vessel.  After that, it's a quick slide into a wider conflict.  The Warsaw pact nukes a NATO military base near Sheffield, the mushroom cloud rising over a panicked populaton.  Soon it's Sheffield's turn, as the belligerents up the ante to include civilian populations.  Before the war is over, we're told by the voice-over, the UK will have absorbed 40 megatons, and more than 60% of the population will be dead or wishing they were.  The effects of the attack on Sheffield, and its inhabitants is graphic and unsparing.  The mum, the dad, the gran, the young boy, the husband, all perish from blast injuries, burns or radiation poisoning trapped in the wreckage of what little is left of the city. The pregnant woman survives (though clearly traumatized to her soul). Her baby is born in what's left of a barn (no Biblical reference intended, I'm sure), severely retarded from the effects of radiation.

Most of the ""science"" explaining the likely effects of nuclear blast, radiation, etc., comes through a calm, matter-of-factly delivered voice-over.  You get the point, but you're not beaten over the head with gratuitous data.

Fast forward. The woman and her child have joined a group of other survivors.  We see them hunched over crude farming implements, scraping the soild in a poisoned land, clothed in rags, bodies and eyes covered to prevent UV burns.  The ozone layer has been burned off.  We're informed that the population of the UK ten years after the war is equivalent to what it was in medieval times.  No one's coming to save them.  Who won the war? Does it matter? You're left to infer the fate of the rest of the world.

The only other film in this grim genre that even comes close to the impact of ""Threads"" is ""The War Game"" (another British docu-drama of a nuclear attack on London). Compared to ""Threads,"" ""On the Beach,"" ""Alas, Babylon,"" ""The Day After"" are like ""Gidget Goes Hawaiian."" Think the threat of a nuclear wipe out is gone? Don't bet on it and Tom Cruise won't emerge from the rubble to start a new world order.  If you can handle it, watch ""Threads."" Then commit yourself to peace.",1126656000,36,4270,4.84573002754821

1353865,5,B00004U409,"I was born the year The Day After was first shown on ABC network across the USA, and year before this film was shown on the BBC network across  Britain.  I vaguely remember seeing the news covering the fall of the Berlin Wall and the close of the Cold War in the early 1990's.  I saw some happy people in Germany and elsewhere, but didn't really get what all the excitement was about.  So, I can't say that I might understand at an emotional level what the impact of this film might be within the context of its release year, but I suppose I might have some useful perspective that is detached from the opinions about nuclear weapons/war of those days.  So here goes.

This film is of a docu-drama style that juxtaposes a human story arc (Jimmy and Ruth) through a nuclear war scenario with proposed statistics describing the effects of the nuclear war scenario.  I am a big fan of this choice, because it lends a lot of credence to the storyline portion by referencing from expert sources.  It is as if the movie is acting out a small part of a wider simulated scenario, and serves as a powerful warning with its combination of the cold, unfeeling worldwide stats backing up the raw human experiences.  I have only learned about the Cold War from history books, and I think this movie conveys that intangible feeling of living through those tense times that books cannot.

I am glad that this movie has found a proper release on Bluray and DVD available in the N. American region, because it has an important message that can apply to today's nuclear situation as well as our future.  I think the single most important part of this message would be the fearlessness with which the movie's creators approached the topic.  It appears that they held nothing back in the name of TV censors or public perception.  This is among the most brutally honest and unflinching stories about nuclear war, or any subject really, put to the screen.  This movie has some notoriety among those that have watched it that some warning is in order before viewing it for the first time.  I think any adult can certainly watch it, and should watch it, but do keep in mind that this can evoke far more horror than any standard gore movie.  Upon rewatching it following this digital purchase, I was certainly impacted all over again, but fortunately less so upon further viewing.  Still, the reality that we live in a world where enough weapons exist to unleash this movie's scenario looms large and is one of the primary reasons, in my opinion, for the heightened impact.  This nightmare could have been a reality.

There are some minor drawbacks to the film, in my opinion, but had little effect on the overall theme and emotional impact.  A couple characters disappear pretty noticeably through the movie with no character resolution, but then again, that might be a merciful thing for the audience, spared from a couple more grisly deaths within the family/friends circle of the primary characters.  Jimmy's friend/coworker shows up to help out Ruth for a brief few scenes in the month or so after the nuclear event and then disappears.  Some people have some criticism in reviews of the nuclear bomb effects, some being stock footage, but I found them to be adequate, especially when focusing on the blast/burn effects and destroyed walls that directly affect the characters.  Seeing a high-tech nuclear explosion on a city is one thing, but having the guts to show humans writhing in pain while engulfed in flames hits a decidedly different note.  I didn't find the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally scenes to be all that useful to the movie, because the rest of the movie certainly makes any points espoused by the rally, and the main characters have no interaction with the scenes other than just casually observing from the crowd.  Finally, I think a couple points of the movie are actually too optimistic.  It feels as though the movie held back a bit on its estimation of the nuclear winter's effect on human populations during that first year.  It seemed like a decent crop was still had that summer after the war in May.  Also, while the movie does boldly extend its scenario out to 13 years after the war, it leaves an ending that calls into question humanity's fate, rather than resolving it.  That being said, the ending is rather shocking and does leave an uneasy impression on humanity's reproduction odds going forward, at least in Britain.  It certainly had an impactful ending, though I think exploring the possibility of a mass extinction event with humans as one of the species on the list might have been an option.  Then again, the nuclear winter science was relatively new at that point, and we know more today with help of powerful analysis tools what the effects of firestorm debris injected into the stratosphere would entail.  Apparently, even a regional nuclear exchange far smaller than this proposed scenario could cause some serious agricultural / starvation problems for all parts of the world.  The movie wasn't bleak enough.  There I said it.

There are no problems on my end with the digital release, and I like Amazon's streaming player functions on a PC.  Subtitles were very helpful, and pretty amusing at a couple points.  The music at the end of those Protect and Survive public service announcements was subtitled as ""(ominous music)"".  Between that and one other quick scene, there isn't any other humor to be found, though.

All in all, this is an excellent movie that deserves far more recognition in the USA than its current underground or seemingly taboo status.  Our nation has a distinct responsibility to lead on this issue, and we ought to be equally as fearless and unflinching to understand the responsibility involved to reduce existential risks to our world.",1522886400,6,5796,4.768537074148297

1353871,4,B00004U409,"The two main countries facing off against one another in a potential nuclear war began with Russia and the United States. Since the Cold War began at the end of WWII, both had increased their nuclear capabilities to the consternation of everyone around the world. They never let loose their weapons, the concept of mutually assured destruction preventing them from doing so. But that didn't prevent people from worrying about it happening.

Those who protested in the 60s came of age and moved into TV and film production. With the election of Ronald Reagan the days of backing down to the Russians ended. His Presidency resulted in the end of the cold war and also in a series of movies using the threat of nuclear annihilation as a theme. Movies like THE DAY AFTER, TESTAMENT and SPECIAL BULLETIN all focused on the use of nuclear weapons. The movies all pack a powerful punch, even in todays world. And another film among these that did just that at the time it aired is THREADS.

Airing on BBC in 1984 the show received the highest ratings of viewership that week. It aired in the US on TBS in 1985. It followed by airing on stations around the world after. It is a film that has left its mark.

The movie unfolds in a combination of storytelling and documentary styled filmmaking. It follows two families in Sheffield in Northern England whose lives have come together with the upcoming birth of a child and wedding of their children. We see how their lives are prior to anything happening, everything from meeting the parents to finding an apartment to redoing the apartment before moving in. One is more upper class and the other working class.

As we learn about the young couple we also get glimpses of news stories on TV that seem to be on no matter where they are. The news is constantly focused on escalating tensions between Russia and the US over both countrys involvement in Iran. The US has helped with a coupe hoping to reinstate the Shah and the Russians have invaded the northern part of the country hoping to prevent this from happening.

The film gets more grisly as we approach the 50 minute mark. The confrontation between the two super powers reaches fever pitch and nuclear was is launched, one of the bombs landing in Sheffield because of the military airfield and manufacturing plants there. It isn't long before the effects begin starting with the shockwave that runs over everything, blowing out windows and decimating anyone still on the streets.

Those that sought shelter, including a storyline involving local wardens who were put in place to help once the war was over, survive the initial blast. But then the reality of what would happen kicks in. Shortages of food with no means to distribute it to survivors has people scrambling for things to eat. With hospitals gone the odds of medical help for the wounded are nearly depleted in minutes. As looting begins among the survivors some sense of order is attempted by what military remains.

The end result is a bleak world where little survives and those that do are subjected to everything one could imagine after such a war. Those things range from radiation poisoning to darkened skies in a cloud of radioactive dust. The sun blocked skies prevent food from growing to replace what was destroyed. And people finally band together in an attempt at rebuilding civilization.

The movie deals with the prospect of nuclear war in the most straightforward manner possible. There are no heroes waltzing in at the last moment to save the day. There are no top secret government bases that hold a select group of survivors intent on repopulating the world living in an environment meant to protect them. This is real. This is the cold hard facts. Ducking and covering will not protect nor save you.

As seen through the eyes of the two families we get a glimpse of what would happen. Those that die immediately are the fortunate ones. The survivors are relegated to a hell on earth that would make most wish they had been taken out in that initial blast. Most movies never consider the small things that we take for granted and even back in 1984 there were items we have now that weren't even around then.

Consider a world with no phones of any kind. No television or radio to listen to hear what happened. No running water to drink or to use to do something as simple as flush a toilet. No government run agency to see to it that dead bodies were collected and even if there were there would be no way to move them. Roads would be covered in demolished buildings or torn up altogether. No electricity means no lights and no refrigeration. All of these are touched on in this film.

While a part of me fears that watching this film will do little more than create another wave of socially conscious protesters with no clue on how the world works or offering suggestions as to a solution, another part of me hopes that some will watch this and consider the threat and possibly find solutions that will prevent this from happening. The bombs will never been completely gone and thinking that the other side will eliminate them all is nave at best and stupid at worst. The concept of mutually assured destruction remains the best deterrent to nuclear war there is.

But we live in a world of madman now. A world where a terrorist isn't concerned about his own safety and looks forward to being the one to hold the button down on the bomb as it explodes. A world where some despots think that no matter how infinitesimal they and their armies are they can threaten and use these kind of weapons without fear of retribution. With those people in mind movies like this should be considered.

Severin has done a solid job in presenting this movie. Not only are you given the chance to see it in its entirety the release has several extras as well. Those include an audio commentary track with director Mick Jackson moderated by film writer Kier-La Janisse and Severin Films David Gregory, AUDITION FOR THE APOCALYPSE an interview with actress Karen Meagher, SHOOTING THE ANNIHILATION an interview with director of photography Andrew Dunn, DESTRUCTION DESIGNER an interview with production designer Christopher Robilliard, and interview with film writer Stephen Thrower and the US trailer.

1353888,2,B00004U409,"I gave it 2 stars.  This 1984 production seems to have a political slant--Anti Reaganism--from the early 1980's.  It reminds me somewhat of a TV movie at that time with Jason Robards--with Reagan's mock voice in the background intoning his commitment to fight communism or whatever.  But in the case of this movie (perhaps England's clone of that American movie or vice versa) goes into predictable detail of what a nuclear exchange would look like on the ground for us ordinary folks.
  I was a young adult at that time.  I don't remember any popular notion among ordinary people that nuclear war was ""winnable"".  I remember the very opposite.  Ironically, the Soviet Union collapsed very shortly after Reagan left office.  No nuclear exchange occurred.
  The movie itself I think provides a horrific view of what happens after a nuclear exchange.  I don't think any rational person would disagree with their depiction of post exchange catastrophe.  The movie did an excellent job of showing that.
  So, in conclusion, the movie shows us what a nuclear exchange would look like.  Yes--or no--a nuclear war is not winnable (something we knew back then BTW;) it is the basis of the logic of ""mutually assured destruction"" (MAD) that played a big role, IMHO, of why the exchange never happened.
  I'm far more worried about terrorists using a nuclear device in a city.
  Maybe we can say that the film provided a service back in 1984 to show everyone (including politicians and decision makers) what would happen if anyone were insane enough to start a nuclear war.",1519862400,,1563,4.893129770992366

There are some bonus features: audio commentary, an interview with Karen Meagher who played Ruth, an interview with Andrew Dunn who was the director of photography, an interview with production designer Christopher Robilliard, and finally an interview with film writer Stephen Thrower.

1353900,5,B00004U409,"Threads was originally a BBC production first shown in 1984 in Britain and then some months later in the US.  I saw it in its US release and have never forgotten the gritty realism with which the run up to, outbreak, and aftermath of nuclear war are depicted.  Now that I've watched it again over thirty years later I can attest that it has lost none of its horror.

Threads opens in Sheffield, the fourth largest city in Britain, industrial and working class. A young engaged couple and their families are planning for the future while trying to ignore background reports of a mounting crisis in the Middle East.  Over the next few weeks the tension between the US and the Soviet Union intensifies, and the people of Sheffield grow more and more alarmed.  The city's mayor and other officials begin to plan for war, but when the bombs actually start to fall everything quickly collapses.  The bombing of Sheffield and its aftermath is shown in pitiless detail, including images of charred corpses and buildings swept away in flames.  Even those citizens who survived the initial explosions quickly fall victim to radiation sickness, starvation, and homelessness.  The story continues over the next weeks, months, and years as the after effects of the war unfold and the scattered survivors try to cope with the horrible new reality.  The final scenes take place over a decade later and underline the continuing horror.

Threads is a disturbing tale, but it served to hammer home the reality of nuclear war and its consequences when it was first shown.  After thirty years its impact is still strong and even more necessary than in the 1980s now that some public officials speak cavalierly of ""The Button.""",1518566400,17,1706,4.848275862068966

1353916,5,B00004U409,"Filmed by the BBC in 1984 at the height of the Cold War, 'Threads' was designed by producer Barry Hines to be an update of an earlier BBC fictional account of nuclear war called 'The War Game.'  The film is highly topical as only a year earlier the West and the Soviet Union had come close to nuclear war due a series of mistakes during the 'Able Archer' military exercise.

As other reviewers have noted, this simulation of a nuclear war and its aftermath is graphic and depressing.  The crisis begins when Soviet troops invade Iran and appear to prepare to make a move to seize the oil facilities in the Persian Gulf.  Finding this an unacceptable threat to their interests, the US and NATO send forces to counteract the invasion and issue an ultimatum for Russian forces to withdraw before military action will be taken.

The crisis quickly escalates and soon both sides engage in hostilities.  At home, the British government begins to take emergency management measures including closing airports, controlling stocks of food, and setting up local branches in the case of a nuclear war.  Hines depicts the series of events quite carefully based on his research into the British civil defence plans at the time.

The crisis reaches a critical point when hostilities begin in Europe and there is a short nuclear exchange between US and Russian forces in Iran.  Soon afterwards, Russia launches a massive surprise attack against Western targets in Europe using nuclear weapons, resulting in 210 megatons of nuclear weapons falling on the UK and killing and injuring millions.  The military exchange is followed soon after by a strategic nuclear exchange aimed at cities, power stations, and industrial centres amounting to 3000 megatons in total.

The aftermath is predictable - total catastrophe.  Society rapidly breaks down at all levels and about 90% of the population of the UK dies in the months and years after the attack.  Law and order disintegrates and is replaced by anarchy.  The government at all levels is completely destroyed.  The city at the heart of the documentary - Sheffield is bombed and completely ruined.  Agriculture is destroyed by a long nuclear winter, a damaged ozone layer, and lack of manpower, fertilizers and fuel.  All infrastructure such as roads, power lines, water, food distribution and housing are largely annihilated, leaving the survivors vulnerable to disease.  There is no medical help since most doctors and nurses are killed and hospitals destroyed.  Firestorms burn millions to death and millions more perish from radiation sickness.  There is no respite or rescue since all parties to the exchange suffer similar damage and the national government ceases to function.

At the heart of the tragic story are two characters - Ruth and her boyfriend, Jimmy Kemp, and their families.  The unfolding of their lives pre and post-crisis helps humanise the immensity and incomprehensibility of the destruction and disorder following an all-out nuclear war.  I won't go into detail about what happens since it is best seen by watching the film itself - but it is harrowing and heart-breaking.

Although the threat of a nuclear holocaust has receded, the film remains relevant today as nuclear proliferation continues and the US and Russia still have thousands of nuclear weapons aimed at each other, ready to launch in a matter of minutes.  It is not too hard to imagine the scenario in threads could happen one day between two third-world nations armed with nuclear weapons and driven by fanatical, irrational leaders bent on mutual destruction, with terrible consequences.  There is an anecdote that Ronald Regan, who described the Soviet Union as an 'Evil Empire', changed his heart on nuclear war after seeing the related American film 'The Day After.'  Threads should be compulsory viewing for anyone concerned about nuclear war, as well as any policy maker foolish enough to think nuclear weapons achieve any kind of social or political good.",1407024000,22,3986,5.07361963190184
1353917,5,B00004U409,"This film is shattering.  A most grueling experience emotionally -- so perfectly done.  It needs a proper release.  Acting, writing, direction -- never a false moment.  I forgot at times that I was watching a fictional account, which made it so much more terrrifying.  There are some amazing details which have remained with me:
** Michael, too young to know about the sexual facts of life, plays with a toy fighter plane and an electronic toy which depicts invaders from the skies.
** His sister Alison vanishes from the film after the attack, but we are reminded of her character when we see a burning bicycle in those massive piles of burning buildings.
** The charred remains of a baby held in its traumatized mother's arms.  The baby was burned to an almost unrecognizeable state, yet its clothes and blankets are intact.  This indicates that the poor mother actually dressed and swaddled the burned corpse of her child.
** Ruth aging at least fifty years in the final few years of her life.  Her pre-teen daughter doesn't have any emotion regarding her death and doesn't seem to be able to understand it.

** The brain and developmental damage of the second generation, clearly a result of radiation.
** My favorite irony occurs early in the film.  Ruth and Jimmy's parents are meeting for dinner to discuss the pregnancy. Ruth's mother wishes it could be a happy occasion.  Ruth declares that it is a happy one and that her mother is acting as though the pregnancy was ""the end of the world.""  That child would end up being the hope of the future after the end of the world. Ruth and Jimmy's child not only has speech and learning defects, physically she can't bear a living child.  It doesn't bode well for the world's future.",1401321600,19,1734,4.6644736842105265
1353918,1,B00004U409,"Before seeing this movie, I read so much about it. Raving reviews about how it's ""sooooo scary!"" and ""deeply disturbing"". When I finally watched it, I was sorely disappointed and exceedingly bored. I barely made it through the first half and won't give spoilers for the second half, which is a bit more profound and has some interesting content but is so poorly made it was tedious to finish the movie.

First of all, the war scenario in ""Threads"" was absurd and not believable to those with a knowledge of history as well as viewers old enough to remember current events during the first 4 years of the 1980s. The nuclear war starts out with a military clash between the superpowers of Iran. After the Islamic revolution of 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini officially declared both the US and the USSR as sworn enemies and Iran was a non-aligned nation. During the Iran-Iraq war, both superpowers supplied arms to Saddam Hussein's Iraq against Iran.  The scenario of ""The Day After"" was far more realistic and with declassified information from Stasi files, it almost happened! East Germany had actual plans to occupy West Berlin and invade West Germany(google ""Seven Days to the River Rhine"").

Worst of all, the nuclear attack scene in ""Threads"" was so fake it was puh-thet-ic. The explosions were SILENT, showed no scorching effects from the heat of the blasts, no lighting up the sky, and the mushroom clouds were film clips from nuclear tests in the 50s and 60s after the fire had turned into smoke.

The following scenes looked far more convincing but were hard to believe in terms of causality after viewing the actual nuclear attack as depicted in the movie. It drags on for quite a while but the movie does little to show the extreme lethality of radiation over such a small area as the Island of Britain.

If you want an idea of what a nuclear attack on a major city would ACTUALLY look like, see ""The Day After""(which is pretty much the gold standard for nuclear war films). If you want to see how people in remote areas would try to handle a nuclear war that does not involve any depiction of nuclear explosions and isn't graphic, watch ""Testament"".",1398643200,5,2154,4.718085106382978

One reason I saw it is because Walter M. Miller, Jr. the author of the post-nuclear holocaust novel A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ (one of my favorite novels) and co-editor of the post-nuclear anthology BEYOND ARMAGEDDON liked this movie.  I even wonder if I should be reviewing this film after so many years but I will.
  The film is about how the city of Sheffield, England survives a nuclear war. Not very well.  It's done in a semidocumentary style which makes it even more chilling.  I still remember the scene where the bomb does explode and the reactions of the various people who see it.  Seeing society crumble and the world being thrown into a new dark age is scary as hell.  The final scenes of the film are showing life a decade and a half after the nuclear strike still give me shivers.  This is probably the most grim and sobering film I have ever seen.

1353922,5,B00004U409,"Threads was a BBC production back in the mid-eighties, back then the fear of a nuclear war was a real possibility and this film showed the likely effects of a nuclear strike on Sheffield, an industrial city in the north of England. As can be expected from the subject matter it is a grim film, made more poignant by the hopeful beginning against a backdrop of impending war between the two superpowers of the time.

The story follows a young couple, planning their marriage and preparing for their first child when the war starts and a nuclear bomb is dropped on the city. It's told in a documentary style that informs the viewer at each stage of the terrible events that occur. It also provides the wider context in which the more personal struggle is set against.

It's a bleak film that just keeps getting worse and remains a difficult film to watch. In some ways it has aged, the lack of special effects being the most notable, but the film does make effective use with what it has. These days the attack sequence would be a CG masterpiece. Here it is some clever lighting tricks and some very localised scenes, but in a way it has more impact  because of it.

'Threads' & its American equivalent 'The Day After' came as a reaction to that attitude & tried to warn us of what the actual effects of a global nuclear war would be.

Threads is actually the better of the two movies, since it is actually more graphic & more realistic in regards to the destruction & devestation would have - not only in the physical sense of cities being destroyed & people dying in a horrible way, but also on how low would people have to go in order to survive, how quickly order would break down, and how all of humanities higher achievements would disappear once the basics of living cannot be fulfilled.",1299974400,3,841,4.391025641025641

The senario involving IRAN too remains topical, but in todays world IRan wants the bomb so they can use it on Isreal, or the west. this is not the same as the cold war era at all. This film looks great and it was shot on film , not all bbc dramas were shot that way back then. Although the tape era was thankfully coming to a end by the time they made this movie. THis is similiar to the very good 'the day after' but done with a smaller cast. The cast does a great job and the film builds up logically to the war for about 45 minutes and then it's a horrorfest of devastation and doom. But that's what that type of war would have been like. I am glad this film is in such good shape too, often we get films with scrathes and lines in them , 'the day after' has this problem. This one looks great and the effects of the war stand up even today. The scenes of the aftermath are very effective too. It would have taken hundreds of years for some sort of real society to return probably after this type of devastation and this film is worth every penny. Why it's not out in region one is beyond me.

This film illustrates realistic visuals and shocking chill effects through the whole effect of nuclear war experience and its aftermath.  Unlike other hyperbolic nuclear war films such as Fail Safe, Testament and even, The Day After.

Threads is a docudrama film - a far more appalling than any horror film, combining a highly effective building tension as the military conflict leading to nuclear war escalates in the background via news reports as a backdrop to domestic scene-setting, a brutally realistic depiction of the devastation wreaked by the bomb itself, and the ultra-depressing reality of the following fifteen years as Britain returns to a medieval state.

You will never forget this film Threads because of these dreadful images and events on this film that would alter your mind for our fate of humanity and the nuclear holocaust.  The chilling images on the list include:
* A woman wetting herself as she sees the mushroom cloud.
* Glass milk bottles melting in the heat of the blast.
* A catatonic woman cradling her dead baby.
* A man biting down on a rag as his leg is amputated with a saw without anesthetic.
* A couple gnawing at the raw flesh of a dead sheep.
* A woman bargained to sell her body in return for three dead rats.
* The same woman desperately smashing a tin of evaporated milk with a rock in the hope of getting it open and avoiding starvation.
* The education system ten years after the nuclear war consisting of no more than a grainy VHS tape of a school program and an erratic television.
* A generation of children with no hope who've never been taught to speak English properly and communicate at a level barely above grunting.
* A child born to a survivor of the nuclear war later giving birth herself to a hideously deformed stillborn baby.

It's certainly the most graphic.  Indeed, the film pulls no punches in its depiction of events following an all-out nuclear war that is sparked by a coup in Iran.  The focus is on the residents of Sheffield, England as they watch world events quickly spiral out of control.  The performances are good across the board, adding credibility to the proceedings.  You actually feel for these people and, as such, its all the more difficult to watch them perish (both quickly and slowly).  The film is full of unforgettable moments: residents watching as fire trucks leave for safety before the bombing commences, artwork being taken down from a museum wall and carted away, Ruth's journey from her parent's home amid rubble strewn with charred bodies frozen in a rictus of agony, a bloodied mother clutching her dead baby, and many more.  Threads is not for the squeamish.  It's also a very depressing film.  However, a film about the horrors of nuclear war should not be fun.  Softening the material would do a disservice to the film's anti-war message.  Yes, it's shocking and very, very brutal.  But, it has to be.

1353940,5,B00004U409,"Threads depicts the aftermath of a country that has been laid to waste by atomic bombs. This is not meant for entertainment. The stark realities shown in the film are not ones you'll soon forget. It shows that in mere seconds how fast the world can change. You would not even believe that something like this could happen until you recall your grade school lessons of atoms and Eisenstein and what America did to two cities in Japan. It is not the film that is scary, it's the fact that these weapons exist and could very well alter the world as we know it.

In Threads, you needn't wonder what life would be like if somebody decided to blowup your homeland. The movie itself covered every possible horror. Explosions, fallout, radiation is all but a fraction of the day to day trials people endure after the bombs are dropped. Civilization does not just stand back up, brush the dust off and rebuild itself. Hunger eats away at the stomachs of billions of people. With all the farm crops poisoned from the multiple effects of the bombs, what little food that remains people will kill for. The remaining government sits by as this happens, using small rations as reward for able workers, hoping that they will kill themselves off quickly so that there will be less mouths to feed. With no electricity to power even the simplest heath care facility, doctors can do very little to help save lives. The majority of the population dies at such an alarming rate that an attempt to bury them all would be futile and since there is hardly any fuel reserve, burning them would be too costly. So the streets are soon laden with corpses and an outbreak of Cholera and other diseases run rampant, significantly killing the people still alive. When crops finally manage to grow, pesticides are impossible to obtain, compromising the safety of food consumption. Finally, with a huge hole blown up in the atmosphere, everyone under the sun will be exposed to cancerous UV rays. And as if this new world was not bleak enough, we eventually learn that many years down the line, even small, harmless exposures to radiation will cause women to give birth to deformed stillborns. This leaves one to question the survivability of humanity as a whole.

When the credits start to roll you'll be relieved knowing that these bombs mostly stay underground and you'll thank God it was only a movie you just watched. But it is not the kind of horrible movie you can just say, ""It was only a movie"" since weapons of this magnitude do indeed exist and this could very well be our future if somebody decides to activate them.

Why this DVD has not made it to the United States is beyond me. I guess they figured we already had our version of a nuclear war movie with ""The Day After,"" but I like Threads better since it focused more on the aftermath of a nuclear war rather than a group of characters. You can learn from this film. It is not as story based as ""The Day After."" It concentrates more on the events that would follow after an atomic bomb has dropped. It does follow the life of one particular character and her offspring, just to show you how far the effects of such a disaster can reach into the future of our childrens' children.

Thankfully the film can be viewed for free on the internet, but I would really love to own the DVD here in the States for quality purposes.",1236902400,7,3354,4.548013245033113
1353941,5,B00004U409,"Compared to, ""The Day After,"" ""Threads"" was by far the superior production, in that it gave a cold, scientific projection of the effects following a nuclear war.
""The Day After"" showed only the immediate after-effects (of the dropped nuclear warheads on soceity), but ""Threads"" showed the decades-after effects on 'soceity' or what remained of it. ""The Day After"" was a more sanitized version of nuclear war that Hollywood made, and one got the impression that Hollywood did not want to shock their American TVaudience, whearas ""Threads"" threw the whole devastating reality in your face, a la ""if you tink there's anything like 'hope' after a nuclear war and you can 'just' rebuild again, better think again!""

For its educational value, I think that ""Threads"" is the better Video / DVD for schools to have in their libraries, if schools choose to have one of the two.  If they have both, they can show ""The Day After"" first, followed by ""Threads"": the 'end' of ""The Day After"" is the 'beginning' of ""Threads,"" so to speak.

1353942,4,B00004U409,"Having seen both Threads and The Day After within a relatively short timespan, I have to say Threads wins, hands-down, as the more realistic depiction.

I saw Threads when it was first broadcast in 1984 in the US, at the ripe old age of 16.  I had nightmares from watching this, for months afterward, and that's saying something.  Movies usually don't bother me.  This one, however... I'm finding myself wishing in retrospect that the NC-17-remake-of-X rating existed at the time.  This BBC production was well-deserving of such a rating.  Of course, being a BBC production, and a TV movie besides, there was no rating system to be applied.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not condemning the movie.  Even though it gave me enough nightm,ares to last 2 lifetimes, I loved it and still do.  I remember the gangland-type battles over simple things like food, water.  To be expected in a post-apocalyptic movie, to be sure.  What struck me the most was the graphic detail in these scenes and others.... I remember reading something about Ted Turner wanting to show this unedited, and by God that's what he did.  aqnd it's also what makes the film so memorable to this day.

There were no all-too-common happy endings movies are supposed to have.  Every day was a fight for survival.  Everything broke down... communication, eco-systems, chaos moved in like wildfire.  The darker sides of human nature break through in this film.  Realistic depiction of a post-nuclear-holocaust is what this impeccable film is all about.  And the final scenes brought me to tears.

In 1985 I gathered around the TV with some close friends to watch this film when it was aired by TBS. We had heard a lot of advance buzz about it and wondered what all the fuss was about. By the end the movie we were literally speechless. Bear in mind that this was still in the bad old days of the Cold War, and Ronald Reagan was making jokes about bombing the Soviet Union.

Well, the old Soviet Union may be history, but what used to be a warming relationship between the U.S. and Russia has more recently taken a turn for the worse. And then there are those off-again, on-again tensions between India and Pakistan. Just one nuclear weapon used offensively by some rogue nation or terrorist group anytime in the near future would be tremendously destabilizing for our entire world.

Low budget indeed, but that only serves to give it the desired grittiness and the effect of watching real, ordinary lives and a real organic society, being destroyed by an event that had perhaps prior to this film simply been unimaginable.
The 10 minutes or so depicting the actual nuclear attack are simple with regard to the special effects - images of nuclear bomb tests spliced with images of the actors and extras running about in panic and disbelief, but nonetheless they are horribly effective.  In particular, the shot of the woman peeing herself as she stands in the middle of the street looking up at the mushroom cloud, while the friend of the main character gasps that 'they've only bloody gone and done it', is simply something that you can never remove from your mind.
As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, the film could be a depiction of a nuclear bomb dropping on Coronation Street (of the popular British tv soap) and that is as close as any filmaker could possibly bring the threat of armageddon to the televisons and homes of the average British family of the 1980's.",1199577600,4,1276,4.721973094170403

This movie is an all-out, no-holds-barred presentation of nuclear war and the torturous aftermath that awaits those who are fortunate (unfortunate?) enough to survive.

In comparing this movie to ""The Day After"", ""Day"" is a PG-Rated movie while this movie would be R-Rated.  The horrific details of both the bombs exploding and obliterating everything and everyone in their path, images of people on fire but not just vaporizing as shown in ""Day"" is the stuff nightmares are made of and that is just the beginning.  The worst is still yet to come as the movie drags on through the aftermath which will torment and haunt those who survive forever.

What kind of world would this be in a post-nuclear war age?  What would 2007 be like had this event taken place back in 1984?  This movie explores a 13-year period following the war in great detail and everyday was as bad as the first.  Though people are coping, the life they live is worthless.  It's one thing to slowly recover from a disaster such as an earthquake, but what about when the disaster has permanently ruined the air you breath, the ground you need to farm and raise livestock?  What about when the disaster is still tormenting you long after it struck, still claiming loved ones, still destroying you?

1353949,5,B00004U409,"I still think 'Threads' is the best ever documentary-type drama depicting the complete collapse of society. While it specifically shows the effects of global nuclear war in Britain, many of its aspects would be true for complete societal disintegration in any western country and from any cause - such as terrible epidemic or economic collapse. And, in case anyone thinks otherwise, the end of the Cold War didn't end the real prospect of most or all of us being blown up and irradiated at some point. All those weapons are still in place and will be until they are used. Atomic weapons have only been around for 60 years and there has been a great deal of restraint that has prevented their widespread use so far - but that cannot be expected to last indefinitely. Enjoy a cushy life while you can!

'Threads' is all the more powerful for its basic story, modest production and lack of special effects. Simple scenes like the ones of the couple miserably stripping wallpaper from their new house just before the missiles strike, or later eating a raw and irradiated sheep, make far more impression than big explosions. Highly recommended.

1353951,5,B00004U409,"Threads is a low-budget BBC drama made back in 1984 and traumatized the nation when aired. It still retains the potential, especially today, when in light of recent events this is exactly the kind of scenario that is all too possible.

Threads is described by many critics as one of the most terrifying films you could watch, and they are right, for shock value Threads manages to conjure up scenes that are beyond nightmares because they are unfeigned. It is for this reason that it deserves its acclaimed kick in the teeth status.

Threads starts off as simple Sheffield town with average Joe Soap problems and in the background some political hostilities between the Soviets and the US over Iran. The bombshell second part of the film is about people dying trying to make it alive or people just dying. When the bombs land, people get burned and then radiated dust kills everyone else off slowly. That is it in a nutshell.

The series of events is described scientifically. Every so often a British documentary voice-over takes places to describe the effects of radiation on people, the condition of services and why there is no sunlight. Eveything goes to the middle ages very quickly and people have to live that way. Don't be surprised to see the local surgeon hacking off arms and legs without anaesthetics as the crowds of wounded murder each other to get into a hospital.

Threads is upsetting all the way.  Even though many newsreels and scientific footage of atomic blasts, including riot recordings and photographs for backgrounds, are used to the point that this production's low-budget strands show, the overall message with cut-scene scientific explanations of what happens when we are hit by atomic bombs is what makes this an unforgettable must-see.

1353953,4,B00004U409,"Regrettably, ""Threads"" is presently unobtainable in the United States, and the only available DVDs are encoded for Europe.  This is unfortunate, because ""Threads"" is one of the most plausible and realistic Nuclear Doomsday scenarios one is ever likely to find. This is a compelling story of what we all feared during the bad old days of the Cold War.  A period of international tension and confrontation culminating in nuclear war and an unthinkable aftermath.

The film's realism is heightened by the use of actual British civil defense television clips which, in their dry pragmatism, convince the viewer that nuclear war is an all-too-real possibility.

What really distinguishes this piece, however, is its depiction of the aftermath of nuclear war.  Human beings are reduced to a bare minimum standard of living in a harsh, agricultural existence in which survival is by no means assured.  Society effectively ends, the ecosystems are hopelessly damaged, and the future, if there is one, is unspeakably bleak.

This is a powerful and depressing film, and its graphic depiction of the effects of nuclear war are not for the squeamish.  I wish very much that this film would become available on DVD here in the States.",1169337600,41,1221,5.100502512562814
1353954,3,B00004U409,"Oh, sorry, that was Wargames. This is an entirely more serious film. My Dad remembers this BBC TV movie from when it was first screened in September 1984, and although he only remembered parts, it definitely had an effect on him, so much so that he asked for it for his Christmas. Thankfully, it was easy to find on DVD, and cheap, although I did find out afterwards that it used to go for 100 on Ebay. Ouch. No.

It's always a bad idea for me to watch these movies, but I won't learn my lesson. I tend to go around switching on all the lights in the house, and then have nightmares. After Armageddon, not only did I cry, but also I did actually think it was going to happen! Especially something like Threads, that is scarily realistic, and still very relevant today. When you have idiots like George Bush & Tony Blair who have too much time on their hands, and who can't decide who to declare war on now, it could so easily happen in our lifetimes. That's what's scary. They talk about ""winnable"" nuclear wars. Well, watch this film, and see exactly how ""winnable"" it is. Do you want this to happen to the next generation, possibly your children?

Threads is about a nuclear war that happens in Sheffield, which spawned other great films such as The Full Monty and ... Yeah. The only reason I can think of as to why they chose to set it in Sheffield, is because it's not London, and because it's (or at least used to be) an industrial town. But it's a pretty dire setting either way. It starts off with a couple who are young and carefree, then Ruth discovers, oops, the condom split, and now she's pregnant. They plan to get married, and move in together, only to discover through various news broadcasts (presented by Lesley Judd, who used to be on Blue Peter), that the world is at war. Next thing they know, there's a nuclear blast, and a very powerful one. It escalates from there, showing who survives, and how they manage.

We follow Ruth's struggle to survive, with her pregnancy, and how the baby will be affected by the radiation, through to witnessing the birth of the ""nuclear generation"", and then the exploits of her daughter afterwards. The film goes through days, weeks, months and ends a full thirteen years after the attack, with scenes that will burn into your mind, with people speaking in a strange, caveman-style way, behaving like wild animals, raping, and fighting, and finally, mutant babies.

Although Threads has dated, I think if Hollywood had got its hands on it, then it wouldn't have been so realistic. It would have been glossy, and unbelievable. (Well, maybe not to me!) It plays like a documentary, so it's in no way sugar coated, and there are no big long speeches, or heroic actions. Cold, hard, brutal honesty.

This is a landmark movie, and I think it should be shown to the so-called ""people in power"" - Bush & Blair being the main people. But I suppose they would be tucked up in their bunkers wouldn't they? But bunkers aren't all they're made out to be as this movie shows. You can get trapped. See it on film, not in real life.",1169078400,7,3072,4.488372093023256
1353955,4,B00004U409,"This film took awhile for it to really grow on me.  Perhaps the best aspect about this film is the powerful metaphor contained therein.  Yes-this planet, with its current technology and fragile ecosystem-is like a delicate fabric and when one of the ""threads"" is missing, then the whole beautiful mosaic collapses like a house of cards.  Excellent reasoning from the producers of this film.  The aftermath also was quite brutal, and contained a lot of good scientific information as well.  However, even with all these redeeming qualities, I still find this film a lot less FRIGHTENING then ""The Day After"", especially in the initial attack scenes.  Oh, sure, Threads is more GRAPHIC in the aftermath, but this still does not make a film necesarily BETTER.  In fact, there are a number of horror films that are excellent in that they rely more on chills and thrills rather than just out and out gore.  I found the attack scenes in ""The Day After"" to be far more chilling, especially with the display of the rockets being launched and the the black demon-like mushroom clouds arising into the air.  ""Threads"" seem to lack this single effect and I found this aspect of the film rather disappointing.  However, the excellent metaphor and realistic-enough aftermath make this film worth viewing.",1168387200,6,1291,4.935185185185185
1353956,5,B00004U409,"I first saw this film shortly after it was released in the US and to this day it still troubles me. Back then, of course, the idea of a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union seemed like a very real possibility. I can not over-emphasize how graphic and disturbing this film is. Unlike it's US contemporary, The Day After, Threads does not try and minimize the horror of a nuclear holocaust. As the movie progresses, living conditions in England become almost medieval: looters are executed, crops wither from the affects of UV radiation, and sickness wipes out millions. If you ever wondered how truly devastating a nuclear war would be, watch Threads. This movie pulls no punches.",1161475200,10,681,4.829059829059829

The ban was lifted and the film was released in the US. All my friends and family, including myself, watched this terrifying doomsday senario unfold. Even today we still talk about it with shutters. Truely not for the faint of heart. Very graphic and unrellentingly realistic. Many who watched it say they will never watch it again. In this post-9/11 politically correct world, I really didn't expect to find it here, but this film is a must have for my collection. Very pleased to find it here. Adults, please screen this film before allowing viewing by children. Now to look for ""Fail-Safe"" and ""Johnny Got His Gun"".",1161216000,6,761,4.644444444444445
1353958,5,B00004U409,"This is one of the best movies that was ever made, and should be broadcast all over the world to enlighten our thinking about nuclear war.

This is the most graphic film that you can imagine.  The soft parts are when people are vaporized by nuclear explosions.  The more brutal scenes show people with horrible radiation burns, starvation, summary executions, rape, and mutated children.

The movie has to be as close to WWIII as theatre can ever get.  The special effects and makeup artistry were brilliant.  The story line is second to none.  It follows a young woman from a romantic interlude with her fiance all the way through a decade of hellish life in post-nuclear winter Britain.  The movie literally goes from modern day technology at the beginning to pitchforks and threadbear knitting at the end.

The most ironic part of the movie is the contrast between the beginning and lead up to the WWIII attacks with news reports and narration, to the medevial life that was left for the miserable survivors.

Warning for Kids - watching this movie may give you permanent nightmares.",1155859200,8,1086,4.821621621621621
1353959,5,B00004U409,"It's a hard title to find, but - alongside ""Dirty Bomb"" - it is, in my view, the most informative film ever made concerning what could happen to planet earth and all aboard her, if the human ability to rationalise does not supercede outdated and overactive human survival drives. If, as often seems likely, the demise of earth occurs in the near future and after a relatively short period of human domination, the chances are the cause will be our precocious development of nuclear weapons allied with a willingness to utilize aforementioned. This film shows what will or would be the kind of bland, deadly, tragic and suicidal trajectory we would be subject to as some of us complain while others cheer our way into oblivion. It is everything ""The Day After"" is not. Unfortunately, we need to wake up and smell the fear. Must-see viewing for politicians, concerned citizens, dictators and religous fanatics from all around the wonderful blue and white orb we have been lucky enough (through evolutionary accident) to have been entrusted with. I hope that watching films like this will help us to pass onto our children the abilty to see the earth for the precious rescource it is; and that ""Threads"" and ""Dirty Bomb"" encourage us to attempt to inculcate in our children an awareness of what will otherwise be the inescapable consequences of human weakness if we do not invest our collective energies and determination in human hope and love, ingenuity and strength.",1140307200,12,1466,4.891566265060241
1353960,5,B00004U409,"Saw this on PBS in 1983 and was terrified. The sheer graphic nature of the visual imagery remains burned into my brain -- burned people, wrecked houses, the utter hopelessness.

One of the things I remember best about this film was the bunker where the officials tried to cope with the disaster. That resonates with me today, because I am on the Emergency Operations Committee of the City of Newark, New Jersey. On 9/11, my post was at the Emergency Operations Center, working with other agencies: municipal, county, state, and federal. I had to prepare press releases and statements from the city to inform our residents on what to do and not do.

So if the bomb drops, that's where I'll be. And if the bomb drops, I'll be with those same folks, running out of food, water, power, and patience, while the world ends around me.

The officials try to figure out how to feed starving residents, and one wonders if his family has escaped the blast. He never finds out. I went through that myself...my wife was in New York on September 11, and I told her to get out, but didn't know if she'd made it. It was a chilling five hours. But she got out.

Thinking that day about ""Threads,"" I saw myself in the same position as those city workers, studying a map, wondering if their families had survived, never finding out, and gradually being overwhelmed by the sheer hopelessness of the situation.

I remain haunted by the scene where British troops, long after the civilian government has collapsed, now little more than a uniformed mob, sift through the darkened bunker, finding everyone dead -- presumably from lack of food or radiation, or just exhaustion. The troops are only interested in food, and they sweep by the bodies, uncaring. I saw myself as one of the corpses lying on a desk in that scenario.

The final part of the picture, with Ruth and her daughter scrabbling at the diseased ground to farm, wrapped in rags, under a permanently gray sky, also haunts me. Below are spoilers, but at this point, I don't think I'm giving up the name of Orson Welles's sled.

Civilization had completely collapsed. Ruth's daughter's generation was growing up in a dreadful mix of ignorance and horror...knowing nothing but rubble, radiation, and death. With society and our social systems gone, they had no education.

I was struck by the scene where Ruth's daughter and her pals sit around a TV set, which is playing a tape, shucking corn (I think), and the tape is saying, ""Cat...this is a skeleton of a cat."" The TV was probably powered by a local power plant or batteries or some such, but there was no teacher. The kids were not interested in the tape.

That was what passed for education in the postwar world. No more Dickens, no more Michelangelo, no more Fermat. No universities, no high schools, no teachers. Learning had ended. Somehow, that upset the most...the idea that nuclear war would not only destroy humanity, but lobotomize the survivors.

When Ruth dies, Ruth's daughter takes her mother's bird book from her dead hands, incomprehendingly, and leaves her there. Quite probably she's never seen a bird. Family structure had broken down as well. That also resonated with me, because I thought about how important families and family rituals are in our civilized world. But in that environment, they meant nothing.

Ruth's daughter then meets and gets raped by some young men. One of the upsetting parts of this interchange was that neither party could speak properly. They were not only illiterate, but incoherent in speech....""Wozzat? Gizzum!"" replacing the English language.

That was proved at the very end, when Ruth's daughter, pregnant, goes to what's left of a hospital, asking for help in delivering her baby. Actually, she yells at matron, ""Babby! Come! Babby! Come!"" I was struck by the idea of a woman in England -- birthplace of the language -- unable to say, ""I'm having a baby, can you help me?""

I was equally struck that the cold matron, obviously older and still in possession of the English language, said, ""You'll have to do it yourself, dear."" There are no supplies left. Everyone is on their own.

And when Ruth delivers her daughter, it's deformed and stillborn. That's the final coda...the future of humanity. There isn't one.

And I hope that such is not the fate of my own beloved little daughter...to end up like Ruth's daughter.",1139961600,108,4365,4.778220451527225

7923535,5,B00004U409,"I was born in 1956 and grew up in Omaha Nebr. and Offutt Air Force base(Strategic Air Command).  The ""SAC Looking Glass Mission"" where one EC-135 was always airborne 24 hours a day to serve as flying command post for the Strategic Air Command(The B52s that would drop the Nukes). In the 1960s we did ""duck and cover ""(get under your desk) at school.  My next door neighbor out in the country had quite an elaborate bomb shelter.  My parents were good friends with a Major with the Air Force at SAC. And he told me when I was nine that if the Soviets launched there Nukes. That maybe if nothing got through I might live and if a Nuke did hit Omaha I would die very quickly.  So I grew up obsessed with dystopian literature and nuclear weapons.
I watched Threads when it came out in 1984 as I also watched The Day After and Testament.  All excellent movies.  All to real.  ***Spoiler****  Did you all get why its called Threads?  In the end you can see people unraveling clothing ""Threads"" to make new clothing from those scraps.  Those movies were incredibly popular because so many were afraid of us and the Soviets starting nuclear war.  Could have happened.
Now all these years later.  Could it still happen?  Of course and much, much worse.  If you travel around the world now you will see how many people are terrified of the USA.  Not the Soviets but US.  If a 50 megaton Nuclear Bomb was dropped on London they would feel effects 600 miles away!  If you dropped it on Paris the city would no longer exist and be leveled.
