1622859,3,B00005LOUL,"This 1998 movie is not bad. It starts off interestingly when the sidekicks of Professor John Richards have a meeting with a mysterious man in a bar, offering 4 million, if they steal the Triton and bring it to him. The Triton can 'atomise' any person or object and can transport it anywhere else, and, as you discover later on in the movie, it can do many other things.

That sounds rather cool doesn't it? Well, yeah, but they've gone the route of 'family movie'; It's kind of a sci-fi thriller compromised to become a family movie. And the professor is hardly eccentric; very serious in fact. Even if Hannes Jaenicke is a good actor, playing his feminine self for laughs, his main character is quite a normal guy.

And the action is resolved too quickly. One minute the professor and his invisible wife are extremely wanted criminals running away from cops, then, all of a sudden, the whole family and the FBI are holding hands, chasing down rather flimsy, easy to catch criminals. You actually want the bad guys to get away so something might actually happen, but before you know it there's the happy ending. It's a flim that starts out thrilling but quickly loses its edge.",1339286400,,1177,4.626794258373206

It's just cute, and the guinea pig looks just like our very own Penelope Wheets!! (We're actually quite angry that no credit was given to her!!) :)",1505692800,,314,4.7272727272727275

7944140,3,B00005LOUL,"I bought this one a few years ago, because as a kid I was into the whole becoming invisible thing, so as an adult if I ever see an invisible man (child, woman, or even animal) book or movie, I always grab it.  To be fair with rating of this one the region 4 DVD is a budget range DVD put out by RAAM Multimedia in 2010 (the movie itself was released 1998 in cinemas or went straight to the TV screen who knows). If you're from a country outside of Australia these things have a full retail price of $2 (and it's usually less) in stands of stores that aren't known for selling movies such as in chemists, dollar stores and places like that. It just has the feature and other than a menu where you can select to play the feature or pick scenes, it has no extras or anything else. These movies are usually not great, but sometimes you find a gem. This isn't one of those gems.  Interestingly the region 4 DVD has an image of a mother on the front who isn't the actor in the film and a boy who isn't an actor in the film either.  It also has a dog, and if there was a dog in this, I don't remember it (I watched this last night).  I mention this as the DVD cover image of the region one for sale on this page also has a dog (different breed) that isn't in the movie, the region one also has a different boy actor and there's also a little girl on the cover image. There are no female kids in the film.  So when the DVD distributors of two regions don't care enough about the movie they are promoting, well that tells you something about the film.

The film is child audience aimed.  It's pretty low budget, and the mother become invisible element is only a small part of a plot about a scientist being kidnapped (why not just murdered I could never work out) by his lab assistants who are doing so on the promise of four million dollars.  They also have to steal the machine and its blueprints.  Neither of these lab assistants is particularly bright, but they manage to use the machine the scientist has invented to transport an object from one location to another, to transport the scientist tied up in a chair to a warehouse.  They also know about another function the machine does that the scientist doesn't which is to give an object plastic surgery if you like, to make it look like the other object.  So they make the female assistant look like the scientist.  Who is a dude by the way (Hannes Jaenicke, who was in quite a few TV movies in the 90s amongst a much longer career) so they can frame him for the crime and get the blueprints from his house. The actor plays both versions of himself obviously, basically by bending his wrist and walking differently as the impostor. What no one knows is that the machine can also turn someone invisible, which happens when the son of the scientist knocks it and turns the mother invisible.

Is it worth watching?  Well yes if it's ever on TV or you can still get it somewhere for a few dollars. It is kind of cheesy though and the storyline isn't the best with a few holes, such as the kid follows the fake dad to the warehouse and phones the mother, telling her this weird machine is in the warehouse and she goes something like I'll be right there.  Yet how would she know where this warehouse was?  Wouldn't the chair and rope also be part of the woman lab assistant when she becomes the scientist since his clothes also were?  It also has some unnecessary story about the son and his friend being bullied by some other boy which we return to after the main story is over with him fighting the kid in a boxing ring.  That part doesn't do anything for the film.

On the invisible person aspect if that's why you're watching it.  She doesn't become invisible until the 43 minute mark. She does the old bandages around the head with the black eye goggles thing H G Wells made famous.  Also uses a towel over the face at one stage.  Gloves and long sleeved jacket as well.  There aren't that many minutes where she nudes up and is invisible, but she visits the lab her husband works in and the warehouse while so.  Doesn't get up to a great deal other than pick up a letter opener and threaten someone.  Oddly in the dinner before going to the warehouse she undresses throwing her various garmets, into the stall being occupied by a woman who oddly starts putting them on (perhaps she didn't want to use toilet paper and planned on using the gloves), yet the mother has these things on in the warehouse scene.",1485388800,,4455,4.287589498806683
