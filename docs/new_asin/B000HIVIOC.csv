2638395,5,B000HIVIOC,"I grew up watching ""The facts of life"" when it originally aired back in the late 70's and early 80's. In my opinion it ranks among the best TV sitcoms of all time.

Some viewers may find the scripts and acting to be a bit ""heavy handed"", but just remember not to judge too harshly or you may find that your viewing sophistication has come with a very high price tag - a loss of innocence. Children of the late 70's and early 80's viewed many sitcoms from the 50's and 60's with the same type of scrutiny that is sure to be applied to ""The Facts of Life"" by today's viewing audience. But the fact remains that the same simple magic and wisdom that exists within a program such as ""Leave it to Beaver"" also exists within ""The Facts of Life"", no matter how ""uncool"" or ""unhip"" you may judge it to be. To those critics who label this series as ""corny"" or ""dated"" I would only say that I'd much rather live in a ""corny"" world filled with hope and inspiration than an uninspired, ""reality tv"" infested wasteland.

At the core of this series is a strong heartbeat that still resonates a very important message of love, caring, understanding, innocence, truth, honesty and hope. You'll laugh and you'll cry as you follow the youthful cast on a wonderful and sometimes painful journey. I actually feel very lucky to have been able to watch and APPRECIATE this series as a child and I can only hope that current and future generations of children will get that chance as well.

As far as the DVD set itself, the packaging is excellent and the picture quality is great! I do however wish that this set had ""extras"" like those included on the ""season 1 & 2"" set. I would love to hear episode commentary by cast members, especially Nancy McKeon who was absent from the extras on the previous set. I guess we can only hope for the future!

My only complaint is that I can watch an entire box set a whole lot faster than Sony can release them :) I'm hoping that Sony doesn't let this series ""stall"" and continues to release each season at a fast rate!

HOW CAN YOU HELP TO MAKE SURE FUTURE SEASONS ARRIVE QUICKLY?

By purchasing the product ""NEW"" from Amazon (or another legitimate retailer) your purchase will ""count"" and Sony will hear the message. When you purchase any item ""used"" you'll probably be saving money but your purchase will mostly go unheard by the releasing studio. Sony (and other DVD releasing studios) are in the business of making money, so make every one of your purchases COUNT and remember to BUY IT NEW!

2638396,5,B000HIVIOC,"This is the best season of this show.  The episode alone with Tootie's (Kim Fields) obsession with Jermaine Jackson is worth it alone. A cynical ending, but a great lesson to us all.  The epsiode with Jo (Nancy McKeon) writing the crooked article on her teacher is a classic, which should remind young viewers that the media, the paper and TV, is not always cracked up to what it is meant to be.  The irony of the episode of Tootie getting drunk is remembrance when Kim Fields played a leading role in a TV film a year before called Children of Divorce.  Fields hit the bottle then to get away from the problems of her mother and father.  What people really have to remember about this show is that it is so must better than the show it spun off from, Diff'rent Strokes.  It always had a serious topic in it that not only girls/women could appreciate, but also boys/men. It took over a week for this season to come in the mail, and I just got it today.  I would grab it ASAP.  Strange to say, this show seemed nostalgic when I first watched it on NBC, as well as the re-runs on Fox in 1980s, and it is still nostalgic.  It brings you to the home  we had at one time with things not always being peaches and cream.",1162339200,3,1213,4.212121212121212
2638397,5,B000HIVIOC,"Facts of Life tickled my funny bone the way it likes to be tickled. Not too aggressively and all in your face, but gently and lightly like a warm spring breeze when all you've got is your smile and the knowledge that life is about sundowns and sadness. But not the sadness that gets you down, the sadness in knowing that the moment you're living is temporary.

I came up with a little saying that I hope you'll like, it's: ""Don't get so caught up in the past that you can't catch up with the present."" I submitted it to Reader's Digest but they rejected it thinking people would mistake ""catch up"" with ""ketchup."" I was like: Wha? How would anyone make a connection between my adage and condiments? What's the expression? That just didn't retain water.

Anyhoo, speaking of retaining water, season three is when the ladies really came into their own. No longer are the performances stiff and wooden. I can actually stomach Natalie's overacting. As for Joe and Tutti, I'm afraid they never really got any better. Charlotte Rae the seasoned pro is what held this show together like a big sack of industrial strength glue, but not the kind of glue that's made from horses -- because Facts of Life had a conscience. No animals were ever hurt in the filming of the show. But did Blair break her arm once?",1162166400,,1299,4.523404255319149
2638398,4,B000HIVIOC,"While the third season of ""The Facts of Life"" is not my favorite season, it is still part of my favorite series.  By season three we have everything that makes ""The Facts of Life"" work:  Natalie, Tootie, Blair, and Jo, with their distinct, terrific personalities.

It has been said that each Monkee was one quarter the perfect man, and the same can be said for the ""Facts of Life"" women:  Blair is beautiful, inside and out, Jo is confident, certainly no push-over, Tootie is out-going and upbeat, and Natalie is gentle and creative.  When added together these girls are a showcase of how friendship should work in the real world.

As stated, this is my favorite series.  Even the opening theme, with the words ""When the world never seems to be living up to your dreams"", makes me glad that as human beings we can dream bigger than our circumstances.",1161129600,6,850,4.626666666666667
2638399,5,B000HIVIOC,"The Facts of Life was the longest running sitcom with an all female cast and of the 1980's. As years goes by the series evolves and just keeps getting better. Season three is by far better than the previous two, with the girls at Eastland (only one more year to go -- then comes 2 years of Edna's Edibles and 3 years of Over Our Head's Era's) they tackle more serious issues as the years go by and as the girls get older. In this season premiere, Tootie feeling left out because she is the youngest and is tired of getting picked on by Blair, Jo, and Natalie turns to alcohol to prove that she is 'just as grown up' as the other girls. As old as this series is, many issues are still current today with teens, and college problems. The stories are very well laid out and realistic (other than season two where it was kind of cheesy in many spots).

This season marks one of the most memorable episode of the series with the infamous Paint Fight, which gets the girls into more trouble and put on probation until graduation.

Sony has included all full length 24 episodes of season three in this box set. The run time is 602 minutes, which means that The Facts of Life Goes To Paris 2 hr movie (ran as episode numbers 54, 55, 56 and 57 in the series) will not be included in this set, but may be included in the Season Four set.

That's what 'Facts of Life' does for me.  I was in high school when this was on the air.  Watching it brings back all kinds of happy memories. True, the writing is cheesy and the acting is over the top. (Check out those 80s fashions/hairstyles!!)

2638431,5,B000HIVIOC,"I grew up watching this show. Re-watching these episodes bring back a lot of memories for me. We all had our favorites. My older sister loved Jo, my younger sister loved Natalie, I - being the only male in the household, favored Blair. Although I didn't follow the show from the beginning (I was far too young during the shows first couple of seasons), I did catch most of these episodes on re-runs in the late 80's. Today, watching these episodes as an adult brings a whole new perspective. Many deals with very serious topics. Season 3 deals with issues of drugs, alcohol, jealousy, cancer, teenage prostitution etc and are discussed in a light-hearted manner while throwing in some laughs as well. The first season is an almost different show with a cast made up of mostly young girls, including Molly Ringwald. The show was re-tweaked for Season 2 with a lot of the characters getting the axe. From Season 2 onward, the cast consisted mainly of the motherly Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), the conceited, pretty blonde, Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel), the comedic aspiring writer, Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), her best friend, Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsey (Kim Fields) and the no-nonsense, in-your-face Joanne ""Jo"" Polniaczek (Nancy McKean). Season 3 would follow the formula of season 2. Many of the episodes are a bit over-dramatic providing more drama than laughs but when the show is called ""The Facts of Life"", this should be expected. Despite this, many episodes featured here are charming and incredibly funny.

Stand-out episodes of Season 3:

Growing Pains - Blair returns from vacation with 2 bottles of French wine and decides to drink it up with her friends, minus the under-aged Tootie. Feeling left out, Tootie decides to drink after stumbling on to one of Blair's wine bottles and gets drunk jeopardizing her future in Eastland.

Give and Take - When the girls find out Mrs. Garrett is in a financial crisis, they realize they have been selfish and decide to help her out.

A Baby in the House - Blair's newly married friend comes to visit the girls at Eastland with her baby. It all turns chaotic when she leaves without her baby leaving the girls and Mrs. Garrett to play babysitter. This episode is more melodramatic but provides some really funny moment.

A Friend in Deed - Blair's mother reveals the truth about her plastic surgery. Again, this episode has a lot of melodrama, maybe a bit too much but it is very well acted by the cast with some genuinely comedic moments.

Green-Eyed Monster - When Tootie gets the female lead in ""South Pacific"", a very jealous Natalie, who also auditioned for the role, tries to make life and rehearsals difficult for her. ""Woops, they dropped."" LOL

The Four Musketeers - The girls probation is finally up and they are able to move to the dorms but soon realize living together wasn't all that bad. Blair and Jo's bickering in this episode is a highlight as is the paint fight.

Runaway - When Tootie's parents deny her permission to go on a day trip to New York with the other girls, she decides to challenge authority and go to the big city by herself unchaperoned. Once there she befriends a young prostitute while her pimp eyes the vulnerable Tootie.

New York, New York - Blair and Jo take a trip to New York to meet up with old friends. They start getting on each other's nerves and when their respective friends show up, it gets even worse and funnier.

Kids Can Be Cruel - When Blair exposes Natalie's secret crush, Natalie takes her revenge by setting her up with a nerdy boy from Bates Academy.

Mind Your Own Business - When Blair reads Natalie's diary, she discovers Natalie wrote some very unflattering comments about her so she retaliates. A furious Natalie then sets up house rules that don't go down too well with the girls.

For those wanting a little bit of nostalgia with a little added charm and humor, I wholeheartedly recommend this set and the other seasons that have been released on DVD. So far only the first 5 seasons have been released. My favorites season 6 & 7 are still unreleased. Although some of the humor is forced and many of the episodes are heavy on melodrama, and Mindy Cohn appears to be laughing at her own jokes - LOL, when the show works, it works splendidly and it is wonderfully acted. Also, practically everyone can identify with a lot of these characters and the topics being discussed. Times and fashions have definitely changed since these girls were in Prime-Time but the issues they bring to the forefront and the humor live on.

Now release the rest of the seasons on DVD please",1400544000,,4586,4.703241895261845

2638454,4,B000HIVIOC,"THE FACTS OF LIFE was a spinoff series of DIFF'RENT STROKES about the Drummond's former housekeeper Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who takes a job as the housemother of a dormitory at a an all-girls only private school called Eastland School which included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), overweight impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest and gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).

This 1981-82 Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE is awesome is when this show had its best ratings throughout its whole 9-year run on NBC and takes me all the way back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Our Pride Is Showing"" and when this show was on Wednesday nights at 9PM.

This 1981-1982 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when Ronald Reagan was our president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 as well.",1345075200,,945,4.974683544303797

It feels like an eternity has passed since season 3 came out!
I hate to sound so rude, but I just love ""The Facts of Life"" and I can't wait to buy every single season on DVD.

2638476,5,B000HIVIOC,"Imagine my delight when I saw all 3 seasons stocked at a mall department store.  Amazon had them on sale, so I ordered them all online at once.  Needless to say, I watched them all as soon they finally arrived in my mailbox.  No bonus features here, but otherwise everything's closed-captioned.  Kudos to the one responsible for this particular feature I truly, absolutely appreciate.

As I said here regarding seasons 1 and 2 (see separate review), I fell in love with it since it premiered despite the changes made for S2.  I'd watch it every week if I get to remember, thru high school.  I'd moved on, sometimes not realizing it was *still* around, but when I did I decided to stick with it again in later years til it went off in 1988.

TFOL finished 24th in the ratings a couple times in its 9-year run, in season 3 at 19.1 and 5 at 17.3.  All other seasons, probably somewhere in the top 40 if not better.  If I remember right, this show finished in the top 30 in the 9th and final season at 14.9, a very respectable number at the time if you ask me.  Some shows crash and burn in the final season, but not this one.  0:)

I'll get future seasons as soon as they come out.  Hopefully the DVD sales will still be good to ensure the rest to be released in due time.",1182643200,4,1269,4.233333333333333

2638479,5,B000HIVIOC,"The facts Of Life is a show we all can relate to. Each and every episode shows us the meening of life when growing up. It is a group of girls in a privet school and their teacher whom we as television viewers and the girls loved, our Mr's Garret. She takes care of the girls as they grow up to be young ladies. It is a comady a drama and they just don't make shows like these anymore. Season one introduses us to all of the girls and Mr's Garret untll the second season they kept just three of the girls and add a new one. We have Blair who is the snoby one, Tootie who is best friends with the perky Nattle and Jo street smart who dosen't get along with Blair until some time in the series. They all show that they care about each other as friends no matter how differant they are. It's a shame that this show went off the air when it did but it did last about 9 seasons.

Alot of the episodes now play like those old After-School Specials, but I just can't resist going back to a more innocent, light-hearted time.
It definitely gets nostalgia points & will make you smile!",1168992000,4,399,4.2631578947368425

2638485,5,B000HIVIOC,"These shows stand the test of time well.  Anyone much over the age of 30 will, of course, feel as aged as I do watching them with all the references to early 80's politics and pop culture but it is so refreshing.  I had forgotten how this show truly set the standard for so many ""4 women comedies"" to come down the pike - Golden Girls, Designing Women, Living Single, Sex & The City, Desperate Housewives... and how many topical issues are handled - and handled so well by the brilliant players headed by the quintessential matriarch, Mrs G!  Frequent cameos featuring the marvelous Geri Jewell as Cousin Geri are the icing on an already delicious cake.  This is a must have for anyone who either grew up in the 80's as I did or who has a curiosity as to what life was like to be young in the 80's.  You take the good, you take the bad, you take 'em both and there you have... THE FACTS OF LIFE!!!  Bring on Season 4 please!!!!",1168473600,3,927,4.238636363636363

Now, for the third season the show really starts to pick up steam and become the wonderful show that lasted for such a long time on televison.  Each of the characters get ample time to be in the spotlight during this exciting and dramatic season.

In this season...

Find out how Blair reacts when she learns that her grandfather whom she loved and respected was not who she thought he was.  Will Tootie and Natalie's friendship survive when Tootie wins the lead in the school play that Natalie so badly wanted?  Will Mrs. Garrett be forced to leave her job at the school when she finds herself in a financial bind?  See what happens when one of the girls discovers that her father is having an affair.  When the school decides to censor some of the books in the library, will the girls and Mrs. Garrett be able to win their fight to get them back?

2638487,4,B000HIVIOC,"""The Facts of Life"" Season 3 is another great season that I think any 80s fan or simply any person looking for great writing with a mix of comedy and drama and actual big issues of the day should own. You can read the other reviews to see the variety in the episodes and writing. This season you see the girls travel outside the school a bit more and their friendship change as their probation period (an ongoing Season 2 plot) comes to an end.

What I liked about this season was just how the show continued to take on a variety of topics young people faced. The surprising thing is that this show stands the test of time; never did I laugh and say ""that'd never happen today"". The jokes and acting were really well done, and when the show had to hit upon a serious note, it didn't seem awkward at all.

My only complaint was that there are NO extra features! That keeps this from being a five-star review. The first released was packed with special features, interviews ... yet none of that is here. As another reviewer mentioned, even the tv movie about the big trip overseas wasn't included. There was definitely room for more in terms of special features and hopefully the next will get more. Other than this flaw, this is still a good release and a show you should own and add to your collection.",1162944000,4,1302,4.37603305785124

I'm not going to list synopses of all the episodes, but I will say this: BUY THIS SET!!  This is a great series with a VERY talented cast; (practically) every episode is a winner.  Yes, there are a couple of questionable ones (the Jermaine Jackson episode where Tootie goes insane is rather questionable), but all in all, these episodes are the cream of the crop.

I love watching with my daughter so we can talk about stuff more deeply than they delve.  And it's one of the few shows I feel confident allowing her to binge watch on a Saturday.
