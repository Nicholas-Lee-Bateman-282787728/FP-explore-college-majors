8219957,5,B000VU4B1I,"I got several videos about Petra. My favorite was ""Petra: Prophecy Revealed"" because of the enormous amount of information in it.

This video was what it was described to be and is a travel video, more secular in nature than my favorite which I mentioned above. The quality and information is good. It's just very short, which surprised me a little. If I had remembered to check the time before I bought it I wouldn't have been surprised. All-in-all, it's a good product and someone watching it will have a good idea of what Petra is all about, with few, if any, Biblical references.",1280966400,7,583,4.605769230769231
