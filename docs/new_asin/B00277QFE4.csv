(Starred Review) Landscapes through Time with David Dunlop.
Jan 2009. SimmonsArt, DVD
In this beautifully shot 13-part series, landscape painter and art historian David Dunlop journeys to various European and American locations where some of the world's most influential artists lived or visited. In the first title, Van Gogh's Asylum at St. Remy, France, Dunlop walks the rounds of the asylum of St. Paul de Mausole where the troubled artist did much of his best work. Setting up his easel as he views the surrounding countryside, Dunlop describes van Gogh's life and artistic techniques as he applies the acclaimed artist's characteristic heavy brushstrokes and rich color palate to create a scene that echoes van Gogh's style. As he paints, Dunlop's running commentary is filled with fascinating tidbits about the artist's personal struggles. Meanwhile, adult students, who accompanied Dunlop on the trip,are creating their own paintings. Dunlop tactfully adds color and texture to enhance one student's work. In the next title, Monet's Waterlillies at Giverny, France, Dunlop talks about the origins of  Impressionism as he tours Monet's home. He works at his easel in front of the well known pond and describes the beginnings of Impressionism. The instructor again critiques the work of a student and enthusiastically shares Monet's techniques and philosophy of painting. Using a similar format, Dunlop and company travelacross France and back to America to introduce other influential artists, including Cezanne, Renoir,Inness, Kensett, Turner, and Church. This stunning series holds wide appeal for armchair travelers,budding artists, and art students. Each 27-minute program can be purchased separately for $29.95. -- Candace Smith",1241481600,12,1758,5.584269662921348

8354191,5,B00277QFE4,"These DVD's are fabulous. Beautifully produced with excellent information. A joy to watch again and again. His approach to giving both practical instruction, combined with historical background, captures my attention again and again.",1381276800,,233,6.090909090909091
8354192,3,B00277QFE4,"I picked this up at the library for free.  I got them impression from the cover that David was going to paint a picture in the stlye of Monet explaining techniques as he goes.

He starts with a brief bio on Monet. The lesson is set in Monet's garden. David does use Monet's pallette of colors.  David paints most of the painting with a 1"" wide bristle brush, which is fine. But the way he slaps it around reminds me more of Bob Ross than Monet. After doing what I would consider to be a good start or a good underpainting, he takes a break to go see what ""other painters are doing"". He comes across Connie in the garden, who is also painting.  Under the pretext of helping her, he basically finishes up her painting.  He makes good points about perspective, asymetry, drawing the eye in, etc., (I suppose she represents the average student) but again, he does the whole thing by pouncing around his big 1-inch brush.  It does look easy, but I don't know if any galleries are going to buy the painting.

If you are painting for fun, this video does look easy. If you are serious student of Impressionism, don't expect much.

The scenary is beautiful, and so is the slow classical music.",1296000000,,1185,4.4036697247706424
8354193,5,B00277QFE4,"Saw a couple episodes on PBS (right after a Bob Ross show).  Although I paint primarily in watercolor, I wanted to play awhile in oils and acrylics (separately, of course).  Mr. Duncan's demonstrations using well-known landscape sites (like Monet's waterlilies with the little blue bridge) and then his follow-on critiques of student work on the same subject were helpful to me in overcoming a hesitancy of trying to paint actual and well-known landscapes for fear of being told, ""That doesn't look like the other paintings I've seen.""  In my opinion, his use of physical sites known to most persons who have even heard of Impressionism, even if we don't know the painters, was inspired because we recognize the subject being painted and are comfortable with it. Then, he shows us that painting is more than copying what we see or what was painted before - a good lesson for us all - and is encouraging to novices like me.  He also spends a little time talking about the physical properties of his paints which is also helpful - I don't have to spend so much time messing with them to learn how they ""feel"" on the canvas. I liked the ""Landscapes"" series enough that I also purchased his ""How-to"" DVDs on oil painting and acrylics. Off and on for several months now, I've watched one or more episodes (or parts thereof) and then tried out techniques he demonstrates.  Some of the techniques are making their way into my style, such as it is, and that's making me happy.",1261353600,12,1468,4.674418604651163
8354194,5,B00277QFE4,"There is a famous Buddhist proverb: ""When the student is ready,  the teacher will appear""  Are you ready for David Dunlop?
  A quantum leap from the dumbed-down art instruction of the  1980's with ""happy little trees"" and furry critters on the set, Landscapes Through Time offers a sophisticated synthesis of art history, theory and insightful instruction. Beautifully filmed on location where many of the greats of the art world lived and painted in Europe and the  U.S.  Dunlop starts each lesson with a passionate and articulate lecture, moves to a demonstration, then follows-up with a constructive critique of his students paintings.
  Nabbing two Emmy nominations, and a win for Writing, this series  trumps all previous TV art instruction shows for both content and production values, and, I must admit, outshines the famous art teachers I studied with in New York.  They might have been able to paint, but Dunlop knows how to teach! (and yes, he can paint too)  A far cry from TV art instruction by self-taught housewives, Dunlop attended Pratt for his Masters degree, and it shows!
  Even if you don't want to try landscape painting, the series is worth watching for the information it imparts about the development of various art movements, the lives of the artists, and the  stunning beauty of the locations. A great gift for any art lover, the  series  sells for less than the cost of a one day workshop with Dunlop. A must have for any art student, or art teacher who wants to become a better teacher.",1257897600,8,1514,4.8515625
