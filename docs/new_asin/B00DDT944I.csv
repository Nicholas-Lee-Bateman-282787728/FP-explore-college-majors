5793494,5,B00DDT944I,Director DJ Caruso tells the story of two children who were bullied at camp and they learn the lessons about how strong they are and able to overcome anything. A Must See for anyone who was a child/teen or who has a child/teen.,1375920000,4,227,4.3023255813953485

Intense at some points, but good to see them become friends over their adventure.

5793498,1,B00DDT944I,"While the premise for this movie should have been interesting, I couldn't past the glaring fail that was the incongruity of a story that purportedly takes place in 1984...but looks in almost every way like it was set very much in the here and now. Bar for a few token nods to the 80s - a decade so blatantly marked by fashions and hair styles people who lived through it still cringe about to this day - whoever produced these movie apparently thought some oversized geek glasses and a rotary phone were all it took to make the scenario totally plausible. I found it especially laughable when, near the beginning of the movie, the mother of the girl is first shown - in an office that in absolutely NO WAY resembles one from the 80s and sporting, yes you've guessed it, an outfit and hair do that could NOT have been any LESS 80s if it tried. Did someone maybe forget to give the people who were in charge of this a memo - you know, the one regarding the most obviously 80s accoutrements of big hair and shoulder pads?

I tried my best to get past this but I thought this was just an facepalmingly epic fail. Whatever the merits of the story told in this movie was completely lost on me due to the complete ineptitude at recreating something as simple as a believably 80s backdrop.",1460764800,,1281,4.382352941176471

5793516,3,B00DDT944I,"Based on ""The Goats"" by Brock Cole (while reading about that book is the first I'd ever heard of the movie version) it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the text, much closer than most book/movie adaptations are. If you/ your child liked the book you'll probably like the movie as well, may like it better as most of the, small amount of, nudity in the book has been left out. What little ""nudity"" there is you'll find to be more implied than anything- you, and the two kids, don't see anything much more than bare shoulders. A ""hell"" or two and the bare shoulders probably constitute most of the PG rating.
Personally I found the movie boring, the book a little better, but beautifully filmed- great use of light & color. The Special Features don't amount to much, just a short ""behind the scenes"" bit and a trailer. These, and the movie itself, have a sound level much lower than the previews that always seem to come on DVDs before the feature starts. Radha Mitchell and Val Kilmer were the only cast members I'd ever heard of.
The ending is actually better than the book which kind of left the reader hanging about a story resolution- you get one here.",1423526400,,1156,4.5095238095238095

As the movie summary suggests, this film encompasses two children that were ostracized by a ""horrible prank"" at camp, who instead of waiting to be the butt of the prank again, seek to get away finding themselves on an adventure of life and discovery.

The movie really is touching.  The acting is very authentic and just about anyone who has been bullied can relate to the children in the film.  Without spoiling the film, the movie takes a few twists and turns that kept my attention and at the end, it put a smile on my face, really a touching movie.  I saw this film was based on a book, which I haven't read, but now, after seeing the film I'd really like to read it.

5793527,4,B00DDT944I,"Very good family film that teaches kids if you're being treated wrong, you've got to do something about it.  Also highlights the benefit someone who lives a very inverted life from bullying, neglect by a parent or whatever gains from simply the friendship of one other person and the importance of parents, teachers, camp staff or whatever to do what they can to make sure lonely kids, bullied kids or whoever can find someone to enrich their life.

The title Standing Up is a bit incorrect for the characters being that they don't really stand up for themselves (they do stand up for each other as the movie goes on), but initially they remove themselves from a situation which isn't healthy for them even if doing so is a bit daunting and they may get in trouble for doing so.  Important that kids know to do that in real life.

Basic plot revolves a seen by other campers as the social loser of their summer camps, both from a neighbouring boys and girls camp, being dumped on an island, stripped of their clothes and abandoned for the amusement of everyone else.  This is a tradition at these two camps and the victims are known as goats (which is also the name of the book this is loosely based on).  In the film we don't exactly know what the intentions of the other kids is, but Howie (the boy) speculates the other kids have returned to take photographs of them and humiliate them further, so he convinces the almost crawled up into a ball Grace to steal a canoe and head downstream.  Then they decide to wait out the time before camp is over, Grace tries to get her mother to pick her up but her mother, a businesswoman thinks she needs to be at camp and that mixing with other kids is good for her, practically ignoring the pain and story Grace has told.  So the two kids decide to survive on their own.  Of course when the camp contacts the mother that Grace is missing, she suddenly wakes up to herself and comes but of course no one knows where Grace or Howie are at all.

Without giving away any of the plot from that point it's a good tale of friendship and loyalty and standing up for your friend when needed.  I liked how the producers didn't make the two kids have romantic feelings for each other or anything, which made it more realistic and probably didn't give a reason for kids the same age as the characters to want to stop watching at any time.

The two child actors Chandler Canterbury and Annalise Basso do a great job in the lead roles, even Val Kilmer does an a pretty good job in his minor role.  The story does have some plot holes in it but overall it's enjoyable enough that their not important enough to care.  It's a film you're not likely to watch over and over again but it's an enjoyable journey to watch at least once.",1405382400,,2757,4.36986301369863
5793528,3,B00DDT944I,"The book this film is based on ""The Goats"" is a much less sunny story of two kids violated and left to fend for themselves in  a cold and uninviting world. The film gives the story the afternoon special kind of vibe placing the kids in a beautiful Adirondack setting (where curiously all the leaves are tuning in high summer?)  where they have a series of adventures while they develop a tender pre-adolescent (and completely platonic) romance The directors have also fell for the ancient device of putting over-sized eyeglasses on two extremely pretty kids and expecting us to see them instantly as nerdy and unattractive. It rings hollow. The characters are largely one dimensional. The bullies from their own camp are predictably evil. The minority kids from the neighboring  poor kids camp are noble and good and the adults are stereotypical and clueless.

Still its  a sweet story with a happy ending. The backdrop for the story is beautiful and its a good one to watch with the kids.",1398988800,4,989,4.794117647058823

5793533,5,B00DDT944I,"I will say that I am in agreement with the other reviewers that this is *not* a children's movie. At best, it is a young adult movie, as the both the themes, language, and situations will be way too frightening and disturbing for a young child. It presents bullying in all of its horror, and the director, D.J. Caruso does a superb job in striking terror in the heart of the viewer at the three crucial moments of bullying. Thus, I would certainly *not* recommend it for young children.

That being said, however, the world we live in is very evil, and when you address a topic like social misfits in the midst of a bullying culture, it is very difficult to sanitize it. That is, in part, the genius of this film. The Caruso takes you into the world of two social misfits, and portrays that world exceptionally well. However, it doesn't end there; if it did, it might fit the horror movie genre. The relationship between the two children, a boy and a girl, are extremely central to this film-probably even more so than the theme of bullying. The director begins by using an instance of bullying to bring these children together. However, you don't know much about them at that point. However, in both the behavior and the discourse of these two children, their world is foreshadowed, and then opened up little by little in a very brilliant fashion. The boy is an extremely pragmatic individual, who take the lead in survival throughout most of the film. There are certain things, such as the cut-up-people in the museum which disturb him though, and his protection of the girl, even from the earliest parts of the film, powerfully foreshadow the background that you find out about him at the end of the film-information that shows you why he needed her as much as she needed him.

I often wondered throughout the film if the girl might have been portraying someone with a mild case of Asperger's Syndrome. She is extremely intelligent with her love of rockets and space [not to mention the way she gets them a motel room for the night!], but is very socially awkward. She even says that she is socially retarded for her age, and doesn't have many friends. She is also extremely susceptible to powerful emotional breakdowns, and even physical retaliation at times. The mentioning of the cut-up people in the museum during breakfast is a classic lack of recognition of the situation in which you are speaking-although the boy does not seem to mind much as, by this point in time, they already are growing extremely close. Also, people with AS have been shown to be susceptible to bullying, because they are so different. While AS is traditionally understood as more rare in women, even her complaints about temperature made you wonder if the screen writer was, even subconsciously, portraying a girl with AS.

How these two personalities interact is probably the most central thread of the film. There are times when they are angry with one another, and lie to one another, but there are also times you can tell when their two personalities help one another. For example, the girl forces the boy to wrestle with the ethical issue of taking things-even if they are taking them because they need them to survive. However, because you don't know much about the children at the beginning of the movie, the author is able to bring them together slowly, bit by bit, and then, when you finally do understand these two children, as you get more information, it hits you how much they need one another, and how deep their relationship has grown. In fact, the skill of the writer can be seen in precisely when you learn the names of these children. You don't normally learn the names of the main characters at that point in *any* movie. This is one of those movies that can actually be more powerful on the second or third showing.

That very powerfully relates to another theme in the movie and that is the girl's relationship to her mother. Her and her mother don't communicate very well, as she says, and one of the themes of the movie is how the mother, through this whole experience, comes to understand her daughter, and especially the evil she faces because she is so different then the other kids-evil worse than simple carrot-top jokes. This is what makes the final scene at the honey stand so powerful when her mother can finally, not only understand the pain intellectually, but finally empathize fully with her daughter's pain.

Of course, lying in the background is the theme of providence. One of the key moments in the movie is when the girl says that ""God gives you what you need when times get tough."" She acknowledges, even at the beginning of the film, that God brought her and the boy together to help them through this time. Thus, although the movie is complex with many different themes, there is purpose and direction given to all of the events by divine providence. There is a comfort in that-a comfort that many people who seek to address the issue of bullying from a secular perspective will have difficulty understanding. In fact, one reviewer I read noticed that divine providence created a kind of book end around the movie as it is mentioned at the beginning and at the end. Although it is not explicitly stated in the rest of the film, it is there, and has a role to play.

As can be readily seen, this movie is a masterpiece of characterization. Not just in terms of the development of the individual characters, but in terms of the way in which those characters are developed in the context of their relationship to one another. These relational themes make the movie extremely complex, but when they are finally brought together, the result is so powerful that I have not watched this movie once without crying. It also points out that the problem with bullying may be a sociological problem as much as a moral problem. The realization that social pressure can influence you to do things you would not ordinarily do, or, on the other hand, influence you for the good to overcome bullying is a profound message of this film.

Because of all of these things, I highly recommend ""Standing Up"" as a powerful addition to your movie collection-although, certainly, only for viewers who will be able to handle these themes.",1386374400,7,6238,4.675774134790529

If, on the other hand, you prefer films that try to capture some authentic aspect of the human condition, you will love this film. Based on the great young adult novel by Brock Cole, this film takes its place amongst the greatest coming of age films of all time: Lucas, Stand By Me, My Life As A Dog, etc. Films like this come along once a decade.

Two pre-teens are the victim of a brutal hazing ritual at Summer camp. Rather than face the humiliation of returning to camp, the two kids take off on their own. What follows is an often moving, sometimes funny, journey of self-discovery as the two kids come to grips with what happened to them and why.

This is a thoughtful and compelling film.

8592310,4,B00DDT944I,"Liked this movie because it was different. Had never heard of either of the two main actors, however, I think they did a better job then the adults in the movie. Of course, the way the movie was written leans more towards them being smarter than the adults anyway. Who leaves teens (or pre-teens) unattended at summer camp? Didn't like the ending very much, but I won't give it away.",1488585600,2,383,4.485714285714286
