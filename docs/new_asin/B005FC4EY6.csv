8469855,5,B005FC4EY6,"Sonny Boy is a movie that covers many topics: Walderman is black, Rika is white; he is barely 20, she is almost 40; he is a student from Suriname (a former Dutch colony), she is married with four children. When these two characters meet in 1928 the dilemma of being a free spirit or submitting your life to heresay begins.

I have never been a fan of films about Nazism, however, I am glad that this wasn't the main topic but part of the story. The last part of the film about what the three main characters go through because of Nazism is very moving, although if you've watched holocaust films before, don't expect to see anything new about it in this movie.

All in all, Sonny Boy is a moving film about a true story, beautifully shot and featuring not only great performances, but a plot about an issue that I've never seen covered in other films before.",1349395200,2,858,4.389937106918239
