8313573,5,B001JQN1SM,I really enjoyed this interview; I learned many things about Joss that I hadn't known prior and I'm quite the Whedon fan.  A must for any Joss Whedon fan.,1463875200,,154,4.310344827586207
8313574,3,B001JQN1SM,"I am a huge Joss Whedon fan and very much interested in writing. I often listen to things like the Creative Screenwriting Podcast and Jeff Goldsmith's Q&A podcast, and so I am familiar with Hollywood writers talking about their craft, their industry, and I love learning about their processes and experiences.

When I heard about there being an hour long interview with one of my favourite writers _on the topic of writing_, my excitement levels reached fever-pitch. I immediately ordered the DVD, blessed Jeff Berman's existence, and watched it as soon as it arrived.

It would be fair to say that my expectations were a little high. I was expecting a thoroughly in-depth, intellectual, almost practical, interview from one professional writer to another, with maybe a few war-stories thrown in. Unfortunately I was surprised and disappointed at just how little of the interview was actually about writing or the industry.

Questions, and the interview itself, seemed to come from a fan perspective, and Berman seemed a little starstruck. A fan-based interview isn't the worst thing in the world for a fan like myself, but unfortunately even those questions were lacking.

Berman occasionally showed a lack of familiarity with Whedon's work (although I guess he can't be expected to know everything), and sometimes unfortunately trod ground that has been well-covered in other Whedon interviews.

The lowest point for me came when Berman asked, ""Who's your favourite character?"". My head fell into my hands, and I swear I could see Whedon thinking, ""Why have I agreed to do this again? Wasn't this supposed to be about writing? You know, offering advice and insight to up-and-coming writers?"".

I still don't know: Does Whedon outline? How fast does he write? Does he really only ever write one draft? How did he manage to run three shows at once? What was his input into his various shows at different times? How is running a show different from writing for one? How did he learn the skills required for his craft; Dealing with networks, managing writing staff, working with actors, etc.? What writers inspired him? What film-makers inspire him? Does he really feel that the Writers' Strike was a failure? How does an artist in Hollywood reconcile the business with the art?

The best piece of advice that Whedon gave was the unprompted, ""You either have to write or you shouldn't be writing"". (A bit of necessary tough love to any people like me who entertain vague notions of writing.)

There were some interesting insights for the Joss Whedon fan, thankfully, but not enough that I could heartily recommend this DVD. Often it felt as though Whedon really wanted to open up and talk with great detail and candidness about anything, but it appears that Berman's skills as an interviewer (and Whedon's respect for someone else's production) don't ever allow us to get there.

On the plus side, some interesting things do slip through: You get to see where Whedon likes to work, hear what an average day is like, and learn some behind-the-scenes titbits (Spike was moved over to ""Angel"" because the WB wouldn't renew the series without him).

Ultimately it didn't go deep enough into any particular subject to be authoritative for me; Not into Whedon's personal experiences, nor into his opinions on writing. Given the length of the interview, and the apparent openness of Whedon, the whole endeavour feels like a heartbreakingly wasted opportunity.

I could only recommend this DVD for die-hard Whedon fans, and to be honest, they've probably already bought copies. Unfortunately I don't believe it offers much insight for those who are trying to break into the industry, or those who wish to improve or reconsider their own craft through the teachings of a revered professional.

There's still a comprehensive and definitive interview with Joss Whedon waiting to be made. Either about his thoughts and tips about writing and working in the industry, or just about him and his life and experiences. I hope I get to watch at least one of them, eventually.",1312502400,4,4056,5.001483679525222
8313575,5,B001JQN1SM,"I came to this DVD as a fan of Whedon's and a writer (although obviously not a Whedony writer--I've mostly produced marketing copy and journalism).  I was pleased both as a fan and as a student of good writing.  Whedon, who can sometimes come off glib or flip, gave a serious interview rich in insight seasoned with trademark Whedon self-deprecating humor.  The interview covers Whedon's history, influences, and work habits, with a range of entertaining digressions.  It's only an hour-long conversation, so I don't wish to claim TOO much for it, but I came away with a better understanding and appreciation of Whedon's talent (and I'm already a hopeless fanboy...see my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity-Lunch-Box/dp/B0010EN7KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity Lunch Box</a>.  I have to say, though, that if I had come to this DVD purely as a fanboy--someone in love with the Whedonverse stories and characters--I think I would have come away from it pretty disappointed.  The emphasis here really is on writing.",1285632000,,1077,5.7
8313576,4,B001JQN1SM,"The subject of this interview would probably hate that I had a dumb ad tagline stuck in my mind when I started to hear him speak, but in an era of disposable TV celebrity he really is a legend.  If you've laughed at a comedy in thirty years, Sam Simon is probably part of the reason, whether his name is familiar or not. I admired his reluctance to take too much credit for himself, as well as the way that he said comedy is funnier when it comes from people with a wide range of life experience.
On a less exalted frame, finally! Someone as unimpressed by ""Family Guy"" as I am. And it would be hard to say the five-time Emmy winner's ""just jealous"".",1254355200,,650,4.2
