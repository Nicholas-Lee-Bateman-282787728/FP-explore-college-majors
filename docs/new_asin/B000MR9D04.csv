Pilots will quickly note that the ""rules"" have been adapted to fit the film, but it's all in good fun.  This is one of the few flying videos I know of that my wife actually liked.",1261699200,,318,4.080645161290323
8171040,3,B000MR9D04,"This is worth watching because the flying scenes are so terrific: there is stunt flying, precision low-level  flying in the mountains, a glider flight, and so on. Some of it is spectacular and it is beautifully photographed.

To see the flying you have to put with the framing device, a typical cliched imax story about a single young female journalist who is afraid of flying but gets the opportunity when she is interviewing a single good looking young pilot. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen?",1190160000,2,499,4.790697674418604
