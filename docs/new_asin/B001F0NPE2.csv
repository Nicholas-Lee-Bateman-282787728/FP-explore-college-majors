8300160,5,B001F0NPE2,"I loved watching it! As a child, I remember watching a fairy tale about Buratino, it was called - ""The Golden Key, or the Advantures of Buratino"", also reading a book about Cippolino.

I cannot compare a book to a cartoon, but I love them both! The way the cartoons were made at that time, so close to real, you almost start to believe that they're real (the characters), and not drawn. This is the way they used to make cartoons in the early Soviet era, especially in the 50s. Most of the cartoons that were made at that period of time are incomparable! I wish there were more cartoons like this nowadays - beautiful to watch, and with a meaning, or a morale!",1304035200,,660,4.32258064516129
