8221145,5,B000SL1VJK,"Of all the versions and interpretations of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. It's nearly as close to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions,which should not detract from the main plot - the realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece, not just another sword-and-sandal Hollywood production B-flick like the 1955 Kirk Douglas version nor the bastardised and over-rated TV mini series starring Armand Assante (with my most sincere apologies if their followers are offended by my remarks). Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did, and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more. A great pity that this is highly underrated and not as well-known as the other popular but less accurate versions.",1370995200,4,1167,4.869346733668341
8221146,5,B000SL1VJK,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon, not even knowing whether it was available since it had been done in the 60s. I had seen many episodes from it on the internet (it was originally a TV serial) and fell in love with it. The main possible problem is that it is in Italian, which I don't really understand. But knowing the basic plot of the Odyssey, I had no difficulty following it. It has been reviewed as the best Homeric adaptation of all tines, including the recent ""Troy"". It is directed by Franco Rossi and stars the very attractive Bekim Femhiu, an extremely popular Albanian actor who has since died, and the great Greek Irene Papas. Having been forewarned about the possible language problem, I recommend it without reservation. It plays for 370 minutes on two disks.",1347580800,3,771,4.635036496350365
8221147,5,B000SL1VJK,"Still criminally unknown by the major public, this is the one series that does Homer's epic justice as no Hollywood movie was ever able to. The cast, except for probably Irene Papas as Ulysses' wife Penelope will probably be unknown to most viewers, but this should not stop you. As a child I saw this on German television and it made an indelible impression on me which lead me some years later to start a long search to get hold of it and now finally a dvd is available. It is in Italian and no other subtitles, so I had to take refuge to the German dubbed version, which somehow manages to preserve the series' poetry and magic. No multi-million special effects are to be seen, the series doesn't need it, as the atmosphere is so spellbinding and poetic, it still manages to keep me on the edge of my seat so many years later and it has lost nothing of its potency.
Any movie buff or lover of the classics out there should discover this masterpiece and let themselves be swept away on Ulysses wondrous journey.",1335744000,5,1013,4.422459893048129
