8266655,5,B0017NRNYK,"Seriously, why isn't this thing on DVD? Or Blu-Ray? Heck, we've got the three women of the original Saturday Night Live cast  front and center with two of the greatest deadpan humorists of the 20th century. My mom turned me on to these guys in their NPR years, and I've been an addict ever since. And okay, deadpan humor is not everybody's bag. And yes, not all of the gags are all that funny if you aren't up on the Bob & Ray universe. To that, I have only one thing to say:

Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?

No, not me. The Rod Stewart song. That most seventies-est of tunes gets the Bob & Ray treatment in what is, to my mind, the funniest song parody EVER. I have yet to show this to someone and not have them just utterly break up over it. If you want to see why these guys had four decades of rabid fans, this five minute sketch does a better ob of encapsulating it then a wall full of scholarly works. Seriously, this bit is worth the price of the tape alone, hunting it down, converting it to something you can actually watch. It's that good.

Bob & Ray were amazing. Funny as hell and always in complete earnest. This show is like a passing of the torch from one generation of comedy innovators to the next, and is definitely worth seeing.",1386374400,2,1238,4.189075630252101
