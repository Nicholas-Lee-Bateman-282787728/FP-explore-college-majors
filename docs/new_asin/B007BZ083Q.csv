5074618,5,B007BZ083Q,"This message is for the FOX CEO in charge of DVD releases for BIG VALLEY. Thanks for giving me Big Valley Season 1 and Season 2 Vol 1.....now, a question...what comes after Vol 1???? I believe it is called Vol 2????  I have been waiting years now for that issue....and nothing has happened.  You took my $ and then quit issuing one of my favourite shows. Why don't you just put out the complete series, as I can't wait 25 more years for you to give me Vol 2.",1273968000,36,458,4.134831460674158

I never saw this show when it first came out, but used to watch the reruns on the weekends with a neighbor.  I used to wish I could live next door to the Barkleys and I still do.  It was refreshing to see a powerful woman, Victoria Barkley, in a western.  Her sons & daughter are all so dreamy to watch and see what trouble will happen to them in the next episode.

5074715,1,B007BZ083Q,"Big Valley is my ""all-time"" favorite TV western, so I was ""extremely upset"" when I discovered they only have select episodes from each season and not the complete season. The original series went as follows: Season 1 & 2, 30 episodes each season; Season 3 & 4, 26 episodes each season. Now HERE is what the DVD collections offer: Season 1 - 18 episodes; Season 2 - 15 episodes; Season 3 - 30 episodes; & Season 4 - 30 episodes. I was like a little kid at Christmas when I saw seasons 3 & 4 being released; when I checked the episodes I discovered some of the 30 in Season 3 are actually from Season 2, and some AREN'T THERE AT ALL!! What a complete mess!! I was looking all over for one of my favorite episodes, ""Court Martial"", only to discover it's not in ANY of the 4 Season collections. Did I return this : NO!! I love the show, and better to have 2/3rd's of the season in HD then none; but DO NOT BE FOOLED!!! NONE OF THESE ARE THE ""COMPLETE"" SEASONS!!! Fans such as us are regulated to scratchy TV copies of the episodes they did not want to include. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!",1422316800,3,1077,4.233009708737864

5074733,5,B007BZ083Q,"Final season for this fine series. In the same mold as Bonanza and The High Chaparral---which is long overdue to
be released on DVD. What's the holdup?",1418688000,,151,4.62962962962963
5074734,5,B007BZ083Q,"Just a year ago, I was frustrated because it seemed that all the seasons of Big Valley were never going to be released.  But I just finished watching the first few discs of Season 4--so I have to say thank you to Timeless Media/Shout Factory.  The DVD's are no-frills, but it doesn't really matter.  The only thing I needed was an episode guide that I printed off the internet so I would know which episode was which.  Other than that, the DVD's are fine.
  And the show?  Big Valley is still a great show.  What makes it so good for me is the writing and the stories--at it's best, the show has the Barkley's standing up for what is right, fighting with others in the names of morality.  They are truly good people trying to do the right thing.  Somewhere during 3rd season, it started that they all the brothers pretty much wore the same outfit every episode.  Also, like Audra was missing the second half of season 3, so far into season 4, there hasn't been as much Heath.  Big Valley, at it's best, is when the whole family is on together, or at least two or more of the brothers.  Too many episodes have them off on adventures by themselves.  Those are still good stories, but they are so much better when they play off each other or back each other up.
  So again, thank you Timeless Media for finally releasing all the rest of the seasons of this excellent show!",1418515200,6,1369,4.351778656126482

Some of the plots seem unbelievable and there is a continual need for people to die in every plot and having three adult men and an adult daughter all living with mom is a plot line that can't go forever, so I can understand that this was the end. Interestingly, the two female leads seemed always to dress 20th-century styles for what was supposedly approximately 1870.",1417046400,2,433,4.564102564102564

5074751,3,B007BZ083Q,"As others have astutely noted the new DVD's Season 4 main titles are incorrect, just as Shout Factory blundered Season 2's. Has Shout Factory ever heard of the UCLA Film and TV Archive?!  As most people in ""the industry"" and ""academia"" know, among its vast holdings the wonderful UCLA Film and TV Archive holds over 20,000 ""as broadcast"" (i.e., full length) film reels and tapes of hundreds of ABC programs, including every episode of our beloved ""The Big Valley.""  That includes elements like ""'The Big Valley' in Color,"" mid-show identification break, commercials, billboards, bumpers and previews.  It's a public website; check it out!  Shout Factory could have easily commissioned the UCLA Archive to make a brilliant dupe of season 4's (unique) main title from one episode and simply replace all the incorrect season 3 main titles on the season 4 master copies (sloppily) supplied by the distributor and/or rights holder of ""The Big Valley.""  We really need to see the different visuals and hear the altered, beautiful theme of ""The Big Valley's"" final season.  But Shout Factory let us buyers down.  Again.  It sounds so irresponsible of the Shout Factory spokesperson to use the lame excuse, ""Well, that's what they delivered.""  Now, at a minimum, its packaging should alert all buyers that the enclosed episodes are not a true representation of their original network run, as other major, legitimate distributors practice.",1415404800,23,1430,5.1558441558441555
5074752,3,B007BZ083Q,"Once again, I am very disappointed that the ORIGINAL Intro credits are not used...and using Season's 3 opening instead, just like Season 2 used the Season 1 opening. Current syndication runs for Season 2  & 4 on Television have this problem, so I contacted Shout Factory when Season 2 was released with the wrong intro, to find out why, and they said the master tapes came from the current rights holder, a third party.  They also said they would pay close attention to the remaining seasons to prevent this from happening again. Obviously they didn't prevent it. Every season episode begins with an opening scene followed by the intro credits already in the episode itself. I wish someone could explain HOW and WHY, Season 2 & 4's intro's got messed up and apparently are missing from the master tapes?????  The last time I seen the correct intro's were when the Family Channel ran it back in the early 90's. I liked Season's 4 original intro the best.  Why can't these shows be released in tact as they originally ran, with previews to the next episode as well.",1415145600,4,1063,4.668449197860962

For a purist, like myself, I am dismayed that the original Season 4 intro was not used on the DVD. Those of you who remember, know it was similar to Season 3, but the music was arranged differently, the cast vignettes were re-filmed (R. Long in a fringed leather coat, P. Breck still in his hat, L. Majors with a bandana, L. Evans with hair combed high up and back over her head, B. Stanwyck with a much more serious look than the Season 3 intro). I last saw it aired when the show was first in syndication in the early 1970's - two and three years after the series ended. I have stills from it, but they are in B&W. In later years, when the series was sent to stations on tape, the Season 3 intro - for some reason - was used on all Season 4 shows. I love the characters, and the stories. There are a lot of great westerns out there - but to have the strong matriarch role in any of them was unheard of, and made ""Valley"" unique. Thanks to Shout Factory and Timeless Media for taking this series and completing what Sony refused to. I hope you will bring us more of what they fail to deliver.",1414627200,16,1198,4.102127659574468

Apparently The Big Valley Season 1 did not sell well and they chose not to release anymore.
