7829392,4,6302645905,"This film by Paul Cox follows the last days of a terminally ill elderly woman. Doesn't sound like a bundle of laughs does it? And it's not. However a beautiful and touching performance by the extraordinary Sheila Florance (Lizzie Birdsworth in TV's ""Prisoner"") in the lead sustains and adds depth to the narrative  -  eerily strengthened by the fact that Florance was herself dying (of cancer) while the film was being made, and died soon after its completion. Her fascinating wizened and wrinkled face, and gravelly ""whisky sour"" voice radiate every nuance in the character, imbuing the bleak and otherwise depressing film with honesty, hope, wisdom and grief in equal measures. The supporting cast contributes effectively, particularly Cox's wife, Gosia Dobrowolska, who is amongst the closest to the dying woman. It's the luminous Sheila Florance who is remembered long after the fade-out. R.I.P.",1388966400,2,899,5.27972027972028
7829393,5,6302645905,"As Lizzie Birdsworth on Prisioner ( Prisoner Cell Block H in America } MS. Florence made us laugh at her attempts to smuggle ""Grog"" into Wentworth. In this movie, she showed us another side of herself.  A COURAGEOUS woman struggling with Cancer which she was herself batteling during the time.  An inspiration to us all! I should have been so lucky to meet her!  Hope they release this movie on DVD in the future!",1355961600,2,413,4.554054054054054
7829394,5,6302645905,"This movie is incredibly touching.  There are really two stories here.  The first is a portrayal of a woman facing imminent death with dignity and grace, and who continues to live life as fully as possible.  The second story is one of friendship.  Martha, the elderly woman, makes her home available to her visiting nurse so that the younger woman can carry on an affair with a married man.  Martha laments that her son ""married the wrong woman...most of them do"" and this leads her to sympathize with the young lovers.  In return, the nurse is the only one who understands and defends Martha's need for independence and control over her declining health.  The story of the friendship between the two women, who have come to deeply love each other, is beautiful to watch.",1017273600,9,771,4.708955223880597
7829395,4,6302645905,"A touching, sensitive, Australian film about an elderly woman dying of cancer (played by 78 year old actress Sheila Florance who knew she was dying of cancer when the film was being made) who has lost none of her joie de vivre and continues to live life to the fullest without the smallest hint of self-pity for her future death, which she knows is imminent.
The marvelous thing about this film is watching Florance's cheerful disposition, while those around her wear long faces. Through flashbacks, we see the tragedy of her past life; and in the present, the resignation of the other old people living in her apartment building who once led formerly productive, vigorous lives, but have now given up. She never gives up and this strength inspires much younger people------who only grudgingly tolerate her-----to admire her strength and see older people in a different way. This used to be referred to as a ""small film"" but with great feeling behind it.",983664000,21,954,4.858895705521473
