2460328,4,B000CEV3K0,I ran across this movie channel surfing and was quickly swept in.  It's a little of The Joy Luck Club meets Guess who's coming to dinner!,1195948800,3,137,4.269230769230769
2460329,5,B000CEV3K0,"I stumbled onto this movie one weekend - I got my copy 10 days later.  For me, the clashing/merging of Asian and African-American cultures was an interesting juxtaposition.  I recommend the movie - it's a little different...Five stars...",1176336000,3,237,5.2105263157894735
2460330,1,B000CEV3K0,"Like Joy Luck Club, this sort of movie misportray a lot of things about Chinese people. As a Chinese-American, I find these films offensive: Asian men are being portrayed as male-chauvinistic and uncaring, whereas American men are portrayed as the women's saviors!! How racist can this movie be!!

Also, Asian women do not wear long-Chinese dresses at home all the times. These dresses are reserved for ceremonies such as marriage.

For people who are really interested in understanding the treatment of gender in Asian culture, I recommend foreign films made in Asia.",1157932800,10,568,5.163043478260869
2460331,4,B000CEV3K0,"Mothers/Daughters...Daughters/Mothers: no matter what country, what city, what culture there are always issues, disputes and of course the ritual rite of passage of breaking the apron strings.
In ""Face"" all of these issues are even more convoluted because into the mix we have a Grandmother (the wonderful Kieu Chinh so good in ""Joy Luck Club""), the particular restrictions of the Chinese culture, an African-American boyfriend (Treach as Michael) and a daughter Genie (Kristy Wu), who was deserted at a young age by her career obsessed Mother (Bai Ling): who returns from Hong Kong with the hopes to re-connect with her daughter.
Particularly memorable here is the romance between Michael and Genie which flips the usual man/woman relationship on its head by having Michael,a Club DJ, as the more committed, the more willing of the two to declare his emotions and as portrayed by  Treach, an unusual and persuasive mix of in your face machismo and hearts and flowers valentine card.
Director and co-writer, Bertha Bay- Sa Pan obviously knows this terrain well and she empowers all of these women, but particularly Genie with a quick wit, horse sense and a fiery, impassioned intelligence.
""Face"" is about how we are perceived and limited because of what is on our exterior: imprinted on our face by way of our heritage. Bertha Bay-San Pa spends an hour and a half blasting those stereotypical thoughts and attitudes into the stratosphere once and for all.",1147132800,7,1456,5.066666666666666
8098210,5,B000CEV3K0,Love the actress Bas Ling & the movie. I recommend this seller,1490572800,,62,4.25

8098212,4,B000CEV3K0,"This is a good movie.  Four stars.  Asian American-themed movies are a real gift to our society and I am thankful to see this one.  I thought the acting was strong.  Kristy Wu is very convincing and (sorry if this is the wrong thing to say) exceptionally beautiful.  Bai Ling shows real range playing both her younger and her more mature self.  Impressive!  I would disagree with the reviewer who said the music was bad.  The music wasn't presented to be the best music of all time, it was presented to establish a sense of place, and it did a perfectly good job of that.  Do yourself a favor and check this out.  Favorite line:  ""You an angry Black man in an Asian girl's body.""",1482278400,2,679,4.352
8098213,1,B000CEV3K0,"If I could give a negative five star I would. The acting and the music was horrible. The storyline has the potential, in more talented hands, to really look at date rape, honor marriage and the abandonment a child of rape feels when rejected by their mother. This film was a waste of time.",1479168000,,289,4.37037037037037
8098214,1,B000CEV3K0,Well the aspect ratio is a dogs breakfast on this DVD release by Indican Pictures.  It is um... a 1.85:1 vertically squished to fit a 2.35:1 ratio AND presented in a 4:3 format.  Result - loads of fat objects with hideous black bars on all 4 sides. Urgh....,1466726400,,257,4.333333333333333
8098215,5,B000CEV3K0,"Face explores subtly the tensions that arise among three generations of Asian immigrants, a study that seems to apply well to all our immigrant histories, the loving grandmother who assumes she need not change any of her traditional values, the obedient daughter whose life is destroyed by trying to be the perfect daughter, the granddaughter who, while she loves her grandmother, looks beyond China Town. Pan refuses to glibly tie together all three generations, all three women following their generational perceptions, tearing the three trio apart.",1465948800,2,551,5.4186046511627906
