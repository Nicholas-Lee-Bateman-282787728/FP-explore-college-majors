7888458,5,6305334684,"For those who follow Dario Argento's movies one wonders where his ideas for inspiration comes from. This documentary, directed by Michele Soavi, shines a new light on Argento's approach to filmmaking. Just about every facet is covered; he explains in great detail what frightened him when he was a child, his choice of music, his crew (with crew members themselves explaining their roles and equipment they used), his dreams (and nightmares), why the close up of every murderer's hand are always his, and the main reason why he wants to make movies (I won't give it away), all interspersed with scenes from his movies (and behind the scenes from his movies). After watching this, one can't help but be in awe of the man and his films. The extras on this DVD are skimpy (only Argento's filmography, not even an acknowledgement to Michele Soavi) but the feature more than makes up for it. Three cheers for Michele Soavi for making this documentary and a big thank you to Dario Argento for your blood, sweat, and tears that goes into each and every film you do.",985478400,4,1058,4.724324324324324
