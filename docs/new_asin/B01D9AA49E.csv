7704808,3,B01D9AA49E,"I gave this movie 3 stars, action was ok but just ok for a low budget movie.",1464566400,6,76,3.5294117647058822
7704809,2,B01D9AA49E,"Note that Seagal plays only a small, although large (portly) role...",1464393600,2,68,5.2727272727272725
7704810,1,B01D9AA49E,"This is another Seagal and Michael Jai White where there is little of either one.

Jack (John Edward Lee) has a Thai girlfriend Avalon (Pim Bubear) who works in a night club and a friend Sam (Byron Gibson) who doesn't like to be called stupid. They rob a bank in Cambodia and escape across the border. They ended up getting more money than they expected, What they don't know is that the money is marked and belongs to the lumbering crime boss Seagal. This then involves more robberies and a double cross.

This was basically a boring action/crime flick. Seagal has a fight scene in the beginning, but clearly he can't move anymore. John Edward Lee couldn't carry the film as his character was to play a straight man to everyone else, people who didn't have any decent lines.

This Seagal film was every bit as good as: ""Sniper: Special Ops"" for what its worth.

Guide: F-word. Rating claims ""brief sexuality and nudity"" I missed the nudity. 1 1/2 stars",1463788800,3,953,4.588235294117647
7704811,3,B01D9AA49E,"This film was interesting. A bank robber accidentally steals Seagal's money and is forced to rob additional banks. Seagal tries to track down who is stealing his money from the banks. White is wasted in a small cameo. He should've beaten up a few people at least. Seagal has a nice fight scene in the beginning. He yells and smacks people around for most of the film. He also has a love interest who he teaches martial arts. Nice to see Seagal treat a woman with love and respect. This is an entertaining film and the ending was not what you'd expect. A C  is a love story. It's also about betrayal. Seagal does a good job with his scenes. He should've had a few more fight scenes to increase the action. His character was well written, menacing but likable. The film mainly features several exciting bank heists and shootouts. There are several fights two involving Seagal and one poor guy gets thrown out the window. The love story of the main two characters makes the film enjoyable. Brief nudity, profanity and violence but no sex.",1463356800,17,1035,4.564516129032258

Steven does His part in movie as His millions of $$$$$$ is being stolen from different Banks. Steven looks old, grossly overweight and mean dressed in all black lol.

7704858,1,B01D9AA49E,Segal needs to retire and stop making these pathetic movies with poor acting.

7704862,3,B01D9AA49E,"Steven Seagal is in this film more than several of the reviews here claim. As the drug lord from who the two protagonists steal, Seagal pops up throughout the film, though he's mostly a speaking role with little martial arts included. And it's different than his other roles - he's not out saving the day but instead is a bad guy getting jacked by thieves while also being double-crossed by one of his own men. So it's a different role for him (that I've seen) and it makes it interesting. Michael Jai White, however, has only one scene in the movie, and while he's a powerful presence, it's hardly worth his face on the cover.

The film itself is ok, not great, but an enjoyable watch. It's definitely a low budget endeavor but the backdrop of Thailand along with some solid directing and camera work pick ups much of the slack. It's a well-paced bank heist story with several interesting elements, including an inside man with a vendetta towards Seagal, and a unique ""switching out"" of heist partners about 2/3 of the way through. No over-the-top, ""every 15 minutes a fight scene"" action but instead it's more about suspense and nuggets of conflict where it supports the story.

Strongest character in my opinion was Niran, the ""rat on the inside"" played by Sahajak Boonthanakit (Nicolas Refn's ""Only God Forgives""). Very understated but nefarious, and a decent actor. The lead, John Lee Edward, not so much - in fact, pretty bad. His girlfriend, Pim Bubear, made up for Edward though with a comfortable, genuine ease to her performance that somewhat balanced out the pair.

Asian Connection offers an interesting blend of action and suspense from a story and characters you wouldn't expect. Definitely worth a watch.",1465084800,2,1719,4.820338983050847
8755216,5,B01D9AA49E,I can't believe I just watched another Steven Segal. It doesn't get any better than that. The rest of this review is redundant. The shooting is good. The pursuits are good. There is plenty of punching and kicking. There is explosions. The story is not complicated; I like it. This is the fourth movie in a row that I watched in 5.1 surround sound. The surround sound contribution was very relevant.,1525824000,,398,4.619718309859155
