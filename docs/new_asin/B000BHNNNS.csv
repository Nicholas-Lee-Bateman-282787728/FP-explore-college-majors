2417295,5,B000BHNNNS,"This DVD is the first real tool I have found that makes it easy to learn how to do exercises such as Pilates or Yoga. I attended a group yoga class for a while, but I was always just barely keeping up, and as soon as I got home I would forget how to do the exercises.

Here everything is explained in detail, and shown from 3 different angles. But you are not forced to watch or hear the same explanations over and over, you have complete control over the sequence of events. As a computer programmer, I really appreciate the elegance of the navigational structure of this DVD.

First there is an introduction that explains the entire theory behind Pilates, and gives you an overview of the components that make up each exercise. But, if you are already an expert, you need never watch this particular piece, you can go directly to the exercises.

When following a particular exercise, the verbal instructions are very simple and soothing. In fact, this is the most relaxing DVD I have ever encountered, both visually and aurally. You may choose to listen to very pleasant background music, or turn it off.

If you can't see exactly how to perform the exercise, switching to another camera angle will usually help. But if you forget some vital point, clicking the enter button will take you to the ""Plus"" track. This track is in addition to general introduction, and gives a step-by-step explanation of the current exercise you were viewing. When the individual explanation is complete, the DVD will automatically return you to the beginning of that exercise. Or if you wish, you can click the enter button again and return immediately. These options are shown as a ""+"" sign on the exercise video and a ""-"" sign on the explanation video, and can be turned on or off.

The ability to program any number of exercises in the order you want is accomplished through the Design menu. On this menu, you just click on the exercise names in the sequence you want. Then you can hit Preview, and it will show you names you have chosen, so you can double-check. Or you can hit Reset and start over. Then when you hit play, it will play those particular exercises, while still giving you access to the plus track. You can even include the same exercise multiple times, up to a total of 24 total selections.

You can also Loop the chosen exercises forever (until you hit an appropriate remote key), in sequence or even randomly. There is also a context-sensitive Help key for each menu, and all of the important menu buttons are repeated identically on each menu, so you never lose your place.

All in all, this is an awesome DVD!",1128297600,3,2616,4.588865096359743
2417296,5,B000BHNNNS,"I have looked over a number of Pilates DVDs, so I have some experience, not to mention a bad back.  I had seen the Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa in this same series, so I knew this was worth checking out. This DVD is the real deal. It offers 3-camera angles on all 20 exercises, which is a great help. As many of you may know, Pilates is a powerful, but somewhat subtle technique. Having three camera angles available at all times really makes it clear how to do these exercises properly. Another feature that I find indispensable is the ability to program the exercises in any order I want. My back problems are such that I need to cycle through a particular series of exercises and this DVD lets me do just that. I also like the gentle background music, which you can turn on or off.

And last, perhaps the feature that makes this DVD ideal for me is the ""Plus"" button. Let me explain it, since it really is a plus. Each of the exercises takes you through a period of actually doing that exercise, so that you can chain them together to custom-build a daily workout. For most exercises, there is a button you can press for a complete introduction to that exercise, explaining why it helps, and just how to do it. You only need to see these sections once or twice to get the idea for each exercise. In this way, it does not intrude into the flow of the actual exercises. I find this totally useful. I don't have to go to some other section of the DVD for instruction. It is built in to each exercise and always there to remind me, if I need it.

This is, by far, the best Pilates DVD I have come across to date.",1128297600,5,1613,4.213592233009709
2417297,5,B000BHNNNS,"Having enjoyed and reviewed this company's Salsa lessons on DVD, watching this unique approach to yet another form of exercise was technically no surprise,  The folks at Digifilm have entered the workout arena with this QUICK AND DIRTY GUIDE TO PILATES and win the competition hands down!

Not only is this DVD an interesting film to watch merely as a bit of advanced technical video achievement, with a course instructor like Laura Hames  it is impossible not to just give in and get down on the floor and participate!  This video DVD makes the positions and steps of gradual advancement as easy as is humanely possible.  With Digifilms trademark multi-angle approach not only is the viewer able to understand the physical musculoskeletal dynamics of each move, but also can alter the workout with every viewing.

This is a fascinating and highly instructive program.  For those pinching the midriff after the holidays, buy this indispensable aid to better health and give in to it! Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06",1136160000,2,1020,5.029761904761905
2417298,3,B000BHNNNS,"It's too bad that all exercise videos don't take advantage of the DVD format as well as this one does.  In particular, The Quick & Dirty Guide to Pilates allows for each exercise to be viewed from multiple angles--including front, top, and behind--which is enormously helpful, especially to beginners.  In addition, at any point during the exercises, you can click on the ""+"" button to obtain more detailed information on how to perform the movement.

That being said, I found the workout itself to be disappointing, as it contains virtually no traditionally Pilates matwork.  Instead, I would classify this workout as more of a stretching program with components more similar to yoga than to Pilates.  Aussie instructor Laura Hames does begin by offering an introduction to Pilates principles (neutral spine, pelvic scoop, and breathing), and she does remind you of these principles during the exercises.

The DVD is very well-chaptered according to the individual exercises, with most of the chapters being very short (<1 minute), and the total workout coming in at about 31 minutes.  Below is the complete chapter breakdown along with my short descriptions:

1.  Sliding Legs--lying on your back, moving each leg in and out in turn

2.  Pelvic Tilts--performed lying on your back

3.  Knee Drops--lying on your back, opening and closing your knees

4.  Knee Stairs--lying on your back, making circles with each bent leg

5.  Hamstrings--reclined hamstring stretch with towel (from yoga)

6.  Spine Curls--similar to pelvic tilts, but incorporating a wave-like movement with your entire back

7.  Arm Opening--still in a reclined position, raising your arms over your chest then opening out to the side

8.  Drops--in reclined position, lifting and dropping your shoulders

9.  Diamonds--a simple back extension from a face down position

10. Cat--spine stretch performed on hands and knees (from yoga)

11. Oyster--lying on your side with your knees bent, opening and closing your top bent leg

12. Glutes--lying on your back, a bent leg stretch (called thread the needle in yoga)

13. Curl Ups--a very slow abdominal crunch

14. Knee Bends--a gentle standing squat

15. Side Bends--a standing side stretch repeated to each side

16. Rotations--a sort of bow & arrow stretch from a standing position

17. Walk on the Spot--tiptoeing in place

18. Shoulder Circles--rolling your shoulders

19. Roll Down--rolling from standing to a forward bend

20. Rest--finish in shell stretch (Pilates) or child's pose (yoga)

Although this workout has some merit as a stretching routine based on Pilates principles, I think calling it a ""guide to Pilates"" is definitely poor marketing.  The comments on the DVD case just add to this confusion--one statement referred to instructor Laura Hawes, saying ""even her presence melts fat.""  I found this to be quite misleading; not only is this workout not traditional Pilates, but it is also NOT a fat-burning workout by any means, as it moves VERY slowly.  If you are wanting to take advantage of special DVD features to learn basic Pilates principles and stretches, you might enjoy this DVD, but don't expect to become familiar with Pilates or to get an intense workout from this DVD.",1135728000,8,3219,5.138996138996139
2417299,1,B000BHNNNS,"I bought this DVD to supplement Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" because I wanted to understand some of the beginning exercises better by seeing them in action.  I was very disappointed in I received.  The exercises amount to simple calisthenics and include very few elements of a standard Pilates mat program.  I'm no fitness guru but doing the entire program hardly raised my pulse or challenged my muscles.

The DVD format itself is quite nice.  If you are looking for some very low-intensity stretches and warmup exercises, this is a great DVD to get.  However, calling this a Pilates DVD is a misrepresentation of its content.",1134259200,2,632,4.915094339622642
2417300,5,B000BHNNNS,"In a brilliant follow-up to ""The Quick and Dirty Guider to Salsa"", producer, director and editor Debdoot Das brings us a DVD for those interested in learning about Pilates in an interactive fashion. Know how most DVDs offer a ton of extras, bonus items and documentaries that complement the main ""feature""? How about taking the main feature and showing it to you in a ton of different ways, for you to make the most of it? This is where this DVD Guide to Pilates excels.

Indeed the ability to view all the exercises from different angles is fantastic, considering that you can get more detail for some of them from different angles. The same applies to sound and your ability to turn it on and off, if you'd rather practice to your own music once you've learned the instructions provided. You can also dive deeper into the exercises, if you choose to, by obtaining more details about them. But perhaps coolest of all interactive features is the ability to set up a personalized series of exercises, to perform. I cannot think of any other DVD series that exploits the interactive possibilities of this medium more than the ones that Debdoot Das puts together. Highly recommendable for its adaptability and high quality.",1132617600,7,1220,4.781990521327014
2417301,2,B000BHNNNS,"I have been taking beginners pilates classes for several months now, so I am by no means an expert, but what I can tell you is that my very first class involved much more depth than this ""Quick and Dirty Guide""! I worked through all of the guided exercises once, as soon as I received this DVD by post, and it built up my excitement - when, I wondered, would the extensive warm-ups be over so that I could REALLY see what this DVD had to offer? Sadly, the end of what I had thought to be ""warm-ups"" coincided with the end of the DVD.

This workout is more similar to the yoga classes I've taken than Pilates, which generally involves some difficult work in my experience. Instead, what you will find on the Quick and Dirty Guide is more of a slow moving, flowing, and very gentle series of progressive movements. Basically you will get to stretch your legs out a bit, and warm up your shoulders and arms, and then the workout is over.

I now realize that this is only Part 1 to what I assume will be a several part series. I am quite disappointed in this DVD, but I suppose I can use it as a warmup to my usual workout.",1132185600,4,1119,4.175925925925926
2417302,5,B000BHNNNS,"After wreaking havoc on my body playing rugby (followed by a long and sedentary period of recuperation!) I found myself a few pounds too heavy, itching to get off the couch, and looking for a solid, low-impact way to get back in shape.  A bit of reading up and asking around led me to a choice of either yoga or pilates. Most other forms of activity were stamped with a big no no from my physical therapist.

I'll have to admit, I wasn't expecting much. Highly skeptical is a good way to put it. I've usually been more of a fan of the high-impact adrenaline-laden competitive sport sort of fitness. Any form of ""mat stuff"" just seemed boring. Fifteen dollars a class was just out of the question (and slightly ridiculous) so I started looking into DVDs and books. I tried yoga, but I found the poses insanely hard to follow without a live instructor making corrections to my poses. I was probably doing them wrong because I came out of my workouts without ever feeling like anything had been ""worked out."" Not much of a choice left. Thus began my quest for the perfect pilates regimen. One that would seriously WORK.

I started out with the (as of now!) more popular recommendations on this site.  Brooke Siler's pilates book...Pilates for dummies...I borrowed Winsor pilates from a friend... They each had their pros and cons. The most cons being with the pilates books in general. Most of the books have nice intros where they talk about the history of pilates and outline basic techniques. But when it came down to having and actually DOING a good workout it was the same problem I had with yoga- I just couldn't see the poses. The photos-while they looked nice-just didn't offer enough accesible comprehensive instruction. And it was hard to use! Try keeping a pose arms and legs straining while trying to read a book for pointers at the same time. Maybe it's just me but I just couldn't.

In the DVD realm, I found things much easier to follow but of course, all DVDs are not made equal. I don't want to single any particular DVD out to avoid or anything because the truth is that most of the ones I tried were okay. Pilates in general, I found easier to follow than other workouts and free of extra things to invest in like weights or exercise balls. All I really needed was a towel or two. And a TV. (Although if I keep this up I might memorize and not even need that!). I found, though, that as a general rule for DVDs that offer multiple workouts: beginning intermediate etc.- all on one disk...what seemed like a great bang for a buck at the time actually turned out to be more boring and less effective in the long run while harder to follow in the short. I think the amount of disk space needed to cram more than one workout on one disk meant scrimping on in-depth explanation of each movement and much less attention to the (very important!) pilates basics like breathing and posture. I also found that most of those more advanced workouts would be just a repetition of the same mat moves in the previous workouts, with only a few new moves added in. Though this probably isn't an attempt on their part to con the buyer or anything (pilates matwork revolves around a set number of proven movements and they're bound to be repeated from workout to workout), it still made me wonder in the end if they were worth it since the tradeoff is less patient and (I think) less effective overall instruction. Of course, on the flip side the tradeoff to the multiple DVD workout sets is literally, price.

As a newcomer to pilates, especially one without the benefit of having a regular instructor or a big checkbook, it was first and foremost important to me that I would be able to really follow the workout, not just scramble through the movements and render them ineffective. Which brings me to THIS DVD and why, after all this trial and error, I highly highly recommend it:

The INTRO to the pilates basics is in a seperate chapter of its own in the main menu. Easy to skip or return to as necessary. I have seen many explanations of nuetral pelvis and actually, most of them do a fine job but in this DVD, Laura Hames pays added attention to pelvic floor/scoop and breathing as well- something which I found lacking in others.

This attention carries over to The MAT exercises themselves, as she paces the exercises well and takes the time to make sure you're aware of ALL the basics during every exercise- not just some and not just at the beginning of the entire set. While this is extremely important when it comes to posture and spinal alignment (no more injuries!)- this is especially helpful when it comes to breathing because, ironically, it's one of the easiest things to forget to do right! On top of that, every single exercise has an icon you can click on for further explanation.

Other reviewers for this DVD have raved about the extra nifty things this DVD has to offer. This is true, they are extra extra cool and still easy to navigate. There isn't a single fitness DVD out there that lets you program your own workout, you can even set the exercises on shuffle. For people who get bored easily by the same old thing everyday, especially in mat workouts- this is an absolute blessing. As far as pilates goes, there isn't a single DVD out there that lets you see every movement from three angles all at once. I found this very helpful in finally getting to ""see"" the poses.

The most surprising thing about this DVD, for me, has been its longevity. I'm thankful to be up and running around again but exploring Pilates has somehow improved my posture and my stomach has never felt more fit....  this DVD in particular, made things less boring and really helped me stick with the regimen and I intend to do so. It's easy to follow and it gives results. My apologies- such a long winded review.  All in all, this was the best one I've found and this is the one I chose to rave about. new and surprisingly effective. Definitely worth checking out.",1130716800,11,5966,4.518999073215941
2417303,5,B000BHNNNS,"I'm deeply impressed by the technical excellence of this disc. I got it for my wife and she loves it, because of being able to programme your own routine and see each exercise from a different angle. But, as a DVD author myself, I can appreciate how much work is needed to achieve these results, and I have to say it's a real pleasure to see the format being stretched and exploited in this way. Because it's so well done, the disc is simplicity itself to use, but there's a mass of seriously clever stuff going on behind the scenes. A playlist capability like this is *very* complex to create, especially in multi-angle. For those who are interested, there's even a demo of the software they used to make the DVD actually on the disc, and instructions showing how to hack in and see it all working. Apparently the same formula can be applied to other discs very easily, so hopefully there will be many more titles made in the same way because it's on a different level to anything else that's available. The presentation of the DVD is excellent, the production standards are extremely high, and all in all it makes a superb teaching tool. The only thing I don't like is the name - there's nothing quick or dirty about it !",1130284800,6,1223,4.464285714285714
2417304,4,B000BHNNNS,"I was always really skeptical about Pilates because it has very little to no cardio in it. But after seeing my friend (a guy!) who has a 6 pack from doing Pilates, I decided to give it a try.

Whats great about this DVD is that it helps you understand what muscles one should be using when doing Pilates. When I do any workout, I'm alyways wondering whether I'm doing them correctly. The DVD has an introduction that explains the fundamental of Pilates. This is REALLY awesome because it breaks down how Pilates works your body and develops your core strength. I used to just think it was just about laying around. Boy, was I wrong. Also the DVD has extra tutorials that you can access while doing the exercises so you can get more info about the moves your doing and whether your doing them right.

There is a whole bunch of perks in the DVD like being able to program your own workout routine. I like the routine that the instructor laid out but sometimes I do feel like doing more stretch exercises like the CAT stretch because I have really tight shoulders. The DVD lets me design my own workout so I can add moves I like and take out moves I dont. Its something I never saw in any other workout DVD.

If your looking for a workout where you will break out into a heavy cardio sweat this isn't it. I would say that this workout is great for someone who wants to balance their already cardio workout with core strengthening and muscle defining. Or who just wants to work on core strengthening which is a hell of a workout to begin with.",1129507200,6,1539,4.336805555555555
2417305,5,B000BHNNNS,"This dvd is amazing in so many ways, but most important it gives you a way to control the variety of your workout. You can program the exercises to play in any order you select, with or without the soothing relaxing ocean sounds in the back. The Quick & Dirty Guide To Pilates delivers in so many ways  and the  articulate pilates instructor Laura Hannes makes it a most relaxing and rewarding workout. I especially enjoyed the excellent view selections of the multi-angle shots. You can view all the exercises from three different angles which make this DVD ever more effective.

I have been doing the DVD for two weeks now and I am beyond amazed at my excellent results. SO much so I have given my sister a copy as well!",1129075200,3,722,4.454545454545454

You can re-arrange your Pilates routine so easily that there is no reason to get bored with the same routine anymore.

The instructor Laura Hames has a great voice, personality and a clear accent. You got to check her out. She is really good. She sounds like an angel with the music. Though the music on this DVD is very gentle and soothing, you can also turn the music off. I prefer my own workout music and this is my most favorite feature.

This introductory guide was fun and easy to work out to, with an emphaisis on stretching more than aerobics. The stretching exercises are very well described, with many options available so they can be viewed from many different perspectives. The DVD makes it easy to do each short exercise (usually around one minute or two each) in the sequence you most desire, so you can customize your work-out and get the advantage of having the guidance of a skilled instructor, Laura Hawes.

8086802,3,B000BHNNNS,"""The Quick and Dirty Guide to Pilates: Part I"" is a pilates workout video for beginners.  The word ""beginners"" should be stressed here.  I do not know the first thing about pilates, but the exercises contained on this DVD are quite simple.

The workouts are led by Laura Hames and she explains what she is doing in a very soft and soothing voice, one which can quite possibly put the viewer to sleep (but hey, maybe that's what pilates is).  There are twenty three chapters on this DVD, each one a different exercise or motion for pilates.

The entire DVD is approximately two hours and the entire feature is multi-angle, so by pushing the ""angle"" button on your remote you can see each movement from a different angle.

This is a very slow, deliberate workout dvd.  Very low intensity and I will say that this is going to be very easy for the beginner to pick up and learn.  Those who are more experienced will be very bored by this.",1143763200,,934,4.452941176470588
8086803,3,B000BHNNNS,"Despite the fact that one's first impression of this DVD consisting of 121 minutes of light Pilates-type exercises featuring instructress Laura Hames may be along the lines of ""Laura Does Dallas"" due to the rather cheeky and most likely deliberately provocative cover pose of Ms Hames, (further exemplified by the ""social"" aspect of the associated website) arms akimbo in a saucy red workout bra, this exercise offering by Debdoot Das productions delivers long on style and format and little on overall content.

In reality, the program features exercises that I would deem merely preliminary when competing in the normal Pilates arena as defined by classically trained Pilates masters like Jennifer Kries of ""The Method"" and Brooke Siler author of ""The Pilates Body"" and ""Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge: At the Gym, on the Mat and on the Move.""  Sadly, Pilates standards like ""The Hundred"" , the ""Roll-up"" and ""Rolling Like a Ball"", usually the first three exercises performed in a standard contiguous Pilates sequence are nowhere to be found on the Quick and Dirty program.

What Part 1 of the Quick and Dirty series does offer is an introductory guideline to some simple stretching which if performed by those who have not exercised in a while might possibly facilitate a light muscle warm-up that may lead to an eventual undertaking of an actual Pilates routine somewhere down the line in the distant future. A disclaimer like ""Light Stretching in Preparation for Pilates Training"" should be featured on this DVD jacket to warn the purchaser of the extra-light format and avoid the disappointment bound to ensue upon its first viewing.

However, that said, what makes the format unique stems from the interesting utilization of several features that adapt quite well to the exercise genre not normally taken advantage of by your everyday DVD presentation.  Quick & Dirty Part 1 allows one to design a personal program by selecting from a bank of 24 exercises only those desired on a per session basis while three user-controlled camera angles provide the viewer with visualization of each exercise from different perspectives.  Instead of plowing through the usual repetitive introductory instructions necessary to understand the exercise on an intitial viewing, the producers cleverly engineered a feature that takes into consideration the viewer's comprehension of the format and exercise level.  One can simply press the [+] sign whenever more instruction is necessary or carry on by following the repetitions once the form becomes familiar.

Bottom line:  Combining this special format with a video that actually details a Pilates routine ala guru Joseph Pilates himself would be phenomenal.  Instead of extra-lite, give us some heavy duty, sweat-inducing, core-building sequences and you would have one heck of an instructive exercise video.  Recommended only for those who have not exercised in a while and need to get back into shape slowly.",1139270400,4,2958,5.245762711864407
8086804,5,B000BHNNNS,"This DVD is a well organized exercise program for anyone new to Pilates or who has not participated in exercise for quite a long time. There are several key factors required for an exercise program to be successful: motivation and commitment by the participant and a good basic exercise program with a qualified instructor. Laura Hames meets all the criteria for the second group of factors. She is a delight to view and listen to ... she provides excellent, clear, and precise instructions. The unique programmable features on this DVD allow for enhanced explanations and most importantly provide three different views or angles from which to learn the proper posture to do the exercises. The programmable sections are very reassuring to someone who is new to this form of exercise. Personally, I enjoy the simplicty and beauty of the 20 different exercises demonstrated on this DVD. The programmability allows one to sequence the exercises differently which enhances the effectiveness and provides a new workout for the main muscle groups.

In the introduction, Laura gives an overview of the areas of the body which work together during the exercises: the spine, the breathing and pelvis. Essentially, the exercises help develop and maintain proper spine and pelvic alignment while breathing in a rhythmic natural manner. The exercises resemble yoga postures. While doing the exercises, the soothing and relaxing music provides a proper atmosphere to concentrate on the muscles and correct body position.

Not having exercised regularly for a long time, this DVD  meets my needs perfectly. The exercises are gentle and not difficult to learn, this is very reassuring for a beginner. In the past, I have had extensive experience with workouts on Nautilus machines following a set routine, weight-training with free weights, aerobics, and various dance and stretch exercises as well as yoga. I find this DVD a refreshing change: it does not tax one's energies, it can be done at home, it saves me travel time, and importantly, saves a great deal of money because one does not have to join a gym or health club.

8086805,5,B000BHNNNS,"This beautifully produced DVD is ideal for beginners, anyone out of shape, or those of us in our ""Golden Years."" Though I am in spectacular health, and very agile at 61, I make it a point to only do very gentle exercise, and the routine presented on this DVD is perfect for my needs. It works the body from the inside out, and if done correctly and to its maximum potential, will make you feel toned and vigorous. It contains no stress to the knees (my one weakness, which I share with many who have in their youth been athletes or dancers, are my knees) and it leaves you with an overall feeling of relaxation. It is also an excellent warm-up for more strenuous exercise, and its controlled, deep breathing a good preparation for more advanced work-outs.

The exercises are simple, and are exquisitely demonstrated by Laura Hames, who is stunningly attractive, with a lovely British accented voice, and extensive knowledge of how the body works. In the Intro, Hames gives important (and quite explicit!) explanations on skeletal and muscular body structure, and also teaches you how to do the basic breathing. If you are familiar with the principles of Pilates, you can do the exercises in a continuous flow, or click on the ""+"" at the bottom right of the screen and get detailed instructions for each movement.

You will need: An exercise mat/rug, a pad or small pillow for your head, a cushion for the ""Oyster"" exercise, and a towel or shawl (about 30"" in length) for the ""Hamstring Stretch."" Otherwise, the floor and standing exercises take very little space to do, and a 5 x 6 area will be more than sufficient.

It is the programmable features of this DVD that make it completely unique and will revolutionize how future exercise DVDs are made. You can program it to repeat or eliminate whatever you chose, view it from different angles, and even the background music is optional, though the music, by Robert Sheff, is wonderful, and adds to the serenity of the DVD.  If you are looking for some mellow exercises that will tone your body without wearing it out, your search is over. This DVD, with its many features, won't get boring, and will leave you feeling relaxed, with increased flexibility as well as muscular control. It is a great way to start the day, or remove the stress of the workday in the evening, as its atmosphere of tranquility will calm your mind, while the exercises improve your body.",1138233600,2,2413,4.683962264150943

There is a feature that allows the user to customize the workout among the various demonstrated movements, and there also are three different camera angles available. The production quality of the disc is quite good; the menus are easy to follow after perhaps a few moments of initial confusion. The on-screen instructor, Laura Hames, demonstrates the exercises skillfully. The provided music is appropriate, if perhaps a bit monotonous.

However, like some other reviewers, I was surprised at the monolithically gentle, non-strenuous nature of the exercises. A few of the movements might give a user a small taste of what ""real"" Pilates classes are like, but overall, this seems to incorporate mainly a warmup and a cooldown, while averting the core-strenghtening heart of the workout that buyers might expect.

Only someone who has not exercised at all for years will find this workout truly satisfying. I suspect that the target market for this DVD is, in fact, longtime non-exercisers, and perhaps older adults who are searching for some guidance in regaining some lost strength and flexibility.

People who have taken in-studio Pilates classes know just how taxing these can be (in a good way, of course).  Perhaps in ""Part Two"" of the Quick and Dirty Guide To Pilates, Debdoot Das and Laura Hames will provide more of a taste of what Pilates is about.",1137715200,9,1416,5.086206896551724
8086807,4,B000BHNNNS,"You might think exercise videos and DVDs are all pretty much the same: some impossibly fit and strikingly beautiful twentysomething takes you through an agonizing ""basic"" routine to the accompaniment of irritating music. The value they offer over books is marginal. But here's something different. Your instructor - Laura Hames - is still gorgeous, but that's where the similarity to other DVDs ends. Don't be fooled by the ""Quick & Dirty"" title, because there's nothing cheap or nasty about this one. Indeed, Digifilm seem to have gone to considerable lengths to make an introductory Pilates DVD that is actually useful. The key to this is the imaginative and innovative use it makes of standard DVD technology. You can run the 20 exercises as one routine, or create your own workout by adding any number of selected exercises to a personal ""playlist"" (which you can change as your preferences or target areas change). Also, at any point in your workout, you can jump from an exercise to an introduction which explains precisely what you need to being doing in this particular movement. The other brilliant feature is the ""multi-angle"" aspect: at any time you can switch between three different camera angles so you can see what the lovely Laura is doing from the front or back or from above. This is a real advantage for some movements that aren't clear in profile. The editing is seamless - there isn't even a break in the audio. And no, you don't need a special DVD player to make use of these features: they all use buttons you'll find on every DVD remote. Nor is it difficult to use: the inside cover of the DVD case includes a Quick Start guide covering the three or four simple things you need to know. We had the whole thing up and running in about a minute. It's really that simple. The only criticism I have is that the range of exercises is not as comprehensive as some devoted Pilates enthusiasts might expect, so check out the exercises listed in other people's reviews (or at the digifilm.com website) before you buy, just to be sure it meets your needs. However, this DVD is subtitled ""Part 1"", so you can expect future installments to be more comprehensive, just as they are in Digifilm's celebrated ""Quick & Dirty Guide to Salsa"" series.",1137196800,3,2255,4.740458015267175
8086808,5,B000BHNNNS,Another masterpiece from Debdoot Das!  It is the most comprehensive guide to pilates and explained in steps any level of user can enjoy. This guide is for everyone and age should not be a barrier.  I am eagerly awaiting Part 2.,1137110400,,227,4.512195121951219
