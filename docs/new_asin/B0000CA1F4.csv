7998520,2,B0000CA1F4,"I cant say that I was much taken with the 1993 Stratford Festival Romeo and Juliet with Megan Follows and Antoni Cimolino. It isn't exactly bad, but I cant think of a single reason to prefer it over the Globe, the Zeffirelli, or the Castellani.

The leads seem seriously mismatched: Follows comes across as way too serious and mature for the character (except, oddly enough, at the very beginning, where she seems appropriately youthful), older even than her own 25 years, let alone Juliets 13; while Cimolino plays Romeo as a goofy adolescent, too much so to be taken seriously as a romantic lead. His approach neither meshes with Followss Juliet, nor works in itself, in my view; and theres really no chemistry between them, either. Neither reads the lines particularly well, and they seem to forget to fall in love before launching into the ball-scene sonnet.

Also, the costumes jump around between historical periods, which is jarring in itself; and some of the styles, notably a sort of 1920s look that starts off the play and that evolves to include Mussolini-style uniforms, just seem bizarre, and in contrast to the play.

Colm Feore, as Mercutio, is a lot livelier than he usually is, and is probably the strongest of the group; but he dies at the beginning of Act III. The Nurse stands out a bit as well. Most of the actors always seem to be acting, though, and they rarely read their lines with anything more than basic competence.

Im not too sure why this was released on DVD.",1419897600,3,1490,4.697318007662835
7998521,5,B0000CA1F4,Thanks for a fast a speedy service.  I love the play and it is the complete work of Romeo and Juliet.  It tells the whole story and nothing is left out.,1412294400,,152,3.870967741935484
7998522,3,B0000CA1F4,"I love the story of Romeo and Juliet and have been teaching it for 15 years in my high school English classes. While I loved the emotion of the actors, several scenes were questionable in its appropriateness, and I cannot show it to my students. (Most of the parts with Mercutio, especially his meeting with the nurse, and the citizen shooting a bird at the passing car)",1396656000,7,370,4.537313432835821
7998523,5,B0000CA1F4,"For the record, this stage production was produced by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival of Canada, the leading reperatory theatre company of Canada. Their productions are simply the best, period.",1286668800,13,196,5.793103448275862
7998524,5,B0000CA1F4,"The format of the movie is different: they film the play as actors are performing it on a real-life stage. You can even hear the audience reacting to the story in the background. I thought this made the whole experience more authentic and enjoyable, because Shakespeare only ever intended it to be performed at a theater, and not on a movie set. I think that's why I didn't enjoy the1996 or 1968 versions as much. With this version, you get the feeling that you're actually spending an evening at the theater.

This version of Romeo and Juliet was filmed in 1993, and it's said that the director set the play during Mussolini's time to up the sense of drama and hatred. This time period pick is a good one, because it doesn't interfere with the overall effect of the play, unlike in the 1996 version (Romeo + Juliet with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio), where the scenery kind of took over the whole plot and made it hard to appreciate Shakespeare's writing.

The two leads are very talented: Megan Follows plays Juliet just a few years after doing her second Anne of Green Gables movie, and the boyish Antoni Cimolino plays Romeo with a lot of charisma. Both actors perform with honesty and enthusiasm, so you never get bored. The two have chemistry, which is perfect for this particular play.

The other two remarkable actors are Juliet's doting, screechy nurse (played by the brilliant Barbara Bryne), and fun-loving Mercutio (played by the remarkably versatile Colm Feore). There are a few scenes in the film where they provide laugh-out-loud comic relief; I think I remember that more than the tragedy, although I found myself truly emotionally moved at the sad parts, too.

I think what I like best about this movie is that it is not entirely serious; the delicate balance of comedy and tragedy is definitely kept. And I think the stage director (Richard Monette) and all the actors put a lot of care into making this a memorable performance. You actually get into the play and what's going on. It's definitely better than anything I saw in high school. There are a few little extras on the DVD, too. Definitely worth it!",1237161600,21,2126,4.6916890080428955
