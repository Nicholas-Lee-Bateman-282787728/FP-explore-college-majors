3169241,5,B00178T5IW,"Travelling to Rome for the first time, I had this sense of dread and excitement. There is so much to see and do, and a limited time to do all of this. Caput Mundi gives this wary traveller a sense of direction, flow and priority that would otherwise be difficult to derive from anything short of a personal tour guide. Peter Melaragno (can you imagine how many PE teachers killed his name in junior high in Rhode Isalnd?) walks us through strata of historical and cultural chaos of a city built upon many others. This comes with two DVD's - the travelogue, and the detailed walking tour, complete with maps, cursors and real time reference of sights, sounds and tastes. There are enough recommendations to book lodging in the heart of it all. I will travel with his pocket guide - a printed text of his walking tour - (included with the two DVDs) in one hand, and a folding laminated map of old Rome in the other.

3169242,5,B00178T5IW,"Both the DVD and walking tour were a perfect introduction to Rome and gave us a lot of ideas for how to spend our four days as we also go to Egypt after that.  The presentation of info by day was extremely convenient and easy to follow with good travel hints, dining tips, and metro tips.  We're trying to put it on our iPhone so that we can bring a walking tour with us as we do Rome.  We're very excited about our trip and a lot of our excitement is because of these DVDs and booklet, which are just perfect!.  We studied the options in Amazon real hard when getting this and are glad we did.  It's wonderful!",1235520000,,611,4.100840336134453

8265409,5,B00178T5IW,"This DVD was a must, prior to my visit to Rome last year. It really gave me a great insight into the city, and was invaluable when planning my itinerary.",1369699200,,153,4.133333333333334
8265410,5,B00178T5IW,I believe this one was the one that came with a video to see before traveling.  That was an extra that the gift recipient liked.,1357257600,,128,4.12
8265411,5,B00178T5IW,"We are planning a trip in the fall back to Rome.  I have order many books and video's on touring and attractions for this trip.  This is my favorite.  Peter has done an excellent job with giving the history  so that the places you are visiting come alive.
The set comes with a pocket guide that is small enough to carry around with you, but has information and history on all the sights you will see.
I am so greatful that I found this DVD set.",1308700800,,444,4.127906976744186
8265412,5,B00178T5IW,"Peter has done a wonderful job with this - You get all the info of the tedious guided tour without the hassle and in the comfort of your own home. Then, you are prepared to do the walking tour full of knowledge and on your own terms without the tedious guide!

We have not been to Rome is years and are looking forward even more after this ""preview"" tour and suggested walking tours. We have an apartment in Navona and this will all be easily adapted - Thanks again Peter",1307491200,,471,4.233333333333333
8265413,2,B00178T5IW,"We purchased this dvd, thinking it would give us a good background for our first trip to Rome. The contents were disorganized (too much time was spent skipping around) and the video left us lacking for a better overview of the sights(example: the Vatican & museum was not covered at all). As a result, we returned the dvd.",1294012800,,322,4.568965517241379
8265414,5,B00178T5IW,"I have been to Rome several times and even have relatives living there. I have dabbled with guide books and the like but have never taken the time to truly delve into the history of this fascinating city. This DVD and accompanying booklet are the perfect combination for those interested in the history and actually seeing it on the ground. I found Peter Melaragno to be an excellent guide (engaging, knowledgable and entertaining) and his DVD and booklet are probably the next best thing to being there with him in person. I highly recommend this product.",1291852800,,556,4.802083333333333
8265415,5,B00178T5IW,This Rome DVD was everything I had hoped for and more!  I really wish I had gotten this BEFORE our trip to Rome last year.  The 2 DVD's were awesome...featuring wonderful high-quality video with great history and information. I highly recommend this for anyone planning a trip to Rome!,1280793600,,285,4.795918367346939
8265416,5,B00178T5IW,"I have found your DVD on ""Rome: Caput Mundi"" not only interesting, but clear; and the little booklet so much easier to understand than any heavy travel book filled with beautiful color photographs, yet totally confusing.

Watching your DVD, then reading page by page your day by day guided tour, I found myself transported, strolling in my mind through the streets of Rome. I knew exactly where I was in relation to everything around me. In all my travels, I have never felt so comfortable before a trip as I do now. I will immediately feel 'at home' in Rome.

Because I have been so impressed with your tour of Rome, I immediately looked to see if you had one of Florence. Couldn't find one, and am very disappointed.  If there is no guided tour of Florence by you, is there one you might recommend?

Many thanks for your attention, and especially for making Rome so accessible.

8265417,5,B00178T5IW,"Watched the first program tonight with my wife. We have grazed our way
through a number of different DVDs on Rome as preparation for what we hope
will be an educated next visit in the summer. Caput Mundi is by far the
best, not only as a source of rich information, but especially as a
re-welcoming into the textures and ""smells"" of this amazing city. Great
videography and editing. We will definitely download the iPod walking tour
file.",1275091200,,438,4.628205128205129
