It shows the story from two perspectives, making the characters  three-dimensional and it really helps the viewers understand the  motivations for each of the main characters' actions.

1024332,5,6305447233,"First of all, I'd like to blow a raspberry to all of you critics of this wonderful movie.  Perhaps, you wouldn't even know a good movie if it came up and bit you!
Hilary and Jackie was an AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL  movie... and yes, the characters at times were a little hard to like.  I  applaud the screenwriters and directors for keeping it that way instead of  turning it into some type of Americanized fairy tale with flawless  characters.  If you read the book written by Hilary du Pr and her brother  Piers (which I highly recommend you do) you could understand this better.  There is so much that could not ever fit into the movie but is just as  important.
Emily Watson and Rachel Griffith had two very commanding  performances in here that it often made the other actors seem like  amateurs... However, they fit together so well and it was believable. If  you look at pictures of Jackie, you can't help but see the uncanny  resembelance between her and Watson.
This is one of the best films I  have ever seen.  Not only did I buy the book but I also purchased the CD  which has recordings of Jacqueline du Pr and her oh-so-famous Elgar  concerto.  Hilary and Jackie maybe labelled as a ""chick movie"" or  something else, but I don't believe you can fit it in any type of genre.  I  think that this is a very intelligent movie and that it has honestly  changed the way I think in many aspects.  Through the second viewing of  Hilary and Jackie, I found myself in tears.  I see A LOT of movies and a  movie that makes me cry has got to be one hell of a movie!
Do yourself a  favour and buy this movie, please.  It is definately worth it if you can  appreciate the classical music, subtle comedy and understand the striking  depth.  If you're looking for a movie in which you can watch without ever  thinking- skip this masterpiece and rent something with Pauly Shore in it.",935107200,7,1871,4.392961876832844
1024333,4,6305447233,"I was a music major in college when I heard that cellist Jacqueline DuPre was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and that she may never play again.  About six months later, I got word from a neurologist that I should face  the fact that my playing days were over due to the same reason.  I can  certainly relate to this film.
I have read the book and am slightly  disappointed with the film version, but I do recommend reading the book  first.  But please do not deny yourself the pleasure of the music and the  excellent performances.
A warning to anyone with Multiple Sclerosis: the  form of MS portrayed in the film, though accurate in relating to Jacqueline  DuPre's case, is extremely rare and happened before currently available  treatments.  Don't let it scare you, but you will find it interesting that  she obviously had symptoms long before anyone suspected the disease.",933897600,2,879,4.78
1024334,5,6305447233,"The book upon which this film was based was in fact written by Jackie du Pre's brother and sister.  Both Piers and Hilary thoroughly supported the film and acted as consultants on the project.  Neither one apologizes for the content of  the story, nor for the actions of all those involved.  They simply present  their story as being that of a family, perhaps flawed, perhaps selfish, but  just a family, much like many others.  However, unlike other families, as  they point out repeatedly, the du Pre family had a genius among them.  Hilary and Piers emphatically repeat that they loved their sister; they  just chose to present their life together as a family, warts and all.

I love this film because the people are flawed.  As  in life, no one is perfect; no one is a saint. As much as one can argue  that Hilary, Jackie et al. are mean or selfish, their love for each other  enabled their mean conduct.  Jackie knew what she could do to her sister,  and Hilary knew what she could handle.  They were so close that hatred was  the same as love among them.  Because Hilary could allow her sister to have  an affair with her husband, and allow this information to become public, in  spite of any embarrasment she herself might feel, should tell us that her  relationship with her sister, was just that, a relationship between her and  her sister; this should also tell us that she really doesn't care what  other people think of her actions.

  Jackie du Pre was Hilary's  sister, not yours and not mine.  Perhaps if the viewer from San Diego was  in Hilary's situation, with her background, her life experience, he/she  might very well behave in the same way as Hilary did.  No one can say.  I  don't think Hilary would honestly expect others to understand her position.  However, I do believe that her attempt should be well noted.

As  for the cliche love aspect of the story which will not assuage or  ""suck in"" the ""intellectuals,""  or the seasoned art  house film connoisseurs, it is now no longer any wonder to me why great  artists are never understood in their lifetime; why women like Jackie  continue to suffer today.  One could argue that emotional intensity on all  levels, is at the base of every great artist's soul; not everyone can  understand that fire; not everyone can understand Jackie du Pre's passion  for the cello etc.  However, when any expression of love, no matter how  slight, is considered cliche or trite, I seriously wonder about the person  who offers such an observation.",933120000,2,2508,4.652873563218391
1024335,1,6305447233,"I watched the original movie in the theater and read the book. I rented the video tape last night watched the movie again. And I found that many  things are missing from the original movie. Especially the part when the  two sisters were young. For example, I remember the Jackie's screaming when  she found the Cello in the morning on her 5th birthday. Where are all those  things gone ? Very disappointing video production. I remember that the  original movie lasted at least 2 hour and 15 min. The video is merely 2  hour and 1 min. I would like to ask video producers that they should  contain everything that was in the original movie. I would recommend not  buying this one at this moment.

She is  wonderful to watch in all of her character progressions, even though she  makes Jackie as a character quite unlikeable.

1024465,3,6305447233,"I have seen this film several times, and I have mixed feelings about it.

The film catches the disappointment and disgruntlement of Hilary du Pre/Rachel Griffiths, because she was supposed to be the star and talented, and her sister, who needed help, became great.  Hilary taught her sister the scales, and it was Jackie, who found good teachers, and eventually superseded her.

Jacqueline ""Jackie"" du Pre/Emily Watson is a star.  Her stardom is rather sudden, and you catch that she is never quite satisfied, perplexed about her ability, not even passionate about her talent, and alarmed by her stardom.  Seemingly jealous of her sister's marriage, Jackie marries a ""rock star"" of classical music.  My favorite parts are when after she plays for a vast audience, she stands up to be congratulated by their thunderous applause.

Hilary tries to be on par.  She is dissuaded from going forward because of a rude teacher, and she marries very young.  She appears contented with marriage, and she cares immensely for her sister.

Jackie is lost.  And she has an affair with Hilary's husband with Hilary's persuasion and approval.  Then Jackie is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which undermines her career, and puts her in the control of her sister.

I enjoyed the film, but not enough was given to Jackie's genius.  She is herald as a prodigy, an al-time great, and this film shows little appreciation for her talent.  This film is told through Hilary's point of view, and of course, Hilary's own elementary talent and magnanimous is on full display; though even Hilary's own daughter disputes her mother's account, claiming that her father was a serial adulterer, who seduced her vulnerable aunt, and it had nothing to do with Hilary's generosity.  Others have been disgusted with Hilary's portrayal of her self-importance, and her sacrifice of her sister to achieve some meaning in her life.

I liked this film, and the actresses give wonderful performances, though it may have no semblance to reality.

The film as a film as good, and both Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson give tremendous performances.  But I keep in mind this film is not based on fact.  And despite Hilary's intent to come out ahead, Jackie (even in death) still manages to outshine and trump her sister.

(And to be honest - I have siblings, whom I adore.  And if they were better than me at anything, even things that I loved, I would focus on their talent, and not anything bad that happened to them later.  In fact, any illness or falling would be a side note, written after the film ended, right next to the credits.)",1439251200,,2596,4.863325740318906

1024549,5,6305447233,"Emily Watson performs a miracle here with her portrayal of the famous cellist Jacqueline du Pre.  I rarely find any actor successful in playing the role of a musician.  Inevitably the hand and arm movements are unconvincing and when acting the part of a pianist the actor is not seen with their hands on the keys for that reason.  In this movie Emily appears to play the cello with all the intensity of the famous artist she portrays making me a true believer that we were indeed watching the real artist at work. I call that a miracle performance!  We see the early years when Jackie and her sister Hilary grow up together in a household that supports their musical talent and then in a strange twist of fate the more apparently talented of the two sisters gradually ends up in second place next to her sister who eventually becomes a world renown cellist. This happenstance leads to some strange psychological quirks going on between them.  Jackie is later stricken with a debilitating disease that robs her of the ability to play anymore; a cruel and horrid thing to happen leading Jackie to question her worth as a human being.  Under this stress she runs ""home"" to her sister and husband leading to a strange triangle that entangles all of them.  The action plays out against a backdrop of ravishing music that reminds us every second of the talent being robbed here.  The plot is provided from the contents of a book sister Hilary wrote about the family leading many musicians to complain that surely this is more fiction than reality.  Frankly I don't care; the film is so magnificent I can take the plot as is and mourn the loss of a great cellist and wonderful human being. Both actresses won an academy award nomination for their performances.  The movie is ultimately very sad, everyone involved should feel proud for what should be recognized as a tribute to a great artist.",1432425600,5,1886,4.653614457831325
1024550,4,6305447233,"This is a biography we're told, of the two Du Pre sisters encouraged to become musicians by their doting parents and especially the piano playing mother.  Jackie takes up the cello and Hilary the flute.  They play together early on and develop a strong symbiotic relationship to the point of becoming almost telepathic with each other.  But eventually separations happen....first the mother is cut out of the pack in favor of a 'professional' pianist, and then Jackie is offered a solo tour so she goes off leaving her flute-playing sister behind.  Hilary continues her studies with occasional playing here and there and is approached by a conductor/music director who says he wants her to play but it turns out he actually wants to marry her, and if we can believe the coincidence of it all he follows her home, pushes himself on her and her parents and is in the process of rushing her off on a first date at the very moment Jackie, bored and upset by her treatment as a touring musician with no love in her life, shows up on the doorstep to visit with her sister. Hilary goes off with Kiren anyway and the drama begins.  I suppose one could say this is a movie about the love/hate relationship that develops between people who have outside, or other, needs.  But of course it is also about a couple of well-known artists...Jackie eventually marries Daniel Barenboim...so my guess is some of the rougher edges have been smoothed over.  For example we are given a glimpse of Jackie's lust for Hilary's husband but it is presented in such a way we're left to wonder at who wanted to do what with whom, and why.  And hopefully that explains the disconnected way I feel about the movie.  But wait.  I bought it purely because it is an award-winning movie starring Emily Watson so to view it from that perspective alone it is a winner.  Emily is fantastic in her role of a woman who runs the gamut of emotional states from bliss to damnation, the former being those times when she and her sister are in synch, the latter being the illness which overtook her in her late 30s/early 40s causing her to lose control of her hands and, progressively, her entire body until she dies an untimely death.  I guess the next time I feel in the need for a good cry I could do worse than watch this movie again.",1428364800,2,2294,4.527845036319612

I wonder, however, how much of the story is the mere truth and how much of it is fiction. Nonetheless, the film is worth seeing and  I recommend it. Emma Wattson in Jackie Dupre's character made me recall Bette Davis in ""All about Eve"".  The two women impersonated by these two great actresses suffered from the same complex.  In their mind,  because they were special,  they thought they were entitled to everything they wanted and unscrupulously pursued their aims all the way to the point that they distinguished no more between ""good"" and ""bad"",  ""ethical"" and ""unethical"", ""innocuous"" and ""harmful"" to the others.

I understand the musical aficionados have their own bone to pick, but I found the incongruous logic that would allow an emotional lunatic (which Jackie certainly was at the point of adultery) to 'have her way' with Hillary's husband (with Hillary's blessing) was to allow the lunatic to 'run the asylum' because the emotionally damaged sister requests it to be too much to swallow, and i shut the movie off.",1241308800,2,884,4.809210526315789

1024822,5,6305447233,"I love a good biopic, truly adore them.  Every once in a while a biopic comes along so outstanding in its power and presence and emotional connection that my love for the every popular genre is reconfirmed to the enth degree.  `Hilary & Jackie' is that type of movie, a film that swells with the grace and glory of love and passion as well as the moving aspects of pain and misery.  I will admit to having not known a whole lot of the du Pre sisters before watching this beautiful film, but my adoration of everything Emily Watson caused me to seek it out and watch it.  Not only is Watson stellar (and so deserving of that Oscar nomination) but the entire film is handled with such delicacy and devotion that one can't help but become swept away as it progresses towards its devastating, yet affirming, end.

`Hilary & Jackie' tells the story of Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, two talented young sisters growing up in a home that makes music the focal part of their existence.  We are given an overview of the young lives of both Hilary and Jackie, Hilary the eldest and at the moment more talented of the sisters.  Hilary is a flautist who has won award upon award, and her young sister Jackie just wants to be included with her sister at all times, so she practices her cello and perfects her craft to where soon she is rising above her sister in talent and in recognition.  The film then shifts gears to their later life when Hilary has practically given up on her music to start a family with her fianc&eacute; Kiffer and Jackie is now world renowned and unhappily settled into a life of fame.

The film is split in sections and tells the same portion of the girls lives through the eyes of each, giving Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths equal time to astound the audience.  Watson undoubtedly has the showier role.  Jackie is repressed by her talent, struggling every day to find herself in her music.  She loves to play, needs to play, but the pressure to perform eats away at her to the point where she begins to resent it in a way.  As the film progresses and her health starts to evaporate her performance becomes even more pivotal to the success of the film, and she delivers masterfully.  This is nothing against Griffiths though, who devours her characters restrained passion, a passion that has been suppressed by the talent of her younger sister.  You can read in her eyes the resentment for her lot in life, yet her undying love for her sister overpowers any and all other emotions in her life.  She is committed to her sister, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness.

While Watson and Griffiths are without doubt the biggest selling points of the film, they are accompanied by a slew of phenomenal supporting performances.  Charles Dance and Celia Imrie are amazing as Hilary and Jackie's parents, and David Morrissey is fantastic as Kiffer, Hilary's husband.

Some have attacked this film for being untrue and or `stretching' facts, but my question to them is `what biopic doesn't do that?'  In all honesty in order to make most non-fiction engrossing to the general public Hollywood has to add layers of fiction in order to embellish truths.  Fact remains that simple sequences of silence cannot capture exactly what is going on in someone's head (sure, an actor can emote a feeling with their facial features but one cannot emote a specific thought) and so to complain that the film shows Jackie abuse her cello and yet she (according to you) never did is kind of petty when her resentment of her fame alone would have moved her to wish harm done to the very thing that is causing her grief, her cello.  She may have never actually placed it out in the cold, but director's decision to include that scene was an attempt to further impress upon the audience Jackie's mental condition at the time.  It may not be true, but does it really need to be.

As far as the supposed `hokiness' of the opening (and closing) beach sequence I have only this to say; ""you missed the point.""  As one reviewer mentioned, the film hints towards a slight psychic connection between the girls (as is common among twins and has been known to express itself in `close' siblings) and this little detail adds a layer to the genius surrounding these two talents.  I think that the opening and closing sequences add closure to the film and actually brought a tear to my eye.

In my opinion the few areas of inaccuracy within the film (granted I have not read the book and am basically going off of what some reviewers have mentioned as falsities within the film) shouldn't deter anyone from embracing the movie for what it is.  It tells the tragic tale of the du Pre sisters (I think we can all agree it was tragic in a touching sort of way) and I think that in the end it paints a beautiful picture of unrivaled love between siblings that endured to the end despite any persons faults.",1218067200,2,4887,4.5479452054794525

To say that she was great, impressive, fantastic - all understatements.  She had talent such as had never been and has still not been.  Her private life is not very interesting compared to seeing her play the cello - and hearing the sounds that only she could bring forth from that instrument.

1024826,5,6305447233,"HILARY AND JACKIE is still one of the most disturbing and unsettling pieces of film that I have ever seen!  From the very beginning of the film there is a looming foreboding and an uncomfortable uneasiness that follows through every frame in this account of the lives of sisters Hilary and Jackie Du Pre. Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson are each disturbingly terrific and I am always amazed at the incredible performances. No small wonder that each actress has gone on to such acclaim in their respective careers.

It is essential to remember that this screenplay is adapted from Hilary and Piers Du Pre's account A GENIUS IN THE FAMILY.The book as well as the film is extremely intimate and disturbing at best. What is positively fascinating is how this film 's narrative runs. The story commences with a portrait of the two sisters and their childhood as musical prodigies together. Then the film diverges in their teen years and tells the remaining story and timeline through each of the sisters' perspectives with gut wrenching honesty that balances each girl. Though I was well acquainted with the music of Cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and her husband pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim as a conservatory student in the 1970's, it is not really essential to know anything about music or these people to be totally immersed in a truly good story that is informative and very revealing about the mechanics of genius, motivation and family.

If you offended by the exposing of warts and ""speaking ill of the dead"" perhaps HILARY AND JACKIE will not be for you. If you are willing to accept that this account of the lives of the Du Pre sisters COULD be true, then by all means come with an open mind and be blown away by what you see! Whether true, not true or somewhere in between, HILARY AND JACKIE presents two great actresses playing their hearts out for all of us to behold.",1181174400,4,1879,4.740061162079511

1024932,1,6305447233,"There is a certain school of thought which holds that biopics have no obligations to historical accuracy -- that this is the exclusive province of documentaries or books. I happen to disagree. There are plenty of documentaries that ""dramatize"" real-life events in the form of dialogue, and many Hollywood films (e.g. _Pollock_, or _My Left Foot_) which were made with concern for accuracy and respect for the memories of specific historical events or characters. If a movie uses real-life names, locations, etc, then misinformation would be malicious that infect the perceptions of mass audiences who see (and for the most part believe) them. A movie that denies the Holocaust or tramples over the memories of war veterans cannot be said to be ideologically unmotivated, but still more callous is such misinformation that is made for purely monetary reasons.

_Hilary and Jackie_, a film dramatization of the life of English cello prodigy Jacqueline du Pr, is one of these. It presents a very heterodox portrayal of Jacqueline's overall character, and has been denounced by her friends and colleagues who knew her throghout her life (Barenboim, Rostropovich, et al) as a complete distortion of the Jacqueline they knew. For e.g., she is remembered by her students and colleagues as being emotionally vibrant with an impassioned love of her craft, while in the film she is portrayed as an insufferable bunch of neuroses who despised her cello -- it having a negative influence on her self-esteem. She is depicted making an indulgent demand to have a sexual relationship with Finzi, her brother-in-law. Her sister Hilary (the apparent heroine of the story), ever selfless, obliges for the benefit of her apparently disturbed sister. The movie ends with Hilary at Jackie's side during her death throes even though (it is made clear) Jackie never did anything for Hilary in her life. If you take the movie's account, it was clearly more than Jackie deserved.

The account here generally follows ""A Genius in the Family"", the controversial memoir written by Jacqueline's siblings. But her siblings would be less reliable on most points than her colleagues who spent a larger amount of time with her (e.g. at her death when she chose to surround herself with her friends instead, contra the events in this film). That is to say nothing of the fact that the two sisters weren't on speaking terms for much of their life (though Hilary claims there was a reconciliation before Jacqueline's death). Clare Finzi, Hilary's daughter, wrote and contested the film account of events as a ""gross misinterpretation, which I cannot let go unchallenged."" She was referring to the actual events between her father and aunt, but the errors of omission are even significant, and at the same time worse. The film depicts Jacqueline as being unsympathetic, ignoring the aspects of her personality that made so many sympathize with her. Nothing here reminds one of the flamboyant cellist that is extensively recorded in Nupen's excellent documentaries _Remembering Jacqueline du Pre_ and _Jacqueline du Pr in Portrait_.

More importantly, the film is guilty of irresponsible revisionism. Biopics don't have to be historically accurate to the letter, just the general spirit of the characters. But as so little is substantiated about the specific events of Jacqueline du Pr's personal life as presented here, this is probably a movie that wasn't supposed to be made in the first place. W. K. Clifford famously said that if we cannot ascertain the grounds for a belief, we have no business in believing it. I would add that we have even less business in popularizing heterodox theses to a mass audience without compelling evidence -- something this film lacks. The director Anand Tucker admitted to not caring about such accuracy; he claimed that ""it [truth] doesn't exist"" because of alternate viewpoints. (One wonders what he would have made of Holocaust denial.) The action of popularizing an extremely tendentious and dubious memoir of Jacqueline's life to audiences who are mostly unfamiliar with her is a unprovoked act of slander -- a base and callous smear against her memory.

The above point is something missed by the critics who defend _Hilary and Jackie_ as portraying ""another side"" to Jacqueline's personality or offering a corrective to ""official"" documentaries or biographies. To the majority who watch the movie unreflectingly, there is only one ""side"" shown. That gets me back to the core of what I dislike about this film: its historical irresponsibility. Jacqueline du Pr obviously achieved much and suffered much in her life, and whether you agree with this film or not, it isn't a constructive tribute to her life's work as an artist and teacher. Integrity demands us to treat unsupported claims with caution, not proselytize them to an unwary audience. Jacqueline du Pr was a great cellist who contributed much to the art was well liked by her colleagues and acquaintances. Her pedagogical legacy survives in the generation of cellists who studied under her tutelage. If she is to be remembered, it should be for that and not the dubious details of her sex life as ""played out"" and vulgarized in sensationalist media.

One would do better to peruse the biographies of Jacqueline du Pr by Carol Easton, Elizabeth Wilson and, yes, the du Pr siblings (if you read between the lines). Or better yet, listen to her music and watch the documentaries of her which contain clips of her life and performances. The latter were directed by Christopher Nupen who, unlike Tucker, actually knew and cared about his subject matter. For if even a fraction of the money the BBC and the Arts Council gave to _Hilary and Jackie_ were diverted to Nupen's program (which they, instead, rejected), great gains would have been made; gains to music, as well as to our conscience.",1158451200,78,5852,5.066390041493776
1024933,5,6305447233,"Misunderstandings lead to some of the greatest tragedies in life. ""Hilary and Jackie"" is a movie full of misunderstandings, and as the movie shows you one side of a talented sister's life (Hilary) and then the other side of the other talented sister's life (Jackie's), you begin to realize that what we remember in our lives is often distorted. We base our memories on our innate desire to see ourself as the hero or heroine. We forget the cruel things we've said to others and remember only the cruel things they've said to us. This movie depicts this in a startling, unforgettable way. It is movie-making genius.

  Jacqueline du Pre is depicted as suffering mental illness during this movie. Other reviewers here have stated that that is  nonsense, because nowhere in the biography written by her brother and sister did it mention she was mentally ill. That's right- in a sense. I don't believe she was mentally ill. But the reviewer either forgot or didn't know that Multiple sclerosis often causes manic depression and can cause suicidal or bipolar like symptoms. It is the slow disintigration of the brain, and depression is caused by the brain.

  The written biography on which the movie was based also reveals that as a child, Jackie told Hilary ""Don't tell Mum, but I will not be able to move or speak when I grow up."" The two girls are depicted in the movie as having a slightly psychic connection. This is hinted at in the movie in one of the most beautiful sequences, at the beginning and end. Those who find that kind of thing ""hokey"" need to be more tolerant of the eccentricities of genius- which is always, and will probably always be, unstable.

  Overall, this is a movie about love, and it is faithful to the book. It is about the trancending power of love to unite sisters even through the difficulties of betrayal and conflict. It is about the torture and burden of genius, and it is most of all, beautiful.",1150675200,7,1929,4.647058823529412
1024934,5,6305447233,"Hilary and Jackie is the story of the DuPre sisters.  From an early age both were rising musical stars, Hilary on the flute and Jackie on the cello.  But Jackie's flamboyant playing style brought her attention and then fame.  While Hilary has her style eradicated and settles for an ordinary life.

The film is broken into four sections.  The first part is the girl's childhood together.  It takes the girls from prodigies to Jackie's first success.  One night Jackie is playing at a wedding for an Italian princess with Hilary looking on and the next morning she is swept away for a concert tour, leaving her sister alone in a foreign country with no explanation of what happened to her sister.

The second part is Hilary's life apart from her sister.  Hilary has her musical life sucked from her by the musical establishment.  But one thing she does find is love and she settles for a country life with her husband raising their two daughters.  During this part of the film we see some bizarre behavior from Jackie with no explanation behind what is happening.

The third part is Jackie's life apart from her sister.  Jackie really never wanted the fame that was thrust upon her.  Jackie is isolated from everyone she cares about and most of the time cannot communicate with the people around her.  Even to find out how to wash her clothes.  But she does find her true love and they become the super couple of classical music.  But things are amiss with her health.

The last part is Jackie's fight with MS.  In the 1950's they really did not know much about the disease and how to treat it.  Jackie was under the impression with time and exercise that she would overcome her disease.  What she finds out is that not only does the disease get worse but society isolates her because of it.  Just as the two sisters reconcile, Jackie dies.

This film is brilliant on many levels but it is the performance by Emily Watson and Rachael Griffiths that give the film its depth.

1024935,3,6305447233,"I am amazed when I read people condemning various things based on this movie.  Some condemn Hilary.  Some (like the Amazon reviewer) condemn the book itself--obviously without having first taken the trouble to read the book.  Some condemn what went on sexually.

To set the record straight (from the book and from another biography of Jackie):

The book does not ""dish dirt"" on Jackie.  Quite the contrary.

There is not the slightest hint that the grown-up Hilary was jealous of Jackie (though she was briefly as a child).  Both she and Jackie saw the many disadvantages of Jackie's fame.  Hilary expresses relief that it is not her life.  Jackie expresses envy of Hilary's happy life.  She hated being pushed into concert tours by her ambitious husband, Barenboim.  She often simply rebelled and left.

Hilary did not ""give permission"" for her husband to sleep with Jackie.  Jackie was terribly upset and ran away across the fields.  She asked Kiffer to have sex with her and he did because she thought it would help her.  Kiffer told Hilary about it as soon as they returned.  (What is covered up by the clumsy, ""arty"" anti-chronological approach of this movie is that Jackie had ALREADY noticed that her hands were sometimes numb!  Imagine the effect that must have had on a cellist!)

The nonsense in the movie about Jackie losing her mind is garbage made up by the screenwriter.  AT NO TIME did Jackie think that she was crazy.  The idiot psychoanalyst that Hilary and Kiffer finally referred her to when they saw that the sex wasn't really helping Jackie thought that Jackie's numbness was hysterical (all in her mind).  Jackie NEVER believed that.  And no one in real life thought that she had any other psychopathological symptoms.

The bits about Jackie's abusing her cello are also garbage made up by the screenwriter.  She loved her Strad.  She never left it out in the cold.  She was a vigorous performer and the Strad sometimes collapsed under her playing and had to go to the shop, but that was not deliberate abuse.

The insults in the movie--viz. Jackie telling Hilary that she was not special--are also totally made up by the screenwriter.

The drum incident at the BBC.  Jackie was not allowed to play a real instrument because the BBC had a minimum age requirement for performers and Jackie was too young.  Jackie was never jealous of Hilary's playing.  Jackie practiced because she loved to play.

The portrayal of the flute teacher at the Royal Academy of Music was accurate.  Moreover, Hilary's daughter Claire took up the cello, won the Suggia Prize at 11, the same age as Jackie, and went to the R. A. M.  After one year, she quit the cello and never played again!  I hope somebody in England is looking into the Royal Academy of Music and their ability to drive away talented musicians.

Well, enough.  Read the book if you want to know what happened.  Don't condemn Hilary or condemn Jackie because of what is in this movie.  Condemn the movie.  They had the facts.  Why did they make these deliberate distortions?

I've also read that Barenboim condemned this film as untrue.  Well he might, considering what the movie reveals about him.  But wait!  Read the other biography, the one commissioned by Barenboim himself, and the facts get even worse: Before Barenboim accepted the conductorship of the Orchestre de Paris and moved to Paris (leaving Jackie to cope with her illness as best she could), he had been offered the London Symphony Orchestra and turned it down!  His leaving was therefore not a job necessity (as the movie implies)!  And both biographies agree with the film in revealing that Barenboim did shack up with another woman in Paris and proceed to have two kids (while Jackie struggled on alone in London with her crippling illness).

Yes, buy the recordings!  Yes, buy the two documentary films and see the real Jackie.  Emily Watson gave a good performance, she was just not right for the part.  She does not have the face, the strength of character, the commanding presence that the real Jackie had.

And if you haven't seen this movie, see it.  Just take it with a grain--with a couple of spoonfuls--of salt.

Footnote: the ""widescreen"" is achieved by blocking out the top and bottom of the scene.  It is no wider than the standard.  You merely lose the sky (or whatever) and the foreground.",1140912000,57,4341,4.759408602150538
1024936,3,6305447233,"While I often post reviews of films I've only seen once, I sometimes wonder how wise that really is.  When I saw this film on the big screen several years ago, I rather disliked it.  It didn't ring true for me overall (not that I can pretend to KNOW the actual story as some of the film's critics claimed at the time--but then again, at least, I didn't mistakenly think it was about the historic meeting of two former First Ladies).  But it does seem wise to be little skeptical about bio-pics, however, and this one just did not get off to a good start with me.  In fact, I'm surprised that none of the other reviews I've read of HILARY AND JACKIE seemed to have much quarrel with the opening sequence of the two protagonists as children frolicking on the beach.  When they see a strange woman staring at the ocean, the younger, seemingly more impulsive blonde child breaks away from her sister and approaches the ""stranger.""

""Ohmigawd,"" I said to my wife, ""I can't believe this.  She's meeting up  with her adult self.""  Now, in all fairness, that's not revealed with 100% clarity until the very end of the movie (give the filmmakers credit for that much subtlety at least), but what else could it be?  And how much hokier could it be?  Young Jackie does tell her sister what ""the stranger"" told her.  Namely, that it would be ""all right.""  How TWILIGHT ZONE can you get?  And how much more manipulative?

But the movie got enough good press and additional acclaim over the years, that I decided that I would watch it again and see if I couldn't get over this particular hurdle.  Given that I knew it was coming, I found--perhaps not too surprisingly--that I could.  And watching it at home, on a smaller screen, I found some of the other cinematic cliches that I felt bogged the movie down the first time out were also forgivable.  Overall, in fact, it held together pretty well.

Interesting in a way, that I found I liked it better on the small screen, since some of the films harshest critics seem to have found it too much like an ""illness of the week"" TV movie.  I actually don't object to that kind of TV film myself and find that they often give actors a chance to shine.  Television is, in many ways, a more intimate medium than the cinema (I forget which one McLuhan said was the ""cooler"" medium, but is seems self-evident that the small screen typically makes for a more intimate experience than we typically get in a movie house.

Thus the smaller scaled HILARY AND JACKIE did work for me.  The story that had somehow seemed cliched (even if based on a true story) when I first saw it during its first run, seemed relatively direct and honest when I saw it again in my living room.  And I cannot say for certain now why I initially thought Emily Watson's performance was too mannered.  On second viewing, she seemed fine.  Jackie apparently adopted certain affectations of her own (such as strange accents), which gave Watson the challenge of portraying her character's artifice in an authentic way.  For the most part, she pulls it off rather well.

The RASHOMON quality the picture exhibited in its different (symphonic-like) segments also lends the picture a certain richness.  The truth of anyone's real life story is hard to know, of course.  Few viewers expect the absolute truth from a film biography, of course.  But on a deeper level, the film challenges the memories and the individual perspectives of nearly all its characters.  Who really said what?  And just what was actually said?  If the two protagonists' take on the ""truth"" is dubious, I guess it goes without saying that the filmmakers' take is open to question too.

And that's what makes Hilary and Jackie's respective segments work as well as they do.  What appear to be  totally selfish acts on Jackie's part (e.g. mailing her washing home while on a whirlwind tour) turns out to have a different significance when portrayed from her point of view (namely that it's a way of reaching out to her family and recapturing a sense of ""what home smells like"").  Of course, enclosing a card or a letter would have helped.

By establishing that much ambiguity, director Anand Morgan and screenwriter Frank Cottrall Boyce successfully move their film beyond ""the artist as outsider"" cliches that, on first viewing, may seem to threaten it.  They are, in a sense, fortunate to have source material that apparently grants them that ambiguity (Hilary and brother Piers' book).  Was Jackie's outrageous behavior due to suppressed rage at her family and the world?  Was it just artistic temperament run amok? Or was a good part of it, her incipient illness.  Even viewers like me, who knew only the barest outlines of DuPre's life and career, had to wonder just what drove Jackie to such extreme behavior as demanding to sleep with her sister's husband.  How much was sheer self-indulgence, how much was a self-conscious acting out of the ""difficult artist"" role, and how much was a kind of genuine madness. Finally, how much of it WAS her illness?  Rhetorical questions all.  Viewer's of the film can never know.  People in Jacqueline DuPre's actual life can probably only make their best guesses too.

Which brings us back to the childhood sequences that, as it turns out, frame the movie.  A review I read of Hilary and Piers DuPre's book indicated that Jackie did indeed have an eery childhood premonition of the illness that would cripple her in her adult life.  Apparently, she once told her sister, ""Don't tell Mum, but when I grow up I won't be able to walk or move.""  Why this spooky presentiment, which seems pretty dramatic to me, was discarded in favor of the trumped up ""mystery lady on the beach"" scene is beyond me.  Handled right, a brief scene of Jackie as a child making that stunning prediction would likely have been downright bonechilling.

The two ""Jackies"" on the beach was less than that.",1140825600,3,5886,4.669582118561711

Isn't it sad how the stable, the level-headed kid in the family is expected to be compassionate and understanding?  This is the cross that Hilary takes upon herself when her sister Jackie develops psychological problems.  When Jackie starts sleeping with Hilary's husband, Hilary makes no attempt to confront either one of them.  Because Hilary is no longer performing, being a wife and a mother, she thinks of herself as inferior to her famous sister.  She just swallows the hurt and crawls into her children's bed.  That act was very symbolic.  She was denouncing her womanhood and devoting herself 100% to motherhood.",1137801600,,809,5.129770992366412

It included scenes with portrayals of other real life musicians including Pinchas Zukerman, who made legendary recordings with the pair.

What most people in the industry most hated (aside from the wayward portrayal of the hero) was the way Emily Watson acted out the final days of DuPre, whose career ended prematurely as a a result of multiple sclerosis, which led to her death at an early age. ""Hasn't she already suffered enough?"" asked a critical review of the film in American Record Guide.

Still today DuPre is revered in England, her homeland, for her musical artistry. Her recordings maintain the stamp of a genius who died young. She is ranked up there with other young geniuses that died young like Ferenc Friscay and William Kapell.

She is so popular in England that her famous recording of Edward Elgar's Victorian-era cello concerto was ranked the second greatest recording of the 20th century in the 2000 reader poll by Gramophone magazine, a beacon of classical music on both sides of the Atlantic.

So the people of classical music, who perhaps cling to their memories of living legends more closely than patrons of any art form, could not reconcile the idea that this artist was such a bitch, twit and bad wife. Surely she must have been a porcelain angel!

No way, according to this biopic. Right from a young age she was competitive with her older, then more talented sister. She fought for more love from her parents and demanded the attention of everyone that would watch. She turned into an erratic adult whose artistry was unquestioned but whose personal affectations alienated many. Or so says the biopic, anyway.

THe scenes of her death are painful and probably too real for most people to handle. It was difficult for me to sit through those scenes first time I saw this movie. It is a reality flick of a life come undone by a disease no one can tackle in graphic portrayals.

I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a compelling drama about real life people. But be forewarned, this is not going to be pleasant viewing. It is to classical music what ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was to most people's view of Jesus -- too real and up close for comfort.",1115942400,5,2516,4.80787037037037

1025001,5,6305447233,"First off, this movie is based on a book of memoirs, which, of course, are based on ""actual"" events.  I didn't read the book (I hardly ever do).

Emily Watson turned in another devastating performance, the first being her role in Breaking the Waves.  Both are also similar in the fact that they're both almost unbearable to watch at certain points.  In this one, that point was the point where Jackie, suffering from MS, is shaking--flailing--wildly and can't stop.  It's just so upsetting.  But we're compensated for this scene because soon after we're shown one where Jackie's sister, Hilary, is holding her in her arms and manages to get her to stop shaking, all while recalling their happier childhood.  It's truly HEARTBREAKING.  Then, of course, in the next scene ... okay, I won't spoil anything.  ;)

Emily Watson, it seems, gets to have a LOT of sex in her movies.  And, in fact, she just LOOKS like somebody that would do just that.  Basically, Hilary takes pity on her sister and shares her husband.  Shocking?  Yes.

More so because this is based on a true story, remember.

1025003,4,6305447233,"Exceptional lives about extraordinary people always make good book and movie sense. The possibilities are limitless and the audience favours a bit of an inside peek at the lives of the rich and famous. This is the case with Hilary And Jackie, a film based on the lives of Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, and the basis of the book, A Genius In The Family by Hilary and her brother, Piers.

We are taken on a roller coaster ride of grand proportions as the du Pre parents, Derek (Charles Dance) and Iris (Celia Imrie) watch their two daughters, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie (Emily Watson), attempt to span the Mt. Everest of the classical world with their music. All starts out well enough, with Hilary, a flautist, taking centre stage and Jackie taking a back-seat until receiving that extra push from her mother, who was also a classically trained pianist, to excel. And excel she does. The two young girls who portray the du Pre sisters as children, Auriol Evans (Jackie) and Keely Flanders (Hilary) are exquisite in their innocence and understanding needed to comprehend the complexities required to master both the sense of competition and the sisterly understanding that permeated their relationship throughout their lives. We see the emotions of both spiraling in opposite directions as Hilary is pushed into submission and Jackie flaunts superiority on her cello. Hilary is forced on almost a daily basis to hear from one and all, ""and how is your wonderful sister, Jackie?"" as she goes deeper and deeper into the background, almost fading into the wall, as her musical star burns and fades all too quickly. She will never be good enough to compete.

Jackie is portrayed as forceful, a tornado, wholly spoiled and used to getting her own way, even to the point of wanting her sister's husband, Kiffer (David Morrissey), and getting him. Jackie, never one to be bested by others, attempts to play the game of one upsmanship with her sister and eventually marries the Argentine piano prodigy, Daniel Barenboim (James Frain). But, as is won't to happen throughout Jackie's life, nothing is ever good enough to remain for long, as she is firmly the architect of her own choosing. The supreme irony occurs when she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 28, seeing her career ebb and flow until she is a shaking skeleton of her former self, as she descends into final illness and imminent death at 42.

The actresses portraying Hilary and Jackie, Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson, do superb jobs in recreating two very interesting enigmas and the world they inhabited. Much was made when A Genius In The Family was published, for it took the goddess on the pedestal, Jackie, and shook the very foundations with its portrayal of her as vain, self absorbed, unkind and a sexual predator towards her sister's husband. Those in England were shocked that Hilary would have shared such personal memories for all the world to read, and she caught a great deal of flack because of it. I feel that this has nothing to do with the music that Jackie made, and while it may put her in less of a favourable light than we would like on a personal level, it does nothing to negate the genius that she was to become and who holds a firm grasp even to this day, almost 16 years after her death. There are those in the music world who refuse to play her most famous cello rendition, Elgar's Cello Concerto, in tribute to her accomplishment. Hilary has presented Jackie with all her credits and flaws in striking fashion. What is history or biography unless we are presented with a complete and absolute portrait? A shallow representation not worthy of mention.

Rachel Griffiths is the more interesting of the two actresses, for her performances is multilayered, presenting stratas of the plain Jane who becomes the doormat that her sister walks over in her pursuit of greatness. Watching Griffiths facial expression change from warm to cold as she is asked by Jackie to share her husband with her, is worth the price of admission, and that small action presents her as an actress completely in possession of her craft. She's that rare animal that performs with controlled and yet unsubjected abandon and it is a delight to be on the receiving end.

Emily Watson's Jackie is both engaging and obnoxious, rather bleeding over the top in her representation. Jacqueline du Pre was not as difficult in real life, although at times she was and could be a force to be reckoned with. She owned a sense of humour, was not as gifted or musically knowledgeable outside of her collected realm of works and could throw poison barbs out with the best of them. Watson seems to go for the worst and nothing of Jackie's generosity is to be seen in the course of this film.

Arnand Tucker, the director, has fashioned a first time effort with smartness and finesse, and has used a Rashomon technique to project this layered tale from the perspective of both sisters. Hilary's version being presented first and Jackie's, imperialistic and heartbreaking, the second. Similar situations as seen through different eyes. He has used a genuine facet of believability with the opening of the movie, as we see the two sisters as children on a beach, before the glory days. They see a mysterious woman on the same beach, who tells Jackie that everything will be all right. This same woman is seen at the end of the film in the same setting, and it is the adult Jackie, who has come through heaven and hell. A very interesting concept by Tucker, whose previous work has been for the BBC.

The music by Barrington Pheloung is quite mood enhancing, and is interspersed with selections by Bach, Elgar, Boccherini, Hayden and Schumann. The cello, in original parts of the soundtrack, is played by Caroline Dale, with Hilary du Pre being quoted as saying that Ms. Dale, 'achieved an extraordinary amount of 'cello acting' in catching the spirit and sound of Jackie. She has hit the nail squarely on the head.

If there is to be a major complaint about this film, it lies with the representation of Jackie's life during the last 14 years of it, after her diagnosis. Time is compressed into a matter of what seems to be mere minutes, with no thought being given to the life she led in reality as a teacher for other students and the causes she embraced. One is led to believe that except for the visits of friends and her husband, Barenboim, from Paris on weekends, that she practically led a housebound and almost solo existence. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

Hilary And Jackie is a film that entreats us to enter into a world that perhaps a good many of us have envied to some degree, but would be loathe and hard pressed to withstand without the endurance of a long distance runner and the wisdom of Solomon keeping pace. Human frailties and emotions are put on the table and we are dealt a hand that wrenches our souls with what might and could have been.",1092441600,7,6939,4.718646864686469
1025004,5,6305447233,"I think that many reviewers are hung up on who the real Jacqueline duPre was and therefore do not appreciate the films numerous redeeming qualities and instead concentrate on Emily Watson's cello-playing. The film is deeply moving, superbly acted, and, more than anything, succeeds as a work of art. I'm sorry I am being so vague about it, but I haven't seen the film in a few years and anyway there are enough plot synopses here to get you through. My recommendation is that you watch this film. (If it means anything, I am a 3rd year male college student, and my musical background is limited to playing the clarinet for only about nine years, so I am no authority on the cello. But this movie really isn't about playing the cello. I wish some people would understand that.)",1078444800,2,776,4.589928057553957
1025005,3,6305447233,"I give this movie three stars mainly because as a classical musician myself, this movie kind of dealt with when I went away to study abroad at Brevard for six weeks.  And it's true for almost any musician that most of your days are spent either rehearsing or performing.  And I can relate so much to Jackie because I wanted to get serious with my musical talent, but the traveling and touring and publicity took a toll on me.  And I wanted to have a normal life like Hilary where she settles down with her husband, haves babies, and raises chickens on a farm. But then Jackie reveals the unthinkable when she wants to sleep with Kiffer.  Also this isn't a great movie to watch if you're a young viewer who wanted to know more about Jackie's life as a musician.  Some material on here is rather offensive, provocative, and bizarre. I was a little disappointed with the visual effects.  She uses the ""f"" word quite often and there's quite a bit of nudity.
Overall I'd still give it three stars because some parts of the movie were fictional or didn't quite make sense. But in some cases, it shows unconditional love as sisters. Hilary was by her side when Jackie had MS and right before her death. In my opinion, the book ""Hilary and Jackie"" is much better than the movie--mainly because it tells what really went on.  I think you better read the book first before watching the movie.",1074384000,6,1382,4.48207171314741

1025008,5,6305447233,"This is an outstanding film with bravura performances by all the actors and actresses who grace it. Emily Watson is dazzling as world renowned cellist, Jacqueline Du Pre, and Rachel Griffiths gives a heartwarming portrayal of Hilary, the more grounded Du Pre sister. British director Anand Tucker does a masterful job of capturing and exploring the often complex and symbiotic relationship between these two sisters, one of whom reaches heights in the music world of which most may only dream.

Most of the film is bifurcated in that it is told from the perspective of each of the sisters, with the same scenarios being viewed through the eyes of one sister at any given time. The film opens with a scene of the young sisters playing on the beach, with an enigmatic adult figure on the shore whom the younger of the sisters, Jackie, approaches. They speak, but what transpires between the young Jackie and this solitary figure is only made manifest at the conclusion of the film.

The viewer is then thrust into the Du Pre household, where it is clear that their lives revolve around music, with Jackie playing the cello and Hilary the flute. A pivotal moment in the film occurs when Hilary is invited to participate in a televised children's concert, and Jackie is not. Jackie is told by their mother that if she wishes to get such an invitation that she must play better.

This is an edict that Jackie takes to heart and adopts with abandon, becoming relentless in her devotion to the cello, until it is she, and not Hilary, who becomes the one in demand and the one to whom slavish attention is given. This is a portent of things to come. Therein lies the seed for the subtle rivalry that is to last their entire lives, though they remain as close as two sisters can be. Jackie goes on to become one of the world's most renowned cellists.

That Hilary sublimates herself to her sister is obvious, even when ballroom dancing together, as it is Jackie who leads Hilary. This was to remain the pattern for most of their respective lives. While the shy and seemingly insecure Hilary eventually marries a man who makes her feel special and important, it is Jackie who continues to dazzle, even in the marriage arena, marrying a world class pianist with whom she makes beautiful music, until she is struck by a fatal illness.

As Jackie's world spirals out of control, Hilary is leading the placid life of a country squiress, having children and playing at local concerts, happily married to a man who is clearly devoted to her. Jackie intrudes on their idyllic life, and in her frenetic fashion turns their world upside down during a visit sans her husband, when she obviously horns in on Hilary's husband. What happens next is sure to shock even the most jaded of viewers.

As Jackie grows more successful in the music world, her personal life spirals out of control. Her passion for the cello is often countermanded by the pains she takes to try to divest herself of the demanding instrument that seemingly controls her life, as her passion and musical genius begin to consume her to the exclusion of all else. Her tortured soul is finally set free, when she succumbs to her fatal illness, a lonely and tragic figure at the end, mourned most of all by Hilary.

This is a movie that music lovers and anyone who loves a beautifully directed and well-acted film will appreciate and enjoy.",1041638400,17,3385,4.678991596638656
1025009,2,6305447233,"The particulars of this film have already been discussed exhaustively by other reviewers. What I'd like to add is that the book on which it is based, written by Hilary du Pre, despite the attacks it received from the British press, is a much more evenhanded account of the two sisters' complex relationship than the melodramatic events portrayed in the film, many of which appear to have been invented from whole cloth (though not the central, titillating assertion that Hilary and Jackie shared more than most sisters).
In addition, Daniel Barenboim, pianist, conductor and du Pre's real-life husband, refused to cooperate with the making of this film in any way, including giving licensing permission to use du Pre's actual recordings. Thus, with one exception, the cello playing in the film (very competent, to be sure) is by a totally different artist. This, together with Emily Watson's notably unskillful pantomiming of du Pre playing the cello, seems to sum up the falseness behind the concept and execution of this entire project. All in all, Hilary and Jackie is a disappointment as drama and a disservice to the memory of a great musical artist.",1023235200,8,1155,5.020833333333333
1025010,5,6305447233,"This 1998 film stars Emily Watson as Jacqueline and Rachael Griffiths as Hilary, the two musically talented real-life English Du Pre sisters.  Jackie became world renowned for her cello playing but was deeply troubled and worn out by the constant touring.  Hilary, who was trained to play the flute, married early and lived an idyllic life with her husband and children.  The bond between the sisters was great, so deep in fact, that an emotionally disturbed Jackie even went so far as to ask her sister an unusual favor.  Based on a memoir by Hillary Du Pre and her brother Piers, the screenplay was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, who managed to bring out both the deep love as well as sibling rivalry between the sisters. David Morrissey and James Frain play their two husbands. Both do fine jobs in their supporting roles.
There are three sections to the film, which starts off during the sisters' childhood.  Later, after Jackie becomes successful, we see the story from Hilary's point of view.  Then, the same incidents are shown from Jackie's viewpoint.  From these unique perspectives, our understanding is deepened as the tale grows darker and more complex..  Of course there are also the concert performances, which music lovers will no doubt enjoy, but the music never gets in the way of the haunting story or the wonderful characterizations by the cast.  It is not always comfortable to probe human nature so deeply, but it is always fascinating.  And ""Hilary and Jackie"" is a superbly fascinating film.",1022025600,16,1516,4.909803921568628
1025084,5,6305447233,"When Hilary and Jackie opened, it caused a bit of controversy. Most movies about real life people usually do, unless everyone who knew then is dead. Some rather famous people said the story was not that accurate. I am not knowledgeable enough about the De Pres sisters to know the truth. I only know that what was written was turned into a fine movie.
Hilary and Jacqueline De Pres were too English sisters who were extraordinarily close when they were young. As adults, their lives took very different paths, which is what gives the movie much of its drama and pathos. Raised in a musical household, both showed great promise as children. Hilary learned to play the flute, while Jackie decided on an unlikely instrument, the cello. Both won numerous awards. As often happens, when they matured, only Jackie proved to have that true spark of genius it takes to become a world-class musician. After Jackie began to tour Europe, Hilary, not unhappily, opted for life in the country with her husband, who also loved music.
The film cleverly covers some key events by showing us both sisters' points of view. To Jackie, Hilary has used her gift to become selfish and distant. The love still exists, but barriers get built. What Jackie cannot see is that Hilary sees herself as enslaved to the cello. Anyone who has ever been obsessed with something can relate to this. In her hotel room, Jackie can get no rest useless she puts her cherished instrument in another room. One time she puts it on a balcony in the snow. Another time she leaves it in a taxi. Even with these efforts, it often plays a big role in her nightmares. The isolation Jackie feels on the road causes her to have times when she feels no one loves her. Ultimately, I think she believes that the cello, which she tried so hard to master in order to please her family, ends up causing her to be in some way cast off from her loved ones.
Hilary is jealous of Jackie's talent and fame, while Jackie is envious of her sister's normal, loving life. This is a fairly common theme in sibling rivalries, but it is especially painful when the bond between the sisters is so strong.
Jackie does marry the famous concert pianist Daniel Barenboim, but her insecurities get the best of her. In one pivotal scene in a European hotel suite, she asks Daniel if he would still love her if she lost her talent. He does not know how to respond, and she disappears. She runs to Hilary. Soon she asks for a very unusual favor, which I will not reveal here.
Much of the music in the movie are from works that made Hilary famous, and it is quite effective. As Hilary, Emily Watson was nominated for an Oscar. It is a stunning performance, one of the best of the decade. The entire cast is nearly perfect. Again, I am in awe of English actors as a whole. They don't often get to do it for the money, you know.
The ending is intense. It will remain with the viewer for some time. Hilary and Jackie is a must see for those believe that movies can occasionaly be an art form.",1016755200,5,3012,4.468239564428312
1025085,5,6305447233,"This totally absorbing movie concerning the life of famous cellist Jacqueline duPr and those around her is based on the book written after her death by her siblings.  It charts her life right from her very first performance to her untimely death, beginning with her childhood and then moving through to her adult years where Jackie (Watson) and close sister Hilary (Griffiths) head off their separate ways.  The movie manages to sidestep Hollywood drama by giving an unbiased view of the troubled lives of the two sisters.  For instance, one particularly affecting act by Jackie is backtracked so the audience gets to see what led her to it.
A great deal of its mesmerising quality comes from its two stars.  Watson acts her socks off as the world-famous cellist and wisely chooses not to go for the audience's sympathy once her downfall begins.  Griffiths is an utter revelation, in a role completely different to that which she played in `Muriel's Wedding'.  She is understated and manages to create a character full with emotional vulnerability but also brimming with fantastic strength.  To add to this, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong.
The cello performances are never less than astounding and really bring to the limelight just how talented Jacqueline duPr was.  However, it is its depiction of two sisters side-by-side is beautiful and its message that fame isn't everything is subtly stated.  The contrasts between the two women, ironically both searching for the same thing yet finding it in different places, are beautifully done.  The same can be said for the film's question of whether life is about settling for the best alternative or whether that elusive dream should always be chased.  Without doubt this is not only one of the best British movies in years but also something that redeems the true-life drama.",1013472000,3,1836,4.9868852459016395

But the director refused to go for the cheap effect (what tears there are, are genuine), thus turning this film into something maudlin. The trailer tells you misleadingly that this is a movie about a woman, her sister, and the man they both loved. I guess I missed that last part of the story (and thank God, the director did not dwell on the sensational element in the story). For me the film was about the relationship between two sisters, music, and death. The only criticism I do have is Ms Dupre's passion for music is not adequately covered; and in its place we get her dis-passion for her profession. Had the director confronted the passion aspect, he could have then woven the trilogy of concepts - human relationships, music, and death - into something awfully profound (but then again, perhaps this is something only Shakespeare could have pulled off).

On Hilary And Jackie , director Tucker talks about exactly the same theme yet in a far more specific and at the same time complicated way .
  The family of Jaqueline DuPre has said in the past that this movie doesn't describe the gifted artist as she really was. Did the producers and screenwritters twisted the truth in order to make her film-biographie  more intreresting ? That's not a question for us to answer . All we can do is judge  Hilary And Jackie  for it's artistic point of view and it's ability to move us. It tells the life of a woman trapped by her own music talent in a way of life she doesn't like . She never seems to be sure whether all those people who surround her see something more in her than Jackie the musician . Do they see Jackie the person ? She feels certain only concerning her sister's love. She is trying to confirm that love by asking her to do even the most extreme things ( let her sleep with her husband ) .
  The film is been seperated in two parts , one talking about how Hilary saw things through her own eyes and one about how Jackie did . Emily Watson is excellent as always as Jackie while Australian actress Rachel Griffiths displays a great deal of talent too in her first major lead role .She creates a down-to-earth Hilary who never stops feeling compation about her sister's problems .

The viewer is then thrust into the Du Pre household, where it is clear that their lives revolve around music, with Jackie playing the cello and Hilary the flute. A pivotal moment in the film occurs when Hilary is invited to participate in a televised children's concert, and Jackie is not. Jackie is told by their mother that if she wishes to get such an invitation that she must play better.
This is an edict which Jackie takes to heart and adopts with abandon, becoming relentless in her devotion to the cello, until it is she, and not Hilary, who becomes the one in demand and the one to whom slavish attention is given. This is a portend of things to come. Therein lies the seed for the subtle rivalry which is to last their entire lives, though they remain as close as two sisters can be. Jackie goes on to become one of the world's most renowned cellists.
That Hilary sublimates herself to her sister is obvious, even when ballroom dancing together, as it is Jackie who leads Hilary. This was to remain the pattern for most of their respective lives. While the shy and seemingly insecure Hilary eventually marries a man who makes her feel special and important, it is Jackie who continues to dazzle, even in the marriage arena, marrying a world class pianist with whom she makes beautiful music, until she is struck by a fatal illness.
As Jackie's world spirals out of control, Hilary is leading the placid life of a country squiress, having children and playing at local concerts, happily married to a man who is clearly devoted to her. Jackie intrudes on their idyllic life, and in her frenetic fashion turns their world upside down during a visit sans her husband, when she obviously horns in on Hilary's husband. What happens next is sure to shock even the most jaded of viewers.
As Jackie grows more successful in the music world, her personal life spirals out of control. Her passion for the cello is often countermanded by the pains she takes to try to divest herself of the demanding instrument that seemingly controls her life, as her passion and musical genius begin to consume her to the exclusion of all else. Her tortured soul is finally set free, when she succumbs to her fatal illness, a lonely and tragic figure at the end, mourned most of all by Hilary.
This is a movie that music lovers and anyone who loves a beautifully directed and well acted film will enjoy.",984441600,5,3366,4.668350168350169

Just want to add or reiterate that if you see this movie fresh, without any knowledge of this story beforehand and judge it  by the work of the director and actor alone, as I did,  I believe the movie will hold you in its grip continuously as the film unfolds.

1025092,5,6305447233,"Embarrisingly, I have to admit that the only reason I ended up watching this movie in the first place was that I happened to stumble upon it during one of my ""there's nothing on but this seems somewhat interesting"" kind of moods.  Sufficed to say, I was hooked from the first five minutes.  I had no past knowledge of the story line or even of the cellest Jaqueline Du Pre.  The movie was simply captivating, from the music (and this is coming from someone who'd rather listen to Smashing Pumpkins then Elgar)to the connection between the two sisters Hilary and Jackie.  I have two brothers but no sisters and it was different to see two sisters who knew eahother so well they seemed to be able to read eachother's minds.  Kiffer was definatly the comic relief to an otherwise seriously toned movie.  He had me nearly doubled over in laughter when he walzted into Hilary's home ""to make a nuisance of himself"".
I will admit, however, that the scene where Hilary allowed Jackie to sleep with her husband was somewhat disturbing.  Never in my wildest nightmares could I imagine allowing one of my best friends (being as to how I have no sisters)to sleep with my husband whom I loved very dearly and had children with.  It goes against my morals.  However, I understand perfectly that to edit out that part would be taking away from the magic of the story so by no means do I wish they had removed it.  It was a crucial part to Jackie's deteriorating health, in my opinion at least, and had a necessity to be shared.
In a nut shell, this movie left me breathless.  After watching it for the first time, I immediatly went on the lookout for it again on my satilite and upon finding it, proceeded to tape it.  I am now looking forward to hopefully one day owning the soundtrack (as it is the music I like best out of the whole film)and perhaps even the book written by her siblings after all the good reviews I have heard about it.  To the film making company in charge of adapting this movie, I say thank you for your selection.  To the actors and actresses who made the story come alive, I say bravo.  Bravo.",972518400,7,2105,4.431168831168831
1025093,5,6305447233,"Films as intelligent and well crafted as this are hard to come by.  ""Hilary and Jackie"" is an exceptionally well done character study of two real life sisters.  Jackie (Emily Watson) is a world-class cellist and Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) lives a normal middle class life.  The story is rich in character development depicting the sisters starting from their childhood when both were musical prodigies.  Now that they are adults, they envy each other's life.  The story follows Jackie's career and explores the sisters' relationship, including the deep resentment and enduring love they have for one another.  Director Anand Tucker does a wonderful job of presenting the story.  He induces great feeling from each scene and lays the raw emotions on the screen without embellishment whether pure or turbulent.
Emily Watson was superb in the lead role.  Her's was an extremely complex character and her command of the range of emotions Jackie required was phenomenal.  Lovers of classical music will appreciate the rich soundtrack and Watson's realistic cello renditions.  Watson was nominated for best actress by the Academy in 1999 for this performance and I felt she was most deserving of the prize that ultimately went to Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Shakespeare in Love"".  Paltrow's performance was clever and charming, but had nowhere near the power Watson delivered in this film.  Emily is such a talented actress, however, that I have little doubt eventually there will be some other envelope with her name inside.
Rachel Griffiths also gave a career performance as Hilary and she was nominated for best supporting actress, an award I felt she won hands down.  Griffiths' tortured performance was gut wrenching and inspired.  She played Hilary with deep sensitivity and handled her emotional conflicts brilliantly.  The Academy's choice of Judy Dench was again perplexing as the Shakespeare juggernaut rolled on.
For those viewers who appreciate a powerful and disturbing drama, great acting, complex characters, terrific classical music and extraordinary character development, this film is a must.  I rated it a 9/10.  Don't miss it.",969753600,2,2132,5.2976190476190474
1025164,4,6305447233,"Ah, the beauty of sibling rivalry. From the fragile years of childhood to the tumultuous twenties and the shaky bridge of middle-age, this is an epic  of two women on the verge of being legendary. This movie depicts the  unrelenting and sometimes vulgar competition to be more or less complicated  than the other, to be more talented, more beautiful and more successful,  lasting a lifetime and beyond. It examines the twisted devotion between  real-life sisters Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, rivaling musicians and  completely diverse women in their motivation to find happiness in their  molded lives.
From the beginning, their mother hands Hilary a flute and  Jackie a cello, and together they relentlessly play note after note,  concerto after concerto, even original music that their mother composes.  She immerses them in amateur talent competitions, Hilary displaying an  acute aptitude for the flute and Jackie looking on in deep-rooted envy, her  cumbersome instrument weighing heavy in her hands. When Hilary wins her  woodwind division, Jackie begins her mission for excellence, rehearsing  pieces in her head and even on her arm. Her unearthly skill becomes  apparent and, in time, she outshines Hilary and leaves her sister trailing  in her brilliant afterglow.
As the story commences, the first half of the  film becomes Hilary's side of the story, her point of view to the events  that transpire. Hilary's aspiration for music wanes as she reaches  adulthood, her capabilities as a musician put under a microscope by a  callous and unyielding instructor. She forgets her objective for excellence  when she meets Kiffer, a young and ambitious conductor who is scouting  specifically for her talent to put in a showcase concert. She is enamored  by his quirky sense of humor and romantic sentimentality and agrees to  marry him when he proposes. Not long after the joyous news spreads,  Jacqueline arrives home after an extensive philharmonic tour to discover  that her sister has stumbled upon a happiness that she relentlessly  searches for and in due time envies. From this first half of the film,  Jacqueline is made out to be a self-indulgent and incorrigible brat, an  emotional vampire and a manic-depressive. When the second half begins and  the film does a reversal of roles, we begin to see why Jacqueline is such  an extreme character and why she is somewhat volatile and self-destructive.
The performances from Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths as the indelible  duo are a spring rain versus an annihilative hurricane. Jacqueline is  undoubtedly the whirlwind of despair as the tortured talent, the golden  child of impeccable and preternatural endowment depicted in Hilary's  autobiographical account ""A Genius In The Family"". Anand Tucker  has justifiably extolled Jackie with all the colorful reenactments he  choreographs of some of her most memorable performances in concert halls  around the world. Emily Watson emulates the wily and seductive  characteristics of du Pre's exhibitions with the greatest of ease. She sits  resolutely in her concert chair, her brow furrowed in unbearable ecstasy as  her ochroid tresses whip wildly about her, her spindly arms and wiry  fingers moving masterfully upon the delicate strings of her lavish and  superbly crafted instrument. She is a radiant spectacle to behold in her  vibrant ballgowns and long, lustrous locks, cradling her cello as if it  were a red-hot lover or violently slicing her bow across it in an unbridled  rage.
Rachel Griffiths rounds out the dramatics as the solid and  self-reliant Hilary, an astute and rational woman. She favors the simple  life, choosing domesticity over the eccentric and frenzied lifestyle that  her sister leads. She is Jackie's voice of reason, her soothing sedative  when Jackie's stress levels begin to overflow. She embraces her without  question, as anyone would with family, but is a bit gullible, being taken  advantage of and grudgingly accepting of her sister's penchant for  dramatics. When Kipper begins to consistently object, she is forced to be  candid with Jackie and in the end sends her away.
This is an excellent  movie as far as direction and cinematography, but one will be slightly  skeptical about the real-life relationship between the du Pres, especially  pertaining to what Hilary allows Jackie to have at a certain point in the  film. This is obviously for dramatic purposes but still makes an  interesting story more intriguing by far. If you want more insight, read  Hilary's book. Either way, you'll become absorbed by the fascinating life  of a bewitching and remarkably gifted woman.",967248000,2,4630,5.217687074829932
1025165,4,6305447233,"Somehow this film reminds of Cries and Whispers - maybe becuase that one was also about sisters.  I found this one to be quite good,a well-paced drama with powerful cinematography.  I also think that an important issue  was raised that a genius in something can be quite and ordinary person in  their personal life.  So, whether it's true or not that Jaqueline de Pre  had the life as depicted,  the point is (in my opinion) that a talented  person could be not of a very sublime behavior.  I'd recommend for seriou  film watchers.",962496000,2,531,4.612903225806452
1025166,2,6305447233,"When I heard, through musical grape vines, of a movie being made on Jackie du Pre, my curiosity was pinched.  I made assumptions on the films content and all in all, expected a totally different film from what I sat through  on a cold winter's night in '98. I should have been more  prudent...especially when the film was titled, Hilary and Jackie.  The film  focuses around the relationship of the two sister's, each one supposedly  telling their own story, Hilary from her pathetic corner of the world and  Jackie from the grave.  The movie progresses or rather, degenerates to an  end that gives no memorium, no regard for a talent for the ages.  For  those who do not know of Jacquline du Pre's genius, I suggest you go to the  music section of this website and type in Elgar Cello Concerto in the  search.  Then, you will find a list of links connecting you different  albums.  Peruse through the endless artists, orchestra's, and directors.  You will find her.  Click on du Pre.

1025167,1,6305447233,"And people said Fight Club was a vicious movie!  This is a dreaful film adaptation of an even more dreadful book. It's all frightfully frightfully English and Jacqueline du Pre appears like an English version of ""Baby  Jane Hudson, the early years.""  There's no intellectual content at all  in this film, no evidence of Jacqueline's du Pre's talent as a musician,  and still less, no evidence of her own highly unique personality; All she's  made to look like is an unwashed dysfunctional running about the set in  faux 60's style clothes. I can't believe she was such an unsympathetic  character as she appears in this movie.
Another aspect of the film that  everyone famous, from Daniel Barenboim to Margot Fonteyn, are played as the  shallowest of man and womankind who dropped du Pre when she was of no  further use to them. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The great  movie going public who will see this film are not going to reach for du  Pre's wonderful recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto and hear the real  ""Jackie"" after seeing this abysmally fearful farrago.
Jacqueline du Pre's brother and sister, Piers and Hilary, should be  thoroughly ashamed of themselves for producing the book in the first place.  And, I suppose, they sobbed all the way to the bank! There is one  consolation; they are both absolutely persona non grata now and forever in  the music world.",960681600,11,1386,4.776371308016878
1025168,5,6305447233,"This is an outstanding portrayal of two sisters who share a love of music and each other. The bond between them was brilliantly portrayed by Emily and Rachel and they should both have won Oscars.
I did not know very much  about Jaqueline's real life prior to this movie so I cannot comment on any  factual discrepancies. All I can say is that the movie moved me and the  story told is easily as tragic as that in Shine. The pressure put upon  young musicians who show extraordinary talents is well displayed, and the  scenes where Jackie is playing away from home to huge audiences but has  no-one to support her, tear at the heartstrings almost as much as the  brilliant Cello playing.
I would recommend this movie to all musicians or  anyone who loves music. It demonstrates that the truly great musicians do  not just appear, they give their whole lives over to the art",959644800,,872,4.538461538461538
1025169,5,6305447233,"Second movie of British director Anand Tucker, HILARY & JACKIE is an absolutely must see for those of you (I hope there's at least one survivor !) who appreciate the filmed biographies genre. HILARY & JACKIE's  screenplay has been inspired by the book A GENIUS IN THE FAMILY, written by  Hilary and Piers du Pr&eacute;, respectively sister and brother of the famous  cellist Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; who died a few years ago at the age of 42.
One  follows the common beginnings, the separation from her family, the musical  triumphs of Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;, her marriage with the great pianist Daniel  Barenboim, her battle with the terrible illness she has suffered from and,  finally, her last days in complete loneliness. But that's of public  notoriety and is only the spinal column of a movie that plunges in the  intimate feelings of the two sisters.
Beautiful, gifted and young,  Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; had everything to be happy but, if you take her sister's  opinion for granted, she was not. She had given her body and her soul to  the cello that was her companion through her life. Under the camera of  Anand Tucker, this cello will become a subtle metaphor of the torments of  the artist. The numerous scenes involving a Jackie unable to communicate  (foreign languages, inaccurate phone numbers, illness) leave also a bitter  taste in our mouth ; the music has eaten alive this genius.
And last but  not least, you will find in HILARY & JACKIE a first class  cinematography one wouldn't have expected to find in such a movie. Director  Anand Tucker has without doubt the future for him. A word for Emily Watson  too : after Lars Von Trier's masterpiece BREAKING THE WAVES, she gives here  an OUTSTANDING performance that leaves far behind the performances of  today's feminine new stars.

The style of the piece, coupled with the music and the amazing performances by Watson and Rachel Griffiths (both Oscar nominated) were almost  overwhelming. The beauty of the movie is that it shows us its subjects  (famed cellist Jacqueline DuPre and her decidedly lesser known, yet  talented sister Hilary) so objectively. Just when I started to believe that  the film narrative structure had reach its zenith, I see ""Hilary and  Jackie,"" and gain new hope. The finale of the movie will completely  blow you away, I am certain. It is a movie I wish everyone could see!  I  can't say enough good things about it.",956707200,,685,4.697478991596639

1025172,2,6305447233,"This movie is too long by half.  In fact, ten minutes would be too long for this film.  Maybe it had a screenplay, but you can't tell it from the movie.  It feels as if the director said to himself, ""I read the book,  I'll just shoot what I feel.""  There was probably a deadline, and the  editor(s) just gave up, trying to assemble the hodge-podge.  At least there  was enough money to make it look pretty.
The thing is full of repetetive  and confusing flashbacks.  I don't know whether the acting is any good,  because the characters are all cardboard cut-outs.  According to the  soundtrack, Jackie knew a few snatches of Bach sonatas and the Elgar  concerto.  Maybe she knew Twinkle-Twinkle, too.
Hillary is a goody two  shoes, devoted to family.  Jackie is a selfish, shallow nonentity, obsessed  with sex.  In one frequent flashback, where the girls are exchanging verbal  abuse, Hillary tells Jackie she is nothing without her cello.
Jackie's  death is a blessing for everyone but her. As for sleeping with Hillary's  husband, it is possible to say ""no"" even to primadonnas.  What  does that say about Hillary's courage; I can't find any of her flute  recordings?
The main problem here are the two new styles of biography.  One thinks we need to know about every bathroom break in a person's life.  I'm reading one now on Jefferson, like that--tedious.  There is also one on  Horowitz.  The other new biographic form presents the thesis  that the  accomplishments and creations of our geniuses and heroes are completely  nullified by their character flaws.  This movie is one of those  biographies.  What rubbish!  If you want to read others, there's one on  Leonard Bernstein by Peyser and one on Picasso by Huffington.
