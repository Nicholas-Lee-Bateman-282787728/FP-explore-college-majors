Great sound and footage, the camera crew was really able to capture what was going on and the edits are smooth. Mike Keneally, Bakin' @ the Potato DVD is the second set of this show with the same band. I would also highly recommend that DVD as well.",1462233600,,397,4.605633802816901

8453660,5,B0052A1OQW,"Bar none, Bryan is a force to be reckoned with. This DVD's real gem, other than Beller's compositions in modern Americana of course, is the guitarist, Griff Peters. His sonic snarls, scratches and swells - without the obligatory (guitar god) facial contortions, demand awe and respect. Definitely worth the price of admission.",1414022400,2,326,5.288461538461538
8453661,5,B0052A1OQW,A mesmerizing performance with all the same players from the Mike Keneally  Band.  Great DVD with an even greater band!,1379721600,4,119,4.9
8453662,5,B0052A1OQW,"I have to admit, I was not familiar with Bryan Beller before I bought Mike Keneally's ""Bakin' @ The Potato!"" DVD. I bought Bryan's DVD because it is the first part of the same concert that Mike Keneally filmed for his DVD and I wanted to have the whole night of music as was presented to the audience that night.

All I can say is ""Wow!"" What a great night of music it was! Bryan Beller is an excellent bassist and the other musicians playing with both him and Mike Keneally are also great as well. I can't get into each song's performance because, like I said, I'm new to all of them but as a newcomer I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.

On the technical side, there's no fancy camera work or anything here. Just a bunch of musicians squeezed onto a small stage in small club and a basic filming of that show. We've all enjoyed nights like this in clubs in whatever city we live in and watching this DVD on a big screen is very much like you are sitting in that very club on that night. It's a real presentation of the experience and you don't really need more than that to enjoy the music.

I'm very happy with this purchase.",1363824000,6,1123,4.213953488372093
8453663,5,B0052A1OQW,I bought Bryan Bellar's DVD for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is extremely pleased with it. He listens to  it quite often and enjoys every minute of it. We know Bryan personally and has attended one of his concerts in Atlanta. You will love it!!,1327017600,2,249,4.413043478260869
