The acting and story are very real - no excuses, explanations, or apology, rather an opportunity to see life in contemporary Australia. I'll watch it again.",1365552000,5,290,4.490566037735849

4185248,4,B003RHZ67K,"This film provides a terrific view of the differences in class culture in Australia, juxtaposing the lives of 2 kids, basically from the same background, but with the chance difference of racial characteristics and color. The movie gives the viewer a quick but surprisingly relatively deep understanding of race issues in Australia in one short movie-length glance.

The scenery, sets, dialogue, and acting are on-point for Australia, underscoring the pace, feel, and sense of place that accurately portrays the lives, home-life, and dwellings of its characters.

Well-done and well worth watching--",1346630400,2,599,5.571428571428571
4185249,2,B003RHZ67K,"I think it's important to state right off that this movie script has the f-word in most every sentence/comment.  If that isn't off-putting enough, the movie is also very boring and bleak/depressing - and at the end you realize it was also completely pointless and that ""love story"" ain't happening.

A waste of film - a waste of time.

FULL STORY (if you really want it):
The movie begins with Lena - a young white girl from a LOW income home - on her way home (from school?)  Her and her girlfriend are sitting at a bus stop where the girlfriend tells her she is pregnant. Lena tells her she'll never get out of this s-hole then. As Lena continues to wait, her younger brother and a friend ride up on bicycles, smoking cigarettes. A police car goes by and the boys ride off -- Lena arrives at home to see a police car with her brothers friend in back, the brother being loaded into it and the 2nd officer coming out of the house with an armful of cigarette cartons the boys had evidently stole.  She goes inside and her mom is at the kitchen table with empty beer bottles on it and the mom drinking from another.  Her husband (or boyfriend?) in the living-room watching tv.  She looks at her mom who says something to the effect that she needed a break from him anyways. They argue a bit. Lena goes to her room looks at a scrapbook of photos of her father and the next morning she sets off to find him, with only a vague idea he might be in Sydney.

Next you meet Vaughn - a gang kid in what appears to be a youth prison work camp area. He is clearly full of hate for whites and has plenty of will to fight. His sister arrives to visit (probably the first time he's had a visitor in the 2-yrs he's been there) to tell him his mother (who had abandoned him when he was younger) is very sick and won't live much longer. He breaks out and finds himself at a bus stop -- where Lena (the only other person around) is because she just missed her bus due to being sick in the bathroom and getting out just in time to see her bus drive off without her back on it.

Vaughn asks her which way to Sydney and she points, and he takes off walking in that direction. For whatever reason she decides to take a risk and follows him (since that's the direction she needs to go in as well and has nothing but some change in her pocket).

The rest of the movie is them walking towards Sydney - hitchhiking when they can.  Not a lot of talking but a small bond of trust happens when Vaughn saves Lena as 2 men attempt to pull her into their car and drive off with her.  Eventually they share a little about themselves as they continue.

As they walk, some gang friends of his drive by and pick them up. The car gets pulled over, 4 strapping youths vs 2 cops, they fight and drive off leaving cops in the road (who will surely be in pursuit again in a moment).  The friends drop him & Lena at his mom's and speed off.

The house is a low income sty, and nobody is home. On the bed is an oxygen tank and a large stain of blood (like it was vomited up) and bits of lung??  He's too late.  Lena puts her hand on his shoulder in attempt of comfort and he tells her to leave. After having a few moments of anger alone he hears a police siren and runs out.  He catches up with her as she's about to get on what looks like an above-ground subway type system.  They tentatively hug for a moment, she gets on, he does not.  End of movie.

This was a POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME. I'm sorry I wasted my time on it, but hopefully I have saved you from doing the same.",1345680000,32,3531,4.095791001451379
4185250,5,B003RHZ67K,"A story of the hopelessness facing aboriginal Australians. Two teens, one white and one aboriginal, meet by chance on the road to Sidney. A must see!!",1345420800,3,150,4.8076923076923075
4185251,1,B003RHZ67K,"I found this movie to be uninteresting and unrealistic. This film didn't flow naturally and the scenes seemed so scripted that the actors overcompensated in making simple points. Although it wasn't intentional, the mood of this film reflected an old mindset (1950's - 60's), era and tone that displayed a poor job, in my opinion, of the true issues/pains surrounding racism.

At least it was free on Hulu, but still was a waste of time.",1333065600,,436,4.8133333333333335
4185252,5,B003RHZ67K,"This is a classic Aussie film about two kids, from different (but similar) backgrounds meeting and taking a journey together.  The texture of the outback and the indigenous characters make it stand out.  Very relevant to N. America and our own racial issues.  I would suggest getting this when it comes out.",1277337600,4,307,4.865384615384615
4185253,4,B003RHZ67K,"I wish this would get distributed in the U.S.  It's a film that Americans could really enjoy.  Don't know what it will take to make it happen, and as far as I know it's yet to be screened stateside.  I would definitely buy it if it were available (if any of the producers are reading).",1197158400,2,285,4.1454545454545455
8403737,5,B003RHZ67K,"Beneath Clouds, although a very basic plot, is still a great movie.  Simply two aboriginal teens from different backgrounds, are journeying to Sydney from remote New South Wales to see a parent.  Lena's best friend has just told her she's pregnant, the two had planned when older on leaving their remote community with nothing but a petrol station and some sort of farm/business with grain silos where the indigenous residents have your stereotypical problems such as domestic violence, a lot of time on their hands, kids having kids, females being treated like dogs by the guy who has knocked them up, drugs and alcohol addiction and well sheer boredom. Now Lena knows her best friend is stuck in the welfare cycle and won't ever be leaving. When Lena's younger brother gets arrested for stealing cartons of cigarettes, and her mother and the guy she's sleeping with (possibly her brother's dad) think it's great, as prison will straighten him out and then abuse her and threaten her with violence when she calls them out on how stupid that logic is, she decides to leave.  Her father, an Irish man who from the photos she has the viewer knows were taken a long time ago when he was young, and a post card that is obvious was written when she was very young promise in her mind a great future in Sydney.

Meanwhile her brother is now on a prison farm (referred to as a holiday camp by aboriginals not in there) and is dorm roommates with Vaughn, an older teen who is angry at the world and sees white people as the enemy, blaming them for everything he hasn't achieved. The brother worships Vaughn's attitude about hating white fellas, which is odd considering his sister's father. Vaughn definitely doesn't see planting trees as a holiday camp or easy work. His sister is the first person from his outer Sydney suburb family to visit him in two years after he was jailed for stealing cars. He's not impressed with her or his mother for that.  She tells him his mother is dying, so he decides to break out and visit her to tell her off or comfort her is unclear. He stows away in a milk delivery truck which he gets out of at a petrol station where Lena has missed getting back on the bus that had stopped for passengers to stretch and get something to eat.  He asks her which way Sydney is, she points him in the right direction, she works out she can't just sit there counting the few coins of money she has, and starts walking after him.  The two don't really like each other, but will stick up for each other when needed, and follow each other to Sydney, walking, hitchhiking and surviving along the way.

There's no car chases, explosions, serial killers, over the top characters or anything like that, but the movie still has you glued to the screen the whole time. It's a character based story and Dannielle Hall and Damien Pitt are brilliant in their respective roles.  It's a shame neither starred in anything else (according to IMDB) after this.  Damien Pitt passed away in 2009.  There's plenty of stereotypes played out on the journey, such as domestic violence amongst indigenous people,  a lot of white people not stopping to pick up aboriginal hitchhikers (although to be fair where this happens is near a prison and it is also illegal to pick up hitchhikers in New South Wales), people calling aboriginal males boy (although to be honest I thought this was an African American in the US thing and haven't heard of it in Australia), police being violent when given lip and other things.  The fact Lena is the first ""white"" person Vaughn has ever talked to when she apart from her father's contribution to her biology is aboriginal, highlights the difficulty lighter skinned aboriginals face from some of their own race who see them as lesser aboriginal as well as other races don't see them as anything other than aboriginal.  Although that issue isn't really explored to much detail.

Basically the movie ends shortly after they reach the outskirts of Sydney.  Some reviewers seem to have a problem with this, but this movie was about their journey there, not what they got up to in their lives after reaching their goal.",1509148800,,4138,4.647945205479452

8403739,5,B003RHZ67K,"I cant believe this movie is so poorly rated. Some fool is even complaining that it has the f word too many times. I guess since it doesnt have all the cgi & shoot 'em up reicpe for all the mediocre rehash junk that comes out of hollywood it must be boring. For you inpatient people I recomend some regurgitated hollywood dribble, go drink it up.
Those who seem to be getting caught up in ""semantics"" and the cursing (its not rated G or PG) are missing the point, & thess sort of movies (where you actually have to think) are obviously over your heads.
GREAT FILM, very poignant, IF you have the capacity to concentrate, if you dont, go watch something with Angelina or go listen to gaga.",1422662400,3,688,4.341085271317829

8403742,4,B003RHZ67K,"Great in the Ivan Sven style - a coming of age story. How do teenages cope in a god forsaken part of the world with their aboriginal past and no job perspective? How do they meet beyond (racial, etc) prejudices? Wide landscape, low horizon, and hope still in between the clouds... Sven shows us again how we can rise to true humanity under harsh circumstances. Danielle Hall and Daminan Pitt are very moving (great casting) - the story is well told: an excellent roadmovie!

8403744,4,B003RHZ67K,"Other reviewers found this movie disappointing, with an ending that made them feel like they wasted their time. Well, they completely missed the point of the film. It's a character study on race relations, meant to make you think. What would you have done had you been in Vaughn or Lena's situation? Would you have been able to see past the fact that the guy/girl you're traveling with is a member of the race that you have either been taught your entire life to hate and despise (Vaughn) or have an almost unconscious prejudice towards (Lena)? To be fair to the bad reviewers, the film is mischaracterized on Amazon as romance. It's not -- it's about two teens having opening their eyes to racial equality (in Lena's case, inequality) for the first time in their lives, and struggling to come to terms with their realizations.
If you're thinking of watching this for coming-of-age romantic dreck, then don't. However, if you want to experience a remarkably well-written thought-provoking character study, then by all means watch ""Beneath Clouds"". You won't be sorry yoyu did.",1367884800,,1076,4.917582417582418

8403746,4,B003RHZ67K,"I enjoyed the main characters brutal honesty. I didn't care for the ending even though it's realistic. I've been spoiled by happy endings I guess. I didn't think it was a love story, at least not a romantic one. I suppose it does have a love your neighbor/do unto others kind of theme. It was slow moving and the actors weren't really all that good, but there is just something so refreshing about it. I'll watch it again.",1367107200,,422,4.423076923076923
