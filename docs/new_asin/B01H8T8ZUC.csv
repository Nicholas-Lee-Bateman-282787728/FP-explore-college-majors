8764892,3,B01H8T8ZUC,"This could have been a lot better.  Some of the acting was just... bad.  I like the plot, but there are some holes I can't get past.  ****DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED**** Was Theresa ever really pregnant?  It looked like John stole one of Kate & Justin's ultrasound pictures.  Was she faking because John overheard them at dinner out?  Did Justin not call the cops to ask for help finding his baby?  Did they drag the river?  Anyway - it's a decent watch but as I said, could have been a lot better.",1521417600,,504,4.287234042553192

8764896,5,B01H8T8ZUC,"Relatively new take on an old plot - what happens when an apartment/condo dwelling young couple who are expecting a child meet the, at first charming & worldly, new neighbors who are also expecting their first child, and yes, live in the apartment below. Well, things turn out a little tense between them when an accident occurs (random & innocent, or negligent?). Things start happening, and again, are they random & innocent or are they planned along with the psychological consequences? Well acted, directed and written.

Possible spoiler to the ending.
So DO NOT READ until after seeing the film and not sure because, if I'm right (pretty sure I am) it will ""spoil"" the denouement.
The film purposefully makes our two female protagonists similar in appearance; in cases like this common plot thickener I check nose, ear, chin shapes as well as eye color, especially after not paying that close of attention throughout the film and now I'm paying for it by having to go back and check.  Baby is happy with it's new parents.",1474675200,5,1026,4.823863636363637
