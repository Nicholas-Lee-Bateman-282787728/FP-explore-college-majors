3479468,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is one of the best workout DVD's I've seen and heard. Kimberly is beautiful and easy to follow. The music is legitimate and well-recorded. The Samba Reggae rhythm and workout is my favorite. If you're interested in Brazilian dance, music and culture and need some stay-at-home cardio, get this one. Trust.",1224979200,,310,4.980769230769231
3479469,5,B001B1Q2U4,I loved this dance workout.  The music and background are amazing!  Kimberly's smile is so joyous and keeps me motivated.  Her energy is infectious.  I found the choreography lots of fun and thats important to me.  I own other dance workouts and this is definitely my favorite.,1224720000,,277,4.808510638297872
3479470,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I fell absolutely in love with Kimberly Miguel Mullen after I watched her video, ""Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body."" She is so energetic, amazingly beautiful and in great shape (I will get there someday!). Besides all these things, the workout is a fun challenge and definitely gets the heart rate up and keeps it up! I've always been interested in Capoeira but never knew where to take classes. I definitely want to look more into it after doing it with the video. Thank you Acacia for another great video!",1224547200,,507,4.644444444444445
3479471,5,B001B1Q2U4,This is a very fun and challenging workout.  The instructor is adorable and kept me on my toes the whole time.  It may be awhile before I get that awesome Brazilian body but this is the workput that will do it.  The music was great I felt like I was in the middle of Carnivale.  The set/ambiance was very lush.  If you want to whip your body into shape and have fun at the same time then this is certainly the workout for you!,1224547200,2,426,4.023809523809524
3479472,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I buy lots of fitness DVDs to workout at home and this is my newest purchase. I love, love, love the fun moves Kimberly has created here and I definitely feel like I'm getting a cardio workout. The music is great (original to the DVD) and is so much better than all that generic, club music you hear on other programs. I would definitely recommend this product for a fun way to workout--no coordination required!",1224547200,2,412,4.506666666666667
3479473,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is a great video. It's a great workout that is also fun which makes the time go by fast. I workout but have no dance experience so I was not sure if I would be able to get into it but she makes it so easy to catch on. The teacher is adorable and the music and dance moves are really cool.
I buy many fitness videos and unfortunately never use many of them more than a few times due to a bad teacher, annoying music, or it not being a good workout but I have to say that is not the case with this one.",1223942400,2,505,3.7289719626168223
3479474,4,B001B1Q2U4,"Such fun. The scenery is gorgeous. The movements transition one to the next flawlessly, I did sweat even though it didn't feel strenuous. The next day I felt it in my hips, glutes, and stomach. My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the voiceover cues arn't always matched-up with the movements. Easy enough to overcome after the first time or two of doing it tho. Overall, a fun, effective, dance workout with zero dread factor and mega fun factor.",1223856000,4,456,4.573170731707317
3479475,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I just finished doing this dvd and I absolutely love it!!! If you loved Quenia Riberio's Samba Reggae workout"", you will love this one too.  The music is fantastic and you have the option of music only! The steps are fast and she is a little slow on the cuing, but I got thru it and sweated up a storm.  You can see the maculele video clip on you tube.  My only complaint is that I wish the segments were longer.

The instructor has a beautiful smile and lots of energy.  This dvd was very well produced.  It also comes with a bonus samba section as well as segments from Shiva Rea's Trance Dance and Hemalaya's Bollywood workout.  I guess if you need to sweat more you could do those.  The capoeria section is the toning section and requires a large workout space as you will be doing baby cartwheels and kicks; and you need enough room to flip over while going from crab kicks to donkey kicks. One last thing, the choreography requires quite a bit of coordination and rhythm, but I suggest that you don't let that deter you, just enjoy the music and get what you can.  I look forward to doing it again and again!
I hope that she does another dvd and makes the segments at least 20 minutes each.  Obrigada Kimberly!",1223078400,,1216,4.317180616740088
3479476,5,B001B1Q2U4,"Ahhh. . . . Brazilian Dancing.  I have been following along with this workout video for the past 8 years--and I never get sick of it.  Why?  It's a combination of factors.  First off, there is really no melody to the music; there's just this great rhythmic Brazilian music that never gets on my nerves.  Next, the colors of this set and the costumes are so invigorating to the eye.  It's set outdoors, in Hawaii, surrounded by lush green palms and water lilies, with bright pops of red and magenta flowers everywhere.  Sooo delicious all winter long here in Minnesota.  And finally, the instructor is cheerful and encouraging, with an inspiring, fit figure.  It's obvious she's dedicated to dance. Plus, for variety, she's got two background companions, one male and one female. The moves are vigorous and reach to all four corners of the body.  Her cuing is fine, the steps are easy to pick up.  I never do all the segments in one workout, just pick the one or two I want, but always do the warm-up and cool down before I move on to my own Yoga Flow to wind down my session.

I can't go to group classes since I am allergic to fragrance and there's always at least one person in any class who stinks up the air for everyone, so to be able to follow along with this in my home is a godsend.",1461196800,2,1290,4.351464435146443
3479477,2,B001B1Q2U4,"I rented this before I realized that there were better quality, free exercise videos available on Amazon Prime. This may be great for you if you already know the moves, but little explanation and no introduction in a slower pace to get each move left me lost, frustrated and wondering if this video were actually meant for some other purpose.",1461024000,,342,4.716666666666667
3479478,3,B001B1Q2U4,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars: it is a lot of fun, but it's flawed.  Her cuing, as many others have pointed out, is definitely lacking.  I love her energy & found her happiness infectious, but I seemed to be the only one, as the two dancers in the background maintained a 'eh, it's a job' kind of attitude throughout.

The sequencing is also awkward: A nice, very dance-y warm-up is followed by the makulel and samba reggae: both fairly high-intensity dances.  And then everything stops and we do another warm-up in preparation for the capoeira portion, which is rather slower and less intense (and even more poorly cued than the other segments).  Now, I'm all for including capoeira in a dance DVD: it is equally a dance and a martial art, but this just wasn't handled well.  Maybe it would work better if I played it first, followed by the makulel and the samba?  I'll try that next time I pop it in.  Which I'll definitely do:  for all its flaws, this was a lot of fun.",1460592000,2,972,4.385474860335195
3479479,3,B001B1Q2U4,"Pro: Instructor has a beautiful, big smile and graceful body movements that I find very inspiring and make me want to learn her dance moves.
Con: Most of the moves are too fast to follow. I was able to complete the warm-up and half of the first lesson. I tried this DVD twice and had to give up about halfway through.

This DVD isn't for beginners.",1458432000,,348,4.2727272727272725
3479480,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I really love this DVD!  I had no idea what I was in for, but her energy is upbeat, and calming at the same time. The whole time I am using this DVD for exercise, it makes me wish I was on an island!",1456444800,,199,3.522727272727273

I try a new dance workout from Amazon every week, and this is in the top 2 favorites!! For dancers at all levels, this is a good workout that is fun and leaves your muscles feeling better after, not sore and tight, but lean and flexible. Every dancer will adore Kimberly's style, it is so unique! I actually wanted to do the dance workout back to back it was so fun! Thank you.",1405468800,,513,4.298969072164948

3479498,5,B001B1Q2U4,The work out is fun and doable but still challenging for someone who just wants to be healthy. The time length is good for morning workouts before work. I enjoy it.,1394409600,,164,4.32258064516129
3479499,3,B001B1Q2U4,"They have three segments.  Only one is really aerobic the rest are just movements but don't get my heart up and I am nearly 70 and in the greatest of shape.  None of the segments give you a 30 minute workout.  Also, the voice cues are not the best and one just made me laugh because it didn't go at all with what they were doing.

3479512,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I should preface my review by saying I'm a 66 year old woman who has had shoulder replacement surgery.  I wanted something that would be a fun way to get some exercise, and this video fits the bill.  I agree with other reviewers who say the cueing isn't great, but being precisely in step isn't important to me--it's simply a matter of moving and getting some exercise.  Some of the moves I can't do like the overhead arm movements, and torso pops at this point in my life...don't think so.  I'm also far from doing the moves with as much energy as Kim, but I see that as a good thing because I won't outgrow this video any time soon.  So, if you think you're ready to audition for ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" this video probably isn't for you.  But given my own expectations, I give it 5 stars.",1375142400,,797,4.245033112582782

After reading some of the critical reviews done previously, I wonder if those reviewers have EVER stuck with anything new and challenging.  As a health care professional, I know that if you can follow any new exercise routines from the start, then they're NOT challenging you physically ... and you won't see, or feel, much improvement!!
  As Kimberly says during the video, ""Just do your best and this will get easier & easier to follow each time you do your workouts"". I find I must go through a period of feeling a bit ""spastic"" and off ... before mastering new physical (or mental) challenges!!
  I alternate this ""Brazilian Body"" dance workout with my aerobics with weights DVDs, ""classics"" - namely, ""FIRM Vol. 1"" and ""FIRM Vol. 2"".  I have to ""cross train"" to stay balanced, strong & enthused about my workouts.",1372032000,,961,4.5523255813953485

This workout is so much fun. I found myself naturally smiling during the whole routine.

However, as others have mentioned cuing is pretty bad. I am Latina and love dancing, so I didn't have trouble learning the moves but did have a hard time keeping in sync with the instructor.

Despite the bad cuing Im giving this 5 stars because:
1. My heart was pumping superfast during the whole routine (I actually preferred that she didn't pause a bunch of times to demonstrate moves. I'd rather just jump in and figure it out myself)
2. The background was gorgeous! Really put me in a good place mentally.
3. Instructor and background dancers are super cute.
4. A variety of moves so I was never bored.

I read all the reviews and knew what I was getting myself into. It kind of felt like I had entered a workout class where everyone already knew the moves and I had to figure it out for myself. As long as you're comfortable with that, and LOVE Brazilian music and rhythm (as I do), you will have a great time!",1353283200,,1096,4.415841584158416

3479527,2,B001B1Q2U4,I don't really like this product. The lead workout girl doesnt talk while doing the video. Instead they added a voice over which is alittle distracting. She also doesn't explain the exercises before she transitions to different moves so you are stuck staring at the screen when you have to do a rhythm or move change.  It seemed like it would be a fun workout but its not much of workout when it takes you a number of sessions before you can even get down the routine.

I would consider myself a beginner so I expected to have a little trouble the first time keeping up..once again, wrong because these are not dance moves (also, barely broke a sweat).  If you have done any type of exercise in the past you can do this ""routine"".  There really wasn't any music, just a decent drum beat (which I got tired of after about 5 minutes).

My daughter always asks me when are we doing it again since I always change my work out and I do it when she is already asleep. But I have done this one at least 3 times this week.

My heart rate is up, I can still feel my legs burning...this is the perfect cardio workout for me. I have decades of dance experience, so picking up the moves wasn't a problem for me. However, I can see how a beginner or someone who isn't very coordinated could get lost. Tip for those who aren't comfortable with dancing: watch the video the whole way through before trying it the first time, it'll help you keep up.

The instructor keeps you moving the whole time, and did I mention how fun this was?? Even my 4 year old was trying to dance along with me!",1313020800,2,648,4.311475409836065
3479553,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is a very good exercise DVD. I'm not used to the voice over instead of the people talking during the exercise, but you get used to it. The music is great and helps you to do the routines. The three dance options are only 12 minutes each. I like doing the first two, the warrior one is difficult for me so I skip that one. The cool off is very interesting. The moves are fun and does help you to relax and calm down after working out.

They do move from one dance move to the next quickly sometimes, so you have to pay attention. The dance moves are sometimes a little difficult to do, but as long as you try then it's fine. I usually just do a little hip swing or something like that when you have to move but can't quite get there step just yet. As long as you are moving with the same rhythm as they are and go with the music, then it's still a good workout. All in all, it's an excellent dance exercise.

It's very fun to do and you can easily get into the music and have a great time.",1312156800,,993,3.96
3479554,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I loved this workout video.  Before purchasing, I read that some had a hard time with the cueing, but others said how much fun it was.  After trying it, I found this to be one of the easiest videos to follow right off the bat.  Even if I don't get everything, it's easy to jump back in.  And, it is really fun! I get a nice aerobic workout with the first sequence.  The third focuses more on strength which is also cool.  So, overall, I'd say this was definately a good purchase for me.",1303776000,,486,4.117021276595745
3479555,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the reviews that said it was so hard to follow. I'm really glad I heeded the many 5-star reviews because YES, it's challenging, but this is a DVD I plan to workout to for years -- I don't WANT it to be easy. How boring would it get (and how fast!) if it were simple from the get-go? Dancing takes time to learn. It's not something most people get in a single lesson. Think of this DVD as a dance class -- you'll get really good after lots of practice.

The first time, I couldn't do all the steps, but by even the next day I was able to do many more of them. Just enjoy the music, follow along as best you can, and over time you'll get it and will be fluent in some basic steps of samba reggae, maculele and capoeira (workout versions).

BONUS: I burned more calories doing this workout than I did in a 1-hour beginning boxing class, and the 3 dancers are beautiful to look at (great role models to aspire to).

SMALL MINUS: I find the narrator's voice to be a little over-enthusiastic, but then again, the encouragement helps, and there's an option to listen to the music only.",1302220800,3,1118,4.214953271028038
3479556,2,B001B1Q2U4,"I would even say not for an intermediate.
I wanted something that was challenging and face paced. I am an out of shape 38 year old with a good cardio level and 12 years of dance training. This was hard to follow. Like all fitness videos, I watched it before attempting it.

There was no demonstrating/practicing of the coming moves and the moves are such that you are often looking upward or otherwise not looking at the screen to get confirmation on the execution of the move. Then the instructor moves with almost consistent lack of segueway. This is the just the ""warm-up.""

The rest of the video is just like the warm-up as far as instruction. It is extremely challenging and face paced. It gets you moving and your heart pounding for 48 minutes. I danced along three times before I gave up. I was picking up very little and felt like I was ""failing."" This is not a good tape for anyone who is like me. I am a recovering bulimic, which means I am a control freak and give myself very little slack when I don't accomplish tasks as I want. For those who are just starting out in a fitness regimine, this could be very discouraging and (I feel) lead to backsliding. Been there. Done that.

I also found the instructor very annoying. Upbeat, grinning constantly. I guess for some that is encouraging. However, as I was failing to perform the moves, I found it mocking, not motivational. Yeah, I know. I'm crazy, right? I have found Denise Austin and Dolphina annoying, but they are a LOT easier to follow and so I don't give up on their workouts.

This DVD has been donated to Goodwill. (The Salvation Army might have been less ironic, but GW was closer.)",1298246400,,1655,4.470198675496689
3479557,5,B001B1Q2U4,"The dvd contains one set of workout, consisting of three different dancing sequences:
-Warm-up
-Maculele (high-impact, cardio)
-Samba Reggae (mid-impact cardio)
-Capoeira (low impact cardio with kicks and abdominal works on the floor)
-Cool down

Plus, bonus materials including a more challenging Samba.

You will like this dvd if you are:
-looking for a workout in small space. The most space-requiring movement is probably the ""turn and extend your leg and arms"" in the Maculele. But this is also doable in limited space, because this does not require moving many steps to the same direction. The only sequence that requires moving many steps to the same direction is the bonus Samba, which is not part of the regular workout sequence
-interested in trimming your body with different movements. The movements in the dvd are easy but refreshingly different from these from other dvds such as Jennifer Galardi's. Movements in Brazilian Body dvd trim your body differently than do these from more conventional workout dvds
-looking for a workout dvd in non-studio surrounding. This dvd was shot in a beautiful surrounding from Hawaii

You may not like this dvd if you are:
-looking for an instructional dvd that teaches real latin dancing. This dvd is for getting fit and not for learning latin dancing. None of the 3 sequences include real latin dance steps but just flavors of exotic movements
-uncomfortable without tight cue and/or step guide. I happen to like loose cues, but some people who like Jen Galardi-type, tight cuing instructors may find this dvd less great

I recommend that you try the sample clip available at Amazon. It's the first 5 minutes from the Maculele and gives you a good idea of what this workout is like.",1297987200,6,1734,4.989619377162629
3479558,1,B001B1Q2U4,"I'll agree that the instructor is very likeable.  She has a nice voice, isn't overly bubbly or annoying, and is pleasant to watch.  However, I could not keep up with, or figure out, what she was doing most of the time.  If you look closely at the video, there are times when her ""standing"" leg was clearly doing things that were never mentioned while the moving leg was doing something else.  I'm young-ish, and somewhat coordinated, and experienced with workout videos of all sorts.  This needs instruction and breakdown to be useful.  Too bad there were so many positive reviews.  I don't see how you can perform the moves correctly by watching this video, and if I was just going to dance and do whatever I felt like, I'd put on a cd and dance.  Check this one out from the library if you can before buying.",1296604800,5,810,4.462585034013605
3479559,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I really like this dvd. I was looking for something to learn samba and get fit at the same time but this dvd DOES NOT teach you how to samba... so if that's all you're looking for, pass on this one.  To learn the actual samba, order Quenia Ribiero's Dance Today Samba.  That one is not a workout, it strictly teaches you the samba.

This dvd is a really fun workout inspired by Brazilian moves (maculele, carnaval and capoeira.) It is pretty fast paced and really gets you sweating in the first few minutes.  I do agree with the other posters that the voice over is much quicker than the movements but you will definitely pick it up the more often you do it.

It's one of my favorite dance/workout dvd's and I use it everyday.  Kimberly is very fun and she makes it fun but not cheesy.  She's energetic and always smiling and you can tell she loves what she's doing, so in turn it makes you love it as well.  I look forward to working out with her.  So I highly recommend this dvd for a fun workout.  I like to dance and like to learn all types of dance and keep myself in shape.... so with this you will pick up some Brazilian moves and get slim in return.

I also have Vanessa Issac's workout and I will write a review of that next.",1287705600,,1234,4.1645569620253164

3479561,5,B001B1Q2U4,"I never review items, but this workout DVD was a really nice change of pace.  I typically do a lot of circuit training in order to make it as efficient as possible (tight on time!), and this DVD was definitely more fun.  The island background and fun dance moves keep you going, and you can really sweat and work your abs, gluts, and arms if you want to.  I will say that the cuing is bad in some spots, but once you do it a couple of times it doesn't really matter.  If you want to stop being so serious about your workout and enjoy it a little more give this a shot!",1280188800,4,568,4.0
3479562,4,B001B1Q2U4,"... because Kimberly Miguel Mullen can't cue in this video. I took an African Brazilian Dance class a couple years ago (for several months) and I absolutely loved it. The video is somewhat close to the same moves we did in class. The music featured was close enough as well. I purchased the video due to these two things. The set is lovely and you can see that everyone is doing their own level in the video. (Although, sometimes it looks like they don't.) The video is a ton of fun - as long as you can figure out what is going on. Just when you turn your back or look away from the screen (as instructed) the move changes. It's very disrupting and somewhat startling. I guess that's one way to get your heart rate up! It's unfortunate the instructor tells you how to move AFTER you see the move on your screen. With all that said, I am positive after using the DVD a few times you'll be able to figure out the cuing or guess what comes next.

This DVD is definitely what you make of it. You *WILL* sweat using this video. If you're not extremely fit or you require the cuing, you can just do the feet and add a few arms once in a while. Otherwise I would say go for it. Really make your moves big and get into it. Once you try this video a couple times you'll smile and look forward to it. The moves are fun, the beat is fun, and it's hard not to smile!",1276473600,8,1355,4.093984962406015
3479563,1,B001B1Q2U4,"I don't know much about samba, but as for the Maculele and Capoeira portions of the video, I must say that what they displayed had very little to do with the acutal dance of Maculele or the art of Capoeira.
The only reason I was able to keep up and understand what was going on throught these sections is because I am already familiar with Capoeira and Maculele.  The simplistic explainations given in the voiceover actually mis-labled many of the moves, giving them strange names that no Capoeirista uses.  The maculele section neglects to use or even mention the maculele sticks, which are an integral part of this traditional dance!  Disappointing!

If you want to learn Maculele or capoeira, i suggest taking a class and learning from real people!",1268784000,2,751,4.7984496124031

It seemed to me that the instructor was working out for herself and having a great time - too bad she seemed to have forgotten all about the people trying to follow her along.  What a colossal waste of money.  At least I can use the DVD for a coaster.  For a completely different experience, check out Ellen Barrett's workout DVDs.",1268438400,11,562,4.355769230769231

The music is great the setting makes me feel like I'm on vacation and the other dancers' bodies make me wanna keep moving.  My husband says the bonus is that I'm so much happier after I do it, even during our icky snowy winters!  Anything that can do that definately deserves praise!  A little dance background may help (as far as the queing goes)but with practice and modifying moves to suit you....I think anyone can do it and still progress as they lose weight.  That's what's so great about dance, you can always make it harder or easier depending on how you and your body is feeling, how fit or ""unfit"" you may be.....this instructor is really inspiring!!!

At first I was really interested in doing what they're doing but it just got repetitive and boring after 2 days.  No I don't have ADHD and I've been able to work out to other dance workout videos for long periods of time, but this one didn't make me feel like I'm dancing, it just made me feel like I'm doing move after move after move.  The whole thing is just a repetition of different moves, like a monotonous exercise video.  I like dance workout videos that ultimately string moves together to create a real flowing dance feel.

Another point I didn't like was the incorporation of crunches and stretching during the 3rd dance segment.  I don't know if it's normally a part of the capoeria, but it just seemed like something I would do separately before or after the workout.

All in all, it's a good boring exercise and I rarely use it.  Instead I prefer Kili's Tahitian/Hula videos and Vanessa Isaac's Brazillian dance workout better because they're just less monotonous.",1260230400,2,1056,4.609625668449198

Once you get used to it though, it will be worth it.  The instructions are a little off time, but again, if you do this continously, it will be worth it. I have no problems keeping up now (I just bought it about 6 months ago).
It is a fast paced workout that will leave you sweating and help trim you down. Everyone noticed that when I started doing this workout (I also switched it up with Turbo Jam and Dancing With The Stars Latin Cardio workouts) that my waist was trimming and I got so many compliments.  If you like dancing and fast movement, this is for you. It puts me in a great mood and really jump starts my day. My favorite one is the Samba Reggae.  I haven't done the copeira though except for once. It was a lot of floor movement and that one is more difficult to follow. But the other two workouts on here are great!

Warm-up: 6 min -
First half is all standing & fluid, very good choices of common stretches & ends with kneeling w/fluid torso stretches to the sides & forward.
Maculele: 12 min -
fun dancing w/a lot of arm use & stepping at a very energetic speed
Samba Reggae: 12 min -
same as above, she never seems to get tired!
Capoeira: 12 min -
starts with a lot of lower body stretching, lying down for ab work & more stretching. Goes into easy into to capoeira, just the weight shift/steping back & forth w/arms in front to defend. Doing yoga table/spider (hands/knees tummy to the sky) w/hint of the kicking & scooping w/the legs w/o the hard turning of the body. Stepping back & forth w/adding kicks & then ends w/very modified turn/kick that's a very easy cartwheel, which starts off more like a simple stepping & you can stay at that easier depth.
Cool Down: 6 min -
(Her w/guy only) a lot of sitting w/1 leg back & arm use w/torso bends, and then laying down & shifting the body to face one side then other. Yoga pigeon & sitting wide angle side & fwd stretch. Her stretches are almost like a modern interpretive dance, very lovely.

Even though she dis use voice over, the only thing that could use work was her cuing. But with her fluid dancing, contagious positive attitude, great body awareness, good pacing of teaching in 1/2 time several times before normal speed, it's my own complaint & the moves are simple enough to follow by watching. The moves may be simple to understand, but they demand a lot of muscle use & energy.

Bonus Dance: Samba de Roda w/Kimbery & guy only: 8 min -
more fun dancing w/Samba, moving hip circles, etc.

Liberation Dance from ""Yoga Trance Dance"": 6 min
Playtime Begins! from ""Bollywood Dance Workout"": 7 min

I even tried them three different times and I inevitably gave up halfway through. Kimberly doesn't explain the steps well or give you time to figure them out before she's on to something else.

I ended up selling this DVD because it was too frustrating for me.",1252972800,,438,4.475

It was tough the first time, and I'm looking forward to learning the steps better and getting all I can out of this workout.  If you stick with dvds, and are serious about a dance workout, this is a great addition to your video library, even if you're a beginner.  But, since the cuing isn't great, if you're only looking to do this one or two times (and be honest with yourself) I don't think it's the workout for you.  I imagine it would be pretty hard to perfect on the first try.  To sum it up: Kimberly has a motivating narration, despite what I thought when watching the trailer and the workout is so much fun.

3479577,4,B001B1Q2U4,"I like this workout as an add-on or warm up. The music and setting are great. The moves are authentic and fun. The dances look great, and I enjoy myself whenever I do it. However, the cuing is not good. The cuing is provided via a taped voiceover, which is not in step with the choreography. Therefore, it is often behind the actual workout. After completing the workout a few times you figure out where you should be, but the poor cuing can be frustrating and confusing.

The only other problem I have is that I wished the workouts were longer. Each segment is only about 12 minutes so they are over just as you really start warming up. I usually do the first two segments - Macuele and Samba Reggae together just to break a good sweat. I hope Kimberly releases a longer workout DVD for each of these dance styles. I only did the Capoeira workout once, but it is nice as well. It is not as intense or difficult to follow as other Capoeira routines.

I didn't get through the whole video but I did do the warm up and the first 12 minute dance routine. I must say that the warm up is a really good stretch. I'm not much of a stretcher, which is really bad, but you can really feel it all in your back and arms and legs. It moves kind of quickly, though so it almost gets your heart rate up a little bit.

I did the first 12 minute routine and let me tell you, you will sweat. When I saw the previews for it, I thought it was going to be kind of on the easy side. Well its pretty difficult. The moves can be pretty difficult and they don't show you how to properly do the moves which they should have done. But the whole focus of the video is just to have fun. They really want u to get the basics down and then put your own interpretation into it. I'll tell you, though, it was the longest 12 minutes of my life. It was tough, but it was good. I can't wait to try the other dance routines. So I would say if you're looking for a workout other than just lifting weights or running, then this will definitely jazz things up a bit. Its tough, but you kind of get into it after a little while. And the girl is really pretty and her body is awesome...its kind of like motivation.",1243987200,12,1300,3.9242424242424243

I had no problem following this video and in fact I simply love that it is pure dance.  It is not slow, it is not stop start, it is not learn the steps and then put them together.  It is like aerobics or other fast paced workout videos that are constant and that is what I desperately want with a workout.  I have used so many different workout videos from tae-bo, to Crunch videos, to The Firm videos, to pilates, yoga, everything and I decided to try with dance again as I have fun doing it.  Plus with dancing you get a flow in the body and relax more tis exercise without being like real exercise.  I just LOVE this video as it is constant and no she is not teaching the steps, but you just keep watching and you will pick them up.  THANK YOU Kimberly this is precisely what I have been looking for and wanted.",1243814400,4,953,4.086021505376344
3479585,1,B001B1Q2U4,"I'm 28, and fairly fit. I always go for advanced Yoga DVDs and go to clubs regularly but none of that helped me AT ALL with this DVD.

While it looks and sounds amazing and the instructor is incredibly likable, despite the product description saying ""You'll learn simple, flowing steps and incorporate hip circles and torso pops"" there's very little learning going on. Instructions are so minimal that it's basically like watching a music video with the expectations that that will give you the skills to dance. No descriptions of foot placements, angle of steps, etc are told and heaps of lingo is also used. I'm very interested in Capoeria for example but have yet to take a class but am not sure if I should now as I had NO IDEA what she was asking me to do!

The only think I could do (not physically but humanly possible at the pace the video runs) in the program were the situps and that's not exactly what I brought a dance dvd for (why are situps even on here?).

Surely a logical extra feature would be step by step instructions on the steps at a much slower pace.

As someone else said, if you can do this program then why do you have it?

Not recommended.",1243209600,13,1166,4.37962962962963
3479586,4,B001B1Q2U4,"I was cautious not to get my hopes up about this dvd since I'm from the Caribbean and have a dance background from many moons ago.  However, I actually enjoyed it and it reminded me so much of the calypso aerobics I used to do (pre-marriage/family).  I really enjoyed the bonus areas - the samba in particular.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I could see how the timing or the change to a new move could easily throw someone off - especially if dancing is new to them.  Otherwise, it was fun and a great workout.",1242950400,2,534,4.205882352941177
3479587,5,B001B1Q2U4,You are going to learn several dances in this video. Including a Brazillian Carnival Dance as well as some Capoeira moves. It is a VERY challenging video. Not for the meek. You are going to sweat your butt off and feel beautiful while doing it. The music and background in this video are perfect. I have never had some much fun working out. It doesnt even process in my brain as a workout. It feels like I am at an amazing dance class. You will love it.,1241740800,4,453,4.218390804597701
3479588,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This was an amazing workout.  It was so much fun & you can tell she enjoys it.  Kimberly is a fun & vivacious instructor.  It has been an hour since I did the workout & I still feel worked out.  I like that its fast paced & just gets to the point.....burn calories.  Sometimes I'm going out of my mind looking at the clock waiting for ""slow"" workout videos to be done, but I didn't get a chance to with this one.  I would recommend this video to anyone. Don't feel discouraged if you don't get the moves right away, just have fun with it.  You will get them if you stick with it.....unlike SOME people!! ;)",1240185600,,606,4.128205128205129
3479589,5,B001B1Q2U4,This is an incredible DVD! I am not one who typically does the at-home video workouts but this is definitely an exception!  I have been an athlete for many years and I have to say this was a fantastic full body workout! Not only that but I had so much fun that I forgot about how tired I was! Kim's teaching style is so inviting and even empowering! And she's right- it really isn't about technique. The dance moves are do-able enough that you can take it at your own pace. Everyone needs to experience this!,1240185600,2,508,4.291666666666667
3479590,2,B001B1Q2U4,"As I've said in other reviews, I am neither a novice nor an expert when it comes to dance and workouts. I've done a little bit of everything and am usually pretty competent when it comes to following a routine. The first workout in this video was a good pace, although definitely takes some practice to get down. The other two workouts? Forget it! I couldn't even get the first move in the capoeira sequence down because the 'small segments' it's broken into are complex movements in themselves. I was pretty disappointed with this video; Brazilian dance looks like lots of fun and a great workout, but I need something way more basic than this video.",1239580800,3,651,4.620689655172414
3479591,1,B001B1Q2U4,"This is the first exercise video I ever tried, and on the first viewing I was almost too discouraged to continue. There is absolutely no instruction on how to do the moves. I would have been okay with that -- if it had started with a demonstration of each move at a slower pace, but instead, the voice-over throws moves at you at an ever-increasing pace (sometimes even as the dancers are moving into the next move, so you're already behind).
If you're not already fit enough to keep up with the fast pace, and experienced enough with the moves to follow them (and if you are, why bother with the dvd?) -- this DVD is probably not for you.",1238889600,7,639,4.333333333333333
3479592,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is a fantastic work out! The beat will catch up to you immediately. I think Kimberly did a fantastic job at showing a great workout incorporating true Brazilian moves and culturally inspired music. One thing that you must be aware as a buyer- in this video, Kimberly does fail to properly count steps sometimes. Not only that, but if you are expecting to hear how the moves work before she does them, that might not work out so well. But personally, i had no problems- just keep practicing and you'll get them! Oh, and her voice is very VERY cheery. So if you don't like that, don't get it. I, myself, think it adds a great touch of fun to the workout!

Here's a tip: for a MAXIMUM WORKOUT with Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body, buy a full body waist trimmer belt! There's one called ""Bally All-in-One Body Slimmer"" sold by Amazon, and that DEFINITELY gets me losing a lot more than what you would without it. So if you are interested in actually losing weight, like me, that slimming belt plus this video is guaranteed to help you out! At least it has for me :)",1238025600,3,1067,4.36180904522613

3479595,5,B001B1Q2U4,Finally a dvd that is accessible to both men and women! I recommend this dvd to everyone who is looking for a fun and effective way to work out.

She makes an hour of hard core working out seem like nothing!,1237161600,2,336,4.029850746268656

3479598,3,B001B1Q2U4,This work out was also recommended to me by a friend. I like trying new things and really like this work out. It is a little more advanced than what I am used to as far as dance.

3479600,3,B001B1Q2U4,"I bought this to spice up my workouts and it has certainly done that.  A little niggle, the instructor doesn't tell you some of the changes she just does them so the first time you do the workout you end up out of breath and out of step but the more you practice the better you get.  There is a warm-up, three workouts and a cool down section. Its a good way to get your blood pumping first thing in the morning.",1234915200,12,412,4.012195121951219

I stay away from most types of ""dance"" fitness and even step classes and aerobics because I'm just not that coordinated.  This DVD is something that everyone can do.  If you can move your feet and get your arms over your head you can do this.  It does get pretty intensive on the lower back and hips.  If you are not very strong in these areas then use caution or try something like yoga or pilates for awhile to strengthen these areas and get more flexibility before you go for it with this program.",1234569600,8,557,4.257142857142857
3479603,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is a fun workout that uses the whole body. The first time I used it, a lot of the steps were hard for me to follow, but I got a good workout just trying. Even in the first run-through, there were enough steps I could follow along with that it was fun. And none of the steps are too hard to learn. For reference, my fitness level is medium to low, and my dance experience is limited to what I've picked up from exercise videos. I've had trouble grasping the Brazilian rhythm before, which is one reason I wanted to try this video.

I wasn't thrilled that the 3rd dance started out with plain ab exercises, but it did switch to more dance-like moves pretty quickly. And the ""bonus dance,"" which on most videos is just a performance, is actually an extra instructional segment much like the ones in the workout, only just salsa.",1233446400,5,830,4.354838709677419

In my first week; 3 sessions I lost 5 IBS. I could not believe it. No DVD workout has did that before and trust me I have all of them. You actually have fun with this DVD, by the time you realize it you have done the 48 minutes. There isn't alot of teaching here so just follow along. I reminded me of the latin parties growing up in NYC. I loved the music and the lil gal is so energetic, she makes you want to go the extra mile. Try it, it is a nice break from circuit training.

Does anyone know if there is a CD companion to this?  I would really love to have just the music (minus the voiceover)  It's a very infectious beat.",1231804800,3,457,4.218390804597701

3479610,5,B001B1Q2U4,"This is the dance fitness workout I've been looking for! It's very difficult to find something you can use at home that is both effective and fun. For me, this dvd covers everything: carnival dance moves, interactive arm coordination (very important for fighting gravity wars), strength trainers, glut action, and torso pops and twists from every angle. The bonus dance sequence includes speed training for samba steps which is so great for my calves.

With the bonus segment, the dvd lasts for 55 minutes: 6 minute warmup, three 12 minute dance routines, 6 minute cool-down (strengthener), 7 minute samba bonus. Each dance sequence works the body in a different way & angle - I found myself popping out my torso in the 'island' like dances of the 1st segment and then smoothing out the torso in the 'New Orleans' & Trinidad-like carnival dances of the 2nd segment. The 3rd segment is powerful for upper & lower body strength and my only equipment was my own body weight. The warmup and cool-down are beneficial exercise sequences all on their own!

A couple of other reviewers mentioned that there are cueing issues where you may not get a heads up on what's coming up next with each sequence.  My best recommendation (as should be done with all exercise workouts) is to look at the workout before you practice it. A few of the movements may seem strenuous the 1st time so I found it best to do movements at my own level the first week like 'waving the flag' (lifting 1 leg behind you as the arms lift simultaneously in front of you). Also the 3 dancers tend to do things in 8s, 4s, 2s, then singles & repeat the entire routine with more sassiness a couple more run-throughs. There is also the wonderful option of music-only  where you can just listen to the hip-shaking music and dance.

I've gain so much strength & just keep getting better & better each time. The strange thing is that I am still not at all bored & burn a lot of calories which is difficult to accomplish since I am a bellydancer. Kimberly is always genuinely smiling and that positive attitude is a great influence any time of the day. Plus the tropical setting is also a great eye pleaser. I don't see myself rotating this 'dance party' out of my fitness schedule any time soon & it's already been over a month!

She was tired of jogging as her sole means of exercise and the constant pounding of the pavement was hurting her knees and back. I found this video in one of her catalogs in the mail, ordered it, and since I gave it to her months ago, it hasn't left the DVD player! She says it's one of the best gifts I've ever given her and, because it's improved our love life, I'd have to say I agree! Not being a guy who normally watches exercise videos, I am unashamed to say that I've even participated with her as she gets her workout in our home. Kimberly Miguel Mullen's energy and enthusiasm is too infectious to watch without trying to do it yourself. In fact, I just ordered a copy for my mother, as she keeps hearing about it and wants to try! It's great for anyone, at any level, who's looking to feel better about their physical condition and may not have tons of time to devote to commuting to the gym or can't go for a run every day due to weather.

The music gets you going and although it doesn't look like hard work you can definitely get your heart rate up if you put 100% into it.  My BIG complaint about it, however, is that the cuing, if you can call it that, is absolutely the worst I've ever experienced on a DVD.  She does a voice-over which is fine except she tells you what to do after the onstage talent has already started doing it, rarely tells you how many counts you will actually be doing, and she gets the count wrong more than once anyway.  If you want and/or need strong cuing I would say pass on this one.  However, if you pick things up easily by just watching then go for it.
