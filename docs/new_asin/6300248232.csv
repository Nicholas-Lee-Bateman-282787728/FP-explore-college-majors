7807637,4,6300248232,"If you're a Dylan fan who feels something has been missing from his live performances for say the last 20 years, you need to see this video!!  I bought it on VHS because the DVD got so many bad audio reviews.

Intensity. That's what Dylan has on this show. He belts out the lyrics like he means it & strums his guitar so fast on ""It's alright Ma"" you'll be stunned. Not only that, but he smiles several times & looks like he's really into it. Besides The Band, Tom Petty & Heartbreakers are the best backing band he's ever had. They energize him to new levels here. After his religious phase & (besides Infidels) some less than stellar albums, this tour was such a return to greatness. I wish they'd done more!

I subtracted one star because there are only 10 songs. PLEASE CBS/FOX, put the full concert out on a good sounding DVD! Having Tom Petty sing along in harmony on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" & ""Knockin' on Heavens Door"" is pure genius. You will rarely hear better versions in the 40 + years Dylan's played them.
On ""Ballad of the Thin Man"" Dylan delivers every line as you'd want, wish & expect (but rarely get from the crusty contrarian).
I first saw Dylan on this tour & definitely enjoyed it, but didn't realize how great it was until I saw several odd or disappointing shows after this tour in 1990's & 2001.
Other highlights include ""Girl From the North Country"", & ""Lenny Bruce"". Not sure if that's on an album, but he rarely played it after the 80's. Dylan was married to one of his back-up singers at that time.
No, there are no Petty songs on here. I'm a fan, but it's nice that he's just backing-up the master & his band is an American treasure (with or without Bob).
I play this for everyone who says Dylan sucks or can't sing, or can't rock. Wrong!",1338508800,2,1766,4.345454545454546
7807638,4,6300248232,"This video changed my perception of Bob. I was always on the fence, always liking him and digging his music but when I saw him doing ""It's alright ma (I'm only bleeding)"" on this video I finally ""got it"". An intense, tight and inspired performance. Tom and The Heartbreakers are perfect for the job as a back up band too. The duet with Bob and Tom singing ""Like A Rolling Stone"" is amazing. This is a must for any fan of popular music.",1039996800,6,435,4.253012048192771
