8307747,5,B001H3KNEC,"This next to last Bushido was a stacked event filled with many fights involving name fighters such as Dan Henderson, Gilbert Melendez, Shinya Aoki, Gegard Mousasi, and Takanori Gomi. Special rules for Bushido include two total rounds(10 mins first round and 5 mins second round). Kicks and knees to grounded opponents are legal. You get a yellow card for stalling.

Aside from the event itself, this DVD contains a small amount of special features. These include Fighter Interiews(11mins)-Chris Brennan,Gegard Mousasi, Luciano Azevedo,Amar Suloev,Butterbean,David Baron,Dan Henderson,Christiano Marcello,Hatsu Hioki,Hiroyuji Abe,Shinya Aoki,Jeff Curan,Nobuhiko Obiya,Kazuo Misaki,Akihiro Gono,Ryo Chonan,Mitsuhiro Ishida,Tatsuya Kawajiri,Gilbert Melendez.

There's a Post-Fight Interview(4mins) with Dennis Kang, Gilbert Melendez, & Dan Henderson. Lastly there's a Photo Montage(2mins) with pictures from the press conference as well as scenes from the fighter entrance and during the fight. Good solid Bushido event showcasing Pride's final days.",1271721600,,1047,6.4714285714285715
8307748,4,B001H3KNEC,"I was hesitant to buy Bushido 12 at first because, even though it had some popular known pride fighters, the majority of them were going up against unknown people.  However, don't let that fool you. The little known fighters came to fight and gave some of the popular guys "" a run for their money"".

There are about 5 matches that I thoroughly enjoyed. Melendez vs Obiya is probably the best fight on the card. I also enjoyed Baron vs Gomi, Hendo vs Misaki, Gono vs Mousasi and Ishida vs Marcello.  Minowa Man(Ikuhisa Minowa) vs Butterbean didn't last long but The punk is always eager to entertain the Japanese crowd.

I wasn't going to buy it for 14.99 when it first came out but I picked it up yesterday for only $9.99.",1239235200,,722,4.446969696969697
