8332588,5,B001P8VAEG,This dvd contains some awesome hunts but the greatest thing about it is throughout the dvd it shows a first time bowhunter going through the process of selecting his first bow and its set up. The only downside to this dvd is that it is not hd quality but is still one of the best deer hunting dvds that I have seen to date.,1348790400,,323,4.0625
