8110595,3,B000EJ9ROW,Not bad but a bit short on info I fill a lot was left out however I enjoyed it all the same,1506211200,,91,3.1818181818181817
8110596,4,B000EJ9ROW,"Great CD, came in very good condition and I was very happy.",1433289600,,59,4.0
8110597,1,B000EJ9ROW,"I couldn't even pay attention to what the narrator was saying; the costumes and Halloween quality wigs were SO awful, ESPECIALLY the ""redheaded"" one...it made me sad and embarrassed- they couldn't even get a REAL red-haired man or woman actor to participate, or the budget to spend on a wig that didn't look like it was stolen from Carrot Top. And the fact that it looked like it kept slipping down further onto his face....c'mon. It was disappointing, and unwatchable- I threw it away in disgust. And as a Celt, I love sex, but HATED this farce of a production.",1342137600,5,562,4.63
8110598,3,B000EJ9ROW,This wasn't bad but over all in all it wasn't great. It didn't really truly focus on the Celts. It was about sexuality in Ireland from Per-Christian to today.,1314576000,3,158,4.482758620689655
8110599,4,B000EJ9ROW,"This is not a sex tape, although you could hardly tell that from the way this DVD advertizes it's self.  I bet there are a lot of people who got it thinking it was a skin flick with ""Celtic"" trappings!  NOT.  It says some very interesting things about sexual mores in Ireland before and after the Catholic church forced it's ""better to marry than burn"" views on the Celts.  What convoluted power hungry old esthetics those priests must have been...and they created a Catholic God in their image! One who got off on Supressing sexual urges, but was still obcessed with sex, their own and everyone elses.  No wonder confession was invented!",1276300800,13,638,4.660714285714286
8110600,4,B000EJ9ROW,"This film was pretty good.  I am writing a historical novel with parts taking place in ancient Europe.  I was hoping for a little more in ancient times (the second half became too ""modern times""  for what I want to write about.)  However I learned interesting cultural facts and would recommend it.",1275177600,6,298,4.673076923076923
8110601,5,B000EJ9ROW,"I wasn't sure whether to give this program five or four stars. It's a little weird being the first one to review it. But I can say that I enjoyed it immensely.

This is definitely not the History Channel. The presented facts become much less important than the evolving emotions and attitudes, which are accenting by the stirring music. It's almost worth it to watch this show just for the sake of listening to the soundtrack. Each varying theme casts the mood of a given era with incredible accuracy. It's a very sensual presentation, obviously meant for a mature audience. Yes, you will see bare breasts and sexual images just like on the cover but they're shown in a ways that's more artistic than explicit.

I also like the choice of narrator. It's a woman with a low, languid voice marked by an Irish accent. She's well-chosen for the topic and adds to the over-all ambiance.

Some might be put off by this show simply because it can be a touchy, somewhat personal topic. But sex and sensuality are integral parts of our history no matter how much some people might want to sweep them under a rug. I admire this show for its artistry and its bold approach. It's simply mesmerizing to watch. Don't judge it until you've seen it. You might end up equally captivated.",1193270400,76,1269,4.581497797356828
