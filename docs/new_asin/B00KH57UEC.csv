6426395,5,B00KH57UEC,"If you want a very, very cute magical girl anime series based on a much more serious show that was inspired by a visual novel, then this is your show. When I first heard about this show, I thought that it would be all fluff and just cute school moments, with few or rushed action scenes. Fortunately, that thought is very incorrect. There are actually some large battles in this show that even last for more than one episode, and they are very good.

This collection contains all 10 episodes of the first season, as well as one OVA episode, which is listed last on the collection. This contains English and Japanese languages, so you can listen to whichever you prefer. Notably, the English voice cast is totally different than the voices used in Fate Stay Night and Fate Zero, which took me a long time to get used to Illya and Rin's new voices.

This story is an alternate, cuter, lighter version of Fate Stay Night. Illya is now the main character, who has ambitions of becoming a magical girl just like in anime. You can probably guess what happens to her, judging by the cover. She meets another magical girl named Miyu, which they both decide to hunt down magical class cards under the tutelage of their mentors. Many cameo appearances appear within the story, such as Saber and Berserker, so there is always something to look forward to for long time Fate Stay Night fans.

Notably, almost the entire cast is female, which seems to make this a show for younger girls, judging by the character's younger ages. However, I do not feel that this show needs to be viewed just by young girls, but can be viewed by anyone, but note that this is a magical girl show, therefore, if you are against the genre, then you should skip it. If you like shows like Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Revolutionary Girl Utena, or Shakugan no Shana, then you will enjoy this little show.",1406505600,30,1867,4.534124629080119
6426396,5,B00KH57UEC,"Honestly, I wasn't sure about this series at first. I picked it up immediately after viewing Fate/Zero, which, as anyone who has seen it knows, is a very serious tale. That anyone would even consider spinning that dark action story off into a magical girl series is odd, to say the least. That they were able to pull it off and create something that combines the light-hearted positivity of classic magical girl anime with both slice of life and the intense drama and action of the other Fate creations, in a manner that not only works but is strangely addicting, is quite an achievement. Additionally, they do a pretty good job of connecting the series to the overall Holy Grail War mythos in an interesting and satisfying way.

Prisma Illya is a very genre savvy production which pokes fun at magical girl tropes while staying true to the essence of the genre itself. Magical girl, Illya, daughter of Kiritsugu and Irisviel from Fate/Zero, is joined in the series by both Irisviel and Rin Tosaka (Fate/Stay Night), as magical girls and magicians must team up to achieve their goals. The action sequences are unexpectedly bad-ass and the every day adventures of the trio of girls (Illya, Kuro, and Miyu) range from amusing to touching. I was very glad to see that a fourth season of this entertaining series has been approved.

Some warnings: While this may be an unusual magical girl series, it is still very much a magical girl series. There's a lot of cute mixed in with the reasonably good storyline. So if you don't find cute charming, or if you just don't like magical girl anime, you're probably not going to enjoy this. As well, there is some sexually suggestive content that might make it unsuitable for children. If you're looking for some good magical girl anime for kids, Lyrical Nanoha or Yuki Yuna is a Hero might be better.",1451088000,5,1839,4.708074534161491
6426397,5,B00KH57UEC,I love Fate series especially other series that new ones is coming out I'm a big fan of fate series every series that comes out I'm going to get it because holy grail they are fighting for it. Plus the blue ray came out new and good conditions. Also i already watch the episode and its good can't wait for the next one.,1436486400,,319,4.079365079365079
6426398,5,B00KH57UEC,"I originally purchased this mostly because this is one of the only animated appearances of Saber Alter so far, though she most certainly will be appearing in the Heavens Feel movies of the original universe. This series really does stand on it's own as a wonderful comedy series, however. The only problem I had was the fact that the entire english dub was recast with no returning VAs from either F/Z or F/SN, which honestly isn't much of a problem if you are used to watching with subs. I would recommend this if you enjoy both the Fate franchise and magical girl sagas such as Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura.",1431043200,,615,4.54954954954955

6426401,3,B00KH57UEC,This anime is a fun spin off with some pretty neat fight scenes. The only thing is there is so many sexual innuendos considering the two main characters look like they're ten. In fact one of the first scenes in episode 1 shows illya's bare bottom. It's pretty unsettling. People said there was loli but I didn't think it'd be so bad it'd make me stop watching it after just four episodes. I still think the voice acting for the sub AND dub are great. The animation is gorgeous and the characters are fun. Just a bit too much sexualized...,1423612800,,538,4.39
6426402,5,B00KH57UEC,"I originally watched Fate/Stay Night and the only reason I'm glad to have seen that anime is because it helps understand a bit of what is seen visually later in the anime concerning Illya. Other than that, I found Fate/Stay Night to be extra boring and way too long whereas Fate Kaleid I found to be very engaging, very vibrant, fun, but way too short. I can't wait for the 2nd second to get dubbed and released.

I was also glad that the voice actors from Fate/Stay Night ARE NOT the same from this spin-off about magical girls. The writing is funnier, the characters are much better in my opinion, and I actually didn't question why I bought this unlike its predecessor.",1423180800,2,672,4.508196721311475

It loves to play with tropes and poke some fun at itself, but gets serious when it needs to be. This series earns it's place in the Fate franchise with ease with great characters, story, and smart (funny) writing.",1496534400,,299,4.454545454545454

It gives a good short story and not to mention the awesome battle scenes. :) If you don't mind the loli-ness of anime or even if your a fan of loli this series is a great short!

8658585,2,B00KH57UEC,"How do I describe Fate/Kaleid Liner?
In short, the story itself feels like the author of ""My Immortal"", a REALLY bad Harry Potter fanfiction, was given the rights to make a Type Moon series, except instead of being a goth on a permanent My Chemical Romance kick, she's a weeaboo on a perpetual Sailor Moon kick. This show isn't God-Awful, I've seen worse, but it's really bad compared to most of the other Fate/ series. Not just in that it's different, but in the plot line.
(Note: Not using Weeaboo here as a disrespect to fans of anime, but in the sense of being overly obsessed and wishing that reality was actually an anime, etc. You'll see why in a minute.)
The Holy Grail Wars don't happen like they do in Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Zero, and the servants take the form of cards. That mechanic is interesting on its own. But, the Masters now do the fighting themselves, and the Servants don't fight after their card has been taken, so we don't get to see Saber, Lancer, or Archer do battle against each other. Instead, the card allows the Kaleid Magical Girls to use their weapons and Noble Phantasm. Yes, this is a Magical Girl anime. Think Fate/Stay Night+Sailor Moon+Cardcaptor, if it was written by the chick who wrote My Immortal. And I say that because the characters in this are extremely OUT of character considering their other Type Moon counterparts, and there is a lot of pandering to the Yuri Fanboy community.

Now, I DO have to give it credit that some of the Servant re-designs, like Saber Alter are really cool, and the fight sequences are awesome, but it's not enough to make up for the bad story.

Also, a different company dubbed this, so the voices are different than in other series, and the pronunciation of ""Magus"" is now ""Mage-us"". Illyasviel is the main character, and she's now an Otaku, who wishes that life was more like the anime shows she watches, instead of being the master of Berserker bent on winning the Grail Wars. Her character is extremely annoying, and you will be glad to watch Unlimited Blade Works when Gilgamesh rips her heart out of her chest.

In short, this is not my cup of tea because it feels like a bad fanfiction that takes a dump all over everything I loved about Fate/Stay Night. While this does not appeal to me personally, if you like what I described, then you may enjoy the series. As I said earlier, it DOES have some redeeming values, but for me, it's not enough to rate it higher than 2 stars.",1456099200,3,2456,4.539503386004514
8658586,4,B00KH57UEC,I like this anime. Both artwork and story was good enough.,1455840000,,58,4.363636363636363
