8490095,2,B00600SOES,"This movie just didn't connect with us. Apparently the cultural gulf with Peruvian society was too broad to jump. We had a hard time keeping track of the plot, such as it was, and there were a number of times when we scratched our head and asked ourselves ""Who was that old guy with a sick wife and what did he have to do with the protagonist?"" or ""What's the significance of all these religious processions?"" And so on. An interesting slice of Peruvian life, but not one that had much dramatic interest.",1464048000,,504,4.43010752688172
8490096,4,B00600SOES,"""October"" (2010 release from Peru; 83 min.; original title ""Octubre) brings the story of Clemente, a pawnbroker/small-time lender in Lima, Peru, who provides financial services to the local community where banks do not. As the movie opens, we see him meet with locals who are trying to borrow money (as little as $50 or $75 is a big deal to them). Comments one of them later in the movie: ""Just like your father, better than a bank"", ha! Then, out of the blue one evening, Clemente comes home, only to find that someone has left a baby girl. Not knowing what to do, he ends up taking care of the baby, and even hiring a woman to help him out. But why was the baby girl left with him? Is she his daughter? And who might the mother be? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the promising debut feature movie from writers/directors Daniel and Diego Vidal. Second, Bruno Odar as Clemente brings a brilliant performance as the Al Pacino-reminding middle-aged man whose life is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of the baby. Third, this movie is intended to give us a peek in the lives of very ordinary (but no less interesting), everyday people in Lima, trying to get by as best as they can, but clearly struggling a lot. The movie's title refers to the time of year when there are processions for the Lord of the Miracles, a very special time for many Peruvians. Fourth, beware, there are several nude scenes that may be off-putting to some viewers.

The DVD bonus materials include a 2011 interview with co-director Daniel Vidal, bringing us great insights as to the background of the movie and the themes he and his brother wanted to cover. This movie is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for a good foreign movie that is off-center, you cannot go wrong with this. ""October"" is definitely worth checking out.",1396396800,,1956,4.5539772727272725
8490097,4,B00600SOES,"The movie reminds me of magic realism, although the scenes had plenty of REAL realism.
Pure human emotion and love make up the main theme I suppose.
Nothing directly implied, yet, loneliness, poverty, compassion, desire to trust, basic sexuality all merge in one focus.
Recommend it.
I gave four star mostly because the slow pace and lack of vibrancy that make the movie a bit on the depressing side.
Other than that, it's a good show.",1337472000,,435,4.7368421052631575
8490098,3,B00600SOES,"A movie that should have been better. The parts are just fine, but the whole never brings the parts together to lift it to any more than an average movie.",1325980800,,154,4.166666666666667
