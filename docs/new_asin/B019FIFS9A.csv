7573105,4,B019FIFS9A,"Theatrical review. Possible spoilers. WTF is based on Kim Barkers adventures in her book, The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Barker was a news copy writer for the Chicago Tribune but here, she works for a TV network. Kim Baker (dropped the r) is played by Tina Fey. She volunteers to go to Afghanistan after the U. S. invades Iraq. That became a bigger story for reporters assigned to cover Afghanistan. She was bored to death in her desk job and was going to trade it for a chance to face literal death, being embedded with a platoon of Marines.

Once Kim gets over the culture shock of the country (filmed in New Mexico) full of feces in the air she meets another reporter from England (think CBSs Lara Logan). Tanya Vanderpoel (Margo Robbie) has been there for a while so knows the ropes. These early scenes are filled with some low key humor, much of which have been shown in the numerous trailers. But this is not a comedy, so if that is what you're expecting look elsewhere.

Kim settles in with her Afghan fixer, Fahim (Christopher Abbott) and her bodyguard, Nic (Stephen Peacocke) and photographer, Tall Brian (Nicholas Braun) and gets into the action quickly. She develops a good relationship with Marine General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) which helps. As a side note, did anyone else notice when Kim first meets Hollanek, he was a colonel? Unusual that nothing is said about his promotion or the fact that hes in the same job. No matter, just an observation.

Kabul seems to have hidden-away clubs where booze is plentiful, at least to Westerners. Kim meets a Scottish photographer, Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) who at first appears to be a blustery bloke but warms up as time goes on. Eventually a romantic relationship develops although career objectives would seem to conflict. As it turns out the exhilaration of the reporting becomes something of a narcotic. And Kim develops a taste of it as well.

Alfred Molina joins the fray as the countrys attorney general, Ali Massoud Sadiq. Ive seen blubs in print and on the web that the casting of Molina and Abbott as Afghans is another example of Hollywood discrimination. I don't think so, and I don't care. They are both excellent. Sadiq has the hots for Kim, but she keeps him at arms length. Still he has connections so she uses her feminine wiles to get interviews and information.

I found this to be one of Feys better roles. She manages to balance a gritty determination with quick wit and sarcasm. She has some terrific scenes with Abbott, especially a beautifully muted departure when he drops her off at the airport, on her way back to New York. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the film moves along nicely and does a good job mixing some genuine seat squirming moments with a dash of humor and dramatic comradery. Well done.

7573106,5,B019FIFS9A,"I can only support what other reviewers already said:  NOT a comedy.  A smart, well produced, ""atmospheric"" movie.  Fantastic entertainment, not your typical ""chick flick"" but an intelligent mix of drama and the occasional bit of good humor without being ""stupid funny"". The fact that this is based on the true story of Kim Baker makes it interesting and insightful. It portraits the challenges reporters face, including competitiveness and finding ""viewer worthy"" stories the network will actually air.  I rarely give 5 Stars - but this movie is one of the best in a while. I have seen it four times!",1460073600,9,601,4.920792079207921
7573107,5,B019FIFS9A,Movie was very entertaining. Found myself laughing out loud a few times. Never go to the theater anymore but this was worth the money.  The music throughout movie was also great. Recommend you watch this one,1459900800,2,207,4.75
7573108,4,B019FIFS9A,"""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" translates to ""WTF."" You probably are familiar with THAT. Here, Tina Fey plays a real-life journalist who recalls when she was embedded with troops in the mid-East. A directing team, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa guided this R-rated drama with a screenplay by Robert Carlock who in turn based his work on a memoir by Kim Barker (""The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan""). She got the overseas assignment because she was unmarried and childless.

Our heroine is a stranger in a strange land: an emancipated Western woman trying not to step on toes in a fundamentalist Muslim land. See the ferocity on the women's faces when they shout at Kim to cover her hair. When she sees men's reaction as she wears a hijab on the street, she says, ""I feel so pretty I don't even WANT to vote!""

We see:
  * Tina Fey (""This is Where I Leave You"") is Kim Baker, based on the woman who wrote a book about her experiences (see above). She steps into the world of journalists in Kabul, which is mostly booze, drugs and sex. When she finally asks to go out on patrol, I was NOT impressed by her reckless disregard for everyone's safety!
  * Margot Robbie (""The Big Short"") is Tanya, ready for anything. This gorgeous blonde is delighted to finally have another woman to trust and to hang out with. She's a ""10"" in the USA, so she's a ""12"" in Kabul. She too, is ambitious.
  * Nicholas Braun (""Poltergeist"") Tall Brian is dependable and talented. He can run that camera under the most dire of circumstances, so he's Kim's right-hand man.
  * Billy Bob Thornton (""Our Brand is Crisis"") General Hollanek warns Kim that she must NEVER jeopardize his Marines. Thornton gets many of the best lines in what is NOT a comedy, e.g., ""War is like having sex with a gorilla, you keep going until the gorilla wants to stop."" (He didn't say it exactly that way...)
  * Martin Freeman (""Sherlock"") Iain MacKelpie takes partying to the next level. In addition, he's a seasoned newsman who knows his way around that part of the world.
  * Christopher Abbott (""A Violent Year"") Fahim is Kim's resourceful driver and wise interpreter. Their farewell at the airport is both moving and respectful.
  * Evan Jonigkeit (""X-Men"") Corpsman Chris has spent so much time repairing municipal systems, etc., he no longer bothers to chamber a bullet in his rifle. Back home, he chides her, ""If you think we are making a difference, you weren't paying attention over there.""
  * Alfred Molina (""Undertaking Betty"") Ali Massoud Sadiq is a warlord elevated to positions of authority in Kabul. He and Kim form a tenuous friendship.

This movie is also known as ""The Taliban Shuffle,"" for obvious reasons. Because it is R-rated, expect profane language, lots of gunfire, blowie uppie stuff and chaotic partying. I was impressed that Kim learned to speak Afghani (or at least swear in it) after her stay was extended from three months to as many years. (By the way, ""Whiskey"" is the Irish/American way of spelling Scots' ""Whisky."")",1458777600,5,3022,4.732824427480916
7573109,4,B019FIFS9A,"Nine Things About the Film ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot""

1. The title of the movie is more clever than I gave it originally gave it credit for. If you really don't know what it means, go look it up. I'll wait.

2. There are some movies that you come to understand not by figuring out what it is, but by what it isn't. This is one of those movies. It stars Tina Fey, but it's not a comedy. It's set in Afghanistan, but it's not a war movie (there are two combat scenes in the whole film, and they each last about 30 seconds). The main characters are war journalists, but it's not really about war reporting.

3. It's based on the true story of Kim Barker, a journalist writing dumb low-profile stories in 2003. The war in Afghanistan has moved its focus to Iraq, and all the war correspondents are moving too. So the news organization needs to send some replacement reporters to Afghanistan. Barker volunteers for the job.

Barker is immediately out of her depth. Not only does she not know the local language, she also doesn't know the difference between ""Afghan"" and ""Afghani"" (for that matter, she also doesn't know the difference between ""Hoo-yah!"" and ""Ooo-rah!""). Her first real conversation with other reporters amounts to a request for her to stake a claim for who she wants to have sex with.

4. There is a little discussion of the sexism that Barker encounters, being one of the only female war reporters in a Muslim country. However, there is just as much discussion of the advantages she gets by being a woman and having access to parts of the culture that men are barred from.

5. About a third of the way through the movie, a major theme emerges. Since there's no real fighting in Afghanistan, Barker wants to do stories on women's issues. Her boss in America tells her no; the American public isn't really interested in seeing Afghanistan's conflicts on the news, so they are certainly not interested in seeing Afghanistan's women on the news. She is in Afghanistan to find stories that get viewers that create profit in America.

6. About halfway through the movie, an unexpected romance begins to develop. This is not fluff or filler. It represents another theme of the movie, about being in a bubble and losing track of what's real.

7. As Barker learns to be a war correspondent, personal and professional boundaries naturally blur, and motives become murky. In the second half of the movie, a third theme comes into focus - intentionally or not, everybody eventually betrays somebody.

8. There is a fourth theme in the movie, but it is spelled out for you at the end, so you can't miss it. Then you can refer back to the movie's title.

9. This is a surprisingly nuanced film. It's not funny, or exciting, or scandalous. And I have no idea how closely the movie follows the facts of Kim Barker's story. But it is an excellent example about how a life is constructed (and deconstructed) from smaller pieces of experience. It hit me in the feels more than I expected.",1458259200,133,2980,4.595103578154426
7573110,4,B019FIFS9A,"Whisky Tango Foxtrot
 Do not be fooled by the movie billing of ""Whisky Tango Foxtrot"" as a comedy, nor by the star, famous comedian Tina Fey nor by the producer Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels.  Some funny stuff happens, funny more often in the sense of the absurd or in the sense of tragic-comedy but if you wanted something more along the the lines of ""Bride's Maids"", which would seem a natural expectation from this band of  movie makers, look elsewhere.  The not so funny film stands on its own as a many layered look into the contemporary world scene and has considerable value in that way.
 An American woman reporter goes to Afghanistan with no notion about the history, the culture, language or  much notion about the place at all, a natural enough situation for any American at that time-or indeed at any time.  One of the two script writers, Kim Barker, also wrote the original book, ""The Taliban Shuffle"" that the film loosely follows.  To get the most nourishment from the film we need to look around the edges of the story.  Kim (Tina Fey) undergoes her transformation from naif to driven, hardened war correspondent over the several years of her stay and that transformation holds a lot of interest for us.  Thankfully, she exits the bizarre-o world of the battle front before she slides entirely into the darkness of cynical ambition, a dark place where bloody body parts frame the reporter's fame.
 A number of scenes illuminate tiny parts of Afghan culture and show the rough places where East meets West.  Kim lavishly over tips a crying beggar boy, a child selling eggs whose stock has become broken and worthless only to find that Egg Boy always has broken eggs, not to sell but to invoke the pathos of the passing Westerners.  The reporters retreat from the horrors around them and the upside down culture they try to navigate by over medicating with booze, sex and recreational drugs, which gives the movie viewer some light moments, but at bottom the surcease for the reporters is both meaningless and temporary.  Always underlying the lives of the reporters is the chance of random death.  The people of Afghanistan have a dangerous volatility and a mob can form quickly to vent homicidal anger at something as beguine to us as a woman simply being alone.  Perhaps the most terrifying scene showed only Kim dropped by a taxi in the wrong spot leaving her alone in the night of Kabul, prey to any kind of violence suggested only by the sounds of the night.  In her book, Kim Barker mentioned that Afghanistan is ""...a place where young men from the provinces didn't know how to lace their boots..."" never having had boots.  That is an experience about as far from what Americans know as we can possibly imagine.
 But all these nice bits of film making do not jell into  more than a medium size movie watching experience.  Maybe it isn't a good idea to have comics make a serious social exploration.
 Tina Fey does quite well and has two remarkable looks at her co-star and romantic interest, Martin Freeman (famous as Bilbo Baggans).  Australian beauty Margot Robbie plays the older hand reporter who befriends the  new comer Kim.  Robbie appeared in the 2013 ""About Time"" and 2015's ""Focus"" with Will Smith.  Billy Bob Thorton plays a Marine officer.  Thorton now has a screen presence that has few equals.  Alferd Molina, an actor with 163 film and TV credits, plays the reporter's native fixer, translator and general factotum.
 We have an unusual tag team in the director's chair.  Glen Ficarra and John Requa have worked as a team before, in fact always, on ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"", the fore mentioned ""Focus"" and the less famous ""I Love You, Phillip Morris"".  TV joke writer Robert Carlock teamed with book writer Kim Barker to pen the screenplay.
 This decidedly ""R"" rated but ill called 'comedy' musters an average three saw blades in-spite of the well done individual parts.  It runs for one hour and 52 minutes.  Tina Fey, Lorne Michaels and the other producers spent $35 million to make the movie but has returned on $10 million so far in a field dominated by ""Zootopia"".
 Funny woman Tina Fey must have a heart of gold.  She has established a charity to aid military veterans who want to go to journalism school.  She didn't have to do that, at all.  Good for her.",1457740800,44,4303,4.7032085561497325

Content often jerkily alternates between shtick and drama. The storyline lacks cohesion and at times feels more like conjoined elements than an unfolding narrative. I think Tina Fey is wonderfully talented, and it may be that the effort to maintain the comedic spotlight on her and create a convincing wartime story produced some dissonance.

Barker was the papers South Asia bureau chief from 2004 to 2009 and her book was published in 2011 following her return to the U.S.

It's an enjoyable movie, fast paced and as other reviewers have noted, with plenty of profanity which strikes me as likely true to how the soldiers and others really interacted in a war zone and under high stress, with the extremes of fighting and fear alternating with debauchery and sin. Alfred Molina is a treat, portraying the local official who tries to get Baker to sleep with him in exchange for helping her gain the access she needed for her stories.

The underlying story, I suppose, is how Baker evolves from naive and inexperienced war zone reporter, to one who is just as tough and profane as any of the others. The movie alternates scenes from the later stages of her time in Afghanistan with scenes starting from the beginning, and the actress Margot Robbie is excellent in her portrayal of competing journalist Tanya Vanderpoel, who straightforwardly asks Baker at their first meeting if it would be ok if she sleeps with Baker's security man, a New Zealand hunk who later in the movie (spoiler alert) turns out to be an American who's mastered the New Zealand accent in order to impress the women. It works, for a while. I had a hard time not seeing Martin Freeman (Baker's romantic interest) as Bilbo Baggins, though. Billy Bob Thornton is a treat as the local Marine commander, hard as nails but eventually coming to respect Baker (Oorah!).

Intermixed with the story are tidbits of insight into the war itself and Afghan life, such as the time when the Afghan women in a local village confide in Baker to tell her that the local well, repeatedly blown up by what the military assumes were Taliban, was actually being destroyed by the women who preferred having to walk to the river for water, since it gave them their only opportunity to speak together and gossip, away from the constraints of their men. The horror of the war is seen in a few scenes but for the most part the drama of the war is in the background.

The original version of the book, linked above, has more recently been supplemented by the new edition:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot-The-Taliban-Shuffle-MTI-Strange-Days-in-Afghanistan-and-Pakistan/dp/B019B6XJ9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (The Taliban Shuffle MTI): Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan</a>&nbsp;to take advantage of the movie tie-in.

Overall very enjoyable and worthwhile.

What took me by surprise is she can act out of comedy, and in this she acts, she expresses all the frustration, anger, professional intensity of a woman reporter embedded in a hell hole for women. She is gutsy, and fearless, and sometimes just out of control, because her reality is out of control.

7573186,4,B019FIFS9A,"This was a very well acted, well written, and well filmed movie.  Honestly.  And don't look at ""Tina Fey"" and assume comedy - because it's not.  Unlike many comedy actors and actresses, Ms. Fey does a wonderful job in the lead role.  The supporting cast is wonderful, and even though you'd expect it to swing that way - there wasn't a glorification of West > East philosophies.  I loved a scene near the end where a very true-to-culture interaction happens between Ms. Fey and the man who worked as her guide/translator (called a ""Fixer"" in the film).  Beautifully done.

Minor critiques - and these are extremely minor, but I did notice them:
1) There's a scene early on where the Fixer guy accidentally calls Kim Baker ""Tina"".  Oops.  It happens, but it was a little funny it didn't get noticed earlier.

2) I personally didn't like the stylistic choice of music over the Marine Combat Op (No spoilers, but you'll know what I mean when you see it).  I don't think it fit well.  This is 100% my opinion.  The scene was still wonderfully shot, especially with the lack of light.  It gave it a wonderful realism.  I just think they could have either used no music at all (to build on the suspense and importance of quiet), or maybe a different song could have worked.

3) Why Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?  (And yes, I know what they are referencing).  The only thing I can sort of figure out is Ms. Fey's character coming to the realization that the life she had in Kabul was not normal, and she needed to accept that, but it was not really spelled out or clear.  I honestly don't know what better title to go with, but I did spend a little too much time thinking about ""Why did they name it that?"" while watching - which is not a good thing for a movie to confuse and distract its view to that degree.

Like I said - these are minor.  The movie is still 100% worth watching.  Just don't go into it thinking it's a comedy!",1499212800,,1915,4.380681818181818

It's not a comedy. It's a drama with funny parts. Again, being that Tina Fey is a solid comedy writer I was surprised to see this shape up into a drama right from the opening scene, especially since it was billed as a comedy. When they do inject funny parts into the story they are really funny. So it's a good all around entertaining film.

It's completely non political too. I was surprised about that being that it was a Hollywood movie about the war in Afghanistan. But they left politics out of it completely. It's all about one woman's personal journey as a war corespondent. It goes into her personal life, her professional life, and her feels about being on an adventure. Nothing about politics at all.

It also treats the Marine Corps very well and paints them in a very positive way. Almost nothing about the Marines' portrayal is realistic, but it's completely positive. Even when they show mistakes the Marines made, it's done in a very positive way to show they were trying to do the right thing. In other words this movie does not preach to you.

As for the inaccurate portrayal of the Marines,  it was minor stuff but really annoying. For example they have Tina Fey doing interviews with Marines with clearly visible rank insignia on their collars and the Marines give their own ranks wrong. A man wearing Sergeant chevrons says he is a Gunnery Sergeant. A man with Corporal chevrons says he is a Lance Corporal. Or when Fey says ""Hoo Wah!"" to the Marine General, the General rightfully says that Marines say ""Ooo Rah!"" then wrongly says it's the Navy that says ""Hoo Wah!"" In reality the Army says ""Hoo Wah or Hoo ahh""...or whatever I don't know. I wasn't in the Army. But I know the Navy doesn't say it. Stuff like that should have been fixed with a simple military consultant being involved. To be fair that was only about 30 seconds of total screen time with really basic stuff like that botched. It only takes you out of the story for a minute. The rest of the inaccuracies are battlefield stuff that 99% of the world would never notice as inaccurate. And they really aren't that big of a deal.

Still it was a wildly entertaining movie that had a good story. And apparently it's based on a true story.

Don't judge this by the trailers. The trailers for this movie present a completely different idea of what this film is about. They are very misleading.",1489536000,11,2555,4.5292841648590025

7573342,4,B019FIFS9A,"Surprisingly good film. The story is compelling and the acting is very, very good.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to understand the complex and confusing war in Afghanistan. While it never dives into the reasons why this war exists, it shows the state of mind of those who are there to not only fight it but to report on it. Today, it is mostly out of the news as it is boring and no longer grabbing the interest of the public. In other words, the networks and media can no longer make money with it. People still die horribly, soldiers continue to suffer from their wounds. Children continue to suffer due to the violence of others in their country, mostly the Taliban. Exiting that conflict in a manner where the country will be peaceful has been an impossible objective.

Thank you, Tina Fey, for having the guts to tell the story. Thanks to Kim Barker for the real life story after her experiences in that war torn country.

In the end, people will continue to fight and kill. People will suffer and there is very little one can do make it stop. All we need to do is to recognize that someday peace will be apparent to those who fight and kill in the name of God.

In it's attempt to show the frenetic, hedonistic, ""on the edge'"" quality of the war zone of the early Afghanistan war (amongst the foreign press and war reporters - the group under study in this film) - it was really in need of some film editing. The dialogue was superficial and artificial. The mishmash of foreign accents was hard to follow and the 'insights' it tried to convey were muddled and stereotypical.  Near the end they manged to 'right the flight' and come in for a nearly good landing - especially Tina Fey's encounter with the marine she had interviewed early on upon her arrival in Kabul; who subsequently lost both of his legs by IED.

7573666,4,B019FIFS9A,"I've yet to see anything Tina Fey is in that's not good viewing. I also like Martin Freeman - he and Fey don't seem like a likely pair, but opposites attract - yes? They're actually pretty well matched and good for each other. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It brings up a situation that most women would not even consider; however Tina, as true to life Fay Baker, did what most of would not...she went to Afghanistan to report the news. She went through many scenes which are contradictory of what we know as Americans, and did it with aplomb. I do not give 5 stars for 99.5% of my reviews, because I think people need to keep striving for that golden ring; this gets a 4.5, probably closer to 4.7. Enjoyable. Informative. Funny in parts. Sad in parts. I think it's well done for what most people are looking for in a movie. Would I watch it again? Yes, I think it's well worth viewing.",1485648000,,888,4.355421686746988
7573667,4,B019FIFS9A,"So, I'm not an expert. Love movies; never aspired to a career as a film critic. However, I liked this film and after past experience working for a department of defense agency, I've seen how being in a combat zone changes people. Based on that, I appreciated the depiction of a group of people living on the edge. I found Tina Fey's portrayal of a woman moving from a desk job to war correspondent believable and touching. The supporting cast, too, made the story come alive. The evolution of the characters felt real, given what I've seen in my life. There were consequences for actions that involved the lives of others and a peek at other cultures. That said, I'm not a huge fan of violence in movies or of war movies or anything like war movies - so I really enjoyed watching this, recommend it heartily (particularly to anyone who thinks of war or coverage of war as full of glorious fun), but won't be watching it over and over.

Like a Pink Panther sorta thing. Actually, it's quite meaningful with a SOLID story line, plot, character development and not one slow moment. It moves along. The audience is informed at some point that this is based on a real life events of a female journalist which, to me, makes the story even that much more intriguing. It's well done. It wasn't a huge hit at the box office but perhaps if people had actually known what the movie was about it would've attracted a bigger draw. This isn't the first time that bc there is a comedic actor staring they try and sell it as a slapstick-style flick. I find that annoying bc it sells the actors short on the performances they give in the film, and it misinforms movie goers. Just tell us wth the movie is about and we'll figure out for ourselves if we want to view it. Tina Fey really shines in dramatic roles (This is Where I Leave You) so why down play that?

However, I also know that Afghanistan is MORE strict with women even that Saudi, and there were quite a few things that were inaccurate. For example, the main character would NOT have ridden in the front seat of a car with a man who isn't her husband. I also found the scenes of drinking, etc. outside of their ""compound"" or building, to be highly unlikely.
All this aside, it was good entertainment.",1485388800,2,541,4.530612244897959

Co-stars Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, and Alfred Molina all play their parts well.

It was terrific!
Real good representation of what it's probably like as a foreign journalist; in this case, in Afghanistan.
As I recall, the trailers seemed to focus more on the comedy aspects. (I remember a scene with the first Afghanistan woman driving, and she unknowingly shifts the car into reverse and crashes through a wall.) This movie is so much more.  Turns out it's more of a drama.

I expect Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman to do a great job, and they did, but the actors whose names I wasn't as familiar with made me believe as well.  As an actor, there are so many things in films that take me out of it --- when I see a technique or something that I comment on in my mind --- but that was not the case with this movie.

I wish - for the sake of her showing some acting versatility - that it could have been done a little more dramatically, but she still did it well.  Besides this movie being less dramatic than other movies of similar topics, I think another reason this didn't get more attention is that the leading role was not played by Meryl Streep or someone else of that stature.  Of course, any male lead would've drawn more attention to the film.  That's just the way it is.  But, it was a story about a woman, so...  And it was a very good story!

7574292,4,B019FIFS9A,"I was surprised by this film. The marketing made it seem like a silly farce about a female reporter in a hot war zone; the ultimate fish out of water. A woman in the Middle East, Taliban territory. I thought it was going to be one-liners, funny faces, jokes about women, etc. I really like Tina Fey so I had wanted to watch it even though it seemed silly.

It was not silly at all. It was thoughtful, funny but insightful, and well-acted. It was very badly marketed.

Tina Fey's performance was often nuanced. She's a powerfully funny comic. She's got impeccable timing and, her facial expressions, her ""takes"" during 30 Rock, while broad, were hugely amusing. But, in this film, she's far more subdued and her performance is realistic. She portrays a female reporter who makes a decision to change her life and go to Afghanistan in the middle of the war, going from being a copy writer to an on-camera reporter. She's out of her depth. But, she has instincts and listens to people. She makes some mistakes but not for long.

This film deals with ideas like women's rights and gender differences. How do women get treated in a war zone? What is life like for women in the Middle East? As well, the film looks at career choices, mid-life crises, ethical decisions about what to report and how to report it. How important is your career versus your personal life? What are you willing to do to get what you want?

Overall, I was really impressed by this film. The directing was good, the writing was good, the acting was good. Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie both turned in good performances as fellow reporters. Christopher Abbott was notable as Fahim, a ""fixer"" for Tina Fey's character. Their relationship is touching and emotional. It highlights the cultural differences between Westerners and Middle Easterners, particularly those living in countries such as Afghanistan.

I recommend this film. It's not slapstick or farcical at all. It's more of a funny drama or a dramatic comedy. And, Tina Fey's performance should be seen and appreciated.",1484438400,,2047,4.771186440677966

7574365,1,B019FIFS9A,"As a service member, my perspective and experiences with ""war"" journalists and correspondents is jaded from three deployments between Iraq and Afghanistan. With that being said, I have two reason for giving this review 1-star.

First, my experiences have shaped my preferences for ""war"" movies like Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. War is not a comedy and it felt like Tina Fey's comedic approach to a war movie (an ongoing war, where service members and civilians are still being killed) felt like it was mocking service members and the war in Afghanistan, specifically, it made the Marines look like fools by using the most stereotypical actors who can't even properly wear a Marine uniform. Whether your agree with the war or not, service members aren't policy makers, and are making the best of their situation - they shouldn't be pawns in the media - which is exactly the depiction that Whiskey Tango Foxtrot uses.

Second, I have absolutely no sympathy for journalists who cover(ed) Iraq/Afghanistan. They do it for personal reasons; to either promote a personal or organizational agenda or to gain credibility (aka - make money). In my experiences, most journalists that I worked with in Iraq already had their story written by the time they arrived to your Forward Operating Base or Combat Outpost. Therefore, I could care less about a movie that tries to tell the story about how 'hard' war is for war journalists and correspondents.",1484265600,6,1432,5.012605042016807

7574415,3,B019FIFS9A,"It's 2003. Anybody good has been sent over to Iraq. The news channel is looking for unmarried childless people to cover the forgotten Afghan war. Kim Baker (Tina Fey) decides to get out from behind the computer screen to go in front of the camera. She's a fish out of water. She tries long distance dating with boyfriend Chris. Fahim is her local fixer and Nic is security. Fellow reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) is one of the few western women and she claims that Kim is Kabul Cute. Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) is a charming war photographer. Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina) is a rising Afghan politician. Kim gets embedded with General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton)'s marines.

This starts out as Liz Lemon in Kabul. The comedy is a bit too broad. Tina Fey can't help giving off that vibe but she doesn't have to be a bumbling idiot. Letting the money blow away is far too slapstick. She needs to see those moments as ill-fitting and eliminate them with a vengeance. The joke about her looking like a pretty boy is also too jokey. Martin Freeman and Alfred Molina are pushing the movie too much on the lighter side. Freeman is lighter simply by his nature and Molina's character should be a little scary. I have no objection with Liz Lemon in Kabul but she needs to be calibrated to the darker end.",1484179200,,1316,4.6

The lack of clear mission, the flowing of money, and the corruption of Afghan officials are the backdrop for a reporter who decides to go from a lackluster life in a cubicle right into the mix.  The hedonistic, self-destructive lifestyle of war correspondants becomes the daily norm for Tina Fey's character, who loses her moral compass in the immoral wasteland of war.  Not at all a comedy, this film gives the non-combatant's view of just where all those billions of American dollars went, and what they managed to accomplish.

This latest outing is not a comedy, but rather a studied look at the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and the clash of cultures for the reporters who cover the chaos in that desolate nation. Fey lands in the mess as a neophyte to the cultural-military cross currents, and stumbles her way to success. The title of this film is military lingo, using the military alphabet for a common curse used by troops when things don't go right. The look of this film is spot on, for those who recall the news videos of the fighting there. At the end we learn it was made in the Southwest--one rocky desert looks like another. All in, this film is an interesting way to spend 2 hours and learn about how the media and military operate in that intractable, sticky far off medieval nation out of the headlines lately..",1484092800,,924,4.4733727810650885

7574571,5,B019FIFS9A,"This is an excellent film!  I'm not surprised with Tina Fey involved.  Sharp, funny, moving, fast-paced, witty and has strong women characters covering a war.  More realistic depiction of war than I would expect from a dramedy like this.  Highly recommended.",1484092800,,258,5.219512195121951
7574572,5,B019FIFS9A,"Before I begin this review, I have a confession.  I am in love with Tina Fey.  I think she is a absolutely beautiful, intelligent, funny, amazing person.  I even enjoy her American Express Credit Card TV promos!
Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot is WTF in Morse Code and that pretty much sums up the situation in AFGHANISTAN.
Fey plays a reporter who decides to go over to the war zone to cover it to further her career which was going nowhere anyway.
The rest of the fast paced, well directed film shows us what goes on behind the scenes of the people trying to report the war to their home countries.
It gives viewers an interesting slant to the what may go on there. As a Viet Nam era veteran, I enjoyed it because the film showed how senseless it all was.",1484092800,,749,4.335714285714285

The only complaint is that  the first 5 minutes are blurred out by Amazon,  kinds looks like  the bad reception form a Skype call. It does clear up eventually. But it should not be there in the first place.  Tina delivers  good one liners and Billy Bob Thorton  is kinda  cool, especially  the line about  the Kelly Blue Book Value. LOL  very real!

7574617,5,B019FIFS9A,"Tina Fey shows she has acting chops beyond physical and slapstick comedy in this nearly non-fiction story. I watched it expecting a comedy based on her normal repertoire, and was pleasantly surprised by the plot and the whole story. Fey's character goes through a significant amount of transformation throughout the course of the film and she handles these with the appropriate amount of clumsiness as we all do when the world is not as it seems.

I probably would have given it 4.5 stars if that were an option as the people around her who influence her change are pretty two dimensional, but there really isn't more time to flesh those people out.",1484092800,,649,4.743362831858407
7574618,3,B019FIFS9A,"It's a mildly entertaining movie.  I had read a review of it before it was release to the theaters which was misleading as to what the movie was about.  It's a far more serious flick, not so much a comedy at all, which is what the review had indicated.  There are a few humorous moments in it, but overall it's a drama.  The story just never seems to fully develop.  There's hinted-at drama between the female reporters which is never fully played out.  And a very luke-warm romance between Tina Fey's character and the Scottish reporter.  Definitely not a great movie.  If you're bored and want to watch a modern drama in a war setting, it's okay for passing the time.",1484092800,,669,4.471074380165289

But  this is not a comedy despite Tina Fey being the lead actor.  It is a seemingly realistic portrayal of a  opportunist TV journalist who volunteers to cover the war in Afghanistan to add some excitement to her life and boost her dead end career. Ms Fey does her best to carry the film, and despite her good but not great effort, she lacks the dramatic acting skills or persona to portray the serious nature of the war tragedies surrounding her.  Margot Robbie and Billy Bob Thornton, are name brand co-stars and enhance every scene they are in.  The movie loses a bit of credibility in the frat party atmosphere portrayed among the journalists (although, maybe it is realistic, I don't know?) Whatever the case, it is a surprising and revealing glimpse of the hell, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rice created for America in Afghanistan/Afpak.",1484006400,,1075,4.631578947368421

7574815,4,B019FIFS9A,Tina Fey pretty good in this movie. Liked it more than I thought I would.,1483920000,,73,3.933333333333333

7574817,5,B019FIFS9A,"I loved this movie. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. Tina Fey is usually in comedic roles, but this character really showed how diverse of an actress she is. The plot tackles a tough situation but manages to keep it somewhat light with the interactions of the main characters. The cast was simply great together and the story line kept me on the edge of my seat. I would watch it again.",1483920000,,392,4.3108108108108105
7574818,3,B019FIFS9A,"Although I really enjoyed this movie, the advertisements were misleading. I was expecting it to be a comedy based on the commercial takes. It was a drama movie about a woman's life and how she needed a change and she found herself while overseas.",1483920000,,246,4.613636363636363
7574819,5,B019FIFS9A,This was a great movie. Not a comedy as some of the trailers portrayed it. It was funny but in the way a trauma makes you laugh sometimes. Wonderful film and Tina Fey was wonderful.,1483920000,,181,4.2
7574820,4,B019FIFS9A,"Mixed emotions over this film.  Some really dark scenes, some seemed way too fictional, as it was supposedly based on a real life story. Not sure if I liked it very much or not.....sort of left me neutral at best.  Not sure I would recommend it to my friends.  Sort of a mis-mash of events.....",1483920000,,294,4.3090909090909095

7574822,1,B019FIFS9A,Tina Fey was definitely the highlight of this movie production. The script premise was not believable. The character reactions to various external (predictable) events did not appear as realistic. Most of the story flow could best be described as contrived. The purpose of the movie was not easily discernable. Very disappointing given the money obviously spent to create this project.,1483920000,2,385,5.433333333333334

7574825,4,B019FIFS9A,I thought that it was well acted and probably pretty close to the real thing based on discussions I have had with people who have been to Iraq and Afghanistan.  I think other reviewers were expecting a comedy because Tina Fey is in it.  Like Robin Williams she is expected to be funny in everything and doesn't get enough respect for the serious films that she picks.  I haven't read the book but suspect that this is pretty true to it.,1483920000,,436,4.3580246913580245

Tina Fey's performance was fantastic, as was her supporting cast. However, the writing felt uneven and stale.

The script couldn't seem to decide whether it wanted to take a lighthearted, dark comedy approach, or whether it wanted to be a drama.

I felt my attention drifting as I was viewing, which is never what you want from any form of entertainment.

Very disappointed with this movie. I consider myself a big Tina Fey fan, but the script of this movie was appalling. Any attempt at comedy resulted in an eye roll. The jokes went after the lowest hanging fruit in effortless fashion. ""Women can't do this here!"" or ""That is such a white thing to say!"" Also, I understand it is based on a true story, but almost every move the main character made seemed so unrealistic based on what we learned from her in the setup of the movie, or what any rational person would do. For example, immediately jump out of a car in the first ambush she encountered and try and film it (not sure what she tried to film anyways). Lastly, I now have 0 interest in learning the actual story this was based on, which is probably the worst part of the whole thing.

Don't watch this. Not funny. Not entertaining. Not educational.",1483660800,2,1121,4.436893203883495

And it was interesting to watch her character grow not only as a person but also in her profession.  I enjoyed the story line and the portrayals of the characters.

7575199,5,B019FIFS9A,"I think some of the disconnect with the viewing audience is not knowing what to expect in regard to the movie genre. With Tina Fey as the star, I expected it to be more of a comedy.  I'm not used to watching her in serious roles.  Even though it was not quite what we expected, we really enjoyed the movie.",1483401600,,306,4.083333333333333
7575200,3,B019FIFS9A,"This movie is a fine chronicle of journalist Kim Barker's memoir, The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which details her years as a reporter in Pakistan and Afghanistan beginning in 2002. True to the actual events, language is very pervasive. Some sexual content and drug use. Once the violent war images started, there was never any let-up to give us a time to catch our breath. Most detailed, however, is the ""outrageous and shocking"" attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

Rating: R (for pervasive language, some sexual content, drug use and MUCH violence. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 68% with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus states, ""While WTF is far from FUBAR, Tina Fey and Martin Freeman are just barely enough to overcome the picture's glib predictability and limited worldview.""",1483401600,,927,5.098684210526316
