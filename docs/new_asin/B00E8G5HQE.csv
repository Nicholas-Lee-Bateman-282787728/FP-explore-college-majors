5895330,5,B00E8G5HQE,"Really enjoyed this movie.  Looks great on Blu-ray.  You do have to suspend your rational mind and give in to ""movie physics"", especially the heat issue, but every volcano movie has those issues.  OK, I do have to own up to a bias.  I grew up in LA and am familiar with many of the locations in the movie, watching it being attacked by rivers of lava is just too much fun!  Better even than the blob.",1381190400,,400,4.142857142857143

5895394,4,B00E8G5HQE,"Its a popcorn movie. Anybody expecting Shakespeare or even Citizen Kane is being nave. The acting was not bad at all, and the effects were quite good. The original DVD was a letterboxed item, with not full usage of the format's resolution capabilities. The Bluray is wide-screen anamorphic, which would be an improvement even if it were still done as a DVD. However, it is made even better thanks to the Bluray technology. The sound is excellent, too, and I can tell, because I have a superior AV system with dual tower/cylinder subwoofers (flat response to 20 Hz), and top-level satellite speakers in a big room. While it lacks the usual DVD or Bluray ""extras,"" remember that if one were viewing it in a theater there would also be no extras. Consider it as a regular movie being presented in your home. If you want ""extras,"" go look the movie up on the internet and read what you find.",1453939200,3,887,4.584905660377358

5895401,2,B00E8G5HQE,"BOTTOM LINE: Mindless popcorn fun in the same vein as DANTE'S PEAK (also released that same year). There's lots of exploding & burning stuff to ""Ohhh!"" & ""Ahhh!"" at as Tommy Lee Jones breaks a sweat trying to save a lava-threatened Los Angeles. Over the top summer disaster flick blockbuster silliness at its best. 4 STAR film, 2 STAR Blu-ray.

THE STORY: A minor earthquake shakes up a growing magma pocket pooling deep under California's La Brea Tar Pits. A heavy aftershock early the next morning wakes it fully and an honest-to-goodness volcano begins erupting in the center of of LA's famed Miracle Mile district. It's up to craggy-faced Tommy Lee Jones as Mike Roarke, Director of the O.E.M. (Office of Emergency Management) to figure out a way to stanch the unrelenting river of ruthless liquid rock before the entire city of Los Angeles (and her stunned citizens) are burned to a crisp & buried under a massive mountain of molten lava.

THOUGHTS: Fairly dumb-headed popcorn film that I enjoy for some reason. Most likely due to my admiration of Tommy Lee Jones' work over the years. Movie treats audience and film's characters as though not a single one of us or them have ever heard of lava or volcanoes before. Yes, I know that the writer of the screenplay has to somehow get all of the audience members up to speed on the various components of the script, but it is very poorly and stupidly done: the head of the O.E.M. doesn't know what magma is? Really?!? A local TV reporter apparently doesn't know what the stuff is either, given his bone-brained explanation of how the tar from the La Brea Tar Pits appears to have ""overflowed and caught fire."" 6th grade basic science class, anyone? LOL. Still, this movie can be enjoyed on a ""put your brain in park and just enjoy the action & noise"" summer blockbuster level. The visual destruction & volcano effects are plentiful and, for the most part, are done pretty well even though they definitely show their age compared to more modern CGI-fests. The then-topical Mark Fuhrman/Rodney King references also hopelessly date the film. Of the two volcanically-themed movies that came out in 1997, DANTE'S PEAK is the better one, IMHO, yet it too has some laughably bad plot holes, common sense & science logic gaps, and an overly simplistic script. They're both 100+/- minutes of mindless fun. Nothing more. But then again, that's the basic job of a summer popcorn flick, isn't it?? ;-)

THE BLU-RAY: This has to be one of the lamest Blu-ray releases I have ever seen. The movie itself is ALL you get. You put it in your player and it autoplays; there's no main menu, no submenus, no bonus extras. Nothing! Not even the film's theatrical trailer! Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nil. Nyet. At least the video resolution & soundmix do have improvements over DVD and the film is in its proper anamorphic widescreen so there's that. Otherwise I'd be half-tempted to believe that this particular edition of VOLCANO is a bootleg. It certainly has all the lowball earmarkings. If you already have VOLCANO on DVD then I wouldn't recommend wasting your hard-earned moolah on this lame turd of a Blu-ray, excreted by the corporate sphincters at Anchor Bay. If you insist on hi-def then this purchase is a marginal recommendation - and that's only IF you don't mind that you just get the movie itself. For fans of VOLCANO (and movie aficionados in general), this is a real punch in the throat. Don't buy this unless you can get it used, for cheap. Shame on the unscrupulous corporate weasels who foisted this flaccid home video release on an unsuspecting public. 4 STARS for the goofy fun film itself, minus 2 full stars for the crappy non-effort Anchor Bay did with this paltry Blu-ray.",1447545600,9,3723,4.751159196290572

In fact, on some movie nights, we will watch this, back-to-back with 'Independence Day.'  'Volcano' is as exciting & grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the movie, just like 'Independence Day' does. Tommy Lee Jones is at his Best in acting performance, as well as the entire cast.

L.A. was Not prepared for what was about to happen, and when 'Volcano' decided to invade & cause chaos, the movie became more-and-more thrilling. Sound Effects & Special Effects were totally awesome, and you were compelled to find out how it ended, and who survives.

The explosive action had you on the edge-of-your-seat through some scenes, and the entertainment continues, until the final curtains close. Thrilling, action-packed, and entertaining throughout. Highly recommended!",1422144000,2,870,5.2898550724637685

5895479,5,B00E8G5HQE,"Nothing fancy....just your average, ""end of the world..."" Drama here. (If you live in Los Angeles...that is!) I really enjoyed this movie, however...the thought of Tommy Lee Jones outrunning a collapsing building is a stretch! Yet this is fine family fun and entertainment. I'm just glad I don't live in California. Having said that....I'm much closer to volcanos here in Hawaii. Who would have made a movie of Honolulu being torn by a volcano?",1405728000,,444,5.013513513513513
5895480,4,B00E8G5HQE,"This little end-of-the-world (where LA is a stand-in for the world) thriller covers a few days in the life of Office of Emergency Management employee Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) as he improbably works with geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to avert disaster on the streets of LA - and improbably escape near death repeatedly - when a volcano erupts and destroys a bunch of stuff.

It's got the standard sentimentality of a Hollywood actioner: a father-daughter relationship at its center (the father is divorced and the mother is never seen) and a little love story blossoms amidst all the destruction. There's a lot of focus on the logistics of stopping the lava flow which I'm sure is very pseudo-sciencey and Jones somehow outruns a collapsing building to save his daughter.

Still, this thing moves along at a quick pace and there are a good amount of deadpanned one-liners. In short, it's got everything a good action movie should have, including the absolutely epic and heavy-handed, one-liner from a little boy looking at all the people covered in ash: ""Look at their faces; they all look the same.""",1405296000,3,1111,4.873015873015873

The actors try but not even Tommy Lee Jones can save the poor writing. Jones, Anne Heche, David Keith et al struggle to add life to some dumb lines and cliches. There are also too many stereotypes in this film but they do not matter because the volcano, lava and lava balls dominate the movie.
