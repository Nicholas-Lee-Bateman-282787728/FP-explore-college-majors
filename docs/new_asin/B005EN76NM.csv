Actually, would have been better without it.  Purchase the movie anyway; you'll have no regrets!",1340841600,,292,5.466666666666667
8468778,5,B005EN76NM,"I saw the Third Twin back in 97' when it debuted on CBS. I knew it would be great because I'd seen the premieres and it had some wonderful talent lined up. I taped it on VHS, I was so excited to see it.

I rarely give five star reviews on movies but The Third Twin is amazing in every way. It's a top-notch thriller that lives up to Ken Follett's mind-boggling novel on which the film is based.

Jeannie Ferrami (Kelly McGillis) is a scientist who has just come onto something that could change the world as well as how unborn human beings relate in society. She studies the link between criminal behavior and how much of the behavior is desire and how much of it is genetic. Jeannie's made a breakthrough with her latest study by testing different subjects. She is led to a young man Steve Logan (Jason Gedrick). She has been studying him and because of his dental records she is convinced he has a twin. She breaks the news to Steve (who tried to pick her up the day before) and he is beyond shocked. He claims he doesn't have a twin and that his adoptive parents wouldn't lie to him. Berrington Jones (Larry Hagman) almost has a heart attack when he sees Steve in the courtyard and from that point the movie becomes a fantastic ride of unpredictable twists and turns.

Berry is the face of modern genetics and he is close to being recognized and receiving a lot of money for his work in the field. Jeannie's study could ruin everything for him and he does all he can to stop her though he pretends to be on her side the entire time.

When Lisa, Jeannie's friend and lab technician is raped on the university campus, Steve is named the rapist. He claims he's innocent but his DNA says different. Jeannie, the only one who believes Steve or cares about his innocence goes on a chase to prove that Steve is not the rapist. She comes in contact with Dennis Pinker who is in prison for murder. Pinker is the man who Jeannie connected to Steve in the first place as his twin. Jeannie goes to the prison to get blood from him and ends up seeing how frightening Pinker can be first hand. A part of her wants to believe he is the rapist but he never escaped from prison. Jeannie still believes Steve is innocent until she is attacked in Baltimore after a trip to the Alvetine Clinic by a man who looks just like Steve. Is it really Steve? Is he really innocent and has a host of twins he doesn't know about or is he a dangerous conman?

After the first half of the movie everything is quickly set in motion.

I can't tell more about the plot because it's full of spoilers. The acting was superb. Jason Gedrick was wonderful in multiple roles. He was very convincing in every scene he was in. I've always loved him. Larry Hagman and Ralph Waite had wonderful chemistry as partners desperate to cover up what they'd done. Marion Ross is great as Jeannie's mother who is losing her mind and Hal Holbrook is hilarious if sad as Jeannie's career-criminal, burglar father.

I would recommend this adaptation to anyone who read the book and everyone who hasn't. I read the book after the movie because I loved the movie so much. It's not many movies that convince you to read the book afterward.

The only issue I had was pairing McGillis with Gedrick. That didn't work at all. McGillis may not have been that much older than Gedrick in reality but she has aged badly and she looked like his grandmother. It was kind of uncomfortable to see them being romantic and kissing. It was just not convincing. There wasn't a reason that he would find her attractive. That just did not work. If I can remember I don't believe Jeannie and Steve were even romantic in the book. The romance element was not needed and I found those parts (though pleasant still) a waste of time. It was like the romance was put in for filler.

This is a movie where you can put your feet up and settle in for a few hours with some popcorn. You'll learn a lot too in terms of how science works.

The writing was wonderful. The set great, the acting fabulous. Except for the forced romantic pairing of McGillis with Gedrick, I have no complaints. This film is a real treat!",1311811200,,4129,4.3715775749674055
