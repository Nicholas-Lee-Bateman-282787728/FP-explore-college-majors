2217682,4,B0007LFPJS,"I recently purchased this movie and viewed it in two days.  I think kids will enjoy this movie.  Adults shouldn't have any problems either.  I'm a fan of the animator and I'm familiar with his work from urbanentertainment dot com.  If you enjoy super hero cartoons, this should be enjoyable.  One aspect that I like about this movie is that it was created using Macromedia Flash (Now Adobe Flash).  It think it's great that anyone can create his or her own cartoon using Adobe Flash and distribute it to DVD.  I think it's also a nice aspect that Sanaa Lathan, Michael Clark Duncan and Blair Underwood got to do the voices in the cartoon.",1167177600,2,638,4.543859649122807
2217683,5,B0007LFPJS,The animation is pretty nice.  If you like comic books you'll love this story about a high school kid and his father who go around doing good.  This is a nice treatment of good versus evil.  I do not want to give too much info but I will say that the cast is great and the story is well done.,1108512000,6,292,3.8333333333333335

8048217,5,B0007LFPJS,"This is a great film for all children. It's very entertaining and promotes father-son/family unity, building confidence, creative thinking, and dealing with adversity. The humor quotient and animation quality is high.",1440892800,2,217,6.032258064516129
8048218,3,B0007LFPJS,This video is just OK for me. The characters can seem a bit over the top at times. The storyline is cute but I found some of the language to be a bit mean for my young children. This may work better for them when they are 8 or 9 years old.,1413244800,2,239,3.6153846153846154
8048219,5,B0007LFPJS,"I was compelled to find some 'ethnic' superheroes after my 5 year old son started demonstrating some identity issues (and not so ironically, during black history month).  The Golden Blaze was well received by my two kids, and immediately became my 5 year old son's favorite movie and superhero.  I have even grown to appreciate the low-tech animation.  I think that makes it easier for them to 'suspend their disbelief' since it's not as real looking as modern kid movies.  Reminds me of the caliber cartoon I grew up watching.",1399852800,5,527,4.822222222222222
8048220,4,B0007LFPJS,"Really enjoyed the movie and the diversity of characters. The dad was kind of quirky and it had a sub-plot related to big business interests and greed. Moreover, both my 2 year old and 10 year old equally enjoyed it.",1247184000,,216,4.425
