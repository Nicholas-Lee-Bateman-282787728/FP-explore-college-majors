8038160,5,B000646M1Q,"Visually stunning, sweet, understated tale of under prepared young explorer sent to the Arctic region to observe wolves.

With very little dialogue, just some gentle voice over, we trace his path with humor, tension, and sadness.  Even the ending is surprisingly quiet and gentle for a Hollywood film.  An honest portrait of the complexities of venturing beyond our limits.

Sadly there's never been a home video release that really captures how beautifully shot this film is.  The DVD is OK at best, but made from a beat up print.  This cries out for a blu-ray re-mastering, as Criterion did recently or Carroll Ballard's other nature based masterwork, ""The Black Stallion"". (If you liked that film, you should give this one a try).",1446940800,,733,4.967213114754099
