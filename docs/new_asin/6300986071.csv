303671,4,6300986071,"Okay, it's definitely a B-movie, it's derivative, and some of the special effects are cheesy.  However, the story is quite literate -- it was adapted from a great novella.  The sets, especially the lounge, are very cool.  The  characters (though two-dimensional) are well-played by some good character  actors.  Most importantly, the atmosphere is spooky.  The creepiest parts  come near the end of the film, as the surviving crew members head back into  the dark, silent, malevolent spaceship, which has no gravity or life  support.  Not a perfect movie, but interesting and enjoyable.",945648000,15,586,5.260869565217392

glad to find it again, and it's RR Martin, so almost everyone dies too,",1377388800,2,323,4.126984126984127
7808786,4,6300986071,"I bought a Nightflyers custom DVD at a horror convention in Cherry Hills, NJ just recently as well as 9 other horror films that were never released on DVD which are To All A Goodnight, Moon in Scorpio, Slaughterhouse Rock, The Lift, The Keep, Beaks:The Movie, Moontrap, Ghost Town, and one other one I can't think of now. I watched this in a triple feature in a row with Moon in Scorpio and The Lift and this one was the best. Nightflyers is a little slow but it has nice visual effects and is one of those films that makes you think they don't make them like this anymore. The actors do a solid job, I only recognized two them who are Catherine Mary Stewart( Night of the Comet) and James Avery(Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel Air). I am 22 years old and I always prefer 80's low budget horror films than any of today's films. I love low budget horror films and I am so glad I picked this up at the convention. The film as of today gets a 3.5 on IMDB which I think is way too low.

I really was surprised by the film, but the movie is not everybody's cup of tea, you have to love low budget horror films to really enjoy this one as well as being a space horror film fan as myself. I liked the characters but the dialogue could be bad every now and then but if you watch so much low budget films as I did you won't mind it. One really sad thing is that Nightflyers never received an official region 1 DVD release and since VHS is outdated it is pretty hard to see.

Overall: A Slow but Fun Low Budget Space Horror Film with Good Special Effects, Only Enjoyable for Low Budget Horror Fans.",1363219200,3,1592,4.132258064516129
7808787,5,6300986071,"The five stars is for the movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed, being a Catherine Mary Stewart fan. However, the product on this Avid Entertainment tape was really bad. I bought a new factory-sealed Avid tape and it gave my VCR (which can play just about anything) a bad time from the start. It kept losing tracking, jumping all over the screen, had audio quirks and dropouts, and frequent static/hash. These problems improved a bit later in the tape, but there was never very good quality. I gave up and finally bought a used copy from another listing on Amazon (the Artisan Entertainment listing) that was much better.

It's interesting that this 88 minute Avid tape filled less than half of the visible plastic reel in the cassette, while the 88 minute Artisan reel was full. I suspect that it's because the Avid tape was recorded at the lowest possible speed/quality, while the Artisan tape used a higher speed and hence quality.",1271462400,6,930,4.77639751552795
7808788,5,6300986071,"I have always loved this movie!  It's cheesy and campy, but compelling at the same time.  It's one of my favorite cult sci-fi movies ever.  I just wish I could get this on DVD, because I'm really wearing out my tape.  I never really liked Catherine Mary Stewart as an actress, but she did a passable job here.  And I do very much like Michael Praed as the holographic captain.  This movie has lots of hokey effects and inane dialogue as another reviewer mentioned, but the story captures my attention and I'm never bored with it.",1251504000,2,529,4.458333333333333
7808789,3,6300986071,"I had forgotten the name of this film but I never forgot it after I saw it very late at night (or rather early in the morning) on the Sci-Fi Channel. I knew the movie that I was watching had some major, major faults. Mostly bad effects, some inane dialogue, etc. (I remember thinking that it should have been filmed with no dialogue with the atmospheric music amped up.) But I found the actors very engaging and the plot quite intriguing. I was definitely thinking about it for a long time after I had seen it, even though I kept tellling myself ""it wasn't that good"". Movies that leave me with this reaction tend to be the ones I revisit again and again. This wouldn't be the first time I've been accused of liking a ""bad"" movie, but luckily I've learned not to go on critic's or other people's opinions or I would have missed out on some little gems. I've just run across this movie again when I was looking up information on IMDB.com about the series ""Robin of Sherwood"" with Michael Praed. I had watched this series in my youth and was thinking of buying it on DVD. Then I saw ""Nightflyers"" on his resume and the lightbulb went off. I am actually going to go to try to hook up my old VHS again, just so I can watch this movie. If you like sci-fi, give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.
(Didn't know it was based on a novella, though it does make sense. I'm going to buy it soon and can't wait to read it.)",1208390400,3,1420,4.224264705882353
7808790,5,6300986071,"This flick represents the best of 80's Sci-Fi camp and B-movie quality.  Plot goes in many directions and has a likeable ensemble cast.  The real reason to like this flick is, of course, Catherine Mary Stewart.  She could have easily usurped Sigourney Weaver as ""Strong Woman of 80's Sci-Fi"" with a couple better breaks, but alas it wasn't meant to be.  She steals every scene she's in with smooth confidence and smarts.

Sad this little gem hasn't gotten a DVD release, but with ""Night Of The Comet"" now getting a DVD treatment, maybe there's hope!",1170547200,8,549,4.7368421052631575
7808791,3,6300986071,"I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi/Horror movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.

All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,5,380,4.463768115942029
