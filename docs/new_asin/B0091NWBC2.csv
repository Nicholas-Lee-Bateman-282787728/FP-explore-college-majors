5242384,5,B0091NWBC2,"First I want to start by saying that I LOVE the Pixar animated short films.  I look forward to them every time I go see a new Pixar feature.  Anyway, lately the Pixar short films have been shown in 3D if you go see their feature film in 3D.  I'm wondering if Pixar will offer this version with a 3D option as well.  I'd love to have a copy of their most recent short films in 3D like they were shown in the theaters.  Does anyone have any information on this?",1346889600,16,459,4.0

5242386,1,B0091NWBC2,This review is for the item I actually received.  This item contains no code in it so there are no DisneyMovieRewards and no digital version that has come with all of the 75+ other Disney titles I own.  I can guarantee this will be the least watched program I have other purchased from Disney since it will mean digging through boxes to find the actual disc each time.  A disappointment.,1510704000,,387,4.5

I wish I could say the same for this. Of course, it has some great entries: BURN-E, Presto, and Day & Night really stand out, with La Luna and Air Mater coming close. I enjoyed some of the extras, too. The first volume set a high standard, though - one that not even the same creative team could be expected to meet.

5242410,5,B0091NWBC2,"Got these on a great Amazon sale for $2.99 in HD, absolutely no complaints... except that I missed the sale on volume one the following day.  For the price it was definitely worth it.  Being shorts it's good to watch when you need something you could walk away from easily since it has multiple points where you can reach an end point and stop it.  At least half of these shorts are actually included on other Disney movies as extras so if you already have them elsewhere you may not find this as good a buy at it's regular price.  Though I have many of these as extras on my other digital copies of Disney movies it is kind of nice to have them all in one place.

Shorts that are definitely on other digital releases include:
Mater's Tall Tales: Air Mater (Oct. 2011) - Comes with 'Cars 2'
Day & Night (2010) - Comes with 'Toy Story 3'
George & A.J. (2009) - Comes with 'UP'
Toy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation (2011) - Comes with 'Cars 2' and 'Toy Story of Terror'

5242411,5,B0091NWBC2,"In 2012, volume 1 of the Pixar Shorts collection wasn't alone anymore, with the release of volume 2, containing 12 shorts released from 2007 to 2012! Whether it's on DVD or Blu-ray, you'll get another bang out of volume 2, from Your Friend the Rat & Presto to Time Travel Mater & La Luna! The first 2 Toy Story Toons are in here, along with the last 2 of Mater's Tall Tales, and all 12 shorts contain audio commentaries by the gurus behind them! Sadly, there's no play all option on either format, Heaven knows why! Luckily, the DVD is FastPlay-enhanced, so you can see all 12 shorts at once, plus commercials of course. The other bonuses on here are a bunch of student films by some of the masterminds at Pixar, with introductions by said masterminds! I hope there's a volume 3 shorts collection DVD & Blu-ray coming soon; ranging from Partysaurus Rex & The Legend of Mor'du to Piper & Lou, or further on! Luckily, volumes 1 & 2 should definitely tide us over till then! What's more, this is my 200th review on Amazon, so that should be something to be excited about now!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Disney and PIXAR are known for their amazing storytelling, and their second batch of shorts with this PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 2 is no exception. These animated shorts are so fantastic, the only problem that you might have trouble picking out your favourite. If you are interested in watching the PIXAR short films released since 2007 without having to put on about 10 different Blu-ray discs, then you are in luck, as this PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 2 is the ultimate second collection for all you enthusiastic aficionados of PIXARs brilliant animation short films and that also includes me.

In 2007, PIXAR put together a collection of all of its short films to that point. The collection showed off the development of the computer animated art form and was stocked with good storytelling and the joy of the old Looney Toons and Disney shorts. Its been five years and Pixar is still pumping out the shorts, so its time for Volume 2, which covers the 12 animated film shorts released between 2007 and 2012. Experience the revolutionary animation and unforgettable characters with 12 short films together for the very first time. This must-own collection also features seven rarely screened student films from directors John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter. The animation is totally and some of the stories are equally wonderful, but the output is also totally awesome. This is now a great chance to see even more thought provoking animation from very inventive PIXAR animation people who have produced the following amazing new PIXAR animated shorts on one this Volume 2 Blu-ray disc.

Your Friend the Rat [2007] The short starts in with Remy introducing himself and Emile to the audience and speaking on behalf of oppressed rats everywhere. Emile starts frowning about having to speak out, while Remy pulls a scroll and a two-dimensional animation starts by presenting the relation between a human and a rat in contrast with human-dog and human-cat relationships. Remy points out that humans regarded rats in former times as sacred and luck-bringing. He says that during the Roman Empire if a white rat crosses your path, it brought good luck, while if a black rat crosses your path, it brought bad luck and moves on to discussing black rats Rattus Rattus and their connection to the Black Death, pointing out that it was caused by fleas not rats, resulting in the death of one third of Europe's population, and says that royal rat catcher Jack Black was a rat catcher for Queen Victoria and that he kept the rats he captured as pets. Their use for laboratory testing and as pets shows that they can have a good relationship with humans. Concluding the presentation Emile and Remy sing a song about the relationship between rats and humans. At the film's end, a long and drawn-out (mostly satirical) disclaimer is shown asking children to stay away from rats, while Remy and Emile stand in front of it and try to remove it, urging the audience to ignore the warning and complaining about freedom of speech and lack of food, respectively. Audio Commentary with Director Jim Capobianco and Production Designer Nate Wragg. Running Time: 11:14

Presto [2008] Vaudeville-era magician Presto DiGiotagione is famous for a hat trick wherein he pulls his rabbit Alec Azam out of his top hat. An unfed and irritated Alec is locked in a cage, unable to reach his carrot. After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec, so that when Presto reaches into the top hat, his hand appears out of the wizard's hat, allowing him to grab Alec and pull him out of the top hat. He intends to feed Alec the carrot, but realises that he is late for the show and rushes off to the stage without doing so, much to Alec's anger. Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec becomes reluctant to cooperate until he is given the carrot. Presto then spends the rest of the show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat. Now at his wit's end, Presto storms backstage to catch Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets caught in a rope that lifts him up to the fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery. Alec, remorseful that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses and carrots for Presto and Alec respectively. This is PIXAR short-making at its finest, animation, story, comedy and all. Audio Commentary with Director Doug Sweetland. Running Time: 5:15

BURN-E [2008] The short opens with WALL-E running his hand through the rings of Saturn while hanging on the side of EVE's ship, as shown in the original film. One of the rock particles that swirls away begins to increase in velocity as it moves up against the atmosphere of a Saturnian moon, becoming a meteorite that destroys a small lamp spire outside the Axiom. AUTO sees this and activates SUPPLY-R, a storage robot that dispenses spare lamps. He then dispatches BURN-E, a repair robot, to replace the broken lamp. Before he can secure the new lamp, EVE's ship enters the Axiom's docking bay. Still hanging on the side of the ship, WALL-E waves to greet him, but as BURN-E is distracted the loose lamp floats into space. BURN-E returns to SUPPLY-R to turn on the newly installed lamp. At this point, the Axiom's captain and autopilot AUTO get into a fight and the ship is tilted, throwing BURN-E outside again. The Captain disables AUTO and realigns the ship, but as BURN-E prepares to go back inside, the ship blasts into hyperspace and pins BURN-E to the side of the hull. The Axiom lands on Earth and BURN-E re-enters to find the ship deserted. BURN-E spots SUPPLY-R through the window of an escape pod and waves to him. In a post-credits scene, SUPPLY-R consoles him by patting BURN-E on the head and saying, ""There, there,"" in a dull, monotone voice. Audio Commentary with Director Angus MacLane. Running Time: 7:35

Partly Cloudy [2009] All day long, cheerful clouds in the sky make cute and cuddly babies, such as human boys and girls, kittens, puppies, and other creatures, and give them to storks for delivery to the expectant parents. However, one lonely grey cloud named Gus has the task of creating animals that are cute but not so cuddly. His delivery stork, Peck, gets the worst of it, being bitten by a crocodile, butted by a bighorn sheep, and pricked by a porcupine. When Peck sees that his next delivery is a baby shark, he grows more than a little fearful and flies away. Feeling rejected, despondent, and angry, Gus unleashes a brief thunderstorm, and then starts crying with rain pouring from below him. Peck, however, soon returns with a football helmet and shoulder pads, created for him by another cloud to keep him safe (alluded to in an earlier scene, where the same cloud creates a baby that would grow to love football). Gus instantly cheers up and gives Peck an electric eel to deliver, which shocks him despite the protective equipment; this time, though, Peck remains in good (but slightly frazzled) spirits. Audio Commentary with Director Peter Sohn. Running Time: 5:46

Dug's Special Mission [2009] It is Dug's birthday. This ordinary Golden Retriever wishes that it will be the happiest day of his life, when suddenly, Kevin runs over him and the pack leaders Alpha ( Doberman Pinscher), Beta (Rottweiler) and Gamma (Bulldog) run into Dug. Irritated with Dug for getting in their way, they come up with ""special missions"" for Dug to help capture the bird. However, these are just ploys to keep Dug out of their way. Dug is then assigned to sit on a rock; when he jumps onto the rock, following Alpha's orders, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and the rock they're standing on all start to fall. Numerous scenes follow of Alpha, Beta and Gamma getting caught or captured by traps intended for Kevin, due to actions of Dug as a result of commands given to him by Alpha. Dug runs off into a mist-laden rocky area. He sees a rock that resembles a turtle, followed by one that looks like a man. When he hears a voice saying ""I see you back there"", he asks if the man is okay. Dug then realizes that he has received his birthday wish: a new master [Carl Fredricksen]. The clouds clear, the sun comes out and Dug sits proudly on a flat rock. From here the short comes full circle as it reflects the point when Dug is introduced in the film; Russell notices him and briefly thinks Dug is a rock. After the credits are rolled Dug says ""Hi there!"" to Carl and Russell; the film ends with Carl and Russell gasping in shock. Audio Commentary with Director Ronnie del Carmen and Supervising Technical Director Brad Winemiller. Running Time: 4:42

George & A.J. [2009] This animation short starts out with a scene from UP where the two nurses, George and A.J., from Shady Oaks Retirement Village knock on Carl's door to escort him to the nursing home. As seen in the film, Carl instead takes off in his house. George and A.J. stare dumbfounded at the sky while their van's alarm goes off and it had been bumped by Carl's house. Finally, George and A.J. arrive back at the Shady Oaks Retirement Village, only to find an old man outside the door who yells, ""So long, suckers!"" and hits his cane against one of many canisters attached to the outside of the building; the other canisters soon follow and spew out a powerful gas. After the man goes inside, the entire building launches into the sky. Still dumbstruck, George and A.J. stare up. A few canisters fall down, and one lands on their van, setting off its alarm again. Suddenly, from behind them, a giant blimp starts to descend. It turns out to be Charles F. Muntz's Spirit of Adventure dirigible, and Carl is flying it, with Russell next to him. The airship lands on top of the van, effectively stopping its alarm and Carl and Russell climb out. George incredulously says, ""Mr. Fredricksen?"" They walk past the nurses, and Russell says that next time he'd like to steer. A.J. turns to George and says, ""That was the craziest thing I've ever seen!"" They look down to find Dug in front of them. Dug says, ""Hi there!"" through his collar, and George and A.J. are even more shocked than before. Audio Commentary with Director Josh Cooley. Running Time: 3:58

Day & Night [2010] Day & Night follows two characters, Day and Night. Inside Day is a day scene with a sun in the centre, and inside Night is a night scene with a moon in the centre. Whatever goes on inside of Day or Night expresses normal events that typically occur within a day or night, respectively, and these events often correspond with actions or emotions or actions that Day or Night express. For example, when Day is happy he will have a rainbow inside him, and when Night is happy he will have fireworks inside him. Day and Night meet and at first are uneasy about each other. At the end of the film, the Sun descends in Day and rises in Night, so that when the Sun is at the same height above the horizon in both, both characters appear to be identical. As the Sun continues its course, Day becomes Night, and Night becomes Day. Audio Commentary with Director Teddy Newton and Layout Artist Sandra Karpman. Running Time: 6:00

Hawaiian Vacation [2011] It is winter time, and winter break for Bonnie, who is going on vacation to Hawaii with her mother for a week. The toys are excited to have a week of relaxation, but Barbie and Ken reveal themselves to have stowed away in Bonnie's backpack, hoping to join her in Hawaii. Bonnie leaves them in her room, however, much to Ken's horror when he realises they are not going to Hawaii. Barbie reveals to Woody that Ken planned to have their first kiss on a beach at sunset, based off of a travel brochure for Hawaii, inspiring Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Bonnie's toys to go all out and recreate Hawaii for the two. After various ""adventures"" in Hawaii, Ken and Barbie share their first kiss in the snow at sunrise, recreating the scene from the brochure. However, the two end up being buried in snow when they step off the front porch, prompting the toys to come to their rescue by digging them out and releasing them from a block of ice. Audio Commentary with Director Gary Rydstrom, Story Supervisor Jason Katz and Supervising Animator Angus MacLane. Running Time: 5:52

Air Mater [2011] Outside Luigi's Casa Della Tires, Guido is spinning around with his forks spread out because Mater is teaching him how to fly. A sceptical Lightning McQueen asks Mater what he knows about flying, and Mater replies, ""Everything."" Mater then proceeds to tell the story. Mater tows a car to prop wash Junction, a town inhabited by friendly planes who greet him. As he drops off the car at a repair station, Mater watches a group of jets, the Falcon Hawks, in amazement. He is asked by one of the Falcon Hawks if he's going to the air show tomorrow, and he accepts. Then, he sees Skipper's Flight School and reads the sign, ""We can teach anyone how to fly guaranteed!"" McQueen, listening to the story, asks Mater, ""What did you do?"" Mater replies, ""Oh, you remember, Lightning McQueen Hawk!"" McQueen insists that the whole thing never happened, and Mater says, ""It did, too."" At that moment, Mater gets a call from the Falcon Hawk leader and is told that he is needed to take place for one of the Falcon Hawks. He throws his hook up and is caught by the rope being held by the Falcon Hawks. Audio Commentary with Director Rob Gibbs, Producer Kim Adams and Production Designer Bob Pauley. Running Time: 5:10

Small Fry [2011] At a fast food chicken restaurant called ""Poultry Palace,"" Bonnie does not want the electronic Zurg belt buckle that comes with her kid's meal. When she asks for a mini-Buzz Lightyear themed toy, she is told the restaurant's supplies of them have run out. When her mother asks about the one in the display case, she is told that it is for display only. Inside the display, Mini-Buzz Lightyear complains they will never be played with, as they are just the display toys, to Mini-Zurg, who prefers to stay. Bonnie goes on to play in the ball pit with her own toys; when no one is looking, Mini-Buzz secretly climbs in. He pulls the real Buzz Lightyear underneath the balls so that Bonnie's mother ends up picking up Mini-Buzz Lightyear when they leave the restaurant. Once Mini-Buzz Lightyear gets home, he passes himself off as the real Buzz Lightyear, explaining to the other toys that the plastic in the ball pit made him shrink, and proceeds to generally annoy the whole gang, save a gullible Rex with his obvious ruse and his antics. Back at Bonnie's house, the gang restrains Mini-Buzz Lightyear and forces him to give up the real Buzz Lightyear's whereabouts. They begin devising a rescue plan when the real Buzz Lightyear returns. Mini-Buzz Lightyear is brought into the support group mentioning about what he has done with Buzz Lightyear now volunteering as his sponsor. In a post-credits scene, Mini-Zurg is left with the electronic belt buckle as his sole companion much to his delight. Audio Commentary with Director Angus MacLane. Running Time: 7:04

Time Travel Mater [2012] Lightning McQueen and Mater were in front of the Courthouse when Lizzie drives by. She says good morning to Lightning and Mater in a rude way, but she says it in a nice way to the statue of Stanley. Lightning McQueen asks Mater how Lizzie and Stanley met. Mater replies by telling one of his stories, which ""all started last week."" The story starts with him putting up a new town sign with a clock on it. The sign falls on Mater, and the clock ends up on his ""nose."" Mater sneezes, and then disappears. He ends up inside the Tail Light Caverns. He exits the caverns to go tell everyone back in town. However, when he does, he can't find the town, but he does see a car at a nearby spring. When Mater gets closer to the car, he discovers that it's Stanley! Stanley asks Mater if he needs a radiator cap. When Mater says no, Stanley leaves to go to California in search of customers. Mater realises that if Stanley didn't stay, there wouldn't be a Radiator Springs in the future! Mater and McQueen then travel to 1927. Stanley shows them the town. Then, Stanley takes note of a Model T, which turns out to be Lizzie that arrives in town. Lizzie breaks down, so Mater helps her out. Lizzie sees McQueen and appears to be falling in love with him, and Mater realizes that if Lizzie falls in love with McQueen, then she won't fall in love with Stanley. They reappear in Radiator Springs at the time that Lizzie and Stanley get married. After getting married, they went honeymooning at Comfy Caverns. Then, Mater and McQueen leave, and Mater finishes his story. McQueen says that there's no such thing as time travel, but then Lizzie comes and thanks McQueen for introducing her and Stanley. Mater says, ""And that's how you make history."" Audio Commentary with Director Rob Gibbs, Editor Torbin Xan Bullock and Production Designer Anthony Christov. Running Time: 6:22

La Luna [2011] A young boy, Bambino, goes on a midnight sailing trip with his father Pap and grandfather Nonno. After they anchor their boat in the middle of the sea, Nonno presents Bambino with a cap similar to the ones he and Pap wear. The two men disagree on how Bambino should wear it, with Pap pulling it low over his eyes and Nonno pushing it back on his head. Pap sets up a long ladder for Bambino to climb so he can set an anchor on the full moon, and the three ascend to start their work of sweeping fallen stars off the lunar surface. Pap urges Bambino to use a push broom on the stars, while Nonno favours a besom broom. As they quarrel, a huge star crashes down on the moon; it is far too large for any of them to move by themselves. Turning his cap backwards, the way he wants to wear it, Bambino climbs onto the star and taps it with a hammer. It bursts apart into hundreds of smaller stars, and all three go to work sweeping them to one side, with Bambino choosing a rake instead of either man's broom. Once the job is done, they climb back down into their boat and look up at the moon, which now displays a glowing crescent phase thanks to their efforts. Audio Commentary with Director Enrico Casarosa and Producer Kevin Reher. Running Time: 6:56

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again PIXAR and Walt Disney Studios brings you this brilliant Volume 2 Blu-ray disc with a stunning 1080p encoded image transfer, where the colours are gorgeous, primaries pop beautifully, black levels are deep and inky, and contrast is vivid and consistent. It only helps that every last detail is present and accounted for, with razor sharp edges, perfectly resolved fine textures, and no noise or macro blocking to be found. And unlike the PIXAR Volume 1, all of the featured animated film shorts in this PIXAR Volume 2 are free of inherent anomalies, meaning there aren't any eyesores to overlook or contend with. PIXAR fans will be  delighted with the stunning vibrant video presentation all around.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  PIXAR and Walt Disney Studios brings you this brilliant Volume 2 Blu-ray disc with a selection of different English audio presentation that includes 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio, 7.1 Dolby TrueHD, 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, and English: 2.0 Audio Described. Dialogue is very clear and well-prioritised, effects are bright and playful, and music is nice and full. The lossless and high resolution tracks tend to offer more authoritative audio output, enveloping rear speaker activity and more impressive dynamics, but the sound mixes are no slouch. Audio quality varies as the mixes and variation of audio codecs vary across each short. Generally, each short has a really good balance of sound with a typically engulfing and aggressive use of channels, so making the sounds just that little bit fantastic as the PIXAR feature film materials we all know and love.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentaries: With another presentation of PIXARs professional outlook, we once again have more brilliant commentaries from twelve people involved with this PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 2 short animated films with this particular Blu-ray disc. Each of the commentators provides background info on the story, animated and voice cast, and the significance milestones established by each short animated film. But again with each animated short we are blessed once again with a very engaging commentary track that allows the individual filmmakers and project teams to discuss their work in great detail. Fans of these particular animated shorts should enjoy the audio commentary tracks and with each animated short commentary, it varies in quality of information, but overall it is still fairly interesting.

Special Feature: PIXAR Directors Student Films [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1 / 1.37:1] Here is early pre-PIXAR work by three of PIXARs animators. Each of the directors gives a little introduction regarding their shorts, each of which has been restored in high-definition. One can kind of see each of the directors trademarks that would shape the films theyd direct in the future. For example, John Lasseters student films deal with inanimate objects with personality, which he would parlay into the shorts like  Luxo Jr, and later on in animation films like Toy Story  and Cars. Also with each directors introduction to each animation, is where they talk about what they were trying to accomplish with each one and they are as follows:

01. Nitemare [1979] [1080p] [1.37:1] A child, who is afraid, of the dark forms a unique relationship with the objects that once frightened him [5:18]. Play with Introduction by Director John Lasseter [1:54].

02. Lady and the Lamp [1979] [1080p] [1.37:1] A lamp causes a ruckus in the shop while the shopkeeper is away [4:24]. Play with Introduction by Director John Lasseter [1:35].

03. Somewhere in the Arctic [1986] [1080p] [1.37:1] The story of a polar bear and several Eskimos chasing after each other. This first short film by student Andrew Stanton was produced while studying at California Institute of the Arts done [3:48]. Play with Introduction by Andrew Stanton [1:47].

04. A Story [1987] [1080p] [1.37:1] A young boy named Melvin and a purple television dinosaur named Ted have happy adventures that lead them into the clutches of Randy the Killer Clown and his Goon Squad [4:33]. Play with Introduction by Andrew Stanton [2:14].

05. Winter [1988] [1080p] [1.37:1] A young child attempts to enjoy the first snow of the season [1:38]. Play with Introduction by Andrew Stanton [1:49].

06. Palm Springs [1989] [1080p] [1.37:1] A dinosaur is all wanted to have fun, so he finds a way to do it. But a caveman who is jealous of his invention and trys to stop them from playing [1:55]. Play with Introduction by Andrew Stanton [1:25].

07. Next Door [1990] [1080p] [1.37:1] An old square-headed man tries to watch TV while a little girl makes a playful ruckus outside [3:22]. Play with Introduction by Andrew Stanton [3:03].

Finally, this again is a beautiful collection of PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 2 animations, but there is a chance you might own some of them if you already own the other PIXAR animation film releases. But in my opinion one of the best things that PIXAR studios do is to include a short subject before each of its theatrical releases. I think it takes us older viewers back to the fun times of going to the cinema, when you got a cartoon or two before the film started and PIXAR animated short films are never a disappointment because of the animators are true professionals and also very inventive, as well as always visually stunning. If you already have PIXAR animation films on Blu-ray then the commentaries and student films are well worth having with these extras on this Blu-ray disc. This is a really impressive must-have Blu-ray, and if you would rather watch these PIXAR short animated films in one easy package and I very much like the idea of all the commentaries, then this is a definite must have in your PIXAR Blu-ray Collection and if you are a fan of PIXARSs work and don't already own any animated short films on other releases, then this is an easy Blu-ray to cherish for years to come. Highly Recommended!

5242445,5,B0091NWBC2,Great short films at a good price. My daughter and I enjoy watching these.,1464220800,,74,4.357142857142857
5242446,5,B0091NWBC2,"The bonus features include five student films from the main boys' (Lasseter, Stanton, Docter) days at Cal Arts.  It's good stuff, and I think Lasseter's ""Nitemare"" and the very last one by Pete Docter (the title escapes me) are actually worth watching every time this disc is put in.  Though limited in production value, they are as artful and good as the slick stuff.

But the one by Stanton called ""A Story,"" in addition to including the word ""pissed,"" is dark and subversive.  Kinda fun for adult fans of Pixar, of which I am a huge one, but could be pretty jarring for the kiddies.  More for the theme than the mild cuss.

This is a good collection.  Inferior to Volume One, but still essential for fans because of Presto, Partly Cloudy, and La Luna.  I would add BURN-E to that list, though it is a feature-related short.  Others would add Day & Night and Your Friend the Rat, though I would not.  In any case, it comes down to whether or not you think having these shorts together on a disc is worth the money.  To me, it is.

The lack of a Play All feature on the blu-ray is a head-scratcher.  Dunno what they were thinking.  I'm not subtracting a star for it, or for any other shortcoming, but this is because Pixar is basically my favorite thing ever.  The disc could probably be stupid in a hundred ways and, as long as it delivered the goods, five stars from me.",1461888000,,1373,4.371541501976284

I thought most of the shorts in this collection were entertaining, although the Cars shorts were rather boring. I kind of question why the Mater's Tall Tales shorts were included instead of other Pixar material. All of the shorts contain an audio commentary.

5242521,5,B0091NWBC2,"Pixar revived the art of the short theatrical animated release.  Well, it may not really be true, but for many of us it feels that way.  Their habit of putting something fun before their newest releases is something I look forward to as much as their movies themselves.  Couple that with the shorts theyve started doing for DVD special features, and youve got enough material for Pixar Short Films Collection 2 already.

This disc contains twelve shorts.  As far as I am aware, only three are new to DVD while the rest have been previously released.  It may not be a must buy, but for the die hard fan, it is nice to have them all in one place.

Some of these shorts were originally created as bonus features for their DVD releases.  Those are fairly easy to spot since youve got familiar characters in them.  The disc starts with one of these and the longest short as Remy from Ratatouille shares with us why rats are really our friends.  Its pretty funny, although the warning at the end is the best part.  Theres also Dugs Secret Mission which follows everyones favorite dog from Up in the 24 hours before he meets Carl and Russell.

There are also two each of the Cars Toons and Toy Story Toons.  Mater becomes part of a flying squad in Air Mater and he travels back in time to the creation of Radiator Springs in Time Travel Mater.  Meanwhile, the Toy Story gang plans a ""Hawaiian Vacation"" for Ken and Barbie and Buzz meets some forgotten fast food toys when he gets switched out in the ball pit in Small Fry.

Finally comes the non-franchise shorts that ran before features in the theater.  Weve got the likes of Presto about a magician and his rabbit.  Theres also Partly Cloudy which shows us what happens to the stork who has to deliver all the sharp and prickly animals.  Then theres La Luna which shows us three generations of men working together to clean up shooting stars.

There is quite a variety of shorts on the disc, and they are all enjoyable.  Whether they feature familiar characters or new ones, I enjoy watching these, and its nice to have them at my finger tips if I want to watch one in particular.  Yes, I have most of these, but that means having to remember which movie it was on when I want to watch them.

As a bonus feature, the directors of each short have provided an audio commentary, sometimes with the help of another staff member who worked on the short.  These are interesting as we get to see some of the thought processes behind the shorts and technical issues that had to overcome in making it.  The exception is the commentary for ""George and A.J."" which was funny for a bit, but I was hoping to learn more about this one.

The animation geek in me really enjoyed the other bonus feature, the student shorts of John Lassiter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter.  These are hand drawn and rather crude (student shorts, remember with limited budgets and fast production schedule while working on other projects), but they are fun.  My favorites were ""Winter"" and ""A Story.""  Its always nice to see how the story men of today got started.

I mentioned earlier that three of these shorts appear to be showing up on DVD for the first time.  One of these is George and AJ, which tells us what happens to the two men who went to collect Carl at the beginning of Up.  It was originally released for the digital version of the movie only, and I hadnt seen it before.  Its basically storyboards with voices talking (limited animation if any at all), but its pretty funny.  While the Toy Story Toon Small Fry premiered before The Muppets in the theater, it wasn't included on the DVD, so this was my first chance to see that one.  Finally, theres Time Travel Mater.  I really like how this one ties in to the new Carsland at Disneylands California Adventure which makes sense since it premiered on TV the week after that area of the park opened.  A little bit of the Cars Toons goes a long way, but I love this one, so I was thrilled to get it.

The animation on all of these shorts is beautiful.  (Okay, theres the one I just talked about that is storyboards, but its worth viewing for its own reasons anyway.)  You can tell they are using these to push boundaries for the feature films, and the experiments pay off.

The story telling is also very impressive.  While the ones that feature familiar characters do include dialogue (with the original cast members for the most part), the non-franchise shorts don't have any speaking at all.  And yet through just the animation acting, we still get the story and some truly great laughs.

And thats the biggest thing on this disc  the gags are wonderful.  While there are some sweet moments, these are first and foremost intended as comedies, and you will laugh as you watch.

The one flaw for this disc is the lack of a Play All feature.  While I don't need it for me, it would be pain for parents to have to turn on the next short every few minutes if their kids are watching this.

But the main audience for this is probably people like me who are interested in these shorts and learning a bit about what went into them.  For me, Pixar Short Films Collection 2 was great.  Im very pleased to have it as part of my collection.",1434240000,2,5206,4.439873417721519
5242522,4,B0091NWBC2,"I enjoyed this DVD way more than my kids. I think my kids actually preferred the first Pixar compilation. The shorts are much longer than the first Pixar DVD's shorts, but the story lines are much more developed. Obviously this is because these particular shorts are from a much more developed Pixar!

Before watching the DVD, I had only seen a few of the included shorts on YouTube, and they are depicted much better on the DVD. The new ones are just as ingenious and sweet as the ones I was previously familiar with. It comes with a handy menu that lets you browse through the shorts and choose which one to watch.

You can tell they are the creators, but not used to have to tell how they created the story.  If you can get past the comments, and it took a 9-year boy to show me, the short films are very enjoyable. I  particularly enjoyed the one about all the old folks escaping from the old folk's home collectors (film associated with ""Up"").  Didn't enjoy the ""Cars"" short films as much.",1386374400,,498,4.369565217391305

While I do like seeing shorts that relate directly to full length films, this collection was jam-packed with those, which I found disappointing.  Overall, I really enjoyed the completely new story lines of the ""original"" shorts from the first collection better.  However, I'm not sorry I purchased it.",1375228800,,437,5.2

5242627,3,B0091NWBC2,Disney is quickly wrecking Pixar and here's good case in point.  A rather expensive package that is greater in it's parts than it's sum.  They know a couple of these shorts are GREAT and since you can't give them everywhere else you will pony up for this.,1371427200,,255,4.404255319148936

5242641,2,B0091NWBC2,"This purchase was a waste of my money. My opinion is that Pixar put it together just to get something on the market to make a few extra bucks. Collection 2, a second rate video collection didn't even come close to Collection 1.",1363824000,,227,4.3023255813953485

It's great because the short 5-10 min films keep their attention without the demand for a full hour+ movie session.
A good mix of characters and stories that they'll love for years to come.
I hope they come out with a 3rd in this collection. A must have!",1363737600,,317,4.213114754098361

5242648,4,B0091NWBC2,"As far as the short films, it's fantastic!  But as for the play-back, the Blu-ray is disappointing.  There is no function to play all.  The DVD contains the Disney Fast Play option which plays one feature after another.  We stopped using the Blu-ray copy.  Got tired of having to select each film every 5-7 minutes.  Very annoying and extremely disappointing.

I use this for school to practice literary terms and the students just love the small clips although these clips are a bit longer than the first Pixar shorts. Thanks,1362268800,,266,4.235294117647059

5242652,1,B0091NWBC2,I own Pixar Shorts Vol. 1 and value it as an exceptional collection of very unique and special short films. When I saw that Vol. 2 was available I didn't hesitate to order based on the exceptional quality of Vol. 1. That is not the case. It was a terrible disappointment. I'll only keep it to have my library collection complete. Don't try for Vol. 3 unless you can return to the greatness of Vol. 1.,1361836800,,400,4.276315789473684
5242653,1,B0091NWBC2,"We loved Volume 1 so we were really exited to get this.  But I'm tempted to send it right back for two major reasons:

-There's too many repeats of shorts from Vol. 1.  Why would you put the same exact shorts on Vol. 2?!  I counted at least 4 repeats!
-There's no ""Play All"" option as there was with Vol 1 which makes it unwatchable in the car and unlikely for us to watch at home even since we'll have to click play to move on to the next short.

I'm left a bit speechless to the fact that this was produced and put on shelves like this for more than $5!  Get Volume 1 and don't waste your time or money with Vol 2.  Seriously disappointing.",1361404800,5,642,4.0078740157480315

I was not a fan of the price, but the films comprising the DVD were varied and funny and kept me and my kids (4 and 5 years old) thoroughly entertained through multiple viewings.  I see in other reviews that people had to start each short film individually.  I did not have that problem with the DVD as it played all short films by pressing play once.  I would recommend this DVD.",1360627200,2,518,4.089108910891089

5242661,2,B0091NWBC2,I was looking forward to this having enjoyed volume 1. But so much of this appears to be student works by John Lassiter and other. Other things were inspired by Pixas films but not as shorts included before theater released movies.,1360022400,,231,4.658536585365853

That being said there is no ""play all"" feature. So if my kid wants to watch this, I have to help her get to the next feature every 2-3 minutes.  We borrowed this from the library, and have no plans to ever purchase it because of this huge distraction.",1359244800,,497,4.344086021505376

The others are artistic, creative, beautiful, funny or even hilarious. Nevertheless, they are just too short. Also, even they had been quite impactful when my family and I first watched them, we got no interest to do repeated viewing, a rare situation we had with other Pixar movies. Well, that might manifest the importance of an outstanding storyline in the success of most Pixar films.

5242716,5,B0091NWBC2,"By now, everybody knows about the significant influence that the Pixar Animation Studios has had on the Disney Studios. Their ""Toy Story"" and ""Cars"" series, as well as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Wall-E,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and others have been commercial and critical successes, and that is good for all parties involved, including us, the consumers. But, once in a while, when we buy a Pixar/Disney film, the bonus section usually features a Pixar Short, one that doesn't make it to the big screen. So it was a great idea to put all those shorts together and present them in one package, the result being the awesome ""Pixar Short Films Collection,"" and like Volume one, this Second Volume is as just as fabulous.

""Pixar Short Films Collection 2"" includes twelve shorts with different kinds of animation, and many of them feature some of Pixar films' memorable characters. However, I have to say that my favorites were ""Your Friend the Rat,"" in which Remy and Emile (from Ratatouille) tell us about the positive roles of rats in history; ""Presto,"" perhaps the funniest one, where a magician's starving rabbit sabotages his act, because the magician doesn't feed him; ""Partly Cloudy,"" in which a baby-delivering crane gets assigned to deliver the most ferocious babies (porcupines, sharks), and the poor guy can't take it anymore; ""Halloween Special Vacation,"" featuring our friends from ""Toy Story;"" ""Time Travel Mater,"" showcasing Mater, from ""Cars;"" and ""La Luna,"" in which a boy, his father and grandfather do maintenance work in the moon - perhaps the most touching of all.

This fantastic collection of short films is a most for any animation fan. For that matter, it is like buying a whole film, due to its running time. In addition, the bonus material in the Blu-ray and DVD edition includes some short student films by Pixar's crme de la crme, like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, as well as filmmaker commentaries.

5242729,5,B0091NWBC2,"Many of the Pixar principles of creativity have their roots in the concepts of Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and the people in their orbit. One of ways Walt was able to nurture talent, sustain characters, test new ideas and techniques, and generally keep the studio rolling, was to produce short films through the golden age until the '60s with occasional forays into later decades.

Pixar always does this, creating shorts to accompany their features and some of those released by Walt Disney Pictures, some for TV and others as special bonus material for home video releases. This is the second collection in the series and is a must-have for families and animation buffs alike.

For all ages and levels of interest, you get two excellent ""Toy Story Toons"" each of which are impressive considering how many characters they include in such a short time. There are also two ""Cars Toons"" starring Mater the tow truck -- one nodding to a future Pixar ""Planes"" series and another enhancing the back story of Radiator Springs, which ties in with the new Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure Park.

Three shorts present an aspect of their feature films' storylines from another point of view: BURN-E happens during WALL-E and Dug's Special Mission and George & A.J. occur during the course of UP. George & A.J., by the way, has the funniest audio commentary of all twelve -- in which a stentorian announcer relentlessly ""oversells"" the film.

All twelve films have commentaries (thank you!), many of them revealing how personal some of these films are to their creative staff. Partly Cloudy was inspired by the non-English speaking mother of its director (as well as Walt Disney's Dumbo). La Luna captures the  memories of the adults of its director's youth.

Personally, I think La Luna is the most beautiful of the films, with a breathtaking score -- reminiscent of that of Pinocchio -- by the amazing Michael Giacchino. (If only a soundtrack album of all these films was released!!)

Presto boasts the most classic treatment of the films, in that it has the wild humor and frenetic timing of the best Warner, MGM and Disney cartoon shorts. And My Friend, the Rat, which opens the set, is especially delightful for those of us who enjoyed the Disney factual animation/live action films, most directed by Ward Kimball. The design and the music are spot on. These creative people know their material and clearly love it.

Another wondrous extra are seven student films by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter, fun to watch but also fascinating while considering what magnificent futures would lie before these three icons -- and some likely roots of their subsequent films. You can also see how their sense of childlike wonder had not been beaten out of them by ""too cool"" peers or bitter adults.

Says Lasseter, with a chuckle, of his student days: ""I was a bit of a procrastinator. The hardest part of making these films was getting them done, 'cause I would wait way too long to start my project! It's interesting now, having five sons. I go to them, 'I was a procrastinator.  Please don't be a procrastinator in your life!""

And for those who have DVD but not Blu-Ray, you still get the extra films -- and the commentaries on the DVD disc.",1353456000,3,3247,4.81149012567325
5242730,2,B0091NWBC2,"For people who already own all Pixar Blu-rays, this contains very little new material, namely:

- Up short: George & A. J.
- Toy Story short: Small Fry
- Cars shorts: Air Mater, Time Travel Mater
- 7 student films

""Small Fry"" is an absolute hoot, just perfect - while the others are so-so.

Still, such a release would be a nice thing for Pixar completists like me. Emphasis on ""would"".

You see, this collection is not complete at all, because it omits the third Toy Story short, ""Partysaurus Rex"", which was shown in theatres along with the 3D version of ""Finding Nemo"" this summer. Why this short isn't included is just baffling. To top it off, ""Partysaurus Rex"" won't even be on the upcoming ""Finding Nemo"" Blu-ray.

So, two stars. One for this set being incomplete, and another for the brilliance which is ""Small Fry"".",1353456000,4,824,4.616438356164384
5242731,4,B0091NWBC2,"If you like Pixar Shorts and want to watch them all in one place without popping discs in and out this is a great deal.

However, there are two ways this falls short of the first volume:
1)  The first volume had some Pixar stuff that had never been collected along with specials/shorts from the various title discs.  Everything on this disc is found elsewhere.
2)  The first volume had a ""Play All"" option which was great for just popping the disc in and watching.  This volume doesn't seem to have that feature - which means you have to keep selecting the next short to watch.  My kids love watching these and I frequently popped the first disc in while working in the kitchen or on a drive to occupy them - and now this is no longer an option for the second volume.",1353196800,110,767,4.291666666666667
5242732,5,B0091NWBC2,"This is the second collection of Pixar Shorts, but the first one that I've seen. I have to admit that I loved the Toy Story films and ""UP"" was one of my favorites but I've missed ""Cars"" and it's sequel and the others.

The Bluray at hand contains a dozen shorts, clocking in at 75 minutes. Each can be played with, or without, the Directors' commentaries. (So you get about 2  hours of entertainment in the base package). The other bonus is really neat. It's a selection of seven ""Student Films"" from the three top Pixar directors: John Lassiter, Andrew Stanton and Pete Doctor. These were made in the late 1980s and each one (they run about six minutes each) is introduced by the Director. Some are just animated line drawings with sound while others are more fully realized and were shown in the Mike and Ike Animation festival. All were new to me and I found them fascinating and fun.

As to the ""core dozen"", there are both what I'll call ""funny"" and ""serious"" shorts and not all use the CGI method of animation. Two are offshoots of the film ""UP"". The first features Dug, the dog. It's okay. The other ""George & AJ"" shows that the senior, Carl (Ed Asner) in ""Up"" was not the only one who wanted to escape the retirement home. I liked that one.

There are two offshoots of ""Cars"" with the hayseed pickup, Mater, telling ""tall tales"". Clever.

""Toy Story"" has two offshoots too and they are a hoot! ""Hawaiian Vacation"" does a real job on Barbie and Ken (especially Ken) as they try to leave the toy chest for Hawaii. The other ""Small Fry"" takes digs at Fast Food ""meal deal prizes"". Wonder where all those outdated toys from movie tie-ins that failed go? You (and Buzz Lightyear) will find out here.

""Day and Night"" is a wordless piece - as is ""Partly Cloudy"" - and what I'll call the ""serious"" ones. This is a case where you'll get more out of it after you hear the commentary track.

While ""Small Fry"" was close in the ""funniest short in the set"", the hands-down winner is the opener: ""Your Friend The Rat"". Two characters from ""Ratatouille"" present - in about seven minutes - the ""History of the Rat"", just like the old Disney Educational cartoons of the 1950s did. Director Jim Capobianco uses 2-D, hand drawn animation as well as other ""old school"" techniques along with CGI in a short you'll watch a few time just to catch the jokes and clever satire.

As fellow reviewer N. Schoenfeld pointed out in his ""review"" (actually a ""preview"" since he had not yet seen the collection) the Bluray set is pricey, but I'm not reviewing price here. The images are sharp - even on my 30 year-old standard def TV screen - and there is an amazing amount of creativity here. The ""Cars"" and ""Toy Story"" shorts will appeal to small children (but they won't get a lot of the ""inside"" jokes""). They'll probably be bored with the ""serious"" ones and the less flashy ""Student Films"" too. But adults who love great animation will find a lot in this set to enjoy!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5242733,3,B0091NWBC2,"Anyone who has seen Pixar shorts, knows how wonderful they are. The content on this disc is no exception. But this is a product review, so the value of the product as well as the film itself should be taken into account.

Considering this product is the price of a feature film release, and that there are 40 mins of content here, and 50+ mins of content on volume 1, I don't see the value here. It would be better if all shorts up until now were contained on one set, and with a greater amount of special features. (These special features do exist, but unfortunately you have to buy all of Pixar's feature films, along with their shorts, to get them all). I wouldn't be as critical, but Disney is notorious for releasing something, then re-releasing it, followed by a re-re-release a year later.",1349913600,99,796,4.489655172413793
8534372,3,B0091NWBC2,"After having the first release become a favorite for some quick smiles, we ordered this one.  Apparently PIXAR had put all its good stuff on the first (red) disk.

8534373,3,B0091NWBC2,It costs about as much as a feature length Pixar movie but these shorts total runtime is a little over an hour. That's with the titles and end credits too. I would rather just watch these on YouTube.,1525737600,,199,4.2631578947368425
