3775105,5,B001REZM74,"'Marley & Me' is a great adaptation of the novel by Josh Grogan.  It kept all the emotional elements as well as the fun.  Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson had amazing chemistry together in this heartfelt film.  It is more than just a dog movie, surpassing hit dog films such as 'Beethoven,' '101 Dalmations,' and 'Homeward Bound.'  This film concentrates on the family and how a dog affected the lives of this family for both good and bad.  It's a good representation of a young couple and how they evolve as they have children and move on in life.  Along with it, is shows the life cycle of a dog, which is something that rarely gets shown honestly in films.  It shows the good, the bad, and the painfully tragic elements of having a dog.  The end of the film is very true to the book and I'm glad because it is probably the most important part of the story and it's nice to see it portrayed honestly for fans of the book.
Overall, I think viewers will enjoy this film.  Jennifer Aniston is sweet as the supportive wife and Owen Wilson shows how he's much more than playing screwball characters and can be tender and emotional as well.",1235520000,103,1136,4.3971291866028706
3775106,4,B001REZM74,"I really enjoyed this movie...I read the book first and in all fairness if you have not read the book, i recommend doing so- they really left a whole bunch of details out for the movie purposes. It was a cute movie, and I think that alot of pet owners will enjoy it. I do have to say though that at the end, I was sobbing like crazy, and im 20. It just reminded me of when my Siberian Husky Samantha passed away, so I warn that it is a little bit sad, but it does happen in life. Overall, I thought it was a pretty great movie.",1235088000,12,527,3.888888888888889
3775107,5,B001REZM74,"This movie is excellent. I read the book before entering the theater on Christmas Day. I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan so I am usually first in line to see her movies anyway, but I was amazed at how closely the movie followed the book. We have a man and wife, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston who are hopelessly in love. When the husband realizes his wife may soon want kids, he knows he is not ready and instead opts for a dog instead. They are easy enough and it can delay the process of children for a couple years right? They didn't bargain for the trouble that Marley would bring them. They could rarely vacation because they couldn't find someone to dog sit what they called the worlds worst dog. In the end you realize all the hardships that Marley has helped bring them through and helped to bring them closer together, further proving that dogs can be a mans best friend.

Excellent movie, great performances from both main actors, and watch for Eric Dane the comical womanizer that gives his friend advice, from dogs, to women. Definitely worth watching and worth owning.",1235088000,25,1082,4.5487179487179485
3775108,4,B001REZM74,"I'm 19 years old and this movie made me cry like a baby! It's hard because we have a cute little yellow lab just like Marley. His name is Jazzy, and he's like a little brother to me. As I watched this, I thought of Jazz and all of his antics. Marley is so freakin' cute! We had a Samoyed that died two years ago and that's still sad for me, because she was like my little sister. Owen Wilson and sexy Jennifer Aniston did an awesome job. They adopt Marley and have to deal with his crazy misadventures. When Marley gets older, he doesn't seem like the main star. I loved all the trouble Marley got into. I was pretty much hyperventilating when it came to Marley's goodbye. It was extremely harsh to show his on-screen death, because that was not fair to dog lovers. They did take it too far for me. If you love dogs, especially yellow labs, I recommend MARLEY & ME!!!

Cons: PG is too week a rating

the plot

This is the story of a married couple and their adoption of a yellow lab puppy.  The couple, John and Jennifer Grogan, are newly married news paper reporters and they wish to escape the cold Chicago weather by moving their loves to a warmer climate.  When they buy a home in Miami with an extra room, Jennifer starts getting itchy feet to have a baby.  John's buddy Sebastian suggests adopting a puppy to temporarily halt Jen's maternal yearnings. At the breeder's home, they decide on Marley since he has the cheapest price in the litter.

Perhaps the bargain price tag should have been a warning because as it turns out, Marley (named after the reggae artist) is the world's most unruly canine.  His fear of thunderstorms will keep him howling all night and you awake, his untamable demeanor is usually destructive to the house and other properties.  Yet, even more than this, he loved his family, and as the family grew, Marley seemed to pretty much maintain his position as main focus.

When the Grogan's have more children, Jennifer decides to be a stay-at-home mom, and John moves the family up north to Pennsylvania.  The newspaper columns that he had written in Florida about their life and Marley was turned into a family scrapbook and it seemed to serve as a comfortable recollection for the family to reflect on.

the breakdown

I found that the plot was difficult to write here.  It could be because this is a true story, an autobiography written by John Grogan.  To sum up a plot of relatively uneventful happenings inside the life of the Grogan family is hard to do without getting into listing the minute details or even worse - spoilers.  Despite the film lacking a plot and only consisting of an inventory of happenings in the life of the Grogan's and their dog, the movie is marvelous.  The movie's strength is the emotional connection it makes with the viewers.  Although, if you are not a dog lover, Marley & Me may not touch your heart the way it does for the rest of us.

Owen Wilson (You, Me and Dupree,  Night at the Museum) portays the main character John Grogan with his typical amiable guy next store feel that exudes with just about all of his film characters. Wilson is also the narrator, and he's got the ideal voice for narration in my opinion.  Maybe narration is in the cards for him in his later years and he'll emulate Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones in that same way.  Out of all the characters, I enjoyed Owen's scenes with Alan Arkin the most, (The Jerky Boys, The In-Laws) who played Arnie Klein, his editor at the Sun-Sentinal.  Arkin never fails to bring a chuckle to my throat, he is consistantly funny and one of my favorite actors.

Jennifer Aniston plays Jennifer Grogan, who again like Owen Wilson had with his character tends to show the familiar Aniston instead of Grogan, yet much more accessable.  I'm not aware of what Jen Grogan looks like in real life, but Aniston is like a down-to-earth super hot trophy wife.  Even when her character is on one hour of sleep and has a touch of post pardom syndrome, she's still never horrible.  Even after having three babies in this film, she still looks exactly like the very delicious Jennifer Aniston which is sort of like a miracle.  Marley the dog was played by about six or seven dogs I'm guessing which portray the different stages of his long life.  Each dog is cuter than the last, except for the first puppy of course.

I liked the two ideal settings in the film, the first living in Florida in a big house, a big pool and having a short commute to and from work.  Then the northern contrast with the green hills, the snow and the expansive property in Pennsylvania which was equally as appealing as it appears here in the film.

If there is one thing I would change for this film is the rating.  The constant sex talk between Aniston and Wilson should have warranted the PG-13 rating instead of PG.

Marley & Me was funny, very sad and it was easily to relate to this family which my life in no way resembles.  That is except for their problems and their joys.  I think a good messege to come away with from Marley & Me, is that no matter what your stature in life, your location or your situation, it's these common things that bring us the same feelings of sorrow or joy.  The sickness of a loved one, the birth of a baby, or even the feeling of unconditional love that a dog can bring you.  We're all built the same way, to enjoy the same things in life, no matter who we are.

3775151,1,B001REZM74,"Review of Marley & Me
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

I know you're going to want to see this movie. Owen Wilsoncutie pie, Jennifer AnistonAmericas sweetheart, and a dog. Of course you're going to want to see it!

Dont. Especially if you love dogs. The true story of an extremely selfish man whose bond with his dog exceeds his relationship with his wife. If it wasn't a true story, I would have faulted the screenwriter for writing such a one-dimensional typical male character, but since this person actually existed, I can only imagine how frustrated he must have been with his screen representation. Either that, or it was a realistic characterization and he didn't notice what a terrible person the world now knows he is.

The me of Marley & Me aside, you still shouldnt see this movie if you're a dog or animal lover. I know I make it my policy to never give away spoilers, so hopefully I won't have to and youll heed my warning. The preview of the movie will show lots of gags with the dog and some one-liners from Owen Wilson, but actually, this is a total tearjerker. If youve ever had a pet in your life, you will bawl. If you really want to put yourself through that, go ahead. I wouldnt go so far as to say I wish I hadnt seen it, but Ill remember the sadness for many years to come.",1497225600,,1294,4.338842975206612

3775157,2,B001REZM74,"If you enjoy watching a totally undisciplined dog tear up literally everything in his path and find it endearing and cute, then this film is for you.  Marley destroys a half dozen or more living rooms (which magically are completely restored in the next scene) with little more than a passive whimper from his ""owners""(?).  I can't help but wonder how funny viewers would find these ""hilarious"" antics if it were, in reality, their couches that were shredded. He defies the professional trainer and is banned from the course.  He poops in the ocean at one of the few ""dog beaches""' allowed in Florida, because Wilson decides against all the rules to allow him off his leash (so he can be ""free"" even though there isn't a single episode in the film where he would be considered ""restrained""), thus ruining the exception granted to all the other rule-abiding dog owners whose dogs are leashed.  And on and on and on ... one rib-tickling chaotic destruction after another.  But his family just find him so adorable and his eventual death so devastating, one has to wonder what exactly are the values being portrayed here.  The perfect, loving, mutually supporting, sexy parents with careers ascendent and the perfectly behaved children vs. uncontrolled canine terror?  I see a lot of the opposite out there, but I guess this is a weird exception.  This film is some new form of warped ur-reversed comedy.  It's ""funny"" in a frightening sort of way (like when the last standing timber in a torched houses falls over and cracks open a water pipe).  Somehow, unspoiled, likable kids are raised by permissive parents, but the dog reigns havoc continuously without repercussions. Personally, I am more and more grateful that my pets know and respond to the command ""NO!"". They remain just as precious and integral to our family as stoked up Marley. Just be glad that it is not happening to you.  Marley is not just a seductively attractive bad boy type; he is a daily menace.

3775166,5,B001REZM74,"Marley and Me movie review
Have you ever gotten something only as a temporary fix but after a while you become attached. In the movie, Marley and mea comedy, drama, family film released Dec, 25,2008 directed by Daniel Frankel is a story of how a couple in efforts to start their life together buy a puppy to prepare for a family. Which over the course of time Marley changes them for the rest of their lives as they develop into the people they never thought they be.
  John and jenne from the day they got married always have had a plan. Their plan to create the perfect life had multiple steps in which they put into action. First on the list was to find John a job so Their family would have a stable financial base. Next came finding a house one big enough to raise a family but cheap enough to keep money in their pocket. Both John and Jenne are writer John seeking to be a reporter and Jenne a Problem analysis. As john struggle at work due to lack of work exploitation Jenne is thriving securing over a page of the paper everyday. Further along the lines they revisit their check list in which Jeanne is considering starting their family. John nervous ask his friend for advice in which he decides a puppy will work as a great test run. They arrive on the farm where they choose the soon to be Marley as their choice who is on clearance for who knows why. They take home the clearance puppy things seem to be looking up. As soon follows they realize Marley is a handful. Marley causes trouble day after day claiming the title the worst dog ever as along the lines john begins to write about all of his jenne and marley's adventure. As they finally have their first newborn marley watches over them like his own. They go on to have three children. Soon after tragedy strikes the family as they come to realize the value of each other and the impact one life can have.+
 Overall this movie was a great inspiring film. It gives the audience the thrill of growing with marley and the family. Teaching the valuable lesson the one life can make a difference. That if you give your all with a dog your will receive it right back. All marley asked for was love as Jenne and John showered him with it he loved them. As it Works for humans to it might be rough in the beginning but when it's all over your gonna cherish the memories you've created. In my opinion the director could have not done anything more to make this movie one of a kind. I recommend this movie to those who don't value life and the effect one has. As John and Jenne's plan never went step by step it changed. Their plan molded to their life and took of carrying them with it to a life they never imagine for the better",1487289600,,2688,4.28740157480315

3775181,1,B001REZM74,This movie was slow as hell had terrible actors including the dog. The last 10 mins was extremely depressing. I do not recommend for children or elderly.,1482624000,,153,4.703703703703703

3775183,2,B001REZM74,"Goes way beyond being sexually suggestive and is in fact sexually explicit.  I made the mistake of believing the cover ""family movie"".  Drinking booze straight from the bottle, talking about 'making babies', then showing them 'making babies' are just of few of the issues I have with this movie.  I would not let my kids finish this movie.  Fine for adults, not for kids!",1482192000,,371,4.75
3775184,3,B001REZM74,Not true to the book. Book was more about the dog and the movie is more about the people.,1481932800,,89,3.736842105263158

3775189,5,B001REZM74,An excellent movie for most of the family.  The final scenes are impactful and could be traumatizing for a child younger than 10.  It's a movie filled with humor and love.  There are a couple of scenes that would be sexually appropriate for adolescents; no nudity or vulgarity but could be challenging for younger children.  I highly recommend this movie for the humor and love for a dog that becomes part of everyone's lives.,1480636800,,426,4.716216216216216

3775223,1,B001REZM74,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,2,1188,4.8088235294117645

3775226,4,B001REZM74,"The film was fun to watch, but I felt that it was not as funny as I heard it would be. I was also somewhat annoyed by the fact that although the couple certainly loved their dog Marley, they did not train him, with the result that he continually destroyed everything about the house. True, there was a scene where an experienced dog trainer was unable to train Marley, but I think that there is no dog that cannot be trained, especially in this case where it is clear that Marley wants to be friendly and does not want to harm anyone, human or animal. Marley also showed love frequently as well as a desire to protect the couple and their children. It seems to me that a dog with this disposition can be trained. This fact caused me to not like the film as much as I would have wanted.",1464912000,,785,4.2052980132450335

3775252,1,B001REZM74,"What a crappy movie. I have kids I let watch this. Let me outline why you should not watch this, especially not with kids:

1) Profanity. Lots of it.
2) Sex talk, lots of talking about making babies. Embarrassing scenes (if watching with kids) like the two of them crawling into a bed, kissing, pulling up the covers and then the bed loudly squeaking, squeaking, squeaking as they have sex. Scene of the wife taking off all her clothes and jumping in the pool, husband taking his off and following, and the two of them in tight embrace and kissing. Other bed scenes where my kids asked ""why are they rolling around on the bed like that and kissing?"" Also talk about birth control.
3) Scenes of the dog humping things and people, including a part at the end where he humps the couch and you can see his red lipstick going to town.
4) Scene of a happy pregnant woman going for her ultrasound to hear her baby's heartbeat, but instead being told the baby is dead. And they can try for a new one in a couple months. If you have ever lost a baby you will have awful memories dredged up by this and be crying for days.
5) A lot more dog poop scenes than I would like.
6) Marital fighting, lots of stress.
7) The end shows them euthanizing the dog, shows him laying on a metal table and they inject the drug and he dies. HEART WRENCHING and if you have ever put a pet to sleep you will sob for hours over this. Then of course the very end is them putting his body in a hole and covering it with dirt. THE END.

My youngest was so upset and said THAT'S the END?? Because there is NO happy ending or even a sign of a new beginning like a new puppy. Nothing, just a pile of dirt and rocks and the guy walking away. What a depressing, crappy movie.",1458345600,2,1737,4.1513353115727005

How true it was!  It actually made me realize that my yellow lab, Isabel, wasn't the worst dog ever.  I also liked the final moments of the movie, and the idea that it's nice to have another living being think you're extraordinary.  Highly recommended for dog lovers, and not that sad!  Marley had a good life.
......
I just watched this again with my now 13 month old Lab Isabel.  This is not the greatest movie in the world, but I love it.  It made me laugh and made me cry.  Isabel is no longer chewing walls, but she has ripped apart the furniture and I will need to completely redecorate once she gets past the chewing stage.  Nonetheless, she is the friendliest, nicest, most loving dog ever, and Marley and Me really captures the specialness that is the Labrador Retriever.

I haven't read the book, so I can't make a comparison. This is the kind of movie that I think would appeal more to a lover of romantic comedy than an animal lover. The title doesn't really fit the story - it feels much more like a story about a guy and his wife going through the life struggles of work and family, More than about the bond between him and the dog. It had some clever writing but I never quite felt a bond developing between the dog and the owners. It was a bit of a tearjerker at the end of course, as most stories about animals end up being, and I think it will resonate with anyone who knows what it's like to share a decade of life with an animal.

Too many references to sex and making a baby and even a scene where she is in the doctor's office and she suffers a miscarriage.  Other scenes talk about a bed squeaking and being sex starved.  We had to end the movie at that point.  Even fast forwarding some scenes, it still introduced mature information not fit for kids even though the film emphasized the ""cute puppy"" as the star.

3775479,5,B001REZM74,"How many movies do we see in this modern age that (rightly) devote so much attention to such an adorable animal while making itself something to watch for the entire family?  I can't think of any others right now, so on we go.  Based on the memoirs of the same name, the writer John Grogan and his wife Jenny, in an attempt to prepare themselves for having kids, acquire a Labrador retriever puppy who is named Marley after singer Bob Marley.  Then, as Marley grows up, hijinks ensue as the family grows and changes, all the while they all continue to bond with their furry companion.  Much like the book it's based on, this film should tug at the heartstrings from beginning to end.  Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston actually do make a convincing couple.  They're not perfect, but absolute perfection is boring.  The flaws in their ""coupling"" are what make them more interesting to watch, even during the more hammy moments.  But, my two favorite actors in this film, besides the twenty or so pooches who played Marley in his various ages, are Eric Dane, playing John's wise-cracking best friend Sebastian, and Alan Arkin, who amusingly plays the unsmiling-yet-somehow-happy editor Arnie Klein.  Many more round out the cast as the Grogans handle the trials and triumphs of life, Marley always close by.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll...experience just about every emotion known to man.  This film is a 21st century family picture and should not be missed.  Also, look for the Friends reunion...I won't say more.  Enjoy.",1402617600,2,1528,4.853281853281853

3775490,3,B001REZM74,"If you're a lover of dogs, this is a movie worth watching that you can probably relate to. If you're looking for (human) character development, ""Marley and Me"" falls short of doing that. There are scenes in this movie that are hastily fast-forwarded (haste makes waste), so it's difficult to keep up with the story and figure out how the characters in this story develop and grow (e.g. the babies growing up to be kids in minutes and the dog, Marley, growing up to be a full-grown adult dog in about 30 minutes. Also, the fact that Owen Wilson's character gets a job and then gets a raise doesn't normally happen in reality (especially in this economy). I realize that has nothing to do with the central plot/story of this movie, but it needs to be mentioned to manifest the absence of reality in this movie. Going back to relevance and the review, this movie deserves 3 stars because Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson starred in this movie and because it tried its best to develop a worthwhile story (which is difficult, especially when the main character is a dog unable to speak or clearly show emotions). Minus 1 star for lack of (human) character development and minus 1 star for an uninteresting story.",1396137600,,1207,4.644859813084112

3775498,5,B001REZM74,"Its saturday feb 22nd 750pm. my name is andy and today It was with great sadness that I had to give my beloved little flower WHITNEY to god and st. martin, patriot saint of animals. I would like to tell you all alittle bit about her if I may. WHITNEY was my best friend in the whole world! She did everything that a loving pet was supposed do. In all my goodtimes bad times hurtful painfull times she was there for me. Making me feel better and easing whatever pain I was feeling at the time. I could always count on her laying her little head on my lap as if to say ""its ok dad im here"". WHITNEY came into my life 15 years ago the size of a little mouse. she was a caryn terrier lite brown hair the most soothing beautiful dark eyes. And an angelic face and the biggest heart a little dog could have. She was given to me and I didn't want her or any pet for that matter at that time and it took me awhile to get used to her. yes I loved animals but i just didn't want one. Lo and behold I fell for her charms and occasional riff raff that a typical puppy will cause. Her love was so unconditional thru her whole life to me and me to her. About 4 months later a friend brought me a companion for Whitney so she woundnt be lonely while I was at work. """"PIP"" is also a very loving pet, a west highland terrier. They both took to each other right away. I had my little family. PIP is currently 14 years old and still is very vivacious, healthy and frisky. Of course they both had there share of medical trips in there life i.e. shots. They both got ear hematomas but came thru it successfully.  Whitney startd coughing late last year in the summer. It progressed and eventually got worse. It was hard for her to breath and eat. She had tumors growing in her throat (of all places). Doctors went in and successfully got one out in sept. She was back to her old happy self eating all she wants and wanting to be with me watching tv and movies. In late nov another one had grown in the same area. doctors went in and got that out and successfully. With 2 surgeries already behind her and being that she was already 15 I wasn't going to grant her a 3rd.  The first 2 surguries were very scary and risky being where the tumors were. my vet doctors came thru and she pulled thru both surgeries successfully BUT they told me they could not get them all the smaller ones and that they would grow slowly. I had my baby thru the holidays thankfully. She was happy, very energetic for her age, loved her walks with me and pip, ate good and we shared christmas together just the 3 of us. But the middle part of jan she was coughing and gagging once again. I was by this point preparing myself for what was to come. My god it hurt me soo much to hear her coughing violently and her breathing sounded awfull. Only thing doctors could do was prescribe pet steroids to open her troat so she could breath and eat. That worked for awhile but it wasn't a cure. the only thing i could do is try and make her as comfortable as i could. I would carry her just about anywhere in the house. I was hand feeding her cuz she couldn't eat like she used to. Shed wake up late at night coughing up a storm so I would be up with her soothing her as best as i could. oh lord how i would cry and i was so stressed out. I was losing the best friend and companion i ever had in my life. This morning, she didn't get up she just stayed asleep not even wanting to go outside to do her business with pip like always. She would just cough and wheeze while asleep. I knew the time had come. I knew my Whitney was asking me in her own way for me to take the pain away that she was feeling. I picked her up and she did go out and do her final business outside and sniffed the grass like she always did. In the car she was just lying down wheras normally she'd be excited barking up a storm. None of that happened. We got to the vet and it would be her final stop. All i could do is keep holding her and telling her ""no more coughing babies no more just go to sleep now ill see you again you were such a good pet to me and ill never ever forget you"". In an instant she was gone. she passed right in my arms. oh god I haven't stop crying since and don't think im going to stop ever. Shes gone! I still cant believe my little baby is gone and not coming back to me but i know shes happy again and not sick and i will see her again... while on amazon shopping or even right now, She would be right here next to me on the floor waiting for me to shut off everything and go to bed haha... Marley and me is such great a film I watched sometime ago with whitney and pip in our many movie nights with them and as always whitney was always with me on the couch. She wouldnt have had it any other way and that was fine by me. rest in peace in heaven my little wee wee, Ill love you forever with all my heart...Thank you all for reading this, god bless.",1393027200,3,4896,3.9948979591836733

I originally saw this movie 7 years ago when my dog was just 3 years old and I remember crying my eyes out and hugging him all the while wailing with sorrow much to my poor dogs horror.  I just lost him to cancer two weeks ago and wanted to watch the movie again because like Marley my dog was completely lovable and my best friend but not what anyone would consider a ""good dog.""  Seeing the movie again actually made me laugh and smile and brought back memories of the much wilder times when my dog was young and spry and constantly up to no good.  It also really portrayed how much a family can love this creature that could be so naughty.
The scene where he has to ""make the decision"" and say goodbye was so realistic and mirrored what I had just went through in such an uncanny way.  I found it was a really good form of therapy even though people told me I shouldn't watch it while I was still grieving the loss of my long time companion.
I give it five stars for making me laugh, smile, cry and be reminded of the good times ( even if some of them seemed kind of bad at the time)",1390176000,6,1209,4.110169491525424

It never stoops to tacky behavior for laughs and kudos to the Wilson Aniston team.  The only thing really missing, for me, was any real sense of intimate or sexual attraction between them.  They came across as true good friends which was somewhat refreshing.

Marley, the dog, was a little over the top in his destruction and something I would never have taken on but the dog plays a good balance to the quiet, steady support that the leads portray.

We used to bring her camping, but EVERY time she was in a tent, she would run through it. We lost her to cancer when she turned 5. It is one of the worst years of my life.
The day she died, I came home from school, and as soon as I walked in the door, I knew something was off. My mother's eyes where swollen from tears, and when Goldie walked up to me, I knew why.
Her tail was still wagging, but her throat was about 4 sizes bigger then normal. I knew. It was the last day for her.
My mother put me in the car, but I stopped her. I told her ""I did not get to say goodbye"". Now, Imagine a child running from a car to say goodbye to their best friend.
I remember so clearly my last sight and smell of her. I knelt down on the kitchen floor (which is where she was laying) and I said
goodbye.

3775571,5,B001REZM74,"Marley and me represents the best part of who we are as a species, whereby we go outside the box and care for other, more vulnerable among us and make them a part of our homes/lives.

We love and live together, and when one of us comes to the end of our lives, we grieve and remember the wonderful times we spent loving each other and in the process making this world a better place for us all.

Marley & Me, the companion dog in this case is a autobiographical story of how one special dog gave immense joy and companionship to a family, and their collective strength and emotion after Marley's passing with a final conclusion of the story defining why so many of us love and want companion animals to begin with;

 ""  The dog has no use for fancy cars, or big homes, or designer clothes; a water logged stick will do just fine.  A dog doesn't care if you're rich or poor, clever or dull , smart or dumb.  Give him your heart, and he'll give you his.  How many people can you say that about ? How many people can make you feel rare and pure, and special ? How many people can make you feel extraordinary ?  ""

Having gone through absolute joy and loss, I can say for sure, that love shared and a special feeling of pureness and rarity are the hallmarks of what our beloved animal companions , a dog in this case, give us and we can all hope someday we see a world where we all see this special bond existing between all citizens of planet Earth.

I got the instant video edition of it.  Here is the pro: you don't ever have to replace a movie or worry about it being scratched or damaged like you do with a disc.  The con is that all you get is the movie.  There is no bonus feature like you would get on a disc or any option of subtitle or audio.  I guess with a movie like this it didn't bother me, but it might be of concern to purchasers that wanted a classic like Gone With the Wind.

Maybe I have higher standards than most, but I don't think words like ""b@stard"" and ""ass-kissing"" are meant for young ears.  Why do they need to hear these things in a movie that's marketed as a ""family movie""?

I'm extremely disappointed in the movie.  Fortunately, my daughter came to pick up the grandkids about half-way through the movie, so they weren't subjected to any other negative stuff.  Yes, I *should* have just turned it off, but I kept hoping it would get better.

He made a valid point when he said everytime you think something major is going to happen, it doesnt... it just drags on.

If you've lived this story, you got together with someone, got married, you bought a dog, and then decided to start a family, than you can relate to the movie. It does explain a dogs life SO well.

Normally I hate the big-dog-wrecks-everything genre, (Turner and Hooch, Beethoven, etc) but Marley won me over. He was really good with the kids and I got sad at the end. Owen Wilson may be the best lead actor for the Sunday-afternoon-taking-a-nap genre. Just a real easy going guy.

Aniston is a blight on humanity. She's a loser. She threw away the love of her life because she wouldn't have his -- or anybody's -- child. She thinks too much of her body to ""ruin it"" with childbearing. That's not somebody I want to see, ever, anywhere.",1348704000,,540,4.4

3775635,2,B001REZM74,"This is a seriously flawed movie one cannot help enjoying. One of those laugh, then think about it, then feel vaguely guilty for laughing types of movies. So I will confess right up: I did laugh, and in the touching scenes, I almost but not quite cried.

In one sense, the advertising about this movie is deceptive. Marley begins life as a totally adorable puppy, but that phase ends very quickly and the rest is about him as an totally uncontrolled adult. His owners, being an earnest and honest young couple (both writers on newspapers, but different papers), take him to obedience school, where the instructor provides some amusing scenes and then declares him completely un-trainable and orders them to take him away and never bring him back.

Much of the story revolves around his chewing things up, including especially his leather leash, so as to run free unexpectedly. They never thought of buying a chain leash. And if any family really lost that much furniture and clothing and other essentials to a dog's urge to chew, wouldn't they have learned much earlier to buy him a nice large rawhide bone-shaped toy, which is how he managed to contain himself (for awhile anyway) when he owners rushed to the hospital to have their first baby. I'd have bought him a whole case of chew toys if he was mine, and saved thousands of dollars replacing furniture.

But then they were apparently growing quite wealthy, in large part because John Grogan (played by Owen Wilson) was writing a successful newspaper column in which the antics of Marley played a critical part. Maybe they were afraid if he got any discipline, the writing wouldn't be funny anymore. But they had three kids by the time he took a job with the Philadelphia Inquirer and moved from Florida. The house they bought was one of those marvelous old field-stone farmhouses which dot the Pennsylvania landscape. Since it is described as ""just outside of Philly,"" it was most likely on the Main Line, which is a very money sort of area. Big old house, lots of trees, big yard, all old growth landscape -- we are talking real money. Enough to be able to replace furniture Marley chews up.

Do I sound like I am resentful with envy? Perhaps I am. These two attractive people have together just exactly what I would have done if I could have. Still, they are nice people, their kids are nice people, and Marley can be charming when he wants to be.

But dogs do not live as long as humans, and so we have the inevitable death scene. I must say, it was handled well, especially with regard to how the children were involved in the burial.",1336867200,2,2595,4.6326086956521735
3775636,5,B001REZM74,"Thoroughly enjoyed the film.  As a dog lover, it has a definite appeal.  Good family fare, but be forewarned that the reality is dogs age and die, so if you are watching with children be prepared to deal with emotions.  Good opportunity for a discussion.",1333670400,,254,4.6

I expected something similar to the book. This is, however, not what I got. There were many sexual scenes that made me feel uncomfortable. The movie also, did not focus enough on Marley. I did like the ending, thought it gave enough emotion into it. Especially loved that it made my brother cry. After having seen it once, I am still debating whether to get rid of it or to still keep it. I guess I don't have much reason for either, but I just don't know what to do... Anyway, that's not the point I am trying to make here. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone not ready for such content. I got lucky my brother didn't start to ask questions.

This movie turns into a comedy. The book is comedy, loyalty..... so much more. I totaly HATE this book. This might satisfy your kids but it sure won't if you read the awsome book.

3775642,2,B001REZM74,"I'm somewhat late to the board, here, but just watched this movie
and found it very disappointing.  Moreover, I do not understand
why so many people here are giving this movie high ratings.

To the point, there was nothing remarkable to this story.  Marley
was a badly misbehaved dog, causing property damage and even hurting
people.  While watching, I was waiting for something to happen.
Was the dog going to go through a transformation and somehow become
well-behaved?  Was the dog going to somehow be the catalyst that
helps the married couple through their difficulties?  Was the dog
going to be a hero, save a life, chase away a burglar, etc?  Would
the couple split up, only to have the dog bring them back together?
I was waiting for some plot, anything, to develop, but none did.
Furthermore, there are many scenes that seem incomplete, where you'd
expect something else to happen, but nothing does. (For example, as
the dog barks out the window, Grogan runs outside to find a neighbor
girl stabbed. He calls the police and conforts her, but then the
scene ends.  Maybe it would have been fun to see the dog run down
the street and apprehend the assailant.)

More importantly, the dog was not an endearing character.  Throughout
the movie, the dog was self-centered, distructive, and harmful,
repeatedly destroying property and scaring people.  The dog had
almost no redeeming aspects.  Furthermore, the owners did not seem to
even attempt to discipline this dog, other than those no-longer-funny
chase scenes that we've all seen in about a hundred other dog movies.

I would compare Marley's destructive nature to a screaming baby in a
restaurant.  While there are some people who would find it ""cute"", most
people find it very obnoxious and even angering.

The movie ends, of course, with the dog finally dying, in a scene that
is clearly aimed at bringing tears to the audience.  However, two more
common reactions should happen.  Firstly, you may be relieved that this
self-centered, awful dog is finally gone, or, secondly, you may have a
""what's the big deal"" moment, as almost every dog owner has gone through
the experience of having to put their dog down.

This is an unremarkable movie with very little plot.  The dog is not a
sympathetic character at all, and while the married couple do go through
some character changes, the dog contributes very little that is positive.
Not a ""one-star"" movie, because it is not as bad as National Lampoon's
""Gold Diggers"", but not one that I would bother seeing again.  There are
also scenes with strong language and some sexual references, so it would
not be suitable for small children.",1327795200,4,2645,4.848552338530067

I thought the ""Animal Adoption"" feature was by far the most informative short of how to adopt a dog feature that I have ever seen in less than six minutes. It has interviews of people who have adopted dogs from rescue and city shelters. It is just very informative with great pace with providing this information.

The other big bonus to me besides all the other great extras already mentioned by others is the ""Dog Training Trivia Track"" with Picture in Picture (PIP) video on BonusView enabled blu-ray players. YOU can chose to watch the individual clips separately, but I chose to watch the pop ups. Again this is so delicious in that it introduces to how to raise a pet with some good love. It has professional dog trainers sharing tips either with video or just pop up words that makes the movie even more enjoyable. At the 1:14 min (min:sec) into the movie a little pop up says, ""Welcome to the Marley & Me Dog Training Track"" and trust me if you are dog lover like me you will not be disappointed and it this delight.

One is always so joyous over a puppy or even a young dog, but no matter how long-lived the breed, for a loving family it is NEVER long enough.  The pain of the last ""goodbye"" is in direct proportion to the amount of love one feels for the animal, and it is a moot point when dealing with the anguish of loss over a good and loyal friend and family member whether it is worth going through it ever again with another.

Anyone with a pet of any kind will understand the ups and downs of the Grogans and their Labrador Marley.  I gather from the content that the movie is based on a true story, which I can believe.  Though I didn't have as much trouble with my Great Dane Courageous, I had at least some of the issues.  (If you think a Lab can drag you along on a ""walk,"" try walking a 175# Great Dane!)

While some reviewers suggest that the movie isn't for children, I have to disagree.  I suspect small children will deal better with the end than adults will; I'm always amazed at the resilience of children.  Perhaps it's that they have no clue about what dying really means.  Having worked in Pediatrics, both in ICU and in bone marrow transplant, I can say they are a whole lot more stoic about the prospect than adults are, even when it's the possibility of their own death that looms.  I think the end of the dog's life was dealt with well and would help children understand and deal with a forthcoming loss in their own lives.  One can collapse into an hour and half the entire life of a dog, see its contributions to family life, understand that everyone gets old, that sometimes even though it's sad for us because the family member or pet is no longer with us, death comes as a natural thing, even a welcome thing at the end of a well spent life.

But nobody ever  wonders if a father is neglectful for letting  someone else raise his kids (babysitter or mother).

I could [sort of] understand Jennifer quitting work to care for three young kids, but what about when the kids get older? She never returns to her job or even thinks about it. She just makes lunch for them and compliments her husband on his newspaper articles. Oh yea, and she encourages John to chase after his dreams, since apparently her career doesn't mean a thing anymore.

3775661,4,B001REZM74,"`Marley and Me' is the film, based on the book of the same name, about a couple and their disruptive dog.

When journalist John Grogan and his wife Jenny get married he feels like he has to get something in her life to look after so she will not be so keen on immediately starting a family. Cue Marley, a cute, but rambunctious and lively Labrador puppy who soon has them running around after him and pulling their house and life to bits.

There are lots of funny scenes where Marley gets one over on the couple and his antics do make for entertaining viewing, although at times I wish they would just discipline him and stop the disruption he brings! He is certainly a well natured, but head strong dog.

Eventually the couple start a family, with the associated stresses that brings, but the one constant is Marley and he is soon seen as an integral part of the family unit. The film then follows the family's ups and downs for the duration of Marley's life, with the inevitable and heart warming ending.

Aniston was very good in this film and Wilson also showed more depth than in previous films I have seen him in. It has to be said that this is certainly a film for dog lovers and as I hinted at before, I became frustrated at some points throughout at the misbehaved antics of Marley and I wished he would be brought in line, despite a rather feeble half hearted attempt to do just that. But these frustrations were short lived and I was soon enjoying the next stage in his and the family's life.

This is easy going and not too stressful to watch. It has a nice message and has some genuinely funny moments. The acting and direction are good enough, without setting the world on fire and all in all it made for an inoffensive, entertaining couple of hours viewing.

Brief summary:
Marley & Me is a comedy about a Yellow Labrador Retriever. A young couple John and Jenny Grogan adopts Marley as a puppy and soon discover why he was sold to them on clearance. He is the ""worst dog in the world"" and wreaks havoc and destruction everywhere he goes. John gets an idea from his friend Sebastian that a dog might help him avoid some tough responsibility and allow him a few years of freedom by getting his wife's mind off of having a baby. The plan doesn't work out as well as John hopes and finds out that owning a Labrador Retriever can be just as tough as raising children.

My experience:
I had avoided Marley & Me since its release to theaters. I had heard rumors that the movie was so sad that grown men would leave the theater to avoid the embarrassment of bawling like a baby in front of thier family, friends and worse yet, complete strangers.

The movie traces the life of a Yellow Labrador named Marley and follows thru to the dogs last days of life. Since I had just suffered the loss of losing my first Labrador; Zira in 2005 I knew I would not be able to cope well with the story-line. As the old saying goes ""Time heals all"" and I felt I was finally ready to take on the challenge of watching this most talked about film by all Labrador Retriever fans and just dog lovers in general.

The movie made me laugh out-loud so many times and I could relate and appreciate every aspect of John and Jenny's experience with Marley. John is also a writer so I could definitely relate to that as well. Most of the humorous lines come from the character John and of course from the hilarious antics and behaviors from Marley.

There were so many heartfelt moments, they were so tear jerkingly touching, that some lumps in my throat had to be swallowed back and then the writers of the movie could immediately make me laugh again. The last half hour of the movie was so sad that I must admit I was glad I watched this movie alone. It did indeed have me ""bawling like a baby"" (I guess I am such a softie when it comes to stuff like this.) However I thought the movie ended on such a positive note that I found myself really enjoying this film. My biggest disappointment was that Marley is only an adorable little puppy for about ten minutes in the entire movie. I would have liked to have seen more of that.

The movie overall:
The acting was very well followed thru and Owen Wilson as John Grogan was very funny and an extremely likeable character. Jennifer Aniston as Jenny was just okay to me. The pacing of the movie was a little bit on the slow side, with all the family, pregnancy and baby stuff; the pay-off at the end however made it necessary so it was well worth it.

The acting (if you can call it that) from Marley was fantastic, he really makes this movie extremely enjoyable and I will treasure Marley & Me for a long time. The music in Marley & Me was very decent as well; from the opening title theme to a remake of a Nirvana song all the way to the heart wrenching ending theme, I will simply name it, ""Reflections"".

There were a few adult themed elements that gave the movie its deserving PG Rating but all in all I found it to be very appropriate for young children. I would highly recommend Marley & Me to any dog lovers and to all Labrador Retriever fans.",1308787200,,3536,4.267164179104477
3775665,4,B001REZM74,"MARLEY AND ME is a color film starring Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, and a white dog.  The story begins at the time Mr. Wilson and Ms. Aniston are about 30 years old, and newlyweds.  They live in Michigan, but within the opening minutes of the film, move to Florida.  Mr. Wilson goes on a job interview for a large metropolitan newspaper, and gets the job.  While his career goal was to be a newspaper reporter, he eventually segues into a higher paying job at the same newspaper as a columnist.  In general, the job of a newspaper columnist is to immerse oneself into the story, and to become part of the story.  Mr. Wilson is highly successful at this job.  At the start of this job, he drives a Toyota Tercel (the tiniest of automobiles) and when he achieves the position of a ""regional celebrity"" (to use a phrase used in the film), Mr. Wilson owns a minivan and a house with a gorgeous swimming pool.

With the move to Florida, Ms. Aniston, also acquires a job with a newspaper, but for another paper in the same city.  With Mr. Wilson's success, the couple eventually have three babies.  The film is basically a ""slice of life"" movie that lacks any particular plot, lacks any excitement, and is substantially lacking in humor.  Ms. Aniston loses her first child, when it is in the ten week embryo stage.  To relax and recouperate from this loss, the couple takes a vacation to Ireland, where they stay in a homey cottage, where the room is festooned with the accoutrements of the Catholic church.  The room contains a painting of The Pope, a painting of Jesus, a painting of Mary, and a large crucifix.  Mr. Wilson and Ms. Aniston feel a little nervous because their attempt at finding a romantic getaway resulted, instead, in a cottage decorated with so many authorities of the Catholic church.  At any rate, in one of the rare moments in the movie where something interesting actually happened, the couple decide to procreate (despite the stern gazes from The Pope, Jesus, and Mary), and the result is a healthy child.

Eventually, Mr. Wilson's original goal of becoming a newspaper reporter gnaws at him and, to make a long story short, he accepts a position with a major Philadelphia newspaper, and becomes a reporter.  Mr. Wilson's supervisor sternly tells him that he places himself in the stories, that he should not be doing this,and that his own personna should be excluded from his reporting.  Witnessing this particular moment is, perhaps, worth the time and effort of enduring the slice-of-life plotlessness that plagues the entire picture.

Okay, the movie is called, MARLEY AND ME.  What is grafted on the career-story of Mr. Wilson, and the story of Ms. Aniston's newspaper career that becomes transformed into a homemaker's career, is continual slapstick provided by the dog, ""Marley.""  Near the start of the movie, Mr. Wilson provides Ms. Aniston with a freshly weaned puppy as a birthday present.  The puppy is a hungry one, grows quickly, and has the protean appetite of a goat.  Marley has a particular affinity for couches, pillows, plaster walls, and he proceeds to rip up these things with his teeth.  Marley even eats a gold necklace.  Also, Marley eats great quantities of actual dog food, and acts up during the many thunderstorms found in Florida.  Marley is truly an unruly dog.

Overall, about 50% of the time in the movie is spent with slapstick, that is, showing Marley breaking things and running amok.  (The slapstick is NOT particularly funny or amusing.  It is just ruckus for the sake of ruckus.  The continual scenes showing the dog breaking things and tearing up furniture is as funny as scenes from THE THREE STOOGES, where Curly gets a screw driver thrust into his eye.  ""Ha, ha, ha, oh how funny!"") About 25% of the time is spent showing Mr. Wilson and Ms. Aniston in ordinary domestic situations, for example, by having a petty argument, or spending time with their kids.  And about 25% of the movie is spent disclosing the development of Mr. Wilson's career.  I am not sure how history will judge this weird movie.  The movie is more like one of the ""reality"" shows that sometimes find their way to television, that is, where cameramen film ordinary events taking place in a person's life over the course of a month.  The film mainly shows ordinary things that happen, during the course of an ordinary middle-class couple.  The film drags on almost interminably in his way, showing ordinary ""slice-of-life"" things, over and over and again and again.  Aside from the episode in the Irish cottage, this movie is TOTALLY lacking in humor.  The interactions between Mr. Wilson and his two supervisors, one at the Florida newspaper and the other at the Philadelphia newspaper, were done particularly well, and can be used for training young people on making career decisions.

SPOILER ALERT.  Eventually, Marley grows old.  We see him having trouble climbing steps because of arthritis.  We see him being unalert when Mr. Wilson enters a room, because of the dog's loss of hearing.  Also, Marley develops an intestinal knot.  This resolves itself, but the veterinarian warns that this particular disorder usually returns and is fatal.  And so, the intestinal knot returns, and Marley is sent to the vet again.  The vet warns that older dogs do not often survive surgery.  And so, the viewer is shown the actual procedure of euthanasia.  We see an orange-colored solution being infused in the poor old dog.  At this point, I felt that this was really ""too much information"" (TMI). I found myself wondering if the film had been funded by the Animal Euthanasia Society.  I found the euthanasia scene to be not really needed for the story.  But then, the philosophy behind this film is to eliminate any sense of a real ""story"" and to replace it with a prolonged and humorless ""slice of life"" narrative.",1308268800,,5843,4.787212787212788

brilliant and convincing as if already a seasoned actor. And of course
Marley himself was wonderfully entertaining. But it's not about the dog
so much as the way he affected lives. Although I never read the book, I

I actually think I might have OWNED Marley dog, except it was a Siberian Husky! They are bred specifically to ""think"" ...  when the master orders the dog to ""MUSH"" straight forward onto broken ice, The dog is bred to THINK to be smart enough to consider the ""mush"" order, yet smart enough to disobey, to lead the sled team to the left for safety. If you do not give a ""working dog"" a ""job"" to do, it could get destructive. (We keep TP up high, or it will become victim.)

Starring Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as two newspaper reporters who get married and begin a life together, this film goes through the life of one dog, Marley, whom they pick out of a litter.

From the beginning, you know this pup will be trouble as he destroys the garage while waiting for the two to return from the airport.

All through his life, Marley wreaks havoc, but he has the unending love of a puppy. And that is what's truly sad about this film.

Why are all animal movies like this? You always know what's going to happen, why put yourself through it. The only reason I can see is if you need a good cry and haven't had the excuse for a long time.

The filmmakers really do milk the crying/emotional aspect during the film's final moments, but while you're watching it, you don't care enough to complain. You're too busy making a mess of your shirt.",1294099200,,976,4.370165745856354

3775677,4,B001REZM74,"Good dog movies are few and far between. Film pooches always seem to be made more brave, loyal, smart, courageous, etc than any dog could be in real life, and don't even get me started on films where dogs talk, play basketball or practice law.

Marley & Me gets several things correct, and one of them is that Marley is always a dog, and never imbued with super-canine capabilities. In fact, not only is Marley not Lassie, he is, in fact, 100 pounds of canine catastrophe - pooping in inopportune places and sometimes eating things like sofa cushions.

Marley serves as a life-marker for John and Jennifer Grogan, played by Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as an almost-too-good-to-be-true married couple. We learn that they both begin their careers as cub journalists, but where Jennifer has many offers and signs on with the most prestigious paper in town, John considers himself lucky to get any position, and he's initially assigned methane leaks and community counsel meetings.

Jen is ready for children and John is not initially. A friend suggests a puppy to keep her mind off the desire for pregnancy. Enter Marley, a cute Labrador pup sold at a marked down price compared to his brothers and sisters. Jen calls him ""clearance puppy"". Marley gives them reason to second-guess themselves for getting a dog as he chews everything in the house, howls when left alone, and humps the leg of the obedience class instructor (played in a brief slapstick turn by Kathleen Turner).

The next dozen-plus years of the Grogans are woven into a series of anecdotes related to the three children who come (including the youngest daughter who is born with a nickname we hear in one of the funniest lines of the film.) John wants to be a reporter, but for the good of the family takes a large promotion to write a column twice a week. When his muse fails he writes slice of life vignettes that include life with ""the worst dog in the world."" For the good of the family Jen takes a child-rearing hiatus, and some of the most realistic scenes of the film show the family frustrations as Jen gives up her prestigious writing job to raise their children and clean up after Marley's disasters.

In the ominous prelude to the inspirational story of Brian Piccolo, ""Brian's Song"" we are warned that all true stories end in death. Knowing that dogs are quite old at the age humans reach puberty, I was expecting this movie to be a ""true story"" also. I've seen some reviews warning that children should not be allowed to see the film because of the inevitable sadness that comes in the end. I would argue that it is a valuable lesson for the emotionally developing child to learn about loss, and it's an easier lesson with a film pooch than with a loved-one familiar to the child.

Marley & Me is a slice of life movie, with several life-interludes spliced together rather than a true narrative arc, but your interest is maintained because you enjoy the company of these characters and you care what happens to them and their dog. When Marley is old and sick the family gathers to comfort the dog and themselves. The youngest girl offers Marley her stuffed lamb. ""Here, you can chew the OTHER ear off..."" During an extended sad final act I choked back my sniffles and smiled. Marley & Me did that to me.",1288915200,2,3285,4.645438898450947

The movie appears to have turned on many dog lovers who gave the movie high star reviews. However, it also turned off a good number of dog owners who feel that it is an owners responsibility to be the alpha and provide some discipline for their pets.  Marley was indeed a bad, willful but not mean spireted dog and needed some loving discipline.

Although I agree with them I feel this was a good (but not great) film and enjoyed it for what it was worth.  For one thing the makers felt this film should not overemphasize Marley as a puppy. So we were not treated to many scenes of Marley as a young pup. If we had, the ending probably would have been much more effective.

One scene of Owen Wilson house training the dog was very funny and showed him using his own lawn for an object lesson in not using the house as a bathroom.  The dog followed his lead and quickly did his thing. But Owen was spotted by a neighbor. I believe this scene was cut from the final film.

Why would you want your kids to watch this distressing movie?  You'd have to be a pretty cold-hearted parent to think that your kids would be entertained by watching this.  Remember when your kids cried when they watched the father die in ""Lion King?""  Anyway....

A friend of mine had an out-of-control dog about 15 years back.  It always wanted to go out for a walk, even when it was freezing rain outside.  The dog would howl and bark at the door all night long.  This was upsetting to him, his wife, their kids couldn't sleep and it affected their concentration at school, and their neighbors were always complaining.  What he eventually did (to the satisfaction of all concerned), he took his dog up to the mountains one day with his deer hunting rifle, and when the moment was right, he basically just shot him in the head.  He said it was quick, painless, and clean.  So then, from that day forward, everybody in the neighborhood lived happily ever after.

It was very well done and both Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston were excellent in these roles. I even think Mr. Wilson looks like John Grogan a little bit. A wonderful family film, but if you have ever gone through the loss of a beloved pet, be sure to bring a box of Kleenex for the last 30 minutes. The ending was extremely well done and realistic. It particularily struck me how in those last few moments that the character John Grogan spends with Marley, he touches his tail, feels his paws, and buries his face in the dog's soft fur, because that is exactly what I did with my old lab before I said good-bye to her. It was incredibly true to life and very, very moving. Picture quality was exceptional with the scenes in rural Pennsylvania (my home too!) in the Fall and Winter near the end of the film beautiful to look at and sound quality, well, my dogs both turned their heads and looked at the TV when Marley is locked in the garage for his first night and is whimpering and crying, so it must be pretty good. I really like this film and am very happy to have added it to my Blu Ray collection.

*Spoilers*

""What I know is that I have a tendency to surprise myself..."" This quote from Marley and Me is not only a great line, but it really captures the spirit of this movie in a nutshell. What is most surprising to me is how you find yourself pulling for the worst dog in the world, and his ever growing master, and their ever growing family, regardless of their situation as they endures life's ups and downs.

This movie basically follows a par of newly wed reporters as they move to Miami, get a job, a dog, a column, have kids, etc. The dog, of course, is the worst dog in the world. The job (for the guy anyway) is ""gas-leak"" type reporting, which leaves his big-shot reporting dreams unsatisfied. The column is a temp job, and his success makes the job stick, but still leaves him with unsatisfied big-shot reporting dreams. The kids make the wife leave her job and stay home, causing unfulfillment stress in her life. So, basically, if you follow me here, this is a ""real life"" true story which has a lot you can connect with...

The unifying theme to it all is Marley (named after Bob Marley) whose only outstanding trait is his ability to excel at being awful. This dog has no redeeming qualities except in the eyes of his family, and somehow, that is good enough. You find yourself rooting for this dog, just because he is so inept at domestic life, it is absolutely comical. I imagine it would be a much different story for most people, should they actually own such a beast, but watching it on the celluloid is family entertainment at its best. It is the one dog anti-dog-show dog show, the display of a dog with no manners, who has made no attempt to live with any kind of dignity, whatsoever.

The film detracts a bit from the ""real life"" story in the fact that they use actors who to me don't really sell their parts convincingly. Owen Wilson cannot seam to pull off affectionate scenes without his trademark observational banter to fill in the spaces, and Jennifer Aniston doesn't seem to fit the expressive ""emotional cheerleader"" role that the wife's lines seem to portray. I would rather have seen some no-names with good acting skills cast as the leads here rather than watching a couple of mega stars do their periodic obligatory romantic comedy. This script screams ""real world"" and the casting screams ""big budget formula comedy."" While I suppose a case could be made for Owen Wilson, and Jennifer Anniston for being the best boy and girl next door in Hollywood, I still don't think they pulled it off in this one.

Overall, a very good movie, with some really good scenes. I found myself ready for the show to end with the mellodrama of the climax, but overall the pacing of the feel good moments with the comedy terror was just about perfect.

I really enjoyed this movie, and I am not into these kinds of movies. The acting was ok, but didn't hit the mark, yet good enough to get you emotionally involved with the story. A very intriguing way to spend a few hours of your time...

The dog is very loving but extremely destructive.  Marley defies even the most determined dog trainers.

The Owen Wilson plays a reporter who writes for a Florida newspaper.  He wants to report the news as an immersion reporter covering relevant world news.

And if you really do have a heart, you will find yourself doing the same thing. So if you are going to watch this movie, I would suggust you have tissues opr kleenex on hand. Marley and Me tells the by a story of a young newy wed couple, and is based of a book, that I was prety much barely aware of. The book was written by John Grogan. The big question I have with the movie, is what is the timeline of the movie,  know from watching the movie, that John and his wife Jenny Grogan, owned Marley for 13 years. And Marley is not a very good boy, and even at one point, he scares a house sitter, that annouces to the Grograns, that Marley is not a Dog, more lie evil with a dog face. And if you have, or see the movie you will know what I mean. The movie opens on thier wedding night, wear Joh and Jenny have a talk, which learns hem to move from Michigan to Florida, they get jobs at rival newspapers, Jenny (Jennifer Aniston)  is hired at The Palm Beach Post, and John (Owen Wilson) gets a job at South Florida Sun-Sentinel, where he writes obituaries and two-paragraph articles about mundane news like a fire at the local garbage dump. His best friend Sebastian (Eric Dane) ""also works there, and more or less helps him get the job. His editor is Arnie Klein(Alan Arkin). Then Jenny really gets a jump on her plans, which includes having a baby. And Sebastian sugguests to John, to get a dog to see see if they are ready to start a family. So on surpise trip, John takes Jenny to b uy a dog. The dog they select, they get, for less, then the other puppies. Jenny says he is seet like a ""clearhouse puppy"". Then she has to out of town for a couple of weeks, leavin John to take care of he dog. And on he car ride home, John hears ""One Love"" by Bob Marley, on the radio, which inspires him to call him Marley. Then Arnie offers John, his own column, and even on a tempory basis, which John has no intrest in doing, but does agree. Through during the years they have Marley, they don't age, they do have kids, and even has to face what all dog owners pretty much have to face.

3775717,5,B001REZM74,"There is no question that the ""target audience"" of this film would be people (like me!) who adore dogs.  {Or, as I like to call them, little monsters!}  This is the story of a Labrador who is as cute as he is mischievous, as adorable as he is cantankerous.  The little fella has a loving family, headed by a pair of newlyweds (portrayed by Owen Wilson & Jennifer Aniston), and the story of the family proves to be heartwarming.

Dog lovers will be apt to recall to mind a very special dog(s) in their life as they watch the film.  For myself, it brought back memories of a Schnauzer we had named Frosty.  Unlike Marley, Frosty was a very obedient dog, but like Marley Frosty was also so very loyal & loving.

People who are not into pets are often perplexed as to how a pet can be considered anything more than simply a pet.  The present DVD expatiates on how a canine can come to be considered a genuine part of a family, just as Marley was to his & Frosty was to mine.  If this film falls short of clarifying this particular point, then I'm afraid that the concept will never be understood by the viewer in question.

For dog lovers, this film is a 5 Star treasure chest of nostalgia.  For people who dislike dogs, this film is a 1 Star bore.  People from the latter group will be apt to ask ""What is the big deal?"" after viewing it.  They won't ""get it,"" but rest assured people like me will.",1261612800,4,1395,4.238636363636363
3775718,4,B001REZM74,"""Marley & Me"" is a cute, involving movie that even has a little depth to it.  I liked the way it refused to let itself simply become a ""cute dog"" movie, maintaining its pedigree (couldn't resist) as a light drama/comedy that just happened to have a strong thread about a unique dog as a prime component.

And unlike a few criticisms I've read, I didn't feel that the first three quarters of the film are slapstick fun and then we're unfairly waylaid by melancholy and sadness as issues of mortality are suddenly confronted.  Sure, there's a lot of goofiness early on as Marley tears up everything in sight, as well as delivers some unwanted romantic attention to Kathleen Turner's leg. But there's enough serious stuff throughout the earlier going, too, including an examination of the toll career and children can take on a marriage, that when the sad responsibilities of owning an old dog finally appear, there's no major tonal shift.  There's light material and dark material, silly moments and serious moments throughout the film.

I watched the single-disc standard DVD version of ""Marley & Me"", which looks and sounds like gangbusters and has a few modest extra features (including a fun gag reel).  The movie is good enough, though, that I wouldn't mind seeing some of the more lavish extra features on the multi-disc edition.  Who'd have thought I'd say that about a DVD with a cute puppy on the box cover?",1261440000,2,1414,4.794238683127572
3775719,3,B001REZM74,"I'm pretty surprised that this movie is billed to be a family movie. It could have been a family movie if they had left out several of the ""intimate married-couple"" scenes. I was just glad I previewed it before gathering the family for movie night.

 The story itself was a bit drab and it wasn't so much ""Marley and Me"" but ""What I did in my life despite having a destructive dog and how I learned to deal with it and love this dog anyway""...but I guess that title would be too long. It wasn't a bad story line just not innovative. It had some funny, ""cute"" moments but the acting, while not terrible, wasn't all that inspiring either.

 The redeemable aspects to me were, first, showing how a couple really does suffer after losing a baby through miscarriage (probably another thing you wouldn't want little kids to worry about)...a good reminder that life is precious.

 Secondly, it showed that married life isn't always a walk in the park especially with kids in tow but that working through it and accepting your new roles as parents can make you an even stronger couple.

 Thirdly, I was impressed with Owen Wilson's character (John) in regard to temptations he encountered. His good friend was always making the single life look so much more appealing than married life. Despite that though, John showed himself to be truly manly, remain faithful to his wife and keep plugging on with his marriage and family. I don't see much of that portrayed in Hollywood these days.

 I can understand those that were upset by what happened with the dog at the end too. I think most small kids would be very upset with that and it really dragged on too long.",1261008000,,1653,4.5728813559322035

3775723,5,B001REZM74,"I was skeptical that 'Marley & Me' would be a horribly sappy story with an overly cute dog and no plot whatsoever.  Well, I wound out watching it when I was sick and nothing else was on, and I was so very wrong about it.  I was smitten - overwhelmed - by how good the movie is.  Yes, it's sappy in places, but it's still a great movie.  There's both comedy and tragedy, and some surprisingly good acting even from the normally amateurish Jennifer Aniston.  Owen Wilson is fantastic as always, he never fails to surprise me with his ability to perform.  In watching, I discovered that the movie is based on a real life story, told in the book 'Marley & Me' by John Grogan.

The movie starts with John Grogan's (Owen Wilson) marriage to Jenny (Jennifer Aniston) during a freak spring blizzard.  They move to south Florida, get jobs, buy a house ... and to avoid filling the spare room too quickly with children, John buys a Labrador puppy which they name Marley (after Bob Marley).  From the beginning, Marley is trouble with a capitol T.  He humps everything in sight (especially poodles), fails obedience class, weighs 100 lbs and pulls them everywhere on the leash, eats mangos, chews up everything in sight, and is generally a bad, disobedient dog.

Grogan's family finally expands with the birth of their first child, Patrick, and Marley continues to be an important part of their life.  There's fun, frolicking, and frisky adventure whenever Marley is involved.

'Marley & Me' is the life story of Marley, so get ready for some tears along with the laughs.  It's a surprisingly pleasant story of a family growing and developing, along with a dog that never listens and is afraid of thunderstorms.  The movie is saved from being too sweet by showing the tragedies of life too, such as Jenny miscarrying her first baby, and their second son suffering with colic.  Great performance by Kathleen Turner as the dog trainer, and Alan Arkin as Grogan's boss Arnie Klein.

The screenwriter and director did an excellent job of capturing Grogan's tale of Life, starting with early marriage and two people in love with good careers and a happy life, through the birth and raising of their children and the difficulties faced by everyday life in aging and raising children and balancing homelife with careers, and eventually turning forty.  Don't miss out on the book either, John Grogan is an excellent writer.

Like I said, the movie really surprised me at how good it is - a solid 5 stars!  Don't miss out on this fun, well acted, well directed, and well written story.  Enjoy!",1259452800,7,2573,4.698660714285714

In an era where all too much on the silver screen is either pretentious or whiz-bang, this is the kind of thing Disney used to do but has forgotten how.  It is a really heart-warming story about lives, love and a loyal -- if rambunctious dog.  Really good performances by Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston (who never looked more beautiful) and Alan Arkin.  I can relate to John Grogan's story -- I think must of us can -- I had a dog (infact the last one) and we got her when she was a pup and she had an exuburance of personality.  My Dad got her as a house dog for my Mom.  After she died it became my younger sister's dog and -- after she bite her husband -- she became mine and my ex-wife.  My wife used to say she didn't know which one of us (me or the dog) snored louder! I still remember one time when I had the flu and she jumped up on the bed, stuck her cold muzzle in my face, licked me and then curled up next to me. She was with me for fourteen years and time took its toll.  She got old, then she went blind.  I knew what was the right thing to do but I just couldn't bring myself to kill my friend.  So I can relate to this movie and, if you love dogs and feel good movies, you'll love this one as much as I do.",1256342400,2,1328,3.899628252788104

And the dog, anyone who has ever been around a lab can recognize Marleys behaviors too well (and why I don't own one). To put it plainly this is a dog my wife would have made me get rid of two days after bringing him home. He must have been the most destructive animal on the block for sure. In the end the movie pulled off what it intended to do: make you personify your own relationships and family into the film. Or, to put it plainly, see your own life and struggles in the story. Not hard to do when we all go through similar things. I give this 4 stars for the story which is a good one. The actors were not fantastic but the story compensated for them. Just my opinion.

3775734,5,B001REZM74,"Color me surprised.  Being completely unfamiliar with John Grogan's memoir, and knowing nothing about this movie other than its trailer that ran in the theaters, I was emotionally overwhelmed (in a good way) by this very moving film.  Anyone who has ever owned and loved a dog--and then had to say goodbye--will appreciate MARLEY & ME.

Again, all I knew about this movie was what I gleaned from its trailer; namely, a young couple (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, who are both wonderful in their roles as John and Jenny Grogan) with a feisty, uncontrollable yellow lab.  The trailer shows Marley chewing up and destroying things; it shows Wilson and Aniston chasing after a runaway Marley; it shows a wickedly disobedient Marley getting kicked out of obedience school by a flummoxed instructor (Kathleen Turner).  What we don't see are the very real and compelling components of a young couple battling career challenges and the duress of starting a family; what we don't see are the three Grogan children growing up in a loving household now featuring an aging Marley who more and more becomes the family focal point.  And what we don't see are the Grogans having to say goodbye to a 14-year-old senior dog; the closing scenes, particularly when John Grogan comforts Marley as he's being put down, were all very emotional and moving.  After being the family pet for several years a dog is very much a member of the family; seeing this movie brought the very real pain of saying goodbye back to the forefront.

So I walked away from watching MARLEY & ME with a very genuine feeling of warmth and nostalgia.  Really good movies make you laugh and cry, and this one certainly did.  Please keep a carton of tissues close by.

The movie wasn't awful, but I just felt that it lacked so much of the emotion of the book, although I was pleasantly surprised by how closely the plot itself stuck to the events depicted in Grogan's memoir. The various dogs who play Marley are all adorable, but I wasn't super impressed with the performances of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, who both came off as a bit cold to me.

In spite of that, however, I cried (actually, more like bawled) for the last 20 minutes or so of the film. I was shocked that the final scenes with Marley were shown in such vivid detail, and anyone who has ever loved a pet will just be heartbroken by the way the movie ends. I was disappointed that the film ended on such a sad note and didn't include any happy, uplifting scene showing the Grogan family getting on with their life...it was just so freakin' depressing.

I can also tell you that this is not a movie for small children, especially if you have a dog.

This movie follows a married couple as they go along on their journey in life, which just happens to include buying a puppy. Marley starts off as a terrible puppy and grows up to be even worse. I found myself at one point in the movie actually not liking Marley and wondering how they could keep him. But as time goes on, Marley definitely becomes a solid, well loved and appreciated member of the family.

The ending is a bit difficult to watch and I would be lying if I did not say that I had tears running down my face.

3775738,5,B001REZM74,"The previews for Marley and Me made it seem like the story is going to be a comedy.  It is a little bit, but it's more along the lines of romantic comedy, with some drama elements.  It's not a straight up comedy.

There are plenty of funny moments though.  Marley (the dog) was a complete MANIAC!  It was interesting how the owners tried to take the dog to obedient school, and they said the dog was WAY too out of control to be trained, haha.  Any attempt at training the dog failed hard and fast.

Marley would constantly chew up important things around the house, run around doing crazy things, and just have the time of his life being the boss.  Even when the dog got older, he would STILL be chewing constantly.  Apparently nothing worked, so the family just had to live with his uncontrollable behavior.

When the family eventually had kids, this is when the family questioned whether it was a good idea to keep the dog, since Marley would not settle down for anything.

What's surprising to me, is that, the ending is *extremely sad*.  Trust me, for all you dog lovers out there (including me) the ending to this film will make you cry.  I promise it will.  In fact, this ending hit WAY too close to home since I found myself in the same situation three years ago, with the same kind of dog, and the same kind of ending happened to me.

Because of the ending, I'm not so sure it's a good idea for animal lovers to watch Marley and Me.  You can sense an ending like that was going to happen eventually because throughout the movie there was this eerie and awkward silence that seemed to indicate it was drawing near.  I just don't want to spoil the ending and reveal what that ""it"" is.

Marley and Me is a fantastic movie with a shocking ending, and a movie that should only be watched if you can handle such a sad ending.

3775740,4,B001REZM74,"Rated PG, a 2008 widescreen 2 disc release, this movie about a doggie and his family covered a 14 year period and starred Owen Wilson (John Grogan) and Jennifer Aniston (wife, Jenny Grogan).  Special performances included Alan Arkin as Sun Sentenial newspaper editor and Kathleen Turner as a dog obedience trainer. It was cute and entertaining.  It was not fantastic but it was good.  Most of the movie I would rate at a 3 or 4, but the last half hour or so was really good.  I recommend you have a box of Kleenex handy for the last 30 minutes.

I expected the story to be more about Marley and although there was plenty about him, it really revolved around the life of a family that Marley was a part of.  It was not as funny as I expected it to be because it went into the struggles of a couple as their lives moved forward.  Nothing wrong with that, but just not what I had expected.

A young married couple, both Journalists, move to Florida, and buy a puppy.  Marley turns out to be a wild man.  He even gets thrown out of obedience school.  The couple have children and go through things that young couples do, as they all grow together.

There were 22 Yellow Labs used to make this movie, about half of them being puppies. Most of the pictures of full-grown wild Marley were of Clyde.  Jonah was the calm Marley. Rudy is the older Marley, who was actually about age 10 and was mostly unsociable.  Rudy is also the Marley who poops in the ocean.

3775744,5,B001REZM74,"I find the number of negative reviews here shocking.  I'm among the multitude of people who are grateful that this touching, wholesome story made it to the movie world.

ACTING

This movie stayed very close to the book (better than could be expected in the time-frame alloted).  The acting, I feel, was superb.  Forget the discussions about weather Wilson or Aniston were as creative in this film as they were in ""Blah blah blah"" film.  Here they played the parts of real characters from a real story of real people who experienced real, less-than-perfect lives.  I believe that every individual actor in this film carried out his/her role well.  Admirably, even.

DEATH OF MARLEY

This is reality, folks.  All of us who live with and love animals face this loss and grief eventually.  In this movie, the euthanasia scene couldn't be more peaceful.  On the contrary, think back to Old Yeller.  Remember how that movie ended?  He was rabid, snarling, growling, foaming at the mouth---and was SHOT.  Yet Old Yeller remains an American icon.  In Marley & Me, the end is gentle, peaceful, dignified.  I believe this gem is one of the best family/animal films we've had in a long time.",1252454400,5,1180,4.786069651741293

I won't give you a review of the film but let me tell you, if you are a dog owner this will make you just want to snuggle your dog and not let go! Even if you love your dog dearly, you'll appreciate him/her even more once seeing this beautiful film.

3775747,2,B001REZM74,"While they did all the right things technically, this movie lacked the emotional development necessary to really engage the viewer in both story lines - Marley's development and the family's.

Apart from a few seconds of initial adorable puppy hooking you in cuteness, Marley is a manic, uncontrollable animal, and there is no plausible development as to why he is this way. There just isn't enough balance devoted to all the other parts of Marley to make enduring and ultimately bonding with him worthwhile.

The family's character development is equally two dimensional. Wilson and Aniston did everything they way they were supposed to to recreate the character of the book, but this is a good example of a movie that should have taken some liberties.

Overall, very dissatisfying movie.",1251158400,,789,5.10077519379845
3775748,3,B001REZM74,"I'm not overly fond of this film, though it wasn't disastrous, either.  Marginally marketed as a kids' or family film, it's not, really.  The themes of the story surround the dramas of a young couple struggling to have children, to be happy in their jobs, to feel personally fulfilled, etc.  What is at the center of their lives unfolding is Marley, the dog who keeps it all interesting in sometimes really annoying ways.  While the story is heartwarming and doesn't shy away from the subjects of loss, interpersonal conflict, and death, it moves terribly slowly with a lot of superfluous scenes.  The film also seemed to struggle with being a comedy or a drama.  It would likely have been stronger had it picked one and stuck with it.

3775760,2,B001REZM74,"Last night I rented this DVD thinking it would cap off a great day of golf with my significant other who is a significant dog lover. (Small price considering no dogs are allowed in my co-op).

The first hour was about actor Owen Wilson buying a puppy so his wife, played by Jennifer Aniston, could take her mind off having a baby. The breeder offers them a discount on one dog, which they take. (Big mistake)! The puppy is an obvious terror, destroying garage storage, pillows, venetian blinds, even answering machines and curtain swatches. While they cannot afford a baby, they seem to do pretty well in replacing couch cushions and anything else made of cloth. (At this point I would have taken the mutt to Bide-a-Wee). The highlight is when Marley is taken to obedience school where he jumps the trainer, former real-life vixen and actress Kathleen Turner whom he takes for a French poodle, doing to her leg things humans can get arrested for in public. (Marley is thrown out of the training). Unfortunately, that is the high water mark (sorry) of the humor in this film except for the dog sitter who becomes rabidly distraught after caring for Marley for eleven days.

The movie then focuses on the author's career in journalism and his family. We begin panting, wondering where the dog is, and then Debbie started barking at me because she thought it would never end. Shortly after, she rolled over on the love seat and played dead. (I got up to make sure she hadn't started chewing the upholstery). I was so bored I was ready to go outside and start eating grass.

The dog returns as the main character in time for us to see him get old, and die after having a life of mayhem, and eating too many appliances and mangos. Naturally the kids have become attached to their dog and miss him as all kids do. Debbie began to cry. I began to howl with delight that this film had finally come to an end. It was 30 to 40 minutes too long, even in dog years. And then to discover that they had deleted scenes? They should have had even more of them! Even the out-takes belong in the doghouse.

Stick with the book or get a cat. This movie is a real dog.

Whoof!

We thoroughly enjoyed reading Marley & Me.  I enjoyed it so much that I read Grogan's memoir ""The Longest Trip Home"" as well (a recommended read by the way).

I picked up the Marley & Me DVD to watch with the family.  I remembered the ads saying something that made me think it would be ""great family entertainment"".  I assumed that the movie would be made more in the style of the kids version of the book - WRONG.  While I appreciate that they don't get too graphic and show the murdered neighbor scene, or too much detail with the stabbed neighbor, I found a number of scenes that I thought ""why did this need to be in here""?  I really wish that the movie would have truly been geared toward family entertainment and therefore G rated, or decided to not market it as kid friendly and gone with a PG-13 rating.

Scenes that provoked inward groans of ""why did I get this movie?""...Anniston and Wilson rolling around on the bed passionately kissing and talking about sex (alot).  If you think these things will go over your kids' heads - think again and be prepared to talk after the movie.  Also - why show Marley being euthanized?  Again, I think this went more to the PG-13 edge of rating than the G side.

Hope this review helps you to make a more informed decision as to whether or not it is ""family friendly"".

For those of you who are just wondering if this is a good movie...If you have not read the book, you may enjoy the movie.  If however, you read the book and laughed out loud and maybe even cried as I did...don't spoil that good memory by watching the film.  The movie was loosely based on the book.

3775778,4,B001REZM74,"After all the hype around the movie, I finally got around to seeing it.  In a nutshell, it is a movie that shows the arch of a couple's life who happens to have a dog.  The story itself isn't anything out of the ordinary.  The characters in the movie are just regular people that we probably all know.  Marley, although the 'Grogans' will beg to differ, is just an adorable lab just like yours and mine (Okay he may be a tad bit crazier).  The seemingly 'normal' story of a family is what makes the movie unique.  The movie spans for about 15 years.  It starts with a newly married couple starting out in their careers.  At this time they adopt a puppy.  And the puppy goes through the great journey of life with this beautiful couple: having babies, new job, old job, marriage struggles etc.  The movie definitely runs at a different pace to other movies.  There's no huge drama, there's no hilarious and frustrating struggles with crazy in-laws.  Nobody cheats on anybody.  Nobody chases anyone driving at a thousand miles per hour.  Nothing traumatic happens.  Basically, there's no climax.  But that's probably more realistic.  As other reviewers say, Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson make a nice couple.  And the last scene of Owen Wilson with the dog is just so touching....(sniff)

The couple demonstrated the everyday life of a married couple that included the ups and downs. I would think the arguments and constant sadness would turn kids off. The dog mainly lead the audience to believe this movie was family oriented with the dog on the front cover and all during the trailer. This movie would be excellent for young adults and adults who are tired of movies with sex, drugs, and violence, but not clean enough for kids. Did I forget to add this movie will have kids asking where babies come from? After watching with your kids it may be sooner than you think. I guess their tactic was the movie would sell  more copies if the audience was targeted to kids and adults, but I think they should have only targeted an older audience since some things shouldn't be heard or seen by children. Aside from audience differences, THE MOVIE WAS VERY REFRESHING AND VERY ENJOYABLE. IT'S A MUST SEE MOVIE, SO DON'T BE TURNED OFF FROM SOME OF MY NEGATIVE GRIPES.",1244246400,,1664,4.528239202657807

Generally, when books are made into movies, something gets lost in the translation from book to screen.  That said, I didn't have high expectations.  With a PG rating though, I thought it would be 'safe' enough to allow my 5 and 6 year old to watch Marley's antics.  How wrong I was.  We ended up turning it off about 20 minutes into the movie.  The sexual innuendos aren't the kind that go over the kids' heads.  They were pretty blatant, which was surprising given its PG rating.  This should have been PG-13, no question.

Not so with this group. The film was mis-named and dreadfully miscast, among other things. It was not about two dogs, but three. One, Owen Wilson, the others: Ms. Aniston and Marley. Amazingly of the three, Owen never gets a hair-cut in the passage of several screen years, while Ms. Aniston constantly fights with her fore-locks to master her angry lines throughout. What not to do with dogs while trying to humor us comprises most of this haphazard plot. I will spare you the excrutiating details.

3775797,2,B001REZM74,"Right off the bat, let me warn you that ""Marley & Me"" is certainly not a family comedy as the advertising tries to show it to be. I own over 2,000 DVDs in my collection and I've watched thousands more that I got rid off, traded or sold so I've seen my share of movies - both moving, outstanding, average and lousy.
I want to tell you how disappointing it was for me to watch this mislabeled supposedly comedy with my wife. I laughed maybe a couple of times. The other times we were shocked with how depressing this movie was to sit through. For one Owen Wilson in real life attempted suicide before he got this movie role. That gives you an idea where this movie was headed. This labrador was cute at the beginning of the movie as a puppy and then out of control the rest of the way. I wanted to call Cesar Milan ""The Dog Whisper"" to get this lab under control and maybe a marriage counselor for Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, both acting irresponsible most of the time,, having no clue how to handle Marley. It was not a fun movie to watch. You hear both of them arguing and fighting about his out of control dog for most of the movie. It was about real life, drama more than a comedy. I wanted to get rid of the DVD even before it was over. This movie is a good one to watch to deter you from getting married and/or getting a labrador. Other dog and animal movies after watching them you want to go out and get a pet like just them.
The cover of the DVD is also misleading, Marley looks like that for only a couple of minutes at the beginning as a puppy. He is already bigger when Owen takes the lab home.
The only redeeming value for this movie is the last 20 minutes or so when you know that Marley is doing to die. My wife and I are serious pet lovers, we have one dog and six cats, they are our babies. We had to put our beloved cat Pete down last Sept. and it crushed us to do that. To put him to sleep was not anywhere as peaceful as the movie showed. Pee who was a such a loving Siamese cross breed, jerked violently, threw up and pooped when the final injection was given. Pete was such a loving cat and it watch him die like that was such a shocking experience, one that pet owners should never have to endure.
But saying goodbye to Marley brought tears to my eyes as I heard the last goodbyes. It's hard to say goodbye to a family member and friend.
The two ""stars"" for my review are mainly for the last minutes of the movie. It moved me to tears, it certainly got to my emotions.

So, if you do not want to know about things that happen in the movie, don't read the review.  Below I will tell you about the movie to the best of my ability.  I hope that it helps you decide whether or not you want to watch.

The movie is great.  It's about a couple who get married.  The married man is out one day talking with his friend who tells him the next thing his wife will want is a kid.  They decide that getting a puppy will take her mind off it.  So the man gets a puppy.  Through the movie you get to see the couple learning to live and deal with a dog.  You also get to see them at their job.  There kind of competing with each other.  They are both writers.  Then you see them have kids.  You get to see how the mother takes leaving her job to watch her kids.  She has some problems.  It causes her a lot of stress.

The movie spans over some years.  You see their kids get a little older.  While the main characters never really look any older, you see the dog aging.  They did a good job with the dog.  You really feel like your watching their life.  As I said, the movie is sad.  But I think it was for a reason.  The man sees his life as it was and realizes that now he can look at the way his life will be.  I hope I didn't give too much away.  It is a very good movie.  I think family's can watch and enjoy, and maybe walk about the things that happened.  My step dad, mom and I were crying at the end.",1242604800,,1528,3.819935691318328

3775815,1,B001REZM74,"Marley and Me reinforces the reason why I do not see a movie that has been made from a best seller. I adored John Grogan's book about the antics of his loveable, adorable, yet rambunctious lab.  But I cannot believe that Mr. Grogan is just a bit put off by the movie. (Had there been no financial compensation, I am sure he would have hated it). I was watching this with my 9-year old son, but clearly this is not a family film and he completely lost interest early on.  The book simply is not about the dog, but about the couple that brought him into their lives. The miscarriage, John's birthday party, and the wife's never ending complaining about everything became the focus of the storyline. They were not likable and the love that was clearly developed properly in the book NEVER came to be in the movie.

I forced myself to finish the movie, hoping that it would redeem itself, but that was not to be.

3775819,4,B001REZM74,"I watched ""Marley and Me"" a couple of times over the past few days, and it's easy to see why this film earned 5 stars from some reviewers and 1 star from others.

Here are some things to consider if you are thinking about picking up a copy of this DVD:

1) This film is about a huge, strong, active dog and the two people that he ""owns"".  If you are a dog-owner/lover, that should be a plus for this film for you.

2) If you are not a dog owner or dog lover, this film will confirm all of the stereotypically bad things you have ever seen or heard about dogs.

3) The dog-centered ""one-joke"" storyline has a tendency to get old after a while - you know, dog runs, owner chases, dog runs, owner chases, dog chews things up, owner...you know.  If I had a dog like Marley it'd drive me crazy.

4) Of course, the film runs full circle and eventually highlights the bond that often develops between people and dogs, to the extent that dogs are taken into our inner family circles...and all that bond brings with it.

5) There are, I must say, some memorable lines and scenes in this film, some of which can make you laugh out loud.

6) I liked the main actors and their characters, but, to be completely frank, Owen Wilson's hair bugged me all the way through the show.  Don't ask me why...maybe it's because I expected him to do some growing up and developing as the film moved along...but that never happened

7) My favorite character in the film was Alan Arkin - the somewhat crusty newspaper editor.

8) Lastly, who is the film supposed to target?  From the DVD cover you'd expect this to he a children's movie.  That's not the case...while it may look like it's being marketed to the younger kid crew (elementary school or younger ages) this is not a film for little kids.  I'd say that the appropriate audience for this film should not start much below 12-yr olds or so, since there are some dicy scenes that make you wonder even about them.  At the same time, this film doesn't really target grown-up audiences either!  I found some of the bits to be funny and engaging, but at other times, mainly adolescent.  And this film doesn't work just for adolescents...our teens watched it, and they thought it was ""cute.""  That's it, ""cute.""

Anyway, it does work to some extent for audiences from older children through grown-ups.  It does generate a wide range of emotions, and highlights some of the major challenges of getting started, working, rearing a family, and surviving ""the worst dog in the world.""

I think that most people will enjoy this film, but it does not rate 5 stars, or maybe even 4 atars in my opinion...hm...3.5?

I am glad that I saw this film. but I can't say that I'm going to go out of my way to recommend it to anyone...so, 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.  Not great, not bad...perhaps a bit above average.",1241740800,,2832,4.4123314065510595

The last  scene of the movie, shows Marley's interment, at which the heartbroken family place some of their most treasured posessions on his coffin.  For anyone who loves dogs and children, viewing this  movie will prove an unforgettable, even if tearful experience.",1241395200,,767,5.186991869918699
3775831,4,B001REZM74,"My review title really doesn't have much merit as far as I'm concerned, since I tend to cry very easily, but in general I think that this is one of those films that will make the `manliest' of men tear up.  There is something about that four-legged bundle of fur that will get you every time, and I'm sure most men can remember the attachment they had to their first dog (and even their second, third and so on).

It's that sentiment that carries `Marley & Me' to home plate.

Adapted from his bestselling book, `Marley & Me' tells the story of John and Jennifer Grogan.  Shortly after getting married and moving to Florida, John discovers that Jennifer has her whole life practically planned out in a series of `steps'.  Her next step appears to be parenthood, which is a commitment John is not sure he's ready to handle.  Insert Marley, an adorable Labrador puppy who serves as a distraction from Jennifer's biological clock.  That puppy, as rambunctious and disobedient as can be, is also as precious and irreplaceable as can be and he accompanies the family on a whirlwind of experiences.  He becomes a defining character in the Grogan's lives, cementing himself as a family member (as Jennifer so beautifully puts it at the films closing).

There is a lot of good here.  The acting is all very well done, especially by Jennifer Aniston.  I have to say that Owen Wilson is an actor I have a hard time taking seriously.  He is a `funny guy' and so when he does drama (which isn't very often) it's not very believable.  Much like his character (who has a knack for surprising even himself), he surprised me here.  I actually felt his emotional connection to the material, and he is especially effecting in the more tender and dramatic scenes, which is not something I expected.  Jennifer Aniston is in top form here, nailing every ounce of her characters emotional well being.  She is quirking and fun and she is frustrated yet lovable, and she is even borderline insane, all the while remaining wholly believable.

And then there is Marley, cute, lovable, `want to strangle him' Marley.  Without the dog this movie wouldn't work, and all 22 of them work magic on every frame.

I do have a few minor issues with the film though, so I'll get into those here.  I wanted more from Alan Arkin.  I'll just get that off right now since it is the least of the films issues.  He's not a big player and not a priority, but I rather like his dry sense of humor and so I expected a lot from him.  He was kind of dull here.  The bigger issue I have is with the script work.  For the most part it's very well done, mixing well the Grogan's life and their life with Marley so that it felt less like a `dog movie' and more like a movie about people who own a dog.  The thing is, at times the film can feel like it's taking on too much.  It starts to run long in the end and there are sections of the film that feel redundant because they are taking on too much.  It's not `frequent' but it is enough to become noticeable.  I few tweaks and some cutting could have helped the movie a tad.

That said, these few faults don't take away from the films finale, which is a whopper.  Overall I really liked this movie.  It was very, very good; nearly great even.  For any dog lover, this is a must see; but more than that, if you are a fan of family fare that is moving, heartwarming and memorable then this is a movie for you.",1241395200,2,3407,4.374203821656051

It reminded me of my yellow lab and the mischief she got into like tearing up a very full waterbed.  The smile on her face said ""Look Mom, see what I did"".",1241308800,,481,4.052631578947368

Unfortanutely, I must agree with some of the reviewers here that this movie should not be shown to anyone younger than 13.

My reason?

The ending of the movie. Waaay too intense and sad for young children. It was extremely painful for me to watch, and was not one of my all time feel good movie expirences. No happy ending, where a ""Marley 2"" appears, just a very sad and tearful farewell.

Don't get me wrong here. I loved this movie. We need more ""Slice of life"" pics out there. But if you show it to your young ones, you should forewarn them that this is not a happy movie.",1241308800,,705,4.358778625954199

3775848,3,B001REZM74,"Who cried when Ol' Yeller got shot? Come on. Admit it. You did, didn't you? I cried my eyes out. So it shouldn't surprise many that this film (and the book it is directly based on) can get that lump started in your throat and make your eyes well-up.

The correlation between being a pet owner is strong. Most of us probably had a dog when we were growing up and that poor mongrel must've meant a lot. We always remember the name of our first dog-love. We played with `em, fed them, and watched them grow old and die. It is a powerful moment in all our lives to witness the death of a beloved friend, be him human or not.

So MARLEY & ME drills right to the core of that relationship. I don't fault the writer or director for using this type of ploy. It gets the audience seriously involved at an emotional level. Have two wannabe parents decide on their first dog (Marley). Raise him along with themselves, their careers, and their children. Watch him terrorize and destroy your home, your privacy, your car (insert laughs), and then have him slow down as he begins to gray. Finally, the decision comes: what to do with the old guy when he can't raise himself onto his feet anymore. Watching kids say goodbye to him will be the highest emotional point for most film viewers; I can feel that old knot starting in my throat already!

The great thing about the film is that it does touch on those memories we have. I have such great ones of my first dog that I broke out some pictures and looked at them after watching Marley & Me. But it didn't make me want to buy another one. I don't own a dog and don't want one. They do exactly what Marley does: they die on you.

The downside to the film is that it is completely predictable and only so-so acted. Much of the book is incorporated so lovers of the novel will probably cheer about that. But there were some edits, obviously. The only one that bugged me was when Marley and owner John Grogan (Owen Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cars/dp/B000V1Y43W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cars</a>) went to find out about a crime in their neighborhood which eventually made John and his wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Break-Up/dp/B000HCPS94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Break-Up</a>) decide to move to another, safer area (in the book this is pretty well spelled-out but in the movie it isn't clear why they move).

It was good BUT not as good as I thought it was going to be and here's why. The first 45 mins to an hour was great because Marley was very cute and the movie was just full of humor. I think most of the funny parts were on the previews. After about the first hour the movie started getting kinda dull and boring. The focus stopped being about Marley and started being about Jen's and Owen's character's marriage and family problems. Marley just kind of faded into the background which I thought was unfair. I think they could of cut about 30 mins out of the movie and it would of been a great movie.

There are some adult situations and adult language in the film so I wouldn't recommend younger viewers watch this movie or it may bring up some sex questions you'll have to answer.

Overall I think this movie was good with potential that it could of been great. Marley and Me is still worth the purchase. There are some very funny and cute parts in the movie BUT there is also a VERY SAD part at the end of the movie.

My 6year old and I began to watch it but after a long day of work and being sick, I dozed off and woke up to a scene such like, ""lets make a baby [kissing, mmmmm, aaaah and on the bed together]"" or the next scene something like ""are you guys are trying to have a baby, are you having sex yet?"". I'm a liberal parent in the idea that I talk to my child about a lot but come on!

In the promotions, this was never obvious. This movie appeared to be a kid movie about a dog that only it's owners could truly love and most people I've spoken to agree. This movie is rated PG, I expected a small amount of profanity but goodness, my kid hasn't been curious yet about where babies come from; But thanks to the producers and raters of Marley and Me, if your kid wasn't curious or you haven't been honest, he could be interested now. Can kids just be kids for a while!

And we wonder why the teenage sex/STD/pregnancy rate is through the roof. LET THEM BE KIDS!

Maybe after I get past this annoyance, I can try to enjoy the movie for it's humor, WITHOUT my 6 year old unfortunately.

I absolutely loved the movie, but NOT for my 6 year old. It should have been rated PG13 so parents would know to expect a little maturity.",1240963200,4,1265,4.109311740890688

Throughout the majority of the film, Marley, the family's dog, appeared to be troublesome and annoying.  Marley brought upon a very stressful environment due to the dog's disobedience and destructive behavior.  Even though his behavior was not top quality, it did create a never-ending list of hilarious memories and experiences to look back on.  I would never guess, as a viewer, that I would end up falling in love with this dog.  The movie's ending made everyone in the theatre cry as much as the dog's family did.  These tears showed that I was not the only one who loved this dog.

After I watched this movie, I realized that calling a dog ""a man's best friend"" is not just a figure of speech.  The husband temporarily worked as a writer of a newspaper column.  In his column, he wrote about his daily experiences he had with Marley.  How the husband interacted with his dog everyday and wrote about it shows the strong bond he had with his dog.  When he began to work for a different newspaper, he was forced to write about other topics.  By changing his angle of writing, he realized how much he enjoyed writing about Marley and how he took it for granted.  Over time, the husband realized that his columns documented his daily memories with Marley.  This was a wonderful touch to the story.",1240876800,,1374,4.510121457489879

Based on the memoir by newspaper columnist John Grogan, the film is the chronicle of a young family and their dog, Marley, easily the worst dog in the world.  He destroys furniture, eats through walls, jumps out of car windows, and is entirely out of control.  Yet to Grogan, played by Owen Wilson, and Jenny (Jennifer Aniston), Marley is part of the family, even as their three children come along.
 The movie follows Marley from puppyhood onward, and there are some very sad moments as Marley faces problems brought on by old age.  Yet most of the film is upbeat and very funny.

I thought the movie was kind of shallow and that I didn't really get to know the characters. There were some great scenes, but I just didn't feel close to them.

I thought the ending was way overdone and unnecessary.

3775871,3,B001REZM74,"There is a lot of controversy about this movie....it seems like people either love it or hate it. I'm in between....

I did not see Marley and Me in the theaters but being a dog-lover since I was born, I was interested and borrowed the DVD from my boss a few days ago as my mother wanted to see it as well.

For all you who have heard from lots of angry parents claiming ""false advertising"" and ""deceiving trailers"", I'd like to confirm that yes, that is somewhat true. If I had young brothers or sisters or children of my own, who wanted to see a cute and funny family dog movie, ""Marely and Me"" is not the movie that comes to mind here.

This for two reasons:

One, the movie's focus is on the marriage of a new couple and their struggles through a married life. It doesn't soley focus on the dog, he more so takes a backseat in most of the film, apart from the first hour or so. Children will adore the puppy Marley in the beginning, but their attention will go elsewhere when things get more serious after Marley grows up.

Two, is the mature content of the movie. There are several sexual references (nothing too explicit), some profanity, and darker scenes that are definitely too intense for younger viewers. I wouldn't suggest Marley and Me to anyone under 12...or any child who has not had ""The Big Talk"" yet. Because these scenes are most likely going to trigger the question that must be answered with ""The Big Talk"". Sure, innuendo goes right over the young ones' heads. But the last scene is the real clincher. It's going to have them crying so hard that it makes me say ""Please completely abandon the idea of showing the movie to a kid. They won't be able to handle it.""

My best suggestions for kid-friendly, family-friendly cute dog movies with HAPPY endings and very little adult content:

Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey
Beethoven (only the first flick)
Lassie (most mature of the three but will definitely touch your heart.)

Now that we've covered that fact that this is NOT a children's movie, onto the actual review:

It's good but it could've been a bit better. Again, for two reasons:

One, it's a bit too long. Cut a half-hour out and it'd be fine.

Two, the relationship between the family and the dog wasn't really developed enough in my opinion. Marley spent most of the movie destroying things and terrorizing people and I kept waiting for him to do something heroic or outstanding in order to redeem himself but...he doesn't, aside from a comforting scene here and there. When Owen Wilson's character comments to the vet that Marley stayed up all night to watch over their sick son, I was thought "".....what? Why didn't they show that then!?"" And because of this flaw, it really takes out much of the impact the ending is supposed to have. I'm a crier, a dog lover, and very sensitive. But the most I got was slightly teary-eyed. Marley and Me's biggest mistake was that it doesn't give the viewer enough time to fall in love with Marley before it's time to say good-bye to him.
.......although if you hate crying and feeling depressed, this COULD be a good thing.
Oh, did I mention that the dog's euthanasia scene is completely milked for all it's worth? Yeah. It's like the directors are doing everything possible to get you to cry that it almost feels insulting. They drag it out so far that I was saying to myself, ""Come ON...enough is enough...it's far too obvious...just STOP IT!"" I don't like to be beaten over the head with stuff. Owen telling Marley that he's a great dog as he dies was the thing that triggered my tears. The sad music and the home movies, and the children's euthanologies just made me roll my eyes and say ""...um....trying a little TOO hard now"".

So where's the good stuff? Well, it lies in the film's originality, talented acting, and ability to tell the realistic story of a any dog owner's life. There is something here any person who has raised a puppy can relate to-all through the parts of Marely's mischeviousness, I myself kept laughing and saying ""YUP, MY DOG DOES THAT!!"" Some of his antics are exaggerrated but not to point beyond disbelief-and that makes it even funnier. Comments like ""Now he's eating the floor"" and ""Now he's eating your briefcase"" had my family of three burst into laughter because as dog owners, we know what it's like.

The acting is GOOD. The characterization is GOOD too. Despite what you've heard, Jennifer Aniston is NOT Rachel Greene at all in this. She's an admirable, take-charge, responsible and independent mother, who as a human of course has her limits but she only complains ONCE about it. She also still looks pretty good for her age....I'd imagine that's a bonus for you men out there who like to look at her. *laugh* And the children are all very adorable and Owen plays a good father who even when he dislikes his job, puts his family first in every choice he makes.

As many have said before, this is a good movie to see with teenagers or significant other. The romance is well-done. But also see it if you love dogs or have owned one. Whether it's dogs, romantic love, or having a family, Marley and Me most likely has at least one thing any older viewer can relate to.",1240185600,103,5186,4.5504291845493565
3775872,5,B001REZM74,"My family got a Labrador just before this movie came out.  Our Labrador looks and acts just like Marley.  It was great to see that we are ""not alone"" with all the problems in raising a Labrador. We laughed at the funny scenes and we loved the way the movie (which is based on a true story) moved so smoothly into the real changes this family went into as they and the dog aged, and to the final end that I admit had me in tears for days.  This is a great slice of life movie.  It has funny, it has conflict and it has sadness, but it can't be trapped in one label such as ""comedy"" or ""reality"".. it is truly just a story of a family and all the emotions that go with that! I don't understand anyone saying they didn't like the acting.. this was the among best acting these two have done and they were very believable in their roles and as a team. If you watch this, realize that it isn't written as a comedy.  It was written by a guy who bought a dog and it follows how this fantastic challenging dog changed his life and the life of his family forever.",1240099200,2,1053,4.043269230769231

Marley begins his journey as a pup and goes through the entire movie making you laugh hard, feel for the humans including the ever increasing kids, realize that life is finite.  Just let it all hang out.  Trying to hold back your feelings will just cause hard feelings with yourself.  Don't do it.  I am so glad we decided on the two disk set instead of the other alternative.  It is a shame the deleted clips were not included in the whole movie but that would have cost the producer too much money and it is understandable.

One thing is for sure.  I have always wanted a big dog and this movie cured that feeling.  To think that one dog devastated several rooms of several houses is beyond understanding.  I'll stick with two under 10 pound Yorkies and be thankful for their presence and even presents.

Bottom line:  super dog movie with all the ins and outs of today's suburban lifestyles.",1240099200,2,1065,4.394871794871795

3775878,2,B001REZM74,"From the commercials and trailers, you think this is going to be a funny story about a cute dog that would be great for the family.  I sat down to watch this with my 11-year-old last weekend and we enjoyed about the first 45 minutes...

Then ""life"" started happening and the story quit being about the dog (true of real life but not necessarily what I want when I'm watching a movie)  -- the babies came along, postpartum depression episodes which were very uncomfortable to watch, mid-life crises and in the end...

For literally the last 45 minutes, my son and I were crying our eyes out... we were so depressed.  Despite the late hour, we had to pop in a Robin Williams stand-up routine just so that we could start laughing again.

Folks, don't let the cute dog and the funny trailers fool you.  This is a serious film that is bound to leave you feeling depressed.

Our dogs liked it though because we were so sad that we both hugged them for dear life just for the comfort factor and their fur was so absorbent!",1240012800,9,1015,4.390374331550802
3775879,2,B001REZM74,"This is a decent movie. I give this only 2 stars because of the misleading PG-rating and the treatment of this as a ""family"" movie. Otherwise I'd give it a 3.

After renting and viewing this movie with kids, my husband and I were shocked this was rated only PG! There is constant talk of sex, considerable swearing (b-word, s**t, etc), bikini babes, a womanizer, a dog humping a lady, the two main characters get naked and jump in the pool (some very brief breast shown). It even goes so far as they get it on in a room full of religious statues, paintings, and crucifixes on the wall. That's just wrong and I'm not even religious! They could've left those details out of a PG movie! It's just NOT for younger kids, as in under 13. After the number of times it was mentioned in this movie, I'm surprised my 8-year-old hasn't asked what ""sex"" is yet.  As parents we would say treat this as PG-13. Had we known it had so much of this in it, we would not have permitted our kids to see it! Disney movies are rated PG, and I'm talkin' cartoons. This is no where near as mild ...

As for the movie itself, it was okay. The acting was good. There were some very funny scenes (one of which was the humping dog and the kids turned and asked what he was doing). Not as good as the book, and it doesn't follow the book completely. For instance in the movie John gets the dog because he doesn't want his wife asking for kids. In the book he gets the dog cause she wants to make sure she can nurture something and keep it alive before trying for kids (she killed all the houseplants). Making him against kids is not true to his character portrayed in the book!

I'm glad I got the rental for free, looking back I probably would've regretted paying new-release price to see it. Decent movie for a couple or a family with older children. If you want a good PG movie for younger kids, where they don't discuss sex every 5 or 10 minutes, swim naked and have their honeymoon in a room full of crucifixes, I recommend ""Underdog.""",1239926400,3,2011,4.270341207349081

A) My sister has a friend who's dog is a whit elab named, Sonny and he looks JUST like Marly did, I call him my ""God Son"" and I dread the day if or when his time should come to go to that big puppy palace in heaven) and
b) I had to put a pet of mine down three summers ago and it still hurts to this day. Granted, my dog wasn't a lab (she was a grey & white schnoodle)but it hurt like hell even tho she was up there in years, the pain is still there.
BUT Jennfer Aniston & Owen Wilson work great together and they were absolutely adorable with the dog. You could just see how relaxed they were and that hey are animal lovers too.

The movie suffers a bit of an identity crisis, though.

- possible minor spoiler -

It starts out as a good romantic comedy, but gets quite sad towards the end (if you're a dog lover).  Our spirit was dampened afterwards.

The movie is from a grown-ups' perspective, too sad for a comedy, not dramatic enough to be a drama, not romantic enough to be a romance.  I don't know how to categorize it, but we didn't regret watching it.",1239753600,,656,4.508474576271187

3775886,4,B001REZM74,"Just goes to show you....on Sunday I swore to a whole room full of people that I'd never watch Marley and Me.

Why? Multiple reasons. A) I can not handle pets in jeopardy scenes. I won't watch Old Yeller, I cried over the promo clip for 8 Below. My mom always thought Lassie was my favorite show, but I always watched with my little heart in my throat and sweat glistening my brow. B) I'm sentimental and a sucker for anything that is designed to play my heartstrings. I've cried at Hallmark and coffee commercials along with a thousand movies. It's so bad that my family watches me for entertainment during sad scenes.

Marley and Me were never meant to be. But on Monday, a friend invited a few of us over for her birthday. Her movie of choice? Yeah. You guessed it.

I sobbed. Not even going to try to downplay the sad. My eyes were swollen for at least an hour after the movie ended. I didn't just cry at the end, I was leaking from the mid-point. I'm not even a natural dog person. That said, I like Marley and Me. I liked it because it didn't rely on just cheap ""cute"" pet shots to win over the viewers, instead it was a nicely fleshed out character piece. The Grogans struggled with life in quite a few scenes and I was there with them. I didn't grow as attached to Marley as I might have, and this is a good thing, any more attached and it would have been too, too sad, because the filming covered about a dozen years in highlights.

Some of the scenes were hysterical. Some also hit a little close to home. Alan Arkin cracks me up. I love his delivery. Only one caution...I watched this film with an eleven year-old and cringed a few times. The language is mild, but there is some. The situations are PG-to PG-13, but there are a few uncomfortable moments, especially with a child in the room. So, parents, don't assume this is G-rated Disney family friendly. If you are concerned, check it out first.",1239667200,5,1910,4.326815642458101

3775888,1,B001REZM74,"First, shame on the studio who advertised like a family movie! The kids only cared for the beginning and the tear jerking end. A total of 30 minutes perhaps. The dog was barely the focus of the movie and I do mean barely (if at all)...it was more about Wilson's life and his relationship with Aniston (far too realistic and dreary, much of the sexual content was unnecessary) and then finally their relationship to the dog. Pass on this movie...

It seems that this movie made the majority of people feel bad after watching it. ""Old Yeller"" at least celebrated life and was life affirming, where this movie missed the mark.

Personally, I think that if this movie is attempting to realistically show a family's arc within context of dog ownership then it failed terribly. Anyone who would allow a dog to be so wild will have little to no hope with their children. And what of the premise?? That having a miserable dog is ok because they were there while our lives were also miserable?",1239580800,13,984,4.5852272727272725

There is much talk and reference to sex, condoms, and other adult themes.  The movie in itself isn't bad, but not appropriate for my 5 year old.  It didn't even hold her attention very long, as Marley, although billed as the star, really isn't.  He almost seems like an incidental bystander in his own movie.  It is mostly about John's journey through life and marriage and fatherhood, which again, is fine in itself, but it's not the big deal it's made out to be and personally, I feel cheated.  Now I have to tuck this film away in a closet somewhere and tell my child I misplaced it so I don't have to start explaining what sex is, and what the reference to ""goalie"" means, and why John didn't want to be a father and how his philandering confirmed batchelor best friend gave him his best advice on how to ""slow down his wife's biological clock.""  Immature male bantering galore...and too many things for a parent to have to explain while watching a so called ""family film.""

It's really about how a dog can effect your life and be there through your ups and downs.  This is so true because animals love unconditionally.  Marley was a part of their family, just like my dog is a part of my family.  This movie is not perfect at all, but I enjoyed it because it was real and sincere.  It didn't show this made-up perfect family movie, it clearly showed typical problems that couples and families have.

This film was a suburbian hell and reminded me why I chose to live the way I do. There was no love between the couple and I didn't find the ""funny"" moments funny at all. There is nothing romantic about horrible animals and screaming and crying children. Furthermore, the final scene in the film was supposed to be a tear-jerker but it didn't warrant a single speck of moisture from my eyes.

3775894,4,B001REZM74,"This is a review of the single-disc DVD

Marley is really not the center of this film. To reverse the usual way a tornado is used as metaphor - Marley is the swirling storm that comes to define the quiet center of the movie. That center is the Grogans' relationship.

It's rare to find a movie couple that, for the most part, continues to respect each other and to take delight in each other through all the tumult of having children, maintaining a home, moving, struggling towards career goals - and a dog like Marley. But then maybe Marley really did bind them better by giving them some definable difficulty to exercise themselves on. Better to worry over the concrete vandalisms of a Marley than to dwell on all the vague resentments that can accumulate in a marriage.

So we see Marley giving people some focus of trouble, something to invest themselves in -  and therefore something to love. That essential love is what this movie is really about. In the end, this is a family film in that it's about a family growing up, loving, and growing older - together.

However, I do think it would be better to get the two-disc set with all the extras. I only got the bare-bones single disc. But I really would have liked to see more about the various dogs who played Marley, the training techniques, the interviews, and all the behind-the-scenes tidbits.

Then if you want to meet another animal who invited love by being a constant handful, you might read Sy Montgomery's bestseller, ""The Good, Good Pig.""",1239321600,,1505,4.617977528089888
3775895,5,B001REZM74,"This definitely was a really good movie. I have not read the book yet but intend to when I get home later this year. There were some weak scenes in the movie but overall the film was about how a family dealt with life's obstacles specifically with a very misbehaved dog.

  Those of us who have had the privelage to care for a dog know what I am talking about. My wife and I just lost our dog, Cooper, early last year. He was quite sick and we made a decision, like John Grogan did, to let him go on our terms: happy and without any further pain. This film was definitely by far not a children's movie hence the PG rating. What I don't understand is why the negative reviewers don't understand what PG means (uhmm, PARENTAL GUIDANCE, which means EXPLAIN to your child). A lot of other reviewers (and some commentators) are correct in that life is not a bunch of peachs & cream (my words).

  I also don't know what movie some of these negative reviewers saw but I sure didn't see any sex acts. Maybe they were actually looking for the supposed sex acts. I did see a scene of implied nudity but no outright nudity itself.

  Overall, the movie was really good. I personally am not a fan of Owen Wilson but I had to give him credit for playing the part of John Grogan well. I think that Jennifer Aniston also played her part well.",1239321600,,1328,4.258964143426295

3775897,3,B001REZM74,"First, let me start by stating that I did not read the book.  I am a dog owner and consider my dog a part of our family.  For me, this movie wasn't as good as the reviews here would suggest.  Many of us have had a dog at one time or another, so there is plenty in this movie to identify with.  My problem wasn't with Marley at all.  It was with Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston.  I never once forgot that I was watching Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston.  I didn't buy either of them in this film.  We never really got a sense of either character in this film.  My feeling is that many of the positive reviewers here either let their favorable feelings for these actors cloud their judgement or they let it be clouded by the fact that, as dog owners, they have gone through similar situations.

The story is OK.  Owen's character, John, is a newspaper reporter who takes a job that he is good at (columnist) even though he thinks he should be reporting straight news.  Jennifer plays John's wife.  She too is a reporter of some sort, however we never see these people actually involved in their work.  All we ever see of Owen's work is his brief, somewhat awkward, conversations with his boss (played by Alan Arkin).  There is a significant disconnect from the man and his career.  His career is a very important part of the story, yet I feel it was glossed over.  Jennifer Aniston never convinced me that she was a housewife either.  It's hard to ignore that she looks the exact same at the end of the movie as she does in the beginning.

So what does that leave us with?  Well, I guess it would be the relationship between John and Jen - sort of.  Frankly, their time together on screen wasn't magical.  In one scene at a doctor's office, there was a chance for an emotional connection between the two, but it never materialized.  Then the movie must have been a cute dog movie, right?  Wrong.  Marley wasn't really the star of this movie either.  To be fair, I don't believe that the story was intended to star Marley.  There's scenes of Marley getting into things, chewing furniture, and pulling his owners, but those scenes (of which there are plenty) aren't really about Marley.  I think the point was trying to be made to show Marley as a dysfunctional, but important member of the family.

We first see Marley as a puppy, and time goes by as the family grows with the arrival of three children.  The ending is inevitable.  Honestly, the last 20 or so minutes were the best part of this movie.  Only then do we see Marley as what he really was - a companion and family member.  It tugs at our hearts when Marley is in distress and the ultimate decision has to be made.  Many of us have been there, and it isn't fun.  A nice scene toward the end is when the oldest son watches old home videos and we see that Marley was there for every family milestone.  Marley was in every shot.

The last part of the movie made it worth watching.  I didn't find Marley's antics leading up to the ending to be all that funny.  We've all seen dogs pull their owners around and get into things they shouldn't get into.  Owen and Jennifer's reactions aren't particulary hilarious either.  That leaves us with the drama, which really isn't that dramatic.

If you're considering buying this movie, wait a bit.  It's sure to end up in the bargain bin rather quickly.  For me, watching it once was enough.  I plan on reading this book to see how it differs from the film.  The book was a huge hit, so I'm hoping that the book makes up for what the movie lacked.",1239235200,4,3544,4.350152905198777

If you didn't want your kids to hear bad words or see someone in a bikini, you should watch the film before they do, so shut up already!

Fitting all the detail from the book into a 2 hour film was a cumbersome task. Director David Frankel and the two leads do a fine job in bringing the Grogans' and Marley's story to the film. Marley And Me the film follows the story and the spirit of the book. Anyone's who's ever had a dog knows how important they can be to your life, and losing them is heartbreaking. If you loved the book, you'll love the movie. If you didn't read it, you'l find that Marley and Me is still a very good movie not just a 'dog movie'.",1239148800,2,692,4.2105263157894735

I was sooooo ashamed that I did not proof this movie before I let my 9 & 10 yr old daughters & there 2 friends watch it.

The last 30 minutes focus on the dog dying and dying and dying.... honestly with the parts my kid was able to watch - she ended up crying for another 30 minutes after we the movie ended.

3775903,5,B001REZM74,"Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson star in this remarkably funny yet poignant film about how a dog can change a person's life forever.  Owen and Jennifer star as John and Jenny Grogan, two aspiring newspaper workers who live in south Florida.  After their marriage, John surprises Jenny with a new yellow lab puppy. After they bring him home, John and Jenny soon discover that their lives will never be the same.

""Marley"" turns out to be just like most other puppies; getting into mischief, chewing on everything, and generally making a nuisance of himself.  John and Jenny decide to try taking Marley to obedience school, but that becomes a disaster in more ways than one, especially for the teacher.

As the film goes on, John and Jen's life begins to change, as does Marley's.  Soon, children are added to the Grogan household, and Marley begins to age.  He still retains much of his playfulness, but the aging process is catching up with him.  John and his family decide to leave Florida when John is offered a new job, and they settle in Pennsylvania.  Marley, who has become older and slower since the move, begins to have severe health problems, including a turned stomach which only a skilled vet can fix.  John is cautioned that if Marley's stomach were to turn again, she probably wouldn't be able to fix it.  Sure enough, the inevitable stomach turn occurs again.  In one of the most touching and moving scenes I can ever remember from a movie, John tells Marley, who is now awaiting euthanasia, what a good and wonderful dog he has been.

This is a very good movie.  Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are excellent as the Grogan's, and it was a lot of fun watching Marley cause so much mischief.  The ending, however, was difficult for myself, my wife, and our three children to watch.  We have recently had a dog die from pancreatic cancer, so watching John and Marley was extremely difficult, especially for my wife and children.  All of us had tears running down our cheeks at the end.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Dog lovers will surely enjoy watching the adventures and misadventures of ""the world's worst dog"".",1238976000,4,2144,4.71505376344086

Okay, I'm an older man and I found it a bit tough to deal with as I reflected on the cradle-to-grave relationship I've enjoyed with the dogs in my past.

Aside from the traumatic ending, I found the script to be better written than the book.  The understated, but high quality, humor was welcome in an era of over the top and gross out comedy.  The production value was good.  Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston were both charming.

The dogs - all of them - are just as cute as they can be, but so out of control.  You just wonder how anyone could really love such a destructive dog, and why did they not try harder to train him?  We don't see much of what makes Marley so endearing in his early years. As he ages he is just always there in the charming family scenes. What makes him extraordinary?  We need a speech by Owen Wilson to tell us that.

The acting is pretty average.  Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are an attractive couple, but neither really impresses.  Actually, the best performance is from the actor who played the older son, in a limited role.

Don't get me wrong.  I laughed out loud several times and cried my eyes out at the end.  However, the overall impression was of many good moments strung together but lacking cohesion.  I want to know more about this family and this dog.  It could have been a better movie - I wouldn't have minded a longer movie with more detail.",1238976000,4,1218,4.220779220779221

(1.) The author of the book, the script writer and the director must never have heard of the long running Animal Planet's ""Me or the Dog"". If they had they would not have presented such a misguided movie with regards to understanding and training an out-of-control dog. Which, incidentally, was suppose to be the central element to this story.
(2.) I had this unsettling feeling though out the movie that I was not watching real ordinary people dealing with a dog and life but actors characterizing people in some contrived unrealistic life. I just saw actors. A well directed and acted movie should move you into another world and not make you feel like you're a director observing acting class.",1238889600,5,734,4.833333333333333

The subject, the dog, is a jerk with no redeeming feature whatsoever - at least none demonstrated by the film. This movie is nearly two hours long, spends about an hour and forty minutes demonstrating what a worthless turd he is, and then its final 15 minutes showing the family inexplicably decompensating as he - whom the family has heretofore always regarded as a pain - dies. (And good riddance, I say.) The tear-jerking doesn't work, because the dog has never been shown to have a single redeeming feature. In any other country in the world, this destructive, stupid, untrainable, unlovable animal would have been eaten about 30 minutes into the film.

Their star power gets in away of this small movie about a dog. The plot in the book meanders some, but in a movie it drags down the pacing. I did like Wilson's line how he keeps surprising himself is a nice little theme of the movie. Arkin as the editor displays curmudgeon-like charm as the editor. Kathleen Turner brings a smile in a good comedic cameo as a overbearing dog trainer early in the movie.

The movie is a family movie, but it is about the entire life a dog. Parents need to be prepared to talk about how all pets eventually die after viewing the movie. I grew up with ""Old Yeller."" Children today can handle pets dying.

For me, as someone who owned/trained dogs, bad dogs have bad owners. Stunts that this mutt pulls would be extremely dangerous for real and would be a sign of some kind of doggy brain damage. So, this movie was not very funny in my opinion.

Owen Wilson - now he is working with animals; from Eddie Murphy to Jackie Chan, now pairing up with a (non-talking) dog. Next it will be puppets..

The ending - I knew this was coming, since the movie manages not to be about anything so the ending had to grab you emotionally somehow. Not for little kids (who will want to see this film).

Great  movie about a couple who marry and begin their lives together, and decide to start their family off with a rambunctious but loveable dog. Kids come along as the years go by and the dog grows along with them, as much a part of the family as the kids.

Of course, a dog's lifespan being what it is, the Grogans must say goodbye to Marley at the end of the movie, and some reviewers don't like that this situation was depicted in such a realistic fashion. This is like being upset that the boat sinks at the end of ""Titanic"". The ending of ""Marley & Me"" was a punch in the gut to me, but life does that to you. It's real. I say this as a person who knows what it's like to bury the beloved family dog in the back yard.

3775919,5,B001REZM74,"I read the book when it first came out. Oh, how I loved it, every page of it! Marley reminded me so much of my late Golden Retriever - the mischievous puppyhood, the easy-going adult years, the slower-paced - albeit with occasional bursts of energy and puppy-like playfulness - senior years... I could really relate to the author's experiences, and I laughed and cried out loud when reading the book. It took me straight back to the years I shared with my dog, I re-lived all the laughs and frustrations we had, and yes, also the inevitable grief at the end. Sad as it is, everything and everyone dies, that's just life.

I was so excited when I heard few months later that the movie was being made! I usually end up liking the books a lot more than the pictures, and I was prepared for some disappointment, but I was anxiously waiting for the movie anyway. However, I must admit that I was a little worried when I started to see the billboards and ads with the adorable Lab puppy that shelters will be full of discarded Labs in a few months... I was very relieved that the movie stayed exceptionally true to the original story and that it didn't have a fake happy ending!!! The movie really shows what life with a dog is like: lots of fun and games, but also tons of responsibility and expense; unconditional love and ample laughs, but also plenty of anguish and heartache. (I hope all the would-be dog abandoners got discouraged by Marley and did NOT rush to pet shops to buy puppymill products after seeing this movie!)

I never go to see any movie on the opening weekend but I made an exception for Marley. (I took a pack of tissues with me because I knew I would need them.) I laughed until my cheeks were hurting, and I cried my eyes out at the end, but it left me with a warm and fuzzy feeling, and most importantly - it made me realize how much I missed having a dog and for the first time in 6 months felt ready for a new furry family member. (I started to look for a new dog the next day and found her 2 weeks later.)

I loved the movie just as much as I loved the book, and I just ordered the DVD, so I can watch Marley again with my dog at the comfort of our home.",1238630400,,2176,4.213429256594724
3775920,5,B001REZM74,"Moving, enjoyable and heartbreaking!  Are you ready for for a film that is one heck of an emotional roller coaster?  `Marley & Me' is no doubt going to make the dog lover in you, laugh and cry!

""Marley & Me"" is film based on a New york Times bestselling autobiographical book by journalist John Grogan in 2005.  The film is directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"" and has directed television episodes for ""Entourage "", ""Sex and the City"" and ""Band of Brothers"" with a screenplay by Scott Frank (""The Intepreter"", ""Minority Report"") and Don Roose (""Bounce"", ""Single White Female"").

The film is about John Grogan (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston), two writers who are just married and they begin their years as reporters in Florida.  But before they have any children, Jennifer starts off with plants and then the couple move on to adopting a golden retriever who John names Marley (after reggae legend Bob Marley).

Marley is an active, always hungry, strong, quick and somewhat of a hyper dog who loves attention from his owners.  Of course, this leads Marley to causing a lot of trouble from breaking things in the home, eating the cushions of pillows and the couch, in one scene eating a gold necklace given as a present from John to Jennifer and even getting kicked out of obedience school.  But despite the trouble he may have caused, both John and Jennifer love Marley as part of the family.

But the overall film features on the 13-years of the Grogan family and growing up with Marley.

What works for this film is that it strikes the right chords for any couple or family that has had a pet in their life and knowing the love (and sometimes trouble) that a pet could bring into ones life, but cherishing the moment that the pet is with you, just like a family member.  From the beginning of when they were puppies to the end of a dog's life.

""Marley & Me"" is given special treatment in the Blu-ray release from 20th Century Fox as we are given a total of three discs.  The first disc is the Blu-ray, the second disc is a DVD and the third is a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Marley & Me"" looks absolute beautiful on Blu-ray.  With so much of the film shot outdoors and during the day and in a variety of locations capturing the beach life, the rains and even snow in Philadelphia, the film is just vibrant in colors and with the video featured in widescreen 2:35:1 at 1080p, overall I was impressed of how vibrant this film looked. Director of Photography Florian Ballhaus has experience shooting beautiful scenes from working on a film like ""Devil Wears Prada"" to working on television series such as ""Sex and the City"".  He manages to capture the mood, the action and the whole vibe of Florida and then later in Philadelphia.  There were a lot of shots filmed for ""Marley & Me"", especially during a segment where the film tries to explain how the couple has grown and as does Marley.  Overall, ""Marley & Me"" is very colorful and beautiful picture quality.

As for audio, audio is presented in DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio.  The film is primarily a dialogue-based film but also utilizes a great deal of music.  So, you really get a good projection from your front channel and center speakers when it comes to hearing the audio.  The Blu-ray also comes with the Spanish, French and Portuguese audio track in 5.1 Dolby Surround.

The film is subtitled in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

For the special features of ""Marley & Me"", the following features are included on the Blu-ray Disc:

  * Dog Training Trivia Track - When this is selected, you can watch the film with pop up trivia and facts about dogs.  Plus picture-in-picture videos with interviews with the trainers of the 22 dogs used in the film.
  * 19 Deleted Scenes With Director, David Frankel Commentary - About 26 minutes in all, the deleted scenes features optional commentary by Director David Frankel.  Deleted scenes include shots with Marley as a puppy but since the focus was to showcase the family and Marley grown up, the puppy scenes were cut.  Also, scenes with the couple's neighbors were deleted due to pacing and also what was important in the storyline.
  * Finding Marley featurette - An eight minute featurette with an Interview with trainer Mark Forbes and other trainers in regarding using 22 dogs who were Marley.  Half were puppies and half were older dogs.  Some were able to do scenes such as peeing on cue, humping on cue, etc.
  * Breaking the Golden Rule featurette - An eight minute featurette featuring interviews with Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, Kathleen Turner and others in regarding to working with children, working with dogs, about raising families and what made ""Marley & Me"" special.
  * On Set with Marley: Dog of All Trades featurette - A near three minute featurette featuring an interview with Marley.  An interviewer interviews Marley  with text bubbles shown above the dog.
  * Animal Adoption featurette - A five minute featurette about animal adoption with an interview with Dr. Pia Salk and tips on adopting a dog and also how purebreds can be found at animal shelters and how many shelters have improved over the years.
  * Gag Reel - A six minute gag reel featuring the group having fun on set and messing up on their lines.
  * When Not to Pee featurette- A two minute featurette about the segment featuring Marley having to pee in the Grogan's home after they return from Ireland.  The film used two dogs.  Clyde as the primary dog during this segment.  But since he can not pee on cue, the golden lab Brody was used.  The film was difficult to shoot and the featurette was about how difficult it was to get that one shot.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that watching ""Marley & Me"" was very difficult (mainly at the end).

Like the Grogan couple, I'm sure many couples can put themselves in the shoes of the Grogan's of raising dogs before children and for many years, the dog is part of your family and over the years, watching the animal grow.  But it's when the dog gets older and you notice how difficult it becomes for them to walk, to jump and its a very sad situation to watch your dog struggling to do things that you would remember them doing for so many years.  But of course, it's the saying goodbye to your dog when it's their time, that makes it so difficult and from my situation with my dog, it was nearly the exact same situation.  The feeling of being powerless but knowing that you want your dog to no longer suffer.

So, ""Marley & Me"" is a moving, hilarious and heartbreaking film.  It's definitely an emotional roller coaster of a film that you probably will want to have the tissue box nearby because if you are a pet owner or have lost a pet, those emotions will just come back and tug at your heart.

As for the acting, personally I found Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston fun to watch onscreen.  I've read a few reviews of the film when it was first released and it seems you have those who had pets really enjoying the film and those who never had pets wanting to see more focus on the couple.  Both talents have always been known for their work in romantic comedies but both had significant emotional scenes and for the most part I feel the pulled it off. For Owen Wilson, you get that sense of sarcastic bad boy from his ""Bottle Rocket"" to ""Wedding Crashers"" years but in the end, I felt he did a good job.

The film is not a film that has a deep storyline or a significant plot.  It's a story about life and a couple starting off as a married couple, raising a dog before they have children, the complications of balancing job and parental duties and financial worries.  These are experiences that many people can easily understand.

If there was anything that I did have a problem with the film is that at 115 minutes, it was a bit long.  And the fact that the film had so many deleted scenes, it could have gone longer.  But I'm sure it was difficult for Director David Frankel to decide what to edit out.  Because there were some deleted scenes that go into character development of John, Jennifer and even the neighbors and so, for pacing reasons, a lot was cut out already.  After watching the film, I wouldn't know where would I begin to cut out 10-15 minutes more.

Also, another problem was having Eric Dane's character of Sebastian who was important in the first half, all of a sudden being thrown into the second half.  Personally, it was scene that could have easily eliminated a bit of time in the final cut but I suppose the director wanted to show the difference of what if John chose career over family and pursued a similar life that Sebastian has lived.

But overall, I enjoyed ""Marley and Me"".  And on Blu-ray, the film really shines because high definition brings out the vibrancy of the film.  It's a colorful film and it just looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.

Bundled with plenty of special features and the fact that the film does come with a DVD (for those long commutes for the family) and also a digital copy, you definitely get a good deal with this Blu-ray release and I can only hope that 20th Century Fox continues with the 3-disc treatment for their Blu-rays (as long as it's priced affordably for the consumer).

There have been quite a good number of dog films with a similar feel of growing up with a dog such as the Japanese film ""Quill"" (which I highly recommend) and the film ""My Dog Skip"". But ""Marley & Me"" is a film that is just fun to watch but also is going to make you cry.

I enjoyed the film and if you are a dog owner/lover, I think that you will enjoy this film too!  ""Marley & Me: 3-Disc Bad Dog Edition"" is definitely recommended!",1238630400,5,9727,4.536739380022962

If you go into the movie expecting a comedy about a family and a dog and a happy-go-lucky ending, you might be disappointed. If you go into the movie with the understanding that the movie is basically a portrayal of a dog's life, you will have better understanding of what to expect and might enjoy the movie.

I never read the book, which I would now like to do, but based on what I saw from the movie I have to say I really enjoyed it. I might be a little biased, however, because I went into the movie expecting the worst. I was already told beforehand what will happen to Marley at the end, but what I wasn't told was how it would happen. As I was watching the movie, I kept expecting some untimely tragic accident to take Marley's life which would have made it more heartwrenching, but that wasn't the case. The dog was eventually put down, yes, but that was because he was old, he had lived his life to the fullest. And for people who are upset over this, they need to realize that nothing lasts forever, unfortunately, but as I mentioned before the movie portrays the dog's life from infancy to old age, and yes, death is part of old age. I've had a few good dogs die on me, some before there time, and sometimes the hardest thing a person has to decide is when to let their best friend go.

Another thing I wanted to point out is that they all had their second chance. They could have easily ended the movie with Marley's first visit to the hospital, but he came out of that okay. Sometimes that's all a person needs, is just a second chance to spend with somebody or something they love, to make amends for anything they might have done, and to say good-bye. I know what a second chance feels like because I've been there. And sometimes that second chance makes it easier to let go when it's finally time.",1238630400,5,1839,4.3246376811594205

There are definitely some laughs in the movie as well, and it's a good choice of actors.

After seeing just the ending of the movie, my hubby asked me why I would watch such a bad movie that shows a dog dying.  (This is a sad subject for us b/c we have an elderly dog in the house.)  But, in all fairness to the movie, I watched the movie because I had already read the book.  I KNEW what was going to happen in the end.  Therefore, I was sad about Marley dying...but I already knew that would happen.  Therefore, it didn't come as a surprise, and therefore I didn't cry nearly as much as I did when I had read it the first time.  Months and months (years?) before when I was reading the book to my dog-loving son...we were both crying quite a lot.  We weren't traumatized, cuz you know when you have a pet that you are going to out live it, unfortunately.  I wouldn't recommend this book or movie to a small child.",1238630400,3,1277,3.992094861660079
3775923,5,B001REZM74,"I read the book awhile ago, when it first came out. My love of dogs lead someone to buy it for me. It was a beautiful book. One that really captures your heart and makes you fall in love.
Then I heard they were making a movie. Sadly, I had a broken leg and had to be wheeled in a few days later in my wheel chair, but i was excited for what was to come. I was praying for a movie that didn't botch my beloved book.
And I was so proud that this came out.
This is a beautiful depiction of life with a crazy lab, and was quite true to the book. Yes, it wasn't complete, but.. it's a movie, there's only SO much you can sit through.
The ending, as I'm sure you all have heard, is QUITE a tear jerker. Everyone in the entire theater I was in was crying. Were any of the kids scarred for life? No. I don't see why people are making such a fuss about the ending (I had been through the same thing a few times, and worked in a vet hospital where it was done... it never gets easy). It's still a family movie (I'd be more concerned about my kids asking about the sex stuff mentioned in the movie). Dogs are part of the family, and *SPOILER ALERT* death is a part of life. *END SPOILER* People need to realize they have to man up, and tell their kids about these kinds of things. I think ""Marley"" has a great way of dealing with this.
I loved how  they had the ending-it was REAL LIFE. It was true and heartfelt. Another reviewer mentioned how at the end Marley did these great things, they never showed them. Antics are what make a movie, and to be honest, when you are living with your pet, you tend to talk and focus on all the naughty antics. It's when things get tough, you realize how much good they've done.
This movie is beautifully done, good for the whole family, and is worth it. Don't let the reviews for the ending scare you. It's part of the movie, and it makes it real. You'll enjoy it. And if you've ever had a crazy puppy.. you'll love it!",1238544000,3,1946,4.041450777202073
3775924,1,B001REZM74,"We all know that movies will always have the best clips put together for their ads to get you to go. However, THIS movie was FLAT OUT DECEIVING. Big time case of false advertising. I had the unfortunate experience of watching my own dog go through a horrible death and being with him when he had to be put down. I did NOT want to relive that experience through watching a movie that was advertised to be a COMEDY. It is NOT a comedy AT ALL. I don't like to put spoilers or ruin endings to movies in reviews, however I think it's important to warn people to NOT watch this movie unless they want to watch in detail a dog being euthanized. It's terrible that they would put that scene in a movie, and it is absolutely not okay AT ALL that they would put it in a movie that they're advertising as a comedy and a family movie.",1238457600,10,822,4.14375
3775925,3,B001REZM74,"I recently saw an online ad for this movie which proclaimed it ""the funniest family comedy"" or something like that.

This movie is neither family centric nor is it a comedy. There are moments of levity, but mostly it's about a young couple struggling to find their way in the world, with the dog as the glue that holds the story together.

It's not good for kids, unless you want to see kids LOSE it crying.",1238457600,5,407,4.342105263157895
3775926,5,B001REZM74,"Marley & Me is a movie about love and acceptance with lots of action, fun and the realities of life. The movie held my attention although I think they could have cut a few minutes off to tighten it up here and there. Nevertheless, the acting was very convincing throughout the movie. The cinematography works well for the crowded beach scenes in Florida as well as in the Grogan household when Marley the dog is running around like anything; and the choreography shines bright.

When the action starts, we meet newlyweds John and Jennifer Grogan (Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston) who marry during a rare springtime blizzard in Michigan. They are young and very much in love; but they decide to live in a warmer climate so they move to Florida. Once in Florida, Jennifer wants a baby; they also go to a woman who has puppies for sale--lots of them--and they pick the discount puppy that John names Marley.

And Marley sure is a handful--fatherhood is less stressful! We get many funny situations in which Marley chews up anything and everything, especially when he is restless. Marley simply can't be controlled; he even flunks obedience training school on the very first day! On another occasion, Marley swallows an expensive necklace John gives to Jennifer when she's pregnant with their first child.

Of course, we get drama that's much more human, too--and we see Marley becoming more and more of an equal family member going along with the family as they make decisions about their lives. Will John and Jennifer have more children; and will they always remain in Florida? In addition, look for a fine performance by Eric Dane playing Sebastian, a womanizer who befriends John after John starts working at a Florida newspaper called The Sun-Sentinel.

I must admit that although many of these amusing ""dog-run-amuck"" scenes might not be so funny if they happened to you in real life. For example, if you had a dog that completely destroyed your garage tumbling over your stored possessions, breaking some of them and even eating through drywall, your day might be so pleasant. In the movie, however, it works for a good laugh.

Moreover, the ending of the film is upsetting, especially for young children. I suggest that grown-ups talk to their children before seeing this movie so that they don't experience too much of a shock.

The single DVD version of this movie comes with a gag reel; and we get some deleted scenes, too.

Overall, Marley & Me gives us a tender portrait of a family that includes a dog as a true-blue member of the family regardless of how difficult the dog can be. The movie sends a great message about the importance of unconditional love; and I recommend this movie on DVD despite an ending that isn't exactly the happiest.",1238457600,5,2752,4.781052631578947
3775927,1,B001REZM74,"John Grogan's book, ""Marley & Me"" was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read! I laughed until my stomach hurt. He did a wonderful job depicting his life with his wife and his beloved dog, Marley. However, as much as I did enjoy the movie, I felt the rendition could have been truer to the book.",1238457600,7,304,4.169491525423729

Perhaps all kids wouldn't be in tears, but mine were. I know I was!

I would NOT recommend buying this as a gift for a child and their family if you haven't previewed it yourself to see if it's okay.",1238371200,7,498,4.123711340206185

3775931,4,B001REZM74,"I watched this movie(the single disc edition) on a whim thinking it was going to be a funny screwball comedy, which I don't usually like, but to tell you the truth, I watched it for the dogs. I just love animals and my pets, so I figured it would at least be mildly entertaining. It was a lot better and more heartfelt then I expected. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Anniston, but she was very good in this and Owen Wilson was his normal funny, sweet self.

If you have had or currently have any kind of pet, but especially a dog, I think this a great movie for you. For those without a pet, it might scare you! But it shows that no matter what your dog does, you still love him unconditionally, because they're a part of your family. You might want to ring their neck but they're just too adorable to be mad at for very long. The movie was laugh out loud funny and also heart wrenchingly sad at the end. It really spanned comedy into drama territory very nicely. Well paced and great acting.

The only bummer was that the single disc edition only has some deleted scenes and a not so funny gag reel. If I had the choice I'd definitely grab the 2 disc edition, but that's only for those who are really into special features.",1238198400,4,1223,4.2
3775932,4,B001REZM74,"There are quite a bit of extras on the ""Bad Dog Edition"" that fans of this film will no doubt enjoy exploring.

There is a collection of 19 deleted scenes with optional commentary by director David Frankel. We see John and Jenny go house hunting in Boca Raton. There is more footage of them choosing to adopt Marley. Naturally, there is more of Marley's antics as well.

""Finding Marley"" takes a look at the 22 dogs used in the film. One dog in particular had the most screen time. We see how his trainer got him to do various things and it is amazing to see how well trained he is.

""On the Set with Marley: Dog of all Trades"" is an ""interview"" with the dog that played Marley including on the set footage provided by a camera located on the pooch's head.

""Breaking the Golden Rule"" features the cast and crew talking about how Marley & Me is not a dog film per se but about the Grogan family. The cast speaks admiringly of each other and, of course, the dogs.

""Animal Adoption"" champions adopting your pet from a shelter or pound. It covers some of the things to consider when you want to adopt an animal. This is one extra that everyone should see.

""Purina Dog Chow Marley & Me Video Contest Finalists"" features footage of dogs doing all sorts of funny, goofy and adorable things that did not qualify for the Hall of Fame but were pretty entertaining in their own right.

""Purina Dog Chow Video Hall of Fame"" features the best of the best.

Also included is the requisite ""Gag Reel"" with the cast blowing their lines and so on.

""When Not to Pee"" shows how a spontaneous moment of dog urination was recreated and took two dogs and several takes to pull off.

Finally, there are some trailers.",1238112000,82,1698,4.396166134185304
3775933,3,B001REZM74,"I loved the book.  I am a Lab person...I have been trained by some great Labs over the past 35 years.

Having said this, after reading the book I went to this movie with high expectations.  I enjoyed the movie, but was expecting much more.  Biggest disappointment was the relationship with the Vet...The Vet in the book was the Vet from Heaven.  The movie did nothing to depict the actual relationship between the family and and the Vet, which was heartwarming to say the least.

The pace of the movie also seemed a bit forced, like they decided they only had 90 minutes to tell the story and skipped important anecdotes to get it in under the wire.  It is still a good movie with lots of laughs, but the book had so much more to tell.  Both stars did great with what they were given, but I left the theater with the feeling that some great scenes were left on the editing floor.

Still, I just ordered copies for all my family!!",1237939200,7,929,4.323699421965318
3775934,2,B001REZM74,"I decided to watch this movie because I am a dog lover, and grew up with all kinds of dogs, even a few ""bad dogs"" that might give Marley a run for his money.

While the movie certainly hits its emotional chords just right towards the end of the movie, the final scenes in the movie lead me to see just how disappointing this movie ultimately was.

All we see of Marley from pup to adult hood is a terror of a dog, a wild animal that refuses to be trained or tamed.  Chewing on anything and everything in sight and the complete lack of concern of his owners to do anything proactive about it just felt too comical, but not in the good way.  I felt like I was watching a BAD live action Marmaduke movie (as if there could be a good version of that!)

However, in the end when John is having his heart felt talk to Marley, we hear of all the great things Marley did, such as stay by the side of John's sick son for hours on end and more.  Yet we see none of these things in the movie.

As a dog lover, this is what disappointed me.  Sure, we all have had dogs that do ""bad"" things, but pups grow up and get past those things.  While it may have felt like a good idea to put only those bad moments in the movie, I feel sorely cheated out of a better movie because we didn't get to see the enduring moments that bonded Marley to his owners.  In turn, the movie fails to bond Marley to our hearts.  All we get to hear of those quieter enduring moments is in a few minutes of talking towards the end.

I realize the movie focused mainly on the crazy things Marley did, the things that were the focus of a newspaper column, but that's all this movie ends up being then...just a long series of newspaper columns focusing on just the bad things the dog did.  In the end, we are told Marley was a great dog.  Sorry, Marley, I am sure you were, but the makers of this movie didn't communicate that enough.  And this wasn't a great movie because of that.

Bottom line, don't get caught up in the emotional end of the movie...this movie has to stand up as a whole and a great, impactful ending does not make a great movie.",1237939200,9,2108,4.080097087378641

I loved it when they went to Ireland and left the dogsitter alone with Marley with notes on how to take care of him and just before they closed the door, they let the sitter know he was affraid of thunderstorms ( I guess they were affraid that if the sitter got to know the dog before they left she would not want the job )......sure enough it rained every day they were  away......the mess was amazing all the sitter could do was run out the moment they came home. Lets not forget the dog training session with Kathleen Turner....  OMG( Hysterical )I sat there through out the movie missing my dear sweet gental dog Oliver who I adopted ( part wolfhound/bearded collie ) who was my best friend and cherished. So the 1st part of the movie I was laughing and the last 3/4 of the movie I was crying my eyes out. I think my husband wanted to pretend he didn't know me....This was a wonderful movie

3775936,1,B001REZM74,"Here's a movie that promises in every way to be a family experience but unfortunately has no idea what it really wants to be. I'm still wondering exactly which part of Marley's life should have endeared us to him as he spends 100% of the time destroying something. That his owners decided to ever let him inside the house is astounding. That they ever found a reason not to give him away must have been explained in the movie's deleted scenes. I guess if they had actually bought a good dog they would have formally adopted him into their family (at least). I still can't believe the makers of MARLEY & ME thought it was a good idea to show us Jennifer Aniston's dreaded ultrasound results in progress. One of this days they should also explain to us what was the point of showing Marley being being put to sleep in wide detail, I thought I was watching DEAD MAN WALKING (or in this case, DEAD DOG WALKING). I guess the best way to describe this movie is as a biography of Marley's owner and frankly a bio about the writer of a newspaper column about dogs is hardly earth-shattering. I found funny how Owen Wilson was always shown depressed, even when he got the dream job, wife, kids, house with the pool & million dollar home in Pennsylvania. This is really not a movie for kids, unless you want to spend plenty of time afterwards explaining the sadder aspects of life.",1235520000,9,1371,4.444444444444445
