8188719,4,B000P2XMIK,"I gave this 5 stars as the program is written more for the english crowd and
yet, gives the viewer an indepth look into the mindset of the players involved.
This dvd should be watched with Battlefield Detectives for a complete understanding
of one of the most misunderstood battlefield failures in English history. The bravery
of the calvary shines through the incompetence of the commanders.
Good for history buffs. Video production is poor, but the information comes through.",1402185600,5,477,5.128205128205129
