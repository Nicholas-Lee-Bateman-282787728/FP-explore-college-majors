8467221,5,B005DNASRO,"If you have an interest in The Da Vinci code this is the collection to get. Deluxe extended editions of both movies along with just about every documentary produced examining the films and the history behind Da Vinci.

Whether you are a skeptic or just a film lover, you will find something in this set to enjoy.

Not sure why the bonus movie is The Devil's Advocate, but it's a great movie on it's own, even if it doesn't really have much to do with Da Vinci. I guess the theme of conspiracy and the supernatural does carry over between the two.

It will take you days to get through everything.",1311120000,,596,4.351351351351352
