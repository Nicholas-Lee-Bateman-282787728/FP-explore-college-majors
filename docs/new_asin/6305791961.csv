1085176,4,6305791961,"I saw this movie a long time ago on T.V., so when it was released on video, I had to have it! Although this movie is called ""Noah"", It's not about him. It's about Norman Waters, a widower with three boys. Hes a construction worker who cheats people out of their money. He's the last person you would have expected God to act through, but God sends a messanger to tell Norman to build an arc using the same blue prints Noah used so many years ago. It takes him a while to realise that there really is a flood comeing and that he does need to build the arc. As he falls in love with the owner of the local pet shop, and starts being the father his children need, the flood comes. Will he be selfish enough to leave everyone else to die, or is he a changed man? Tony Danza gives an outstanding performance as Norman and you are sure to love this movie! This price is great and the video comes in a clamshell case so you can keep it for years to come!",989798400,2,947,4.042553191489362

7896999,5,6305791961,"I bought it because of Disney, Tony Danza, and Noah. I keep it, and wish I could find a DVD version, because, the entire family (grandparents through grandchildren) enjoys it over and over again.
Through a fun story line, it teaches enduring principles of faith, family dynamics, loss, processing grief, ethics in the work place, personal responsibility and growth, social dynamics, love, and forgiveness.",1210982400,,405,5.34375

7897001,5,6305791961,"Disney and Tony Danza - a combination that guarantees entertainment!  Norman Waters, the widower with three sons and a not-so-honest construction worker, receives the test of his life when God sends a messenger to him.  The messenger must convince Norman to build an arc, as he will be sending the disasterous flood in the near future.  Norman responds like anyone probably would in the similar situation, but when he accepts his fate, his sanity begins to be questioned by those around him.  Eventually, a local pet shop owner helps him supply the animals for the arc, even sacrificing her entire savings and business for the project.... all while the two fall in love.  This project tests his relationship with his sons, with their various feelings about their dad's activities.  In addition, the community, friends, and business associates add to the complications of Norman's fate.  Norman cannot help to make some permanent changes in his beliefs and future actions, but you'll be surprised at the results.  This is an excellent movie, that does stress the fact that sometimes things may not quite make sense to others - but we all have to do, what we have to do.  There are many more levels to this movie that I can describe here in such a short review... so I highly recommend you watch this movie to obtain the full impact of it.  Enjoy!",1026345600,4,1345,4.783549783549783
