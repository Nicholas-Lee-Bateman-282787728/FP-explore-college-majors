Shout About Movies doesn't have a lot of immediate replay value (unless you buy the other discs) but it's extremely fun and I would recommend it to any movie...",1459296000,,267,4.469387755102041

8159111,3,B000KUO6NW,The Shout About Movies is extremely fun to play with a group.  The problem is that Volume 3 seems to be extremely similar to Volumes 1 and 2.  We thought this DVD was a duplicate of what we had just played.,1379030400,,206,4.0
8159112,5,B000KUO6NW,I love the shout about movie series! I own all of them. Hours of fun - only problem is that there are only 3 games on each DVD and once you play a game you can't play it again because it is the same questions,1327708800,,208,3.6444444444444444
