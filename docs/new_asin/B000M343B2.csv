2719065,3,B000M343B2,"After phenomenal ratings for the first season, the producers of this show recognized they had a unique creature on their hands: the television spin-off which is very strong in its own right. America just could not get enough of Mork and his zany antics.

 So, they sent Fred McConnell and Cora packing on a concert tour and attempted to up the `young adult' demographic by bringing in new characters for this 26-episode 1979-1980 season.

First, enter Remo and Jeannie.

The brother and sister duo work at the New York Delicatessen on Boulder's pedestrian Pearl Street Mall while Jeannie is being put through school. Mindy and Mork frequently stop by to chit-chat, eat and exchange advice.

Another is Nelson Flavor, an aspiring political candidate and Mindy's cousin. Being a political animal, I like him despite not being given adequate character development to realistically flesh out his role in this particular city. If Boulder is supposed to be the `counterculture capital' of the mountain states but the guy looks like a young Republican, there is no way he could ever get elected yet alone Mindy would be working for him (""Mork v. Mindy"" , ""Dial N for Nelson"") despite the family connection. Plus, if Fred still is getting weirded out by Mork, Nelson should definitely be running for the mountains after a first encounter!

One character who I just can't personally deal with though is Exidor, the lone member of the Friends of Venus, who somehow realizes that Mork is in fact an alien from another planet. I think that he was supposed to represent the 70's new age-cult phenomena and emphasize that even as Mork has adjusted to earth, he still was taking our planet's eccentrics at their own face value. Exidor is harmless, but he is definitely an eccentric. Perhaps it was part of the whole 70's bohemian thing, but I don't find `wacky people' with obvious mental health problems `funny'. Audiences were supposed to laugh at Exidor, but the way his lines are written he comes across as somebody being mocked rather than a nice person to `hang with.

All of the emphasis on new characters and people focused storylines did not completely eliminate the series' `concept' storylines. Since the 70's were the era when so much disability rights legislation was getting passed in America, there is an episode where Mork meets Mr. Bickley's blind son--and subsequently experiences his world (""Mork learns to see"").  Mr. Bickley was of course introduced last season, but apparently grew friendlier towards his neighbors because Mindy and Mork can now stand to deal with him.

Mork experiments with gender roles when he decides to audition for the Pony Express the professional cheerleaders for the Denver Broncos--who have traditionally been female (""Hold that Mork""). They are supportive of Mork's intention to attempt joining them as are Mindy and Jeannie, but Remo appears visibly uneasy with his friend's decision.

Then, Mindy gets targeted by a local hate group in ""The night they raided Mind-skis"" because she is Polish. Although this series wasn't as political as anything being produced by Lear-Yorkin, episodes like this do acknowledge that `bad' stuff happens even in `liberal' cities across America. Mindy's obviously shaken by the encounter, but comes away determined to continue being herself.

This season is the season which contains both the classic episodes ""Stark raving Mork and a Mommy for Mindy"". I originally owned these particular episodes on a long-ago issued VHS best-of-set, so I can now assure any remaining doubters that the picture and sound quality restorative powers of DVD make a very big difference for aficionados of classic television series. I can't wait to complete my collection of this entire television series.

Mork's future permanent job at the daycare center is foreshadowed in ""Looney tunes and Morkie melodies"" when he turns a spot reserved for Nelson's television campaigning into a variety show for children. It turns out that Mork has a natural ability for taking care of children! Throughout the episode Williams makes obviously kind-hearted but satirical allusions to ""Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"" in tribute to the impact Fred Rogers had on childrens television programing--and having grown up with both shows and Mr. Rogers now departed, appreciated the episode even more now!

Mork needs a paying job of his own too because he can't keep just living off of Mindy forever no matter how nice of a person he is. Then, in ""Invasion of the Mork snatchers"", he goes spend crazy, creating problems for Mindy who obviously doesn't have a lot of worldly possessions to begin with.  They are after all, only living in a two bedroom apartment in part of a renovated Victorian.

Finally, Fred comes back in ""The way Mork were"" he needs help with marital advice and ends up turning to Mindy and Mork for help!  Since traveling around to conduct an Orchestra did not work out (i.e the show's ratings slipped big-time) Fred returned with Cora and he is now dating women around the area.

Mindy realizes that she never fully got over her mother dying when her father brings over a woman named Kathy for dinner and announces that he plans to marry her (""A mommy for Mindy""). We never learn what she had died from, but this episode is very important because Mindy could remember her mom being sick and then permanently leaving her. Realizing that her dad did love her mom but needs to move on enables Mindy to then move on with her life and become friends with Kathy.

There are two `bad' episodes in this season. The first is ""Clerical error"" because the writers seem to have forgotten that Mork already got mistaken for a priest in the first episode of the first season when he encountered Mindy after her bad date dumped her on the side of the road and she was looking for somebody trustworthy to walk home with. The second is ""Little orphan Morkie"" because Mork now has to get married or else he will get deported, again revisiting confusion over the `alien registration' joke from season one; both were cute the first time but now have lost some air with replay.  Did somebody forget to write episodes and so thought they could get away with simply reformatting earlier ones from their own show? It's a good thing that Robin Williams and the rest of this cast--yes including the `newbies'---were so talented and clearly had great interpersonal chemistry with each other because such apparent script writer laziness would have and has easily killed many other shows.

In an era when there were only three networks, this season's ratings experiments were not as big a gamble as it would be today. No, everything ultimately did not work out as planned, but considering everything which could have happened (and did happen) to risk-taking popular shows, M&M survived to tell more tales of Earthling customs.

Considering there are only two seasons left in this entire series, I hope that the others are released ASAP. I initially was lukewarm about the original case coverings for the DVDs, but after this season's treatment where the discs have now been directly piled onto each other, wish for the original packaging.  I still consider it a crime of intergalactic proportions that this series continues languishing in Paramount's vault.",1179360000,8,7273,4.968724279835391
2719066,5,B000M343B2,"Following the success of season 1 season 2 of Mork and Mindy followed this time we return without 2 of the main leads notably Mindys dad Fred and grandmother Cora but the arrival of Mindys lawyer cousin Nelson would lead to some classic episodes in the season premiere Mork in Wounderland pts 1 & 2 which is a 1 hour special where he shrinks only to appear in a backward world of coulourful animals and a Mindy clone called wait for this yes you guessed right Mandy as the season progressed we would see the return of Fred and of course Cora as guest stars getting them ready to return as regulers next season

Roll on Season 3!!!!",1179273600,,631,4.3474576271186445
2719067,4,B000M343B2,"After much too long a wait, the second series of Mork & Mindy finally arrives on DVD in cheaper packaging and without extras (one can only imagine what the outtakes from this show must have been like). The result is both entertaining and nostalgic. It's hard to imagine now just how fresh and different Robin Williams seemed all those years ago when he was still genuinely funny. And seeing these shows again after such a long time makes me realize just how good (and sexy) Pam Dawber was - not only both verbally and physically funny in her own right but being able to keep her composure and remain in character when confronted with Williams' manic performance.

The best part about the show is the interplay and chemistry between the two title characters and the best scenes are invariably the ones when they are alone on screen. But the makers of the show (or the network) did not seem to have sufficient confidence in these two and insisted on putting them in the straight jacket of a conventional sitcom format. Thus one set of unfunny supporting characters have been replaced by another equally unfunny (but younger) lot. A couple of survivors have their roles expanded (was Exidor really funny after the first or second time?). But what we really want to see is Mork and Mindy.

As always, the highlights are Williams' bursts of stream of consciousness fantasy which occasionally seem at least partially improvised. His range of voices and mannerisms, coupled with a totally bizarre way of looking at just about everything, are still a delight. True, they are liberally sprinkled with some cultural and political references which are now terribly dated. But some, such as the throwaway line about buying Earl Butz a pair of tight shoes, are still quite funny. Unfortunately, some of the episodes descend into a sickly and heavy-handed sentimentality which was totally unnecessary.

On the whole, Mork & Mindy still manages to amuse and even make you laugh out loud. Once, that is, you get past the misjudged and not very funny hour long opening episode. Compared to modern sitcoms, it seems almost innocent. But that doesn't stop it from being one of the all-time classics.",1178236800,6,2180,4.854838709677419
2719068,5,B000M343B2,"In 1978, ""Mork and Mindy"" was a ratings smash.  However, the network changed the format and nixed Mindy's father (Fred) and grandmother (Cora) as one means of 'retooling' the show, which simply proves the suits don't even know when success sits on their lap!  But I digress.  Season 2's ratings were said to have plummeted, which prompted the network to bring back Fred and Cora (YES!!!), but having rewatched season 2, the episodes are riotously funny and with the usual moralizing messages we gen X'ers grew up on... and promptly forgot to follow, but who said anyone was perfect?

In this season, we are treated to some of the series' best wit to date:  Starting with the premiere episode, Mork takes a cold medicine that shrinks nasal membranes and he in turn shrinks to nothing because Orkans are nothing more than membranes...  it was an hour long special.  This episode freaked me as a child and still retains much of its power - even special effects were surprisingly successful and hold up rather well overall, even if there is a 'fluidity' problem with some of the zooming close-ups.  That's how it was made, as was said by another it was not a DVD defect.  And the moralizing over the energy crisis is also an interesting non-plot point for the first 5 minutes of the story.

Later we get to meet Mork's vile enemies - the dreaded Necrotons.  Show this to a non-fan, it'll hook 'em right away.  And not just because Raquel Welch stars as the main Necroton and proves she really is a considerable actress and not merely a body with an incidental brain attached... but because of the jokes; many of which come out of nowhere yet whose relevance are staggeringly funny.  In 1980, Robin Williams' lines and improv combined with the smiley-faced boxers had me laughing; re-watching it again yesterday had me laughing for far, far more reasons.  Netflix or buy it for this episode alone!  This one is also a special 1-hour entry.

Another highlight to this season is when Mork is lulled into television commercials - it is another high point and extremely well written episode.

Never mind that Robin Williams and Pam Dawber play against/with each other extremely well.  Even if the low-point episodes are less than special (namely the rehash of the season 1 episode where Mork has to deal with the immigration people... and the clip show featuring the temporary return of Fred), Robin and Pam put in top rated performances, with dialogue to ensure you'll be laughing in hysterics, and I don't say that lightly.

True, I missed Fred and Cora, but I know they will return.  But the suits, for once, had a point and season 2 really contains a high number of gems -- even with the ditzy politician and deli owners who migrated from New York.  They were never the same, but they weren't bad.  But as we all know, Fred and Cora were the best sidekicks.

DVD quality - while the images look a bit soft and there's plenty of film speckles, it doesn't detract.  Color saturation is beautiful and the episodes are fairly spaced amongst the 4 discs.  The packaging is cheaper, but considering how season 1 wasn't entirely profitable, what counts most in a DVD (the level of compression in the episodes) was retained.  I am highly grateful that they kept with the 4 disc format.  KUDOS!!  :)

I hope season 2 is successful so season 3 can come out as well.  It too features a number of gems, including the hour-long opener ""Put the Ork Back Into Mork"".",1177113600,22,3446,4.6572847682119205
2719069,4,B000M343B2,"After the first season of ""Mork & Mindy"" failed to be a huge seller, Paramount took awhile to roll out season two. But it's out now, however this time around it's the no frills version (same with the new season two sets for ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne & Shirley""). The four discs are packaged in a clear single snap case and the episode info is printed on the inside of the case. Gone are the rainbow colored discs from season one replaced with drab gray printed discs. All that aside the episodes are all here. The overall picture quality is really good. The first episode of the second season was a one hour premiere and the first half is shot on film because of the special effects and the quality is less than stellar, but that is because of how the episode was shot. As with the previous season some music has been changed for DVD release, but the series didn't use a lot of music so it's not a big loss. Hopefully if this season sells well enough season three won't be far behind. Perhaps the budget cuts will make it possible for the last two seasons to get released soon.",1176854400,17,1077,4.336633663366337

2719075,3,B000M343B2,"A classic example of what happens when you mess with success.  The first season hit the perfect stroke of magic when everything just came together perfectly.  As a result of this, ABC had one of its biggest hits of the year.  Enter the Network Suits, who for all their supposed expertise, somehow managed to run a Network with their heads solidly up their you-know-what, and in the process wrecked a great series.  They made wholesale changes this season, not one of which was even remotely a good idea, and damn near torpedoed the whole show right then and there.  Getting rid of Mindy's father, Fred, and Grandma, was a colossally stupid idea, and, surprise, the ratings for this season tanked, and actually doomed the show to an early cancellation.  Left alone, these series would easily have lasted seven or more seasons.

This is not to say that this season was completely bad, or that it didn't have good episodes, because it did.  However, it would have been much better if the Network idiots had keep their big mouth shut, and their hands off of what was one of the most uniquely funny shows of all time.

In season three, they attempted to return to the original season format, but failed to completely get back the magic that had been the first season and the show never really recovered.  They did manage to eeck out two more seasons, but they paled in comparison to the original magic.  The show died a slow, agonizing death during the final, fourth season.",1449187200,3,1469,4.655038759689923

2719118,5,B000M343B2,"Bought the work and mindy series in honor of the late Robin Williams, this season along with the other were truly a joy to watch, both Robin and Pam were lovable to watch and it seriously had me wishing I grew up in the seventies. Anyways, I adore Mork and Mindy, and although I never knew this comedy in my childhood because of me being a part of the dreadful 'millenial' generation, I'll be keeping these discs the rest of my life, and show them to my children so they can enjoy and appreciate Robin Williams' talent in making us both laugh and cry. Rest in peace Robin, We'll keep you in our hearts forever.",1409356800,,610,4.3130434782608695
2719119,5,B000M343B2,"Robin Williams is again almost the whole show. This season they got rid of the father and grandmother and added instead two people running a deli and a politician to the mix. It didn't make any difference as Mork dominated every scene anyway. Mindy is the only essential other character as the sweetness of her relationship with Mork is the show's heart.

Williams does some incredible bits this season. When all of the women in a strip club can't do a good striptease, Williams gets up there and does one and is fantastic. Then he decides to become a cheerleader for the Denver Broncos with a squad of women. His tryout for this is impressively athletic as well. I would not be surprised to learn that he knew ballet. He also dances with Raquel Welch as an invading space alien. He tangos. He jitterbugs. He does it all. And the voices keep coming as well such as Jack Nicholson and anyone else who catches his fancy, like Blanche DeBois from STREETCAR! It is real tour de force performance. Then he puts on a children's show and performs swan lake in frog costume with swim flippers on his feet with a female partner. Then he performs as a Bob Dylan type of singer. In another episode Shelly Fabares comes on as Mindy's new stepmother. Georgia Engle makes a guest appearance (from the Mary Tyler Shore where she played Georgette). She's fine but renders a performance just like she did with anchor Ted Baxter as his wife. They all do ok but the show is Mork.

Williams famously would tell everyone that he spent 3 years at Juilliard but did not finish. What he did not say was that John Houseman and others told him that he was wasting his time there, that he was ready to go, that there was nothing left for him to learn there. So he left and hit the entertainment world full tilt with stand up and then this show and then the movies, working constantly. He also endowed a full scholarship at Juilliard which pays everything for the chosen student and is awarded every two years. Jessica Chastain was one of his scholarship students. Probably Juilliard's other students couldn't stand being onstage with him as it was then hopeless for them to be noticed, exactly what his costars experienced on this show.

2719124,1,B000M343B2,"I'm not entirely sure how many, but some episodes on this set are not complete.

For an immediate example, I know Dr. Morkenstein is missing a scene.  In Mindy's apartment, there's a scene where Mork plays Chuck the robot's arm like an accordian and sings Lady Of Spain.  This musical segment is edited out of the episode.  My guess?  Someone may hold a copyright on Lady Of Spain.  And the DVD producers were so afraid they might be sued for using the song that they trimmed it out.  Of course, Lady Of Spain could be public domain, making the removal of this scene just downright idiotic and disappointing.

There's really no explanation for these episodes not being complete.  And to ask people to lay down their hard earned money for incomplete content is simply unacceptable hubris.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this set.",1402876800,10,828,4.767605633802817

It still is worth the money if you enjoy seeing the genious that is Robin Williams. I started watching it for the second time and am enjoying it more.

If you are a great fan of Robin Williams and are looking for something that is relatively clean, you should really enjoy this season. Be warned, however, that there are a whole lot more episodes that deal with witch craft issues like calling up spirits etc.. which leave a lot to be desired and make this not always wholesome entertainment.",1210464000,2,611,4.657407407407407

The season premier was a one hour special about the gas shortage in the late 70's/early 80's. A later episode focused on a white supremacy group hassling the partially polish Mindy.
