8002916,3,B0000TWN9C,"The picture quality is comically bad. It is very faded to the point where the movie is barely visible. You would have to push the contrast on your TV or computer to correct it. I am deaf, so I cannot comment on the sound quality. I'm sure it is just as bad. This movie is not captioned; there is no option for subtitles. (The story is easy to understand without either captions or sound.) Amazon lists this movie as Region 1, but it is actually Region 0/All.",1475625600,,458,4.275862068965517
8002917,5,B0000TWN9C,"You know very well that USA&Canada are country of Child Molesters, once you watch that movie you'll see that the subject inserted there, that's why I advice the Idiotic Ukrainians to stay away from such ""partners""! and instead exclaim ""Xuy znim,Kazak Maxim""!.",1416096000,,259,5.190476190476191
8002918,5,B0000TWN9C,"This is a simply stated portrayal of disability and mental illness in a small town in 1930's North America. This is not a melodrama, but a slice of life. Gary Farmer is spot on with his portrayal of a man with the mind of a child, and Keegan Macintosh will grab you as the child locked inside of himself. Wilfrid Bray's portrayal of Henry's friend Elvin, who has symptoms of schizophrenia, is quickly sketched but accurate. This is a positive and well researched movie representation of disability and mental illness. Margot kidder also deserves mention as the one legged prostitute.",1355270400,,583,4.84
8002919,5,B0000TWN9C,"For some reason I missed this wonderful movie when it came out. I'm a long time Farmer-fan
and again I'm spell-bound  by his performance.",1242432000,2,137,4.708333333333333
8002920,3,B0000TWN9C,"Poor video quality, odd story, odd actors. There is a good story in here somewhere begging to get out. I think someone should find it and rescue it. There is discussion of nudity in this film. If it's there, it's briefer than brief and its certainly not the focus of this film or its been edited out for this release. The mentally challenged man and the autistic boy are just friends...the adults around them though seem to be the real idiots.",1190419200,6,443,4.481481481481482
