2006824,5,B0001JXPPC,"I recently borrowed Season 1 DVD set from my good friend and was able to sit down for the 16 hours it takes to watch it all.  I was out of the country when this show hit and I had no clue what all my friends were talking about when I came back this year.  I have been glued to my television set every Wednesday night and, after watching both season 1 and season 3, I understand that the things which fill in the blanks are just as gripping, if not better.  Like the title says, this is  great show with great writing and a great cast.",1079222400,,534,3.9626168224299065
2006825,5,B0001JXPPC,"Season 2 of Smallville is so far my favorite season (that could change after I see how season 3 ends). Season 2 has less kypton villians and it is more into Clark's background. Some good key notes that happen in Season 2.. Lex gets married, twice!! Someone finds out Clark's secret and prob the most popular episode in season 2 is when Chris Reeve (Superman in the 4 movies),guest stars in ep Rosetta. I love how they go into alot of cool special effects in season 2. I just love Smallville, It just keeps getting better and better. If you liked Season 1 then you will prob like Season 2 even more. Get Season 2 on DVD, I Am!!!",1079222400,,627,4.277310924369748

2006828,5,B0001JXPPC,"Fans of the first season of Smallville will be pleasently suprised that the second seasson more than measures up.  Some of the best episodes of the series - ""Red,"" ""Insurgence,"" and ""Rosetta"" are on this set.  DVD geeks will also note that the special features for season 2 are dramtically better than the season 1 extras with more commentaries and deleted seasons.  Highly recommended.",1077235200,3,386,5.0
2006829,5,B0001JXPPC,"After seeing the first season of Smallville, I almost had doubts about the success of season 2, simply because season 1 was so good. However, my doubts were put to rest as soon as I saw the first episode. Season 2 of Smallville manages to become even better than the first season. The season opens with a bang by offering a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the cliffhanger from season 1. From there things only get better. Clark discovers his heat vision, he has his first experience with Red Kryptonite, someone very close to Clark learns about his secret, Christopher Reeve guest stars in one of the best episodes to date ""Rosetta"", Clark and Lana get very ""close"", and so much more. If you liked the first season, you will love the second season.
Before I watched ""Smallville"", I assumed there was no way for a WB made show to compete with the other aspects of the Superman franchise. Doubting ""Smallville"" was probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. In my opinion, it is the best show on TV right now, and one of the best that I have ever seen. The entire cast from Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, and Kristin Kruek, to John Schnieder and Anette O Toole all do an outstanding job. The reason the show works, is because it takes an interesting look at the legend of Superman. You bare witness to the human side of the character - Clark Kent, growing up as a teenager in Smallville,Kansas. Clark must adjust to his different powers, the relationship between Lex Luthor and Clark develops, and you see the classic romance between Clark and Lana Lang, who are destined to be just friends. The show has something for everyone to enjoy.
If you are a fan of Smallville, then you definately have to pick up the season 2 DVD box set. It is just flat out amazing. The set is not worth owning just for the episodes however. The extras are incredible, and blow away the extras from the season 1 set. The extras include - Commentary on ""Red"", and ""Rosetta"" with commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar, OR series stars Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, and Michael Rosenbaum; the COMPLETE series of ""Chloe Chronicles"", Gag reel, Deleted scenes, and two beind the scenes featurettes.",1077235200,3,2188,4.627249357326479

2006932,5,B0001JXPPC,"All I can say is wow!!.  This show is epic!!  No other Superman show or movie can compare to the greatness of Smallville.  Infact no other superhero show can compare either.  Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed guaranteed.",1479945600,,1223,4.6

We started watching it together, but he couldn't wait for the next episodes! He stayed up for almost 2 days straight watching all of season one, then begged me to get season 2!

I realize now 5 years later my ignorance has made me miss out on possibly one of my new favorites and one of the best underestimated tv series yet! Sure the graphics are old school but the plot easily helps mask that. My girlfriend and I are officially hooked and are barely on the first season. Thank you amazon also for making the series much more affordable for this college student. I barely took interest in smallville a couple of months ago and have been waiting for the price to drop!

As a new fan, I was drawn in by my love of superheroes and their origin stories, and I appreciate how in-depth Smallville goes into Clark Kent's soul-searching teenage years. Yes, the acting could be better (not to mention the special effects), but the small-town nostalgia and intriguing storylines help the series along.

I stopped watching the show after Season... 4? I'm not sure. All I know is, Clark left High School and spent the ages of 18 to 30 in the fortress of Solitude. That's cannon. This is a different, slow learning, 'Super' man, who never learns to fly. Like ever. It's insane.

As a diehard Superman, I went from loving this show to hating it. I won't even dare to watch the rest of the seasons. Do yourself a favor, and don't start now. You also shouldn't smoke or do Heroin.",1410825600,,511,4.204081632653061

But one night when sleep was being particularly elusive, I caught the show in reruns on TNT at 3:00 a.m. in Los Angeles and again the next night.  After a couple of nights where I realized I was straining to stay awake once the episode started, I decided it made more sense to gain some control over when I indulged this silly, secret passion and I've not regretted it for a moment.

2007493,3,B0001JXPPC,"Season two of Smallville continues its strange balance between sculpting out the coming of age of my favorite superhero ever, and being a teenage drama. There are still plenty of clunky lines, there's still plenty of forced drama, there's still plenty of explosions that are just dumb and would only happen in cheesy action movies.  Some of the strain gets relieved by Clark finally sharing his secret with someone (that's not much of a spoiler, trust me). This was a good move on the writers' part because the whole secret identity constantly getting in the way begins to irritate after awhile. When Clark is choosing between keeping study dates with girls versus saving multiple lives there's not much drama there for the viewer because it's such an obvious choice. But the show needs to input drama into these scenes and have Clark feel bad about breaking his dates. That starts to get old, so a little release valve for Clark's secret was nice. At least one person isn't constantly whining to him now.
Lex Luthor continues to be interesting as just another young man trying to figure out where he fits into the world considering his origins. Again, much preferred to having him just be evil from the start.
But where season two really shines is how Clark begins to fit into that archetype as well. Just what did his biological father expect from the last son of Krypton? Why was Clark sent to earth? What might he become as the most powerful being in the solar system? I have to give this season credit for bringing up this interesting question and letting us wonder if Superman ever had any notions of not becoming Superman at all.
Unfortunately this is all intertwined with Chloe whining about something or other.
So, again, happy to be exploring this new take on Superman, but getting a little tired of high-school.",1306108800,,1822,4.747634069400631

2007505,4,B0001JXPPC,"I tend to prefer the later seasons over these early episodes.  It is sometimes difficult as an adult to appreciate teenage drama except that I know they try to infuse the show with real adult emotions and I do enjoy seeing how Clark matures.  I haven't always been a fan of Lana Lang because of how they developed her character and how she ultimately treated Clark.  But, in this episode, you understand who she really is and why she behaved as she did.  She was orphaned tragically and this set the tone for her character...a lost little girl.  You see it here in the final scenes of this episode as she says she knows she hasn't always been the best friend to Clark and that she doesn't care anymore what kind of secrets he has (a momentary stance) and that everyone always leaves her.  This is the core of who she is...believing that she's alone in this world when the reality is she had people who did love her, in particular, Clark who could have been the best thing in the world for her if she hadn't eventually distrusted him.  Of course...this is just good storytelling...can't always be smooth sailing and we do want Clark with Lois Lane...at least I do...LOL.  Nonetheless, the emotions displayed in the final scene helped me to appreciate Lana's character a little better..even after seeing this a few times already.  I just appreciated her dilemma a little more so I've now changed my mind and will say...I enjoyed this epi.",1300665600,,1436,4.6

2007508,4,B0001JXPPC,"I have to admit I enjoy seeing Clark lose it when he is exposed to red kryptonite.

You,of course, want him to always go back to the ""normal"" Clark...but the red krypto Clark is fun...and yes...mean...full of darkness that you don't normally see.

I think this is epi where I really begin to dislike Lana Lang.  What? A person actually dislikes Lana Lang...when she's so central to Clark's life?  Yes...in that she's all black and white with no gray in between.  How many teenagers do you know that are quite as judgemental as she is when it comes to a guy like Clark?  All evidence points to a good guy Clark...a Clark that is always helping people and yet she can't abide the fact that he keeps certain things to himself...that he is private about his life.  It's all or nothing with her...you tell me who you really are or else you get nothing is her motto.  Which I quite disliked.  Dont' get me wrong...their romance on this series was quite something to watch...but only after all the years of her not trusting and believing in good guy Clark....a real romance was only possible after she ""learned"" his secret.  If she had been supportive of him from the beginning...maybe he would have learned to trust her eventually.  Nonetheless...I watch in spite of the angst...because I enjoy seeing Clark mature.  These high school years in this series are to set us up to learn 1) what his abilities are 2) what kind of values he has 3) how truly sensitive he is to his family 4) how life for Clark Kent may just end up being a lonely life.  The first half of this series really, really does show a lonely Clark...and that's what makes these seasons important because they contrast to what we'll see at the end of the series with Lois Lane.",1289952000,,1841,4.539393939393939

2007525,4,B0001JXPPC,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The season kicks off with arguably one of the finest premieres in the run of the series.  ""Vortex"" is actually an improvement over the story it continues from the first season finale called ""Tempest.""  In the premiere, Lana is saved from the eye of a tornado by a mysteriously well-placed Clark Kent, John Schneider's Jonathan Kent is trapped underground with a selfish yellow journalist who knows Clark's secret and wants to expose him for profit, and a jilted and hopelessly in love Chloe Sullivan can only watch and pine as an oblivious Clark is starstruck with the beautiful Lana Lang.  While I'm on the subject of romantic relationships on the show, ""Smallville"" has taken criticism for being too attentive to the romantic lives of its characters at the expense of mythological development in the overall storyline.  This is not a fair criticism, as virtually every show which has ever been on television has relied on some form of ""will they or won't they?"" romantic tension for its characters.  The showrunners of ""Smallville"" have always accomplished a remarkable balancing act between this television staple and the unique storytelling demands the show carries.

Very significant changes come to the cast in this second year, as John Glover's Lionel Luthor is a regular member, replacing frankly the weakest cast link from the first season in Eric Johnson's Whitney Fordman.  This change allows for the deepening of the Luthor storyline, as seen partially in the wonderfully solid ""Prodigal.""  In this episode, Lex's long-lost brother Lucas is found and returns to claim his share as a Luthor.  Though the actor is billed as Paul Wasilewski, Lucas Luthor is played by Paul Wesley, currently on ""The Vampire Diaries.""  Another episode which compellingly highlights the dysfunctional Luthors is ""Insurgence,"" in which a vengeful Lionel bugs Lex's office in retalliation for being thrown out of his mansion by his distrustful son.

The removal of Whitney Fordman also clears the way for the fabled Clark Kent/Lana Lang romance to begin in earnest, although the showrunners still wisely keep this under wraps for most of the season for the purpose of suspense.  Instead, Clark is immersed in discovering his Kryptonian heritage, a storyline which yields several well-done episodes this season.  Among these are ""Skinwalker,"" in which Clark and his friends discover some caves that are important to a Native American activist, and whose peculiar legend runs parallel to Clark's life story.  Additionally, the episode ""Rosetta"" is a pivotal classic in the series, introducing the late Christopher Reeve to the show as Dr. Virgil Swann.  The acting chemistry between Tom Welling and Christopher Reeve is apparent, and the storyline employed to bring Mr. Reeve to the series is appropriate.

There are a few episodes which I don't particularly care for this season.  Among these are ""Red,"" in which Clark turns bad under the influence of red kryptonite.  The episode felt tired and cliched the first time I watched it and though there is a very nice payoff toward the end, thirty-five minutes of the show is way too long to get to the point.  Additionally, the boring ""Visitor"" is a terribly anticlimactic follow-up episode to the stirring ""Rosetta.""  Lastly, the unbelievably bad ""Nocturne""  concerns a young, cursed poet smitten with Lana.  There was absolutely no reason for this episode.

Many episodes in this set display the versatility that distinguishes ""Smallville"" from its brethren.  Highly recommended.",1266192000,,3532,5.1978798586572434

2007528,5,B0001JXPPC,"More powers emerge as Clark gets ever closer to his destiny as the Man of Steel.

This season made you know the show was here to stay and showed a slight, more mature change in the writing style (if memory serves), despite the show still being kind of like The Twilight Zone meets Superman.

Regardless, throwing into the mix someone outside the Kent family permanently knowing Clark's secret--well, things got a little more complicated for our favorite farmboy as he's now got the concern of ""what if so-and-so spills the beans?""

What really made this season, of course, was the guest appearance by Christopher Reeve, who everyone in my generation knows as THE Superman, bar none. His role as Dr. Swann, who shows Clark his Kryptonian heritage, really brought a passing-of-the-torch moment to the show, cementing in Superman fans' heads that Tom Welling was indeed our new boy and--if anyone else out there is like me--makes you itch for Welling to one day put on the tights in a feature film (or seven).

I love the mythology episodes in this series and Season Two had enough to remind you that, yes, you were watching Superman and not just a show about a young man with developing superpowers.

Go watch this, then check out Season Three right after it. You know what? Go watch 'em all then follow Season Nine week-to-week like the rest of us. You won't be sorry.

2007529,2,B0001JXPPC,"The 2nd installment of America's only weekly TV serial based on a comic book is full of major events, major characters and major themes.  Clark starts to learn about his destiny, discovers the Kawatche caves, learns about his birthplace of Krypton, and finally hits it of with Lana.  Likewise, Lionel Luthor discovers the mystery that is Clark Kent, Lex gets married - twice, and the Kent family shares its secret with Pete.  So a very eventful season, and the makings of a great series.  However, episode after episode is full of plot holes, to the point that many of the season's major events are just unbelievable.  Here are some examples.
1) When Dr. Helen Bryce discovers her office has been vandalized, why does not she go look at the security footage of the hospital?  it seems that she does not even bother to call the police.
2) When Clark goes to visit Dr. Swann, why does he need to say hello, and look around the museum in order to find Dr. Swann.  Clark has x-ray vision, and knows how to use it.  Why does he not just use his x-ray vision to locate Dr. Swann.
3) Lex Luthor is paranoid and constantly checks the background of every individual he deals with.  How then does Chloe, a high school sophomore from a middle-class family, find information that he does not, in episode after episode.
4) Clark knows he is vulnerable to kryptonite, knows that it gives un-natural powers to those who encounter it, and knows that there are multiple sources of it in Smallville.  Why does he not go out to look for it, in order to dispose of it, or neutralize it somehow.  Clark is a studious student at Smallville High, so why not build a device to detect kryptonite at a farther distance then his body can feel it.
5) Why are Chloe and Pete not invited to Lex's wedding with Dr. Bryce?  He invited everyone else in Smallville.
6) Maybe the biggest hole is Clark's secretiveness.  He knows that Chloe, Lex, Lionel, and Lana are all curious about him.  Why not make up an alibi to explain his powers, like he is a meteor freak.  Smallville clearly has dozens of meteor freaks running around.  Clark could have easily came up with a cover story, saying that he is meteor-infected and this gives him extra speed and strength.  Tell this story to everyone to mask the fact that he is really an alien.
7) Why does Clark wait until the moment of Lex's wedding in order to put the kryptonite octagon into his ship?  Why not do it earlier, and then go to the wedding?  Or go to the wedding, and then deal with his ship?

And so on.  Every episode is filled with plot holes.  And the entire season is built on plot holes and illogical themes.  All told, I'd say this is the worst Smallville season.",1258070400,,2693,4.4621676891615545

2007544,5,B0001JXPPC,"Season two picks up right where season one left off.  Clark Kent (Tom Welling) manages to save Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) from the path of a tornado, but Lionel Luther (John Glover) isn't quite so lucky.  While his son Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) saves his life, Lionel winds up blind.

But as life slowly gets back to normal, things have a way of continuing to be, well, weird.  Clark develops heat vision, brought on by thoughts of sex.  Chloe and Pete (Allison Mack and Sam Jones III) become adrenalin junkies.  High school students start dying of old age.  And Lana is visited by her best friend who died years ago.

But with everything else going on, Clark also gets hints to his past, much to the worry of parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole).  A cave is found in Smallville that has ancient drawings depicting Clark's story.  The ship that brought Clark to Earth seems to come to life at times.  What does it all mean?

What it means for us is a great season of this engrossing high school soap opera.  Yes, I just called it a teen soap.  Essentially, that's what it is.  Oh yes, it has plenty of science fiction and comic book action, and that's fun.  But the on going stories have a decidedly soap opera feel to them.  There's the love triangle between Lana, Chloe, and Clark for starters.  Lex gets married not once but twice.  There's blindness and an unexpected pregnancy as well.

But that's not to down play the action and scifi.  While the show doesn't follow a formula nearly as closely as it did the first season, there are still plenty of kryptonite enhanced monsters.  Some of the episodes get a little creepy.  And some of them are just downright fun, like the times that Clark gets exposed to red kryptonite.

But as much as I am enjoying it, I find the characters the most fascinating to watch, particularly the Luthors and their interaction with Clark.  At this point, Clark and Lex are still friends.  Knowing how their relationship turns out makes some of those scenes take on a bittersweet feel.  It's help by Michael Rosenbaum.  Any scene he is in is amazing to watch.  In fact, the best scenes are the ones between him and John Glover playing his on screen dad.  I'm not saying the rest of the cast is bad because they aren't.  Those are the two that stand out the most.

2007545,5,B0001JXPPC,"The Complete Second Season of ""Smallville"" on DVD is just so good on so many levels,in fact is is even better than the First Season on DVD. I bu quite a few TV on DVD series'( The OC, Friday Night Lights) and most of the time the first season is the best and none of the others are quite as good. Smallville breaks this mold, gone are the constant meteor freaks that will terrorize those in Smallville every single episode. This time around there is more of a balance, examples are ""Red"", ""Rosetta"" and even ""Ryan"" and there are even more. Clark learns a cool new superpower and Whitney is no longer in the credits instead he is replaced by Lex's dark and evil father, Lionel Luthor. If you wanted more of a variety or if you were hoping for more of the same you will love the Complete Second Season of Smallville. The Special Features are even better with more deleted scenes, two true featurettes and a Chloe Sullivan featurette which involves Earl from the first season.  There is also a very humourous Gag Reel, who knew Micheal Rosenbaum was so hilarious!

I certainly hope that the series spin-off into a Superman series too with Tom Welling as Superman.

Season 2 happens to be my favorite of all because I just enjoy watching the young Clark Kent still unravelling the mysteries of Smallville and the meteor rock effects on the town, while still discovering who he is and where he comes from...  The last season that Kent and all the young charactors were in the prime of their innocense, before the point of no return where boy grows up forever when discovering the world is really broken... the time before he must leave behind all the dreams and goals so cherished in high school and  think about the terrifying responsibility, and burdon he must carry alone in his own future as he evolves into protector of the boundries far beyond Kansas...

2007564,5,B0001JXPPC,"Season Review-

After jittery yet solid first season, Season 2 of Smallville saw the creators and the writers expanding the series beyond the meteor freak of the week lay out by exploring Clark's origins as well as the development of his powers. After a nail biting teaser that sees Clark struggling to rescue Lana inside a powerful twister, you pretty much know you're in for a better season as even the special effects budget seems more convincing. The cast seem more natural and look more comfortable in their roles. Tom Welling continues matures as Clark Kent goes more curious of where and why he was sent to Earth. Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang begins having suspicions about Clark Kent as well as finds out an unforeseen revelation about her father. Michael Rosenbaum grows a more confident and impressive as Lex Luthor as Lex if forced to deal with his issues with his father head on when a blind Lionel moves into his mansion. The marvelous John Glover moves from his recurring job during the first season to a full cast member in the second season, which is a great move by the creators. Lionel is too much of a wonderful character to keep for only a couple episodes at a time. I love the rivalry that continues between both Lionel and Lex, which is a fine storyline that develops so well throughout this season. Lionel is a complex character with villain inspired personality and it's easy to see how Lionel's harsh parenting is apart of the reason why Lex will ultimately become the evil mastermind some day. Annette 'O Toole and Jonathan Schneider are more heartwarming as Clark's lovely parents. Each week they grow stronger as Clark's guides when dealing with his abnormal life. After being left at the Spring Formal, Allison Mack's Chloe is still going strong as Smallville's own investigative reporter, although her assertive feelings for Clark and passive aggressive nature throughout the season are annoying, not to mention hurt the character. Lastly is Pete Ross, played by Sam Jones III, who learns the shocking truth about Clark's abilities and origin. But even after that huge revelation for that character, Pete is pretty much a background character, only used as plot device it seems for most of the season.

Season 2 features some of truly great episodes that see the writers developing their own mythology while paying tribute to the Superman mythology in general. ""Red"" is a classic episode that sees red kryptonite being introduced as Clark loses his inhibitions when he puts on the class ring and wrecks havoc on his family and friends. ""Heat"" is an excellent episode that sees Clark discovering heat vision while a sexy seductress sets her sights on Lex. ""Lineage"" has Clark, Lana and Lex dealing with the harsh reality of their families, ""Ryan"" sees the return of psychic young boy from ""Stray"" whose storyline comes to a tragic end and ""Exodus"" is a heartbreaking finale that just shouldn't be missed. But no Season 2 hour is greater than the epic, mythology filled ""Rosetta"". If Smallville is remembered for anything, it's probably for this episode, considering it features the appearance of Christopher Reeves himself. The acting by the show regulars is top notch and just having Christopher Reeves guest star makes this a remarkable episode alone! The scenes between Christopher Reeves and Tom Welling as Dr. Swann reveals to Clark that his from Krypton and his name is Kal-El are some of the most powerful writing from the series yet and both actors were superb during that scene. It's also touching looking back as this episode seems like a ""passing of the cape"" moment in Superman history, especially after Reeves' death 3 years later. ""Rosetta"" is still seen by most fans as the best episode ever produced. While I see definitely, it's definitely one of the series' finest episodes that deserve to be in any fans' top 5 list.

Other great developments to look out for in Season 2 are the introduction of the caves in ""Skinwalker"" which is a storyline which becomes an important development in Clark's discovery of his destiny for the next few seasons. Clark and Lex's friendship grows stronger in this season, with both men growing more dependent of one another. I also love the introduction of Jor-El in the final 2 episodes of the series, which marks the debut of Terrance Stamp aka General Zod from Superman II ironically as the voice of Jor-El. While sounding more like Zod than Jor-El from the films (obviously) puts his own spin on the role of Superman's father and he fits so well in the Smallville world. Martha Kent also finds herself as Lionel Luthor's newest assistant but even more shocking is her miraculous pregnancy which has a fatal outcome cause by Clark in the season finale. Lastly, despite Lana's confusion over Clark, both Clark and Lana finally end up being together, but will it last, especially after Clark finds himself ruining from his destiny by season's end? Season 2 is leaps and bounds better than the first season as the season feels more focused leaving the freaks of the week behind while creating some season arc that truly develops the characters, especially Clark.

Season Rating: 9/10

Video and Audio:

Like the first season, all 23 episodes are shown in widescreen. The second season looks better than the first season, but nothing too significant. The audio is the same better, but not by much.

Video and Audio Rating: 7.5/10

Extras:

The second season extras are much better than the first. The audio commentary by Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum on ""Red"" is pretty hilarious, with also an alternate commentary on the same episode with Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.  The second and final commentaries are both on ""Rosetta"" with the same set of actors and the creators. Faster than a Speeding Bullet: The Visual FX of Smallville is a cool background extra where we see how the SFX crew create those stunning special effects each week. Christopher Reeve: The Man of Steel is the best extra of the whole set as the cast and crew take about not only the significance of ""Rosetta"", but of Christopher Reeves's role in the Superman mythology. The Chloe Chronicles are fun little mini-episodes that have Chloe investigating past events of the certain episode. These extras aren't the best but Allison Mack is so entertaining throughout that they are worth the watch regardless. The deleted scenes ranged from pointless to pretty good and the gag reel is quite priceless.

I went right to my computer and quickly ordered all of the seasons to this wonderful show and have watched all 7 seasons twice! This very talented cast grabs a person from the start. It is a very well written, fast paced show with everything in it that a viewer would want. The special effects are great and the plots get even better with each show. You feel yourself drawn into the lives of these characters and really can envision the early life of Clark Kent. I like it even better than the Superman movies. I like Tom Welling but really enjoy watching Annette O'Toole and John Schneider as Clark Kent's loving parents. Kristen Kreuk and Allison Mack as Clarks love interest and friend, also really round out this very talented group of actors and it would not be as good without Michael Rossenbaum as Clarks's friend and nemesis, Lex Luther.

There are many tension filled scenes in which he rushes off to save someone only to return and realize that things aren't ok with Lana, or Chloe or Lex, or Mom or Dad. In fact the season finale was really upsetting and Clark leaves Smallville after his actions have a heartbreaking effect on his mom and dad.

2007571,4,B0001JXPPC,"and ""Smallville"" is no exception to this rule. In fact, this show ran out of steam after Series 3. No matter - Series 2 is the best of them, and you can switch the video off just before the end of the penultimate episode to achieve a satisfactory conclusion with no real cliffhangers.

Where this series got it right and the later ones lost it is in the characterization. It is a sci-fi show, so fantasy of course plays a big part in the storylines. That said, at least a couple of the episodes in Series 2 are quite gripping, with minimal superpower input (""Precipice"" and ""Accelerate""). ""Insurgence"" is almost movie-like in its pace and highlights the Luthor family struggle as perhaps the most dramatic thread running through the series. (""Skinwalker"" is annoyingly political and can be skipped by reading a precis of the plot off the Web.)

Clark Kent is always at risk of being one-dimensional, but that's what red kryptonite is for. In any case, the young Kryptonian needs upstanding examples of human virtue to encourage him on his path to becoming Superman, and, in the good series of ""Smallville"", he has this in his foster parents and his close friends: Pete, Chloe and Lana.

In Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk, the show had two impossibly attractive actors who could be exceptional TV role models for the virtues of generosity and loyalty. Unfortunately, in later series, the writers seemed more interested in appealing to the ""American Pie"" audience. At that point it becomes harder to believe that Clark would not become more cynical and introspective.

No matter, Series 2 of ""Smallville"" is a good piece of work and enough to tide fans over until the next adaptation of the Superman legend.",1200009600,,1704,4.805460750853243

Getting started with the conclusion to last season's finale, a slam-bang, sfx-laden first episode, we find our hero rescuing Lana (for the umpteenth time) from a super twister while anti-hero Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) ponders whether to save his fallen father, Lionel (the superbly menacing John Glover) from being impaled by a ceiling beam, teetering over his head.  Of course, the son does reluctantly save his father, which will make for added tension for the pair throughout the season.

This is the season wherein suspicions arise about Clark's background; his friend Pete (Sam Jones III) becomes keeper of Clark's secret; the bond between Clark and Lana (Kristen Kreuk) grows while a rift develops between him and Chloe (the energetic Allison Mack); parents Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) have to deal with marital  problems; former cast member Eric Johnson makes a startling appearance (""Visage""); and two recurring characters (played, respectively by Joe Morton and Mitchell Kosterman) make surprising departures.

The writing staff soars as they add new spins on the Superman legend, having Clark's first use of heat vision in the appropriately titled ""Heat"" and then show the personality-altering effects of red kryptonite of our Kansas-raised hero (""Red"").  The writers also give Rosenbaum the best lines, complete with witty and snide references that foreshadow the divide that will ultimately come between Lex and Clark.

Inspired guest casting is one of the highlights of the season.  Blair Brown appears as a woman claiming to be Clark's mom in ""Lineage"" while Jonathan Taylor-Thomas, himself a teen heartthrob from ""Home Improvement"" assays a dual role in the appropriately-entitled ""Duplicity.""

But, the greatest casting coup is in the landmark ""Rosetta,"" the best installment of the series entire run thus far.  By featuring Christopher Reeve, the actor most associated with Superman, as the enigmatic ""Dr. Virgil Swain,"" the show raised the bar to greatness.  In addition to Reeve's appearance, ""Rosetta"" made wise use of John Williams' powerful music from the first Superman film.

Though Welling is the star, all of actors get more than a few moments to shine and they, especially Rosenbaum and Glover, are up to the task.  It is puzzling why the show gets shut out at the Emmys each year, not garnering at least one acting nod.

The commentary tracks, on ""Red"" and ""Rosetta,"" respectively, are very well done and entertaining.  The other special features, though brief, are also enlightening, with special kudos to ""The Chloe Chronicles"" and the Chris Reeve tribute.

However, there must be some funnier outtakes than the ones presented on the ""gag reel.""",1168819200,,2884,5.319383259911894

2007673,4,B0001JXPPC,"I have a confession to make: Besides the quirky, surprisingly complex characterizations, clever writing, and thoroughly entertaining story telling, one of the things that draws me to this show is the subtle melodrama (there's an oxymoron for y'all) that can make some episodes so darn mockable.  It's probably an insult to some, but that, combined with all other aspects, honestly makes for an awesome series.

And Season 2 is a fine example of this melodrama.  Folks, it's a hard thing to resist and I ain't gonna try.

The season begins where the first left off, a tornado terrozing the town, leading to an opening episode that delves into surprising emotions and character development. This power continues quite well through the rest.  One of this show's achievements is going beyond the fun-if-simple characterizations of Superman and Co.  They're teenagers.  We all know how teenagers are.  And, beyond that, they are human (except for Clarky-boy, of course).

I'm also impressed by this season's combination of episodes.  Some are obvious as being little more than a hilarious frolic, while others are absolutely heartbreaking.  This makes for a possible wide range of emotions, feelings, and views to the series.  And that is life, the funny and the sad.

2007680,4,B0001JXPPC,"That is, if you liked the first season of Smallville, then your money for the second season will have been well spent.  With the second season of Smallville, more of the Superman mythology is revealed.  Clark learns about his heat vision and about that red Kryptonite which unleashes his inner James Dean.  This series could have easily gone the stale way of Enterprise, where discovering everything about the Star Trek universe for the first time that we already knew about was inheritantly not very interesting, but instead was kept fresh thanks to the continually high performances by Michael Rosenbaum and Tom Welling.  Special mention this season should also go to John Glover's portrayal as Lex's father, Lionel Luthor-picture a jolly reptilian and you have the idea where to go from there.  The strengths of Season 2 for me were in Clark's ongoing conflicts with those who continued to get affected by the meteor rock, and the above average special effects, most particularly Clark's speed and heat vision.  The unfortunate shortcomings, however, were in the scriptwriting in regards to Clark's emotional/romantic/human status.  It almost seems to be an ongoing dilemma with the writers over what to do with Clark and his personal life:  is he a normal kid, or a messiah who is above and over the rest of humanity.  Isn't the essence of being an agent of goodness also in being an agent of love and compassion?  What kind of superhero is he going to be if he can't feel love for anyone?  These and other questions will boggle you as you watch Clark screw up just about every potential relationship throughout the series, especially with Lana and Chloe.  Although Kristin Kreuk and Allison Mack try very nobly to inject some kind of pathos and verisimilitude to their respective teenage characters, they usually come off as nothing more than emotional yo-yos going back and forth between weepy lovelornedness and girl-done-wrong outrage.  If you can get past this frustration, then much fun can be had in this season.  The highlight episodes for me were:  ""Visage""--a very disturbing and psychotic episode; ""Insurgence""--a pretty action-packed episode; ""Skinwalker""--a very vital episode for the direction of the second season; ""Accelerate""--an even more disturbing episode about Lana being visited by her best friend who died when she was 10.  The little girl is spot-on creepy;  ""Fever""--maybe one of the most sublime moments of the whole series is when a very sad and frustrated Chloe reads her feelings out to an unconscious Clark, a scene that almost single-handedly justifies the whole series.  The extras for the Season 2 set are very high-caliber:  A tribute to Christopher Reeve, arguably the best Superman ever; a great featurette about the visual effects; the Chloe Chronicles delve even deeper into some of the weirdness of Smallville, especially with the Jitter episode.",1151452800,7,2889,5.108510638297872
2007681,2,B0001JXPPC,"Smallville can get addicting if you watch it enough, but its hard to shake the dirty feeling it leaves you with.  You know its bad, even awful at times, but you want to see what happens anyway.  The fact that it doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out compels me to give it two stars, but that's pushing it.

So where to start?  For one, the entire production is cheesy without being self-aware, ala Buffy.  The acting is hamfisted by just about everyone, especially Lana, whom I want to take a baseball bat to every time I hear her whine about how Clark won't be honest with her.  At least she tries though.  What Clark does can't even qualify as acting.  This man makes Keanu Reeves look expressive.  He flits from scene to scene with a blank look on his face halfheartedly delivering generic lines.  His emotional scenes showcase his especially sad deer-in-the-headlights look, like some big dumb baby that not sure how its supposed to act, and can only manage a confused, vaguely constipated expression.

If all the episodes seem similar, thats because they are.  Every one starts out with some new misterious baddie getting superpowers from evil kryptonite/evil corporate research/evil mystical powers which he inevitably uses for evil.  He causes just enough havoc to force Clark to heroicly save the day.  Then the episode ends with some sickeningly saccharine emotional scene in the barn where Clark's family pats him on the head and says what a good boy he is.  Like I said earlier, it makes you feel dirty just watching it.",1147305600,10,1538,4.7293233082706765

The love triangles become more apparent, and though I tuned in to see where life would take Lana and Clark (respectively), the other plot twists/lines were just as interesting, especially watching Martha work with Lionel Luthor.  And watching Clark develop more powers, while finding out more about himself.  And watching some friends  become more valued than others.

Sometimes the set up can be a little contrived but the result is still compelling.

My favorite actor and character is Michael Rosenbaum as young Lex Luthor.  The character is heartbreaking with his desire to do good and be a part of a loving family but circumstances keep this from happening.  Young Clark Kent (Tom Snelling) grapples with the responsibility both to his family and community of having superpowers, but also to his own developing sense of self.  His struggles to become a man can be seen in any young teen trying to be a good son/daughter but also develop as an individual.

The freak of the week stories became few and far between. Instead, we get to become closer to the characters, going deeper into their psyches. ""Smallville"" is truly the best show on television right now, and one of my favorite shows of all time. Tom Welling is superb as Clark Kent. I can actually see his Clark Kent becoming Superman. Kristin Kreuk makes a great Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum is excellent as Lex Luthor, Annette O'Toole and John Schneider are good as Johnathan and Martha Kent, Allison Mack is excellent as Chloe Sullivan, and Sam Jones III is good as Pete Ross. Special mention must also go to John Glover who is excellent as Lionel Luthor, and the incomparable Christopher Reeve as Dr. Virgil Swann. Classic ""Smallville"" season 2 episodes are ""Vortex,"" ""Heat,"" ""Duplicity,"" ""Red,"" ""Visage,"" ""Fever,"" ""Rosetta,"" and ""Exodus."" (10/5)

Video: ""Smallville: Season 2"" comes to DVD in an outstanding 1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen transfer. These transfers are abolutely stunning. The colors look superb, sharpness and detail are excellent. Simply put, the transfer is smashing. (5/5)

Audio: The Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround is excellent. Most 5.1 tracks wish they could be this good. In Dolby Prologic II, the soundfield is completely immersive. Very well done. (4/5)

Extras: First up, there are two commentary tracks on the episodes ""Red"" and ""Rosetta."" The first on both episodes is by the series creators and producers. The second one features Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, and Greg Beeman. All four commentaries are good. The ones with the producers are more technical, while the ones with the cast are more fun.

There is also a gag reel, deleted scenes, 2 featurettes, and the ""Chloe Chronicles"" Webisodes series. Not a ton of stuff, but fun and informative nontheless. (4/5)

Overall: The second season of ""Smallville"" is a true winner, and the DVD is no exception. Great audio and video transfers and some fun extras to boot make this easy to recommend. Enjoy your visit to ""Smallville!"" (5/5)",1143158400,7,2182,5.066852367688022

The series may have started off nice and worthy of the legacy but the way that TPTB are headed with their vision of this Clark Kent and Lois Lane many of us diehard fans will be left dissapointed. Lets let the almighty dollar do it's work and lets vote with it by avoiding the purchase of Smallville products like the DVD's and other related items.

If at all possible try to return the sets you already have even if they are open. Make sure the retailer knows the reason is because you are becoming disenchanted by where the story is going and you wish to voice your opinion retroactively by withdrawing your financial support of the show. (You can always buy them again later when they get their act together, just as long as the point that you are trying to voice your opinion is heard)

Now you may think that as a comic fan or chlois fan you are only a small portion of the ratings pool that actually gives a damn if Clark is portrayed properly or Chlois happens but think about this: We may be a small segment of the ratings pool but we are the bulk of the fandom that buys the DVD's, the comics, the companion book tie-ins, go to the ComicCons/conventions, and will buy the future action figures/video games/and other ties in that are yet to come.

In the end they will have to take a look and decide which would they rather make happy? The bulk of the ratings fans who tune in and sit and watch the series at home and view a few comercials, or the smaller fandom part that will spend the money long after the series is forgotten.",1137715200,,1567,4.3561643835616435
2007755,5,B0001JXPPC,"I loved the first season of ""Smallville"", and so I immediately rushed out and bought the second season on DVD.  The second season surpasses the first in nearly all ways, though it does have its flaws.

For the second season, the show focused a lot more on the Clark/Lana relationship and a lot less on the ""Creature of the Week"".  The writers were obviously trying to draw out the relationship so that viewers would be more interested; this is understandable, but the way they did it was less than spectacular.  It's the same thing, over and over: Clark and Lana give each other looks, things start going well, and then either Clark or Lana decide that they'd better stay apart.  This becomes very irritating by the end of the season.  The one episode dealing with the relationship which really followed the right path was ""Rush"".

This season imported more chunks of the Superman mythology.  In ""Heat"", Clark discovers his heat vision - and in a very creative move on the creators' part, it's triggered by the inevitable teen thoughts of sex!  In ""Red"", Clark discovers the effects of red kryponite on his body.  ""Rosetta"" is the famous episode which guest stars the late, great Christopher Reeve.  In the episode, Clark learns much about his origins, including the fate of the planet Krypton.

The acting is top-notch in the season.  Even in the weaker episodes, the acting is terrific.  Particularly great is Michael Rosenbaum - Lex is given a chance to shine in this season.  There's more cool effects and a terrific soundtrack, not to mention some well-written scripts and impressive directing.

Again, my one complaint is that certain things had become annoyingly repetetive by the end of the season.  Lex always suspects Clark, and the conversation always ends the same.  Chloe always becomes upset with Clark, and they have the same argument.  And, as I've mentioned, the Clark/Lana relationship was played around with too much.

People who enjoyed the first season will love the second.  Great acting, fine scripts, more of the Superman mythos and a terrific soundtrack.  This is good stuff.

Plenty of action, violence, and sexual situations make this a definite PG rated series, but fans of the SUPERMAN myth will eat it up with a spoon...especially the carefully constructed attention to the mythology and lore of the guy in the red cape.

Frequently sentimental but rarely corny, the actors/characters they portray have improved from Season One and develop the complexities that give them contemporary relevance and staying power.  The odd boom shadow or transparent special effect is certainly forgivable...it's amazing how well they've done on a mere ""TV"" budget and constraints.  My only pet peeve continues to be the weak casting of supporting/day player roles, presumeably to fulfill the Canadian content laws of their location shooting.

Clark's relationships with his parents, his love interest Lana Lang, gal pal Chloe, long time buddy Pete and one day arch enemy Lex Luther also continue to evolve and get put to the test.

2007791,5,B0001JXPPC,"The series improves dramatically with the arrival of its second season. We can attribute this change largely to the fact that the show's writers brought the overall story arc out of the shadows and began spending much more time on character and plot development.

The ""meteor rocks"" still play large parts in many of the episodes, but unlike most of the first season, not every dire situation is a result of a high school student's close encounters with the glowing green stuff.

Some highlights of the season include:

""Skinwalker,"" where Clark discovers a cave with mysterious connections to his home planet.

""Insurgence,"" where it is first revealed to the Kents that Lionel Luthor has an unhealthy obsession with the meteor rocks and with a certain teenage superhero.

""Rosetta,"" with the guest appearance of Christopher Reeve, who gives Clark a message from his biological father and who introduces the name of Krypton into the show's ongoing story.

""Exodus,"" the season finale, in which Clark follows the destiny that Jor-El laid out for him, leaving Smallville behind without looking back.",1123977600,,1097,5.134831460674158

2007825,5,B0001JXPPC,"The creators of Smallville stated in a TV Guide interview that the first season of Smallville was dealing with Clark coping with his powers and his secret.  The second season was to deal mostly with Clark trying to find out where he came from.

Some intriguing storylines are created in this season as Clark finds mysterious Indian caves that tells the future of an ancient legendary hero who is destined to fight an evil force on the Earth.  Could this be about Superman?  IS there a connection between the caves and the people from Krypton?  There are cave paintings that give Clark some insight.  We also find out that the key to his spaceship plays an important role in these caves as well.

Lex continues to try to find out about the mystery that is Clark Kent, much against the suspicious Jonathan Kent who believes that Lex is the same as his father, Lionel.  We also discover how driven and sadistic Lionel can be even when dealing with Lex.  ""If you're going to take me on, son, then you'd better bring your game up to a whole new level,"" Lionel tells him.

And alas, viewers wonder about the possible budding romance between Clark Kent and Lana Lang.  Deep down, we know that Clark ultimately ends up with one Lois Lane, but we are still intrigued by this teen romance as Clark struggles to be honest with Lana about himself and his abilities.  This will be an issue that carries over into Season 3.  The writers are smart.  They know that the death to most any television show is when two people get together.

The writers of the 80s show, Moonlighting, had viewers in front of their sets every week to find out if Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd would ever get together.  Once they did, the rating plummeted as viewers were now no longer interested.  The writers of Smallville are quick to recognize that keeping Clark and Lana apart is key.  It's one of the things that keeps us coming back each week.

A few complaints about Season 2.  First, Lana Lang goes from sweet, coffee waitress to a black-belt Buffy.  Unfortunately, this also carries over into Season 3.  Lex trains Lana (after she's attacked in the Talon) in how to defend herself.  Ironically, Lex can scarcely hold his own in a fight, and I've never seen him use his supposed martial arts skills.  It's nice to see that Lana can defend herself, but it becomes quite exaggerated in some of the storylines.

And from Season 1, Chloe is still the Queen of contacts all over Smallville and Metropolis.  She has more resources than Woodward and Bernstein!

These are minor issues though, and they don't take away from the fun and genious of this great storyline of Clark Kent.  We also are treated the best episode of Smallville that I've seen yet...the introduction of Dr. Virgil Swann played beautifully by Christopher Reeve.  The show even had pieces of the original John Williams music playing from the original Superman movie.  Although at a conference with Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), Reeve asked him, ""What the hell is that key for anyway?""

If you enjoyed Season 1, then you'll be quick to sit down and watch Season 2, and we watch Clark gain another power and struggle to find out who he is and where he came from.",1121904000,,3198,4.6070796460176995

2007828,5,B0001JXPPC,"While I very much enjoyed Season One of SMALLVILLE, I felt the show suffered from two major weaknesses:  1) the insufficient focus on the characters and their interaction and 2) the over reliance on the kryptonite-freak-of-the-week plot device.  The great news about Season Two is that they deemphasized the freak-of-the-week gimmick, and instead focused on a series of storylines that centered on character development.  The result was a vast improvement in the quality of the series.  Season One showed that SMALLVILLE had the potential to become a quality series, and Season Two fulfilled that potential.

As we see the characters develop during the course of the season, we also see their relationships become more complicated.  With Lindsey gone, the seemingly inevitable relationship between Clark and Lana is free to develop.  While they do manage something approaching a romance, things are complicated by a number of factors, including the Lana's certainty that Clark is hiding many important things from her.  In fact, one of the themes of the entire season is the inability of the main characters to be honest with one another.  Clark, Lana, Chloe, Pete, Lex (and Lex's father), and Clark's parents all hide various things from other characters at one point or another.  By the end of the season, many of the relationships and friendships have been affected by an inability to be either open or honest.

We also see Clark gradually acquire additional powers during the course of the season.  In addition to X-ray vision, he develops his heat vision, and we get additional hints that the ability to fly might soon develop.  More crucially, Clark discovers caves upon the walls of which are inscribed symbols that look suspiciously like those contained on various parts of his spaceship.  Before the season is over, these will aid in his discovery of who he truly is, and will start pointing towards his future development.  The other major development in regard to his powers is his revealing to Pete the nature and extent of his secret.

One thing that I find both curious and interesting is the opposition that this show provokes on the part of Superman traditionalists, who somehow feel that the show violates the spirit of the original creation.  I am mystified by this because Superman has always been prone to revision and reconceptualization.  Few serious Superman fans object, for instance, to the exceedingly dark reinventions of Superman and Batman at the hands of such stellar artists/writers as Alan Moore and Frank Miller.  The poet Jack Butler wrote a wonderful poem about Superman depicting him as a middle-aged has been, a poem that is praised by its readers.  Yet for some reason SMALLVILLE is disapproved by ""purists.""  But even the traditional Superman that we associate with the forties, fifties, and sixties is very different from the original character.  For instance, Superman could not originally fly.  Was the addition of the ability to fly improper?  I personally love to see people exploring variations of the Superman legend, as long as they are respectful or serious, and no one who has actually watched SMALLVILLE could argue that they are not respectful.  In fact, the show continually pays homage to entire Superman tradition.  For instance, they acknowledge the Christopher Reeves movies both by having Reeves himself appear in two different episodes and by on these occasions working the John Williams's Superman theme into the score.  Every episode begins by acknowledging Jerry Siegal and Joe Shuster as the creators of the show, and many episodes contain references of one sort or another to Siegal or Shuster.  In other words, the show knows where it comes from, and they are generous in acknowledging that.  Besides, if someone dislikes a particular variant, they can skip it.  No one is forced to watch SMALLVILLE.  I do think that the show is a worthy addition to the Superman saga, and is remarkable for having presented the most interesting and complex depiction of Lex Luthor, converting him from a simple arch villain to a complex, many-sided character possessing great potential for either good or evil.

This is one of a series of shows that seems to have profited from the example of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  During the 1990s many series were struggling with the new potential the medium was displaying in the wake of TWIN PEAKS.  The first show to really begin exploiting this potential was THE X-FILES (a show that feeds into SMALLVILLE by the presence of a large number of people who either acted or were part of the production staff of both shows), but the lone mistake that that great show made (amid a vast number of marvelous achievements) was to structure the show around the mythology and the events of each week instead of the characters.  We all really watched THE X-FILES for Mulder and Scully instead of the weird phenomena, but the show never structurally reflected that.  BUFFY was the show that first emphasized characters and their stories over the mysteries.  We have since seen a number of shows that have followed in BUFFY's tracks-DEAD LIKE ME, WONDERFALLS, VERONICA MARS, and LOST (the co-creator of the latter acknowledges this explicitly)-and SMALLVILLE is one of these.  Despite the tendency of network execs to cancel shows with long story arcs and despite the unwelcome presence of so many reality shows, this truly might be the Golden Age of narrative television.",1118188800,4,5451,5.035674470457079

2007832,5,B0001JXPPC,"Leaping onto the television landscape in Fall 2001, Smallville follows the exploits of a young Clark Kent in the years leading up to his emergence as the beloved Superman. Following a slew of TV renditions of the character's life since the comic book first appeared, Smallville sets itself apart by focusing on the lesser discussed niche of Clark's earliest developmental days. Superb casting and consistent writing have combined to make Smallville one of the more popular shows on television (especially in international markets), making the show one of the WB network's most successful creations to date...

Tom Welling stars in the imminent role of teenager Clark Kent, a refugee from the dying planet of Krypton. His ship having landed in the rural American town of Smallville, Clark is raised by locals Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan Kent (John Schneider - of Dukes of Hazzard fame) as their own son. Unlike some of the film and TV spin-offs, Smallville attributes powers to other individuals in the area as a result of some of the debris associated with Krypton's destruction. As a result, Clark is forced to keep his own powers a secret while battling against other individuals who are more powerful than traditional human criminal elements. The show also provides a glimpse into the early friendship experienced between Clark and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) as well as Clark's romance with two high school classmates, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Part sci-fi fantasy and part teenage soap, Smallville is an instant television classic...

The Smallville (Season 2) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Vortex"" in which Clark rescues Lana from certain death while Jonathan is buried alive with a obnoxious journalist (who's uncovered the story of Clark's secret powers). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor struggles with his own personal guilt while at the bedside of his critically injured father... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Red"" in which Clark first comes into contact with the dreaded ""red kryptonite,"" prompting a change in his personality and demeanor, and ""Rush"" in which the entire student body of Clark's high school becomes infected with a ""bug"" that causes them to participate in outrageously dangerous behavior...

2007843,5,B0001JXPPC,"One of the complaints I and many had with the first season is that it almost had a freak of the week feeling, where characters had kryptonite-induced powers that would try to hurt either Lana, Chloe, Pete, or Clark's parents. Very repetitive. This is where the series starts getting better and more confident in their stories.

Second seasons are usually where everything starts. Like in most shows, the first season is the testing grounds, since shows have a 50% chance of being cancelled, they try not to overload the plot of the show then have it cancelled. Smallville is the same way: not much for plot development than season 2 hits and it takes off.

There's definate highlights in this disc: the premiere Vortex, Clark developing heat vision in Heat, him being uninhibited on red kryptonite in Red, him leaping his first building, well sort of anyway. Other highlights include him discovering some of his origins in Skinwalker, the big episode Rosetta with Christopher Reeve, the introduction of Jor-El and the finale.

It's quite a nice season to a show that seems to get better and better.",1107907200,2,1098,4.86096256684492
2007844,5,B0001JXPPC,"We pick up where we left off in season one, in the eye of the Tornado and, once the dust has settled, several things come to light over the next few episodes.

Lex falls for an attractive teacher who seems to have some kind of power over men...and even gets Lex to marry her (something told me this wasn't going to work out). Pete discovers the spaceship in a field and Clark feels compelled to tell him his secret...which might just be more than Pete can handle.

We discover the effect that red kryptonite has on Clark Kent (don't trust our guy when he's wearing black). And, of course, there's Lana...sweet, innocent Lana, who Clark can't seem to let into his life...and who sees this as a stumbling block in their road to happiness. And, of course, there's Chloe, still hoping that Clark would see her as the woman of his dreams (he could do a lot worse, believe me).

All this and the return of Ryan from season one, the return of Whitney Forman (or was it??), the blindness of Lionel Luthor, and the discovery of Lex's half-brother Lucas.

All that aside, the highlight of the season without a doubt, was the episode ""Rosetta"" and the appearance of Christopher Reeve as the mysterious Dr. Virgil Swann. This could be seen as the late Mr. Reeve's stamp of approval on the Smallville series...which it was, Reeve was a big fan of the show. This would lead to another appearance in season three and talk of more appearances until his unfortunate death last October.

And, of course, we can't forget Dr. Helen Bryce as played by the very beautiful Emanuelle Vaugier, who becomes Mrs. Lex Luthor number two.

Season two progressed the story nicely, we see Clark learn a lot about himself and he seems to take comfort in having someone know his secret, which almost backfires in ""Rush"" when Pete takes advantage of this.

We see Lex Luthor on the periphery...but still believing he is, deep down, a good man...though everything seems to be pointing toward the opposite direction.

Great extras, enjoyed the commentaries (though Kristen Kreuk was basically useless in that role), the Chloe Chronicles and the features on the visual effects and Christopher Reeve (here's hoping the fourth season set contains a tribute to this great actor and even better human being).

2007845,5,B0001JXPPC,"Smallville has some of the most amazing special effects on television.  How they can produce a weekly show with the special effects quality of a megabudget movie like the Matrix is worth getting this CD set.  But on to the episodes itself.

Season Two chronicles the further development of Clark's gifts and relationship with his friends, especially Lana.  For anyone who has ever had a crush on someone from afar, this is one of the more satisfying season.  Clark, of course, gets up the courage to finally admit to Lana about his crush.  Major theme of Smallville, of course.

Lex gets betrayed by the women he marries, and Lionel's dark side  becomes apparent.  Meanwhile, Chloe still harbors an unrequited hopeless crush for Clark, but manages to be the smartest cynical kid in Smallville.  Chloe and Lana develops a sister-like relationship when Lana moves in with Chloe.  Pete, as Clark's best friend, also becomes Clark's confidante.  Lots of development in this season for those of us who enjoy the growing up aspect of Clark and Smallville.  Plot movement  as far as the superman mythology, this season moves this along at a good pace.

DVD Quality - great.  Commentary from the executive producers and the stars Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk.  Place this in the computer, and you get a little more insight into the town of Smallville.

2007846,5,B0001JXPPC,"While I love the show, I was disappointed with the Season One DVD set of SMALLVILLE. However, everything that I felt was lacking in the first set, is here is this second season set! There's a hilarious ""gag reel"" which includes a pretty good impression of Christopher Walken by Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and wait until you see Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luther) at the end doing a dance routine that will make you wet your pants.
Also included are TWO commentary tracks (Both of which feature Tom Welling, Kristin Kruek (Lana Lang), and Michael Rosenbaum...oh, and the annoyingly voiced Co-Producer, Greg Beeman)
The first commentary track is for the episode ""Red"" which introduces red krytonite (It makes Clark go baaaaad). If your tastes lean toward a serious, information-rich commentary, this is NOT the one to listen to, as it is totally unprofessional, completely hilarious, and my personal favorite!
The second commentary track is for the episode ""Rosetta"" (That's the one with Christopher Reeve, as Dr. Virgil Swan) A little more serious of a commentary track, but Michael Rosenbaum is still cracking wise through it.
There are SIX deleted scenes (""Heat"" ""Duplicity"" ""Dichotic"" ""Prodigal"" ""Fever"" and ""Exodus"")
There is also TWO featurettes: one is about the visual effects of the show (Sorry, they don't exactly show you how they do that stuff, though they DO show a breakdown of how they filmed the ""200 foot leap"" that Clark does in the episode ""Insurgence"" and a couple of other effects from other episodes) and the other featurette is about Christopher Reeve (His ""Superman"" career, as well as cast and crew talking about what it was like to get him to be on the show.) I liked them both, personally.
There's also a quirky little feature called ""Chloe's Chronicles"" which is the character of Chloe videotaping some of her investigations and interviews with some people about the strange things that have been happening in Smallville. It's cute. Quirky, but cute, especially if you're a fan of the character (Which I am...What can I say, I like quirky!)
There also ROM-Enabled features for your computer (My DVD-ROM is being a brat, so I have no info on this)

This second season begins immediately after Season One ended, which I won't spoil for the late commers who have not seen the first season finale.
The next episode dives right into Clark gaining a new ""superpower.""
Episode 3 is where a main character finds out Clark's secret.
Episode 4 is when red kryptonite is introduced (Baaaaad Clark)
In later episodes, we learn what happened to Lana's Marine Boyfriend, Whitney, Clark takes a not-so-flying leap, there is a nostalgic ""Who Shot J.R.?"" style episode involving Lionel Luthor,  Lex gets a brother, Clark gets a fever, Superman and Super-Teen meet for the first time, Lana learns to kick some a$$, Chloe is tempted by the dark side of the force, the cave pictographs drive a specialist insane, and Lana and Clark advance things just as everything revealed during the season comes to a head and Clark ends up...TO BE CONTINUED (Ain't I ba$tard?)

2007847,5,B0001JXPPC,"Actually, Clark goes to Metropolis a lot,  but i'm just saying that's how the finale ends... well season 2 picks up where season 1 left off...with clark running into a tornado to save lana, jonathan running into the open area to stop bad reporter man Nixon from revealing clark's secret to the world, martha watching the spaceship fly outta the cellar, although this is not shown, whitney running off to war, or something, lex, watching his daddy about to die, and pete and chloe doing absolutely nothing.

The tension builds between Clark and Lana as they struggle to further define their relationship.  Pete is given more screen time and has a more active role in some of the shows.  Lex continues to struggle between his desire to stay on the straight & narrow path and his desire to win at all costs.  Clark develops new powers and weaknesses as he tries to deal with the everyday trials of being a teenager.  Chloe is one of the only characters who seems to be unchanging.  She is inquisitive as ever and really adds to the show with all her snooping around.  Lionel Luther receives increased screen time and is as machiavellian as they come.

The DVD's are well put together.  All the shows are in widescreen format.  The picture and sound are great.  I really prefer to watch the episodes on DVD.  Watching the television show is a bit of a downer.  Too many commercials and the annoying logos and adds that pop up on the screen while the show is running.  Nice extras, although I've not accessed the DVD ROM features yet.

Also, there was a shameless plug for the TALON MIX(TM) cd on one of the episodes.  The TM is a collection of some of the songs that have appeared on SMALLVILLE during the first two seasons of the show.

I remember that some said Season 2 got away from 1st season's freak of the week plotline, I found that it wasn't toned down very much, still some very freaky characters this season.

Clark still hasn't told Lana the truth about himself (true to history, but he does end up telling Pete- who along with Chloe isn't an old character), still can't fly(except for the , maybe, tornado bit but he does develop heat vision. I liked the Christopher Reeve story, nice touch using Reeve in the series.

The deleted scenes included with most if not all episodes are interesting but you may want to watch them before letting the kids see them as some people seem to say sh-t when they blow a line. There's also a scene in a wine cellar, very expensive to set up it appears, of Lex having sex with some woman- no way that would ever be broadcast why did they even film it?

About the worst extra would be the Chloe Chronicles, or whatever they're called, in which Alison Mack in character plays a tabloid TV type reporter following up on a story based on some 1st season stuff- I didn't enjoy that at all.",1093737600,4,1243,4.395652173913043
2007872,5,B0001JXPPC,"Picking up right where season 1 left off, ""Smallville: Season 2"" starts out with a bang.  After leaving fans hanging for 3-4 grueling months of wondering what will Lex do about his father being trapped by a beam from the twister, will Johnathan Kent die or will he kill the reporter Dixon, will Clark get to Lana in time, and will Chloe stick to her guns about Clark leaving her in the midst of the storm to save Lana.  All of these questions were answered very nicely within the first episode, and the answers had some lingering effects throughout the rest of the season.  I'm not going to ruin what happens in season 2, in case there are people reading this review that are merely interested in watching 'Smallville' and have yet to get this far in the series.

The writing in this series was increasingly better in season 2, obviously the staff had a better feel for the characters and the show was more established allowing for fewer freak of the week episodes.  This season dealt more with Clark discovering his true heritage and coming to grips with the fact that he truly is alone in the universe.  Lex becomes somewhat darker, but not overtly and he still tries to do what's right, especially for the Kents.  Johnathan works at getting along with Lex better this season, and the writers finally give Martha more to do other than simply state the obvious.  Lana is dealt with in a more mature way that makes her seem more real as a person, the relationship between her and Clark becomes more real in the process.
The acting is top notch, all of the actors got better and were obviously comfortable with the characters.  Tom Welling had the biggest increase in his performance, during the red kryptonite episodes it was obvious he was truly enjoying the new side to Clark. Michael Rosenbaum continued to improve his already great performance as Lex Luthor.  Kristin Kruek really brings Lana to life this season and begins to establish herself as a mature character.

The series really picks up steam this season, not that season 1 was anything boring, it was great as well but paled in comparison to season 2.  Everything was just better this season, the writing, the special fx, the acting, and the surprises which include an incredible guest star that really pushes the Superman mythology forward in this series. Excellent back story to the Superman mythos.",1093564800,,2365,4.699757869249395
2007873,5,B0001JXPPC,"This is a top quality adaptation of the Superman legend. This season has a pivotal appearance by Christopher Reeve and some brilliant, exciting new twists on the Superman saga. Tom Welling (Clark), Kristin Kreuk (Lana) and Allison Mack (Chloe)are perfect.

It is the thoroughly engaging story of a young man with extraordinary powers on the cusp of adulthood. It is a superhero science fiction/ romance much like Spider-Man 2 was. Smallville has fantastic movie quality production values and spectacular effects. The writers overcome the challenge of creating villains powerful enough to threaten Clark.",1093046400,,603,5.483870967741935
2007874,5,B0001JXPPC,"The second season of this show is even better than the first one! The writing and acting improved drastically, and Tom Welling's acting ability blossomed considerably in this second season. The focus on character relationships is alot better than in the first season, and there's alot of character developement. There's still a heaping helping of Kryptonite mutants for Clark to square off with, however it's not as formulatic as in the first season. Also, the best episode of the season by far is the episode ""Rosetta"", featuring Christopher Reeve! It was a great episode, and not only did it delve into Clark's origins, but it felt almost like a passing of the torch, from one man of steel to the next. A great season, and definately a must own DVD set for Superman fans, along with the first season.
I sincerely hope that Warner Brothers chooses to use Tom Welling and the rest of the Smallville cast in a Superman movie. Smallville really does feel like it's a prequel to a Superman movie series, and it'd be a terrible shame if this vision is never realised. Christopher Reeve himself has endorsed Tom Welling as the next Superman for the silver screen, and is lobbying to get him into the new movie. Also, the performances of John Schneider, Annette O'Toole and Michael Rosenbaum are excellent as well, and it would be wonderful to see their performances carried into the new movie series.",1089158400,15,1395,4.79253112033195
2007875,5,B0001JXPPC,"Let me begin by saying, James Lowrie, a reviewer from Amazon, asked a question regarding the DVD. James, I have a response at the bottom of this review. :)
""SMALLVILLE"" the first season began on a dramatic high when a meteor shower struck the quaint little town of Smallville. From that shower came a young Clark Kent, a boy with special abilities. The first season played with the abilities and basically was action-packed, featuring a teenage Clark Kent battling meteor-freaks. It began very well, but still, had much room for improvement as far as storylines go.
Then came the thrilling opener to the second season, a continuation of the cliffhanger in season one. BOOM! BANG! Here it is, the second season! Here we see much more character developement, as Clark Kent digs deeper into his roots to really figure out who he is, and Lex Luthor (at this point Clark's good friend) tries to fight his demons, A.K.A. his twisted father, Lionel Luthor. Part of the genius of the season is Tom Welling's portrayal of Clark Kent. He plays the hero as not one of those action-movie type heroes, but rather, just a normal kid. He's not Superman yet. This is the story of how he becomes Superman, and thus, Tom Welling plays him as being just a mild-mannered teenager confused about his routes, wanting to know his destiny. Meanwhile, Michael Rosenbaum creates a dramatically brilliant performance as Lex Luthor. Poor Lex is tortured by the fact that he may grow up to be just like his father, and he is doing everything he finds humanly possible to stop that from happening. BUT...an important thing to see here is the point to all this. The creators of the show are not saying that if your father is a bad man, you will be. No. This season explores more in depth character study to show you that you CAN fight your destiny, but if you let your demons get in the way, like Lex's father, problems arise. At this point there's not much he can do to avoid it, but in the third season, Lex lets his father into his life in a way that creates more disturbing problems. The Lex and Lionel Luthor conflicts are part of the key reason for the show's massive success. John Glover plays Lionel with such a twsited outlook on life, but yet, gives the character many sides, so you also sympathize with him. His performance is incredible, and the chemistry between Glover and Rosenbaum is nothing short of extraordinary. As Lionel gets closer and clsoer to making Lex stray to the dark side, he also begins to be more and more curious about the enigma of Clark Kent. You see, Clark is trying to fight his destiny also. In an exquisite episode titled ""Rosetta"" he is told by Dr. Virgil Swann (CHRISTOPHER REEVES, THE MAN OF STEELE HIMSELF!) that his destiny is to take over the world. Now Clark is also on a quest to prevent his destiny from occurring. Thus, Clark and Lex are so much alike, but will ultimately be torn apart. Meanwhile, Clark and the love of his life, Lana Lang, grow closer, as his reporter friend, Chloe, who has the hots for him, becomes a bit envious.
Some of the best episodes include ""Insurgence"" in which Lionel Luthor bugs Lex's mansion with spy equipment, and Lex turns the tables, ""Rosetta"" the episode where Christopher Reeves reveals some secrets to Clark about his destiny, ""Calling"" where Clark begins to grow closer to Lana and Lionel grows closer to Clark's secret and ""Exodus"" the season finale that will take your breath away and leave you heartbroken and looking forward to the following season.
The DVD features are all very excellent, including a behind the scenes look at the making of the superb special effects in the show, an interview with some actors, including Christopher Reeves, deleted scenes, the CHLOE CHRONICLES, and a hilarious blooper reel! :)
And, James Lowrie, to answer your question, yes, the DVD does come with a booklet, at least mine did. I'm curious why yours didn't? It should be right in the front there in the front pouch.",1087689600,7,3966,4.667142857142857
2007876,5,B0001JXPPC,"This dvd is so exciting.  This show is the most enjoyable show on t.v.  It has great eps. such as Red which is one of my favorites is shows clark can be bad and really hot all at the same time. also its the first time lana and him kiss probably one of the most romantic kisses you will see on tv.  another really good eps. is Progil, Lex recovers his long-lost brother Lucas (mentioned in ""Lineage"") from a situation with Asian criminals and brings him to Smallville as a ploy to buy out his father. Lucas switches sides with Lionel (who set the whole thing up), kicking out Lex who moves in with the Kents. But Lucas has plans of his own and figures out Lionel can see (as does Lex later). Lex figures things out while some of Lucas' gambling ""partners"" show up to make things rough for him. Lionel taunts Lucas into going after Lex, and Lucas decides to go with homicide and force Lionel to shoot him. It turns out Lionel set up everything to play the two against each other but when Lucas threatens to kill Lex, Lionel gets the gun (with some secret help from Clark) and shoots Lucas . . . but the gun has blanks - Lex and Lucas teamed up to play Lionel. Lionel gives back Lex control of the company in return for his silence in the matter and Lex keeps Lucas under his protection.
Meanwhile, Clark applies for a job at the Talon but the situation becomes hazy when Lucas butts in as Lana's new partner. He ends up losing the job to go rescue Lionel and Lex, who don't need it anyway - leaving the Clark/Lana relationship up in the air once more. also a good eps is Ryan it's really sad and it shows Clark can't save eveyone.  So this show has everything excitment, romance, adventure, and some are tearjerkers because it shows Lional being really mean and hateful to Lex and you'll know why if you've seen a certian eps. in season 3.  I hope my review was helpful to everyone :)",1087430400,3,1882,4.275280898876405

2007912,5,B0001JXPPC,"Being a fan of both the comics and the first season of this fabulous show, I came into the second season of Smallville with some pretty high expectations.  This second chapter in this excellent series exceeds all of them, and even goes someplaces I didn't expect.
It seems like a practice or formula that TV series, no matter what they are - comedy, drama, action, etc. - seem to get better as time goes on, especially in the second and third season.  The main reason for this, I think, is twofold: one, the actors have settled into their roles by the beginning of the other seasons, and can therefore experiment a bit with their skills, while also being true to the character that they're playing, making the character come to life even more.  Secondly, the writers tend to work closely with the actors, giving them scripts and dialouge that fits the actor as well as the character. The point behind this rant is that both these practices are in place for Smallville, and put to darn good use.
The cast improves their performances over last season, which was really good beforehand.  (Michael Rosenbaum won a Saturn Award for his portrayal of Lex, and the whole show was nominated in several areas.)  The special effects look even better, and the stories have evolved.  The first season suffered a bit from a kind of ""monster of the week"" kind of setup, and the second season uses that a bit too, but to a lesser degree.  The second season focuses on the relationships between characters, Clark's origins and emerging abilities, as well as how Clark is affecting the entire town.
All in all, it seems like a perfect follow up to a great first run.  The ""cliffhanger"" for this season doesn't evoke that feeling of ""Oh, God, no!""  It works nonetheless, and has me drooling for more.  Hopefully Warner Brothers doesn't take a year to release the 3rd season.  I hear it's a doozy.",1085616000,,1877,4.640483383685801
2007913,4,B0001JXPPC,"...you're probably not going to buy this DVD set unless you're already a Smallville fan.  This is not the sort of show you take a blind leap of faith on.  I certainly didn't.  But, that said, I'm not a Smallville fan from 'way back'.  I got out of the shower one night about a year ago, having left the TV on for my cat, and caught the tail end of an episode.  Okay, so I liked it.  It isn't perfect but the idea is so very full of potential.  The writing is pretty good and there are some stand outs among the actors.  It's worth the time.  And this is coming from someone who watches about 3 hours of TV a week now that the networks have decided that we are all mindless and a little bit cruel (reality TV, you know I'm talking about you).
This DVD set is much better than the first season.  More extras, and more interesting extras.  The packaging is really excellent.  I love the flip book approach as opposed to the fold out track most DVD sets take.  If you're a Smallville fan, this is a must have.

Well acted, well written, well produced and directed. Each of these actors/actresses knows that they're doing and they work so well together to make every episode as memorable as possible. My favorite episode from this season is probably ""Suspect"", partially because it's John Schneider's big episode of the season (big ""Dukes Of Hazzard"" fan), and John is partially the reason why I like the show.

2007919,4,B0001JXPPC,"The legendary adventures of the Teen of Steel continues with ""Smallville: The Complete Second Season"". In this second season, Clark Kent (Tom Welling) begins to investigate his origins and learns some stunning revelations of his true destiny on Earth. The rivalry between Lex Luther (Michael Rosenbaum) and his devious father Lionel (John Glover) heats up and the new woman in Lex's life (Emmanuelle Vaugier) could be his salvation or tragic fall. The close friendship between Lana Lang (Kristen Kreuk) and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) creates certain difficulties for Clark. ""Smallville"" is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The second season shows some improvements in the series' dramatic content and the relationship between the characters, and also avoids the repetitive ""meteor freak of the week"" trend. The episodes storylines appear more creative and better structured, and allow the supporting cast to have a stronger effect in the series' outcome. The second season also delivers some thrilling action sequences and great visual effects.

The ""Second Season"" 6-Disc Box Set is a reasonable improvement over the ""First Season"" Box Set. Like the previous box set, all 23 episodes are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality isn't spectacular but is certainly well-defined. The Dolby Digital 2.0 sound is rather pleasant. Some episodes contain deleted scenes and insightful audio commentaries with producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, and cast members Tom Welling, Kristen Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum. The box set also includes the engaging ""The Chloe Chronicles"", ""Christopher Reeve: Man of Steel"" and ""Faster than a Speeding Bullet"" featurettes, a fun gag reel and some colorful interactive menus.

2007920,5,B0001JXPPC,"Smallville is an awesome show. The first season on DVD was great and Season 2 will be joining us shortly.
If you don't know the story of Smallville yet, it's pretty simple to follow. Tom Welling plays a teenage Clark Kent. He still lives with parents Martha(O'Toole) and Johnathon(Scheinder) Kent. They live in a small farm in the small town on Smallville, Kansas. Clark is in love with Lana Lang(Kruek) who he goes to high school with. Clark is best friends with the local billionare playboy Lex Luthor(Rossenbaum). Lex is in the town proving he can one day lead the business his father Lionel(Glover) had made. Clark has two other good friends from school Chloe(Mack)who is the high school paper editor. Pete(Jones)is Clarks lifelong best friend and is the only one other than his parents that knows of Clarks secrets.
In Smallville we have a young Clark Kent who has yet to develop all of his powers and abilities. He is struggling to be normal and has to coup with the problems of daily teenage life. His biggest struggle is doing that with the struggle to keep his abilities a secret and lead a normal life.
Season 2 is a great addition onto this TV show. There are some great episodes in this season. The first good one they did was ""Heat."" In Heat Clark develops his heat vision powers. It's fun watching him as he learns to coop and deal with it. He can't control it at first and struggles with it. To make matters worse there is Lex's new fiance a guest appearnce by the lovely Krista Allen. She has the abilites to seduce men to do her wants and she is running the town amuck. Clark must get his powers under control and stop her.
Rosetta is one of the best shows the series did. It guess stared everybodies favorite Superman Christoper Reeves. He plays a Dr. that can explain the local cave painting to Clark, and he is one of the few people that know his secret.
Red was another great episode. In this episode Clark gets some Red Kryptonite. Red kyrptonite makes Clark act not normal and he kind of acts the opposite of him normal self. Theres some hot blonde that co-stars in this episode and this episode is just fun.
There are some other turning point episodes in the series. In Skinwalkers Clark finds out about some mysterious caves that prophesy about him. These will play a huge roll in season three.
Lex has a girlfriend and they get married in the season finale of 2. There relationship develops throughout the season.
Clark and Lana also shine in this season. Whitney is out of the way and Clark can finally go after her.
This is a great show and Season 2 is a great continuation of it. I love all 23 episodes of it. The episodes are spread out over six discs. The season contains some nice extras. Two of the episodes contain guest commentary and some deleted scenes. The set contains the Chloe chronicles which were some short videos of her talking about the weirdness in Smallville. Theres a gag reel and an interview with Christopher Reeve. We also get a special on the special effects of Smallville. The show also can be viewed in widescreen format.
Like I said, I'm very excited that this show is finally out on DVD and will be here in less than a week. This is the best show on television and nothing is better than watching it whenever you want to. If you like the show you have to get it on DVD.",1084320000,2,3326,4.472039473684211

The ""Freak of the Week"" episodes are still very well written, though, particularly ""Ryan.""  Ryan is a returning favorite from season one in this particularly moving episode.  The one MAJOR flaw that Smallville is accountable for is the WB style ""teenage"" casting.  I would first believe that the main character Tom Welling is a unemployed, thrice divorced, middle-aged man before I considered him a high school student.  Sixteen years old my ass, the guy looks about 35.  I have trouble imagining Clark and his friends dealing with the hormonal difficulties of puberty when they are old enough to be helping their grandchildren with those problems.

2007932,5,B0001JXPPC,"The first season of WB's young Superman show ""Smallville"" was great, but season 2 completely tears it apart and steps on the pieces. Clark gains new powers and a new confident; Lex and his father (John Glover, now a series regular) take their power struggle to the next level; Lana discovers her dad and moves in with Chloe; more is revealed about the day of the meteor shower; and in a surprising appearance by Christopher Reeve, the overall mythology is pushed further along than anyone could've expected. It all culminates in a shocking season finale that completely tears apart the series even more than the twisters did the first time around.
If I have one gripe with Smallville though, it's that the show writes off its supporting cast way too quickly. A few characters that we remember from season 1 take their last bow here (including Eric Johnson as Whitney), and new supporting characters introduced this season don't seem to last very long. This problem has grown more obvious as Smallville rapidly approaches the end of season 3. Hopefully it's something the series writers will take into consideration for future seasons.
Season 2 looks to be another decent set from WB. There are a few more extras this year, including the ""Chloe Chronicles"" that were featred on AOL, and commentary by the cast.

2007934,5,B0001JXPPC,"Who am I?. Where did I come from?. What is my destiny?. Those are the questions that make up the main story arc for the second season of this wonderful show. Origins. It was a fantastic direction for the show after it's debut season, which was very good, but was too ""Monster Of The Week"". The series really gets settled and comes into it's own in this spectacular season that definitley raises the bar. It starts to add onto the already existing mythology and legend of Superman, while creating it's very own. The show is always at it's best when it touches upon the mythology and tweaks it. The season begins with the fantastic ""Vortex"", where our characters and the town come to grips after a devastating tornado. ""Heat"" is a very cool episode where Clark gains another super power. Judging from the title, you know what that is. One of the best episodes of the season is the episode ""Duplicity"", where friend Pete learns of Clark's true secret. Other stand outs include the classic ""Red"", where Clark comes into contact with red kryptonite, which turns him into the Anti-Clark. The mysterious indian caves that have ancient paintings on the wall that could be extraterrestial set in motion the main story in ""Sleepwalker"", but the story really hits it's mark with the powerful and historic ""Rosetta"", which features Christopher Reeve as a brilliant scientist who just may have answers Clark is looking for. A superb episode that features a hint of the Superman theme. You WILL get shivers. Former regular Whitney returns in ""Visage"", or does he?. There are many other great eps here like ""Fever"", ""Precipice"", and the excellent two part finale, ""Calling"" and ""Exodus"". There are more great moments, but too many to mention. There are a handful of throwaway eps like ""Dichotic"", with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a student who can clone himself, and the return of season 1's Ryan in ""Ryan"". The show is beautifully shot and choreographed and uses bright, vibrant colors. The special effects are top notch and some of the best seen on television. The effects are very sophisticated and eye grabbing. The acting has improved, not that it was bad. Tom Welling has settled and seems more comfortable in the role of Clark. Michael Rosenbaum continues to shine as Lex Luthor, and his relationship with his dad Lionel(Who is played by the fantastic John Glover)is fascinating and undeniable. One reviewer asks why Lex is even in the story. Huh?. I guess HE doesn' know the story. John Schneider and Annette 'O' Toole are also on hand as Jonathan and Martha Kent, giving two worthwhile performances and some of the best representations of parents on TV. Friend Pete though, while getting some more scenes, is still used sparingly. Kristin Kreuk, while beautiful and alluring, does what she can with Lana, and the writers have done little to expand on the character. While many people will belittle the show for heading into the relationship area and soap opera-y type stuff, that isn't the point. Clark loved Lana and so it is being showed. It doesn't make it less worthwhile or light. The writing isn't up to the high standards by other shows, but it is what the show is and it's solid, intelligent, and well crafted. There is no doubt that ""Smallville"" will continue to fly high(as it already has), and won't be coming down any time soon.",1082592000,2,3332,4.806620209059234
2007935,4,B0001JXPPC,"In the second season of Smallville, Clarke has to deal with a lot more. He gets a new power. He can now shoot lazers out of his eyes and he has to learn how to control it. In a great episode, he accidently gets his hands on some red Kryptonite. Red Kryptonite makes him not care about anyone else and do things that he wouldn't usually do. In another episode Lex Luther crosses the darkside more. He has people break into Luther Corp ""his father's building"". He wants them to get something for jim but instead they take his father and Clarke's mother hostage. So Clarke has to find a way around the cops to get in the building. Clarke also finds a cave in a episode that may give him information about his alien races past and may tell him a little about himself in the process. Lionel Luther hires a scientist to check out the cave and while he is a strange light comes out of one of the symbols and hits him. He wakes up knowing Clarke's secret and also with some powers of his own. Also in this season the voice of his real father comes from the ship he arrived in demanding that he follows his destiny.
  The show got more clever in season 2, it had a lot more ideas than the first season. It still has a lot of villains of the week don't get me wrong. It still has kid's showing up with special powers  from ""the meteor rocks"" and Clarke having to stop them. I love the show but think they used that idea too much. Plus gets annoying that Clarke shows up to save Lana when she just happens to be knocked out and can't see him use his powers each and every time. None of that holds the show down though. It's still very entertaining and once you start watching you just can't stop.",1080000000,3,1685,4.178461538461539
2007936,5,B0001JXPPC,"The old plot of the meteor rock-laced villain(s) of the week from season 1 were growing tiresome and the writers knew it. Season 3 so far has shown the downfall of several characters (including Lex) and the breakup of several characters' relationships. Enter season 2, where Clark fights far fewer villains, but these baddies have more personality. Several key Superman storylines are thrown in (""Red""), and secrets are revealed (""Duplicity""). Lex gets married, though only for a short time, and the Kents get a surprise of their own. The Man of Steel himself, Christopher Reeve, makes a guest appearance in ""Rosetta"", which is considered by most to be the best episode in the series so far. Just when you thought season 1's cliffhanger was a show-stopper, season 2's blew the roof off the building! If you haven't seen season 2 yet, go for it and try and get caught up with season 3 before it's over!",1079827200,,901,4.782051282051282
2007937,5,B0001JXPPC,"As the author of the fantasy epic Bloodspiller I can honestly lay claim to having at least some knowledge of what is excellent mythology and the fine art of story-telling. What a fabulous series! Like certain other favorites of mine, I can watch each episode over and over again. And why is this? Because the show works on so many levels that it not only appeals to every generation but the multi-layered plotting is an insatiable magnet. Lets first put a bottom line on this show---the Luthors are the show. Without their conniving,  with each other and others, there's no draw for the adults in the audience. Yes, the kents are familiar and comfortable, both the actors themselves and the iconic figures that they portray, but Lex and his father do it for me. Thanks to them we're able to get away from the Nightstalker Kolchak type monster or weirdo of the week. Now in seasons two and three we're hip deep in personal intrigues. For the younger generation we have Clark and his friends and the ongoing sturm and drang of his love-life with Lana.
  The show just keeps getting better and better, month by month, year by year. Whata fabulous arc of quality. By the way, Tom Welling was approached to play Superman in the proposed movie, but couldn't find time away from the series to do it. It's the logical choice of course. Warner should wait until the series ends its seven year run and put Tom in  the blue spandex. I would love to see the series end with him finally posing in front of a mirror in the iconic outfit and the show just fades out with the lingering Superman music they sneak in from time to time.",1079654400,4,1617,4.508532423208191
2007938,5,B0001JXPPC,"I have to admit when I first heard about Smallville I had many doubts.  A show about ""Superboy"" essentially???  No costume?  No Flying?
But the producers succeeded in making a superhero show that is not about a superhero.  Tom welling's brilliantly downplayed role as the young Clark Kent, learing and coming to grip with his powers has been a wonderful surprise to TV viewers and a nice addition to the Superman mythology without making any drastic changes.
While the first season was kind of a ""monster of the week"" routine with Clark battling a new Kryptonite spawned villian each week, Season two really hits it's stride.
A plot thread is begun exploring just who Clark is and why he is on the Earth...and it may not be very pleasant.  We see More development of Lex and Lionel Luthor as they battle over their company, the Kents, and Lex's soon-to-be wife.
Clark finds out about his father, Jor-El...and Jor-el wants Clark to do his bidding.
I won't go over all the episodes but hear are some of the season two highlights:
""Heat""  Clark discovers a new power...heat vision.
""Duplicity""  Clark's best friend, Pete, discovers Clarks Secret.  I still don't like that this happened myself.
""Red""  Clark gets his class ring only to find out it was made of red kryptonite.  Red Kryptonite effects Clarks mind.  Making him arrogant, rebellious, removing his inhibitions, and he abuses his powers.
""Suspect""  Lionel Luthor is shot at the beginning of the episode turning this one into an old fashioned ""who done it"".  Suspects abound including jonathan kent and Lex.
""skinwalker""  Clark discovers some ancient caves with drawings on the wall that reveal secrets about his origins.
""Rosetta""  Perhaps the most important episode of the season.  Clark discover the octagonal key to his ship also perfectly fits into a spot on those ancient cave walls.  When he inserts the key, he is grabbed by a high power.  Later, Clark goes to meet a myserious scientist played by Christopher Reeve.  He reveals to Clark that he picked up a strange transmission during the meteor storm that brought Clark to Earth...And He reveals Clarks real name..Kal-El.
""Exodus""  The season finale and cliffhanger.  Clark Destroys his ship but in doing so his parents are cought in the blast and martha loses the baby.  Distrought..Clark puts on his red Kryptonite ring and heads for Metropolis.
Meanwhile, Lex's new wife drugs him, and sends him off in an unmanned plane, straight to the ocean.
Season two really began developing the major characters especially Clark, Lex, and Lionel Luther.  The series gets stronger and stronger!",1079654400,84,2601,4.956120092378753

8013437,5,B0001JXPPC,"I've been taking a stroll down memory lane, feeling a bit nostalgic, and have been rewatching Smallville. Season 2 starts out with the conclusion to the season 1 cliffhanger. The tornado hits Lana, Jonathan Kent is missing, and Clark's secret is in danger. From there, the season covers a lot of ground. Clark gets his heat vision, finds red kryptonite, discovers the caves, and has to deal with an ultimatum from Jor-El. On a rewatch, I was kind of surprised at how much ground this season covered, and how well it did so. The season ends with one of its best season finale's (something I always felt the series did very well). Overall, this was well worth the rewatch. I'm on to season 3.",1507939200,2,690,4.57258064516129
