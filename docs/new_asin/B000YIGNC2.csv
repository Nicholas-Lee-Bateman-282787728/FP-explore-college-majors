3029277,5,B000YIGNC2,"As a fan of Ivonne Montero, I had to see this movie just for her. However, the entire cast played excellent parts, and the plot and story was great. Well worth the purchase price, this is one I will watch again and again.

My only complaint was with the DVD itself - though it says English subtitles, I could only get the CC1 English captions. Might have been my DVD player, but did not detract from the movie at all.",1204934400,,417,4.2125

3029284,5,B000YIGNC2,"This is a very entertaining, hilarious comedy heist movie.  It comes with the subtitles option, but I watched it without the english subtitles and could understand everything.  A++; grandes aplausos to the cast and production team.  Definitely a keeper for my movie collection.  Oh, and a word of warning, don't eat milk duds while watching it.  I actually was laughing so hard while watching that I about choked on one.",1201564800,2,420,4.942857142857143
3029285,5,B000YIGNC2,"What a great movie! I had no idea what I was going to see--what I got was a totally entertaining burglary caper with bite. Two charming thieves reunite to rob the richest thief of them all--does this remind you of certain movies with 11, 12 and 13 after the names? But the target here has violated the ""thieves code"" and made a fortune by preying on his own people, selling bogus weight loss, baldness and cancer cures via infomercials to Hispanics in the US. Rather than rely on technical wizardry and professionals, the perpetrators here round up a group of immigrants to pull off the heist, and the resulting fumbling and bumbling are hysterical. On a more serious note, along the way we get a glimpse of life as it really is for newly-arrived Hispanics in the US. I didn't know these actors at all, but I understand they're well-known in Latin America and I loved them--the performances were great and one of the two leads is absolutely gorgeous. The subtitles didn't bother my usually foreign-film-hating husband a bit. I can't recommend this film highly enough--it's light, entertaining fun that leaves you thinking but feeling good. What more can one ask?",1198540800,16,1162,4.786069651741293
3029306,1,B000YIGNC2,"This review is about the DVD, not the movie itself (which is a pretty fun flick, pretty much Ocean's Eleven).

I purchased this DVD in order to improve my Spanish. The description of the DVD states: ""Subtitles: English, Spanish"". I wanted to view it with Spanish subtitles, so I can both read the Spanish and hear it spoken in actual conversations.

However, the DVD does NOT have Spanish subtitles or Spanish captions. It's all in English, which makes it useless for my purpose.

Hence the 1 star.",1473552000,2,498,4.7011494252873565

It has a Latin cast of well known actors from Mexico and Colombia, its not your ideal heist movie but it does have some memorable characters that makes you keep wanting to see more. It has the Cuban actor that brings a comical release, it has a strong female that is more manly then most men in the movie and it has two master minds that keeps you guessing.

Como regla, no robamos a nuestra propria gente, pero este desgraciado lo merece. That line from Emilio in the film tells you all you need to know.  No gratuitous violence, no explicit sex and the language in Spanish is not too offensive.  Pendejo"" and cabron on are the strongest words I remember.  I haven't looked at the English sub-titles, but I would show this to a high school Spanish class.  The accents and slang from so many different countries is great.  I almost fell off the sofa laughing when the Cuban actor character started in rapid fire Cubano.  And when the tech expert character tells an English speaking security guard, Youre in America, learn Spanish was another great moment.  Great fun.",1413676800,,827,4.6875

The film I categorizes it as OK and that is all it is. I loved how the heist was planned with the uses of Immigrants, how they stole the money and got away with it. Also what they did with the money. I wish the same thing could be done to anyone that was screwed over by a big wealthy company. Maybe the tobacco company. OH! Or the NRA LOL!!!!!!",1389484800,,438,3.977272727272727

I think if you liked the newer *The Italian Job,* you will like this.  One caveat, if you are watching in Spanish with English subtitles:  A few of the subtitles are not PG 13--primarily in the first 20 minutes.  After that it's okay.  Some of that Spanish is not necessarily PG 13, either, but some of that depends on connotation and interpretation.  I did not listen to an English language track--I'm not sure if there is one.",1367193600,,557,4.565656565656566

3029442,3,B000YIGNC2,"Heist movies always have some redeemable qualities and for this one the plan to rip off a wealthy Argentinian infocommercial magante is ingenious. The problem is the movie is shot too much like a ""made-for-TV"" movie and seems to flat, lifeless and by the numbers. The acting is hokey at times and the characters seem like cartoon cutouts.

3029443,1,B000YIGNC2,"This must have been a break out vehicle for some soap stars or maybe the director's girlfriend, because there really cannot be another reason for this movie being made.  Awful.  A bunch of gorgeous ""regular people,"" like maids and plumbers who look like Salma Hayak and Brad Pitt, are going to rob a really bad dude.  The really bad dude is really bad because he steals from ... Hispanics!  But wait!  (plot spoiler alert) The bad guy swindler has a long-standing history with the leader of the Good Guy Robbers!  They were mentored by the same Master Thief but then the bad guy turned... BAD! He gave up ""The Code!""

I actually watched this to the end because it was so bad, I just had to keep watching (and there's almost never an actual movie on in Spanish).  This was seriously awful.  It had the ridiculously hot mechanic girl who never wore skirts (but when she did she looked like a movie star, duh), the silver haired bad guy with chiclet teeth and his 20 year old bimbo wife, the dramatic death of the mentor as he passes on his legacy, the hot nanny, the nerdy guy who has panic attacks.  Seriously all it was missing was ""a hooker with a heart of gold"" to be the biggest movie cliche.

I am really confused by all the good reviews.  Is the leader of the good guys Juanes, is that it? Ha.",1303171200,,1298,4.340248962655601

3029445,5,B000YIGNC2,"Appearing to be filmed in Calfiornia, this is a Spanish language film in American filmmaking style.  The 2007 film was directed by Joe Mendez who has done extensive episode TV work and producing.  It is very well done!  The story involves two thieves who partner with immigrants to take the money from an old partner, a millionaire Argentina infomercial Moctesuma Valdez, who has ripped of millions from unsuspecting Latinos.  With the Argentina banking system collapsed, the millionaire has all the money in a vault in the mansion.  It's akin to a robin hood story, but with thieves stealing from a thief.

The scheme is simple, but yet elaborate: hire immigrants, who are mainly invisible, non professional thieves, but skilled enough to do the job.  A phony workers' strike is set up, the immigrants will intermingle as scabs.

An elaborate Man of the Year Party at Valdez' mansion is the setting where things begin to fall into place cleverly, with humor, suspense, fun, action and skill.  The characters are vivid and memorable, acting is excellent, plot moves along at a fast pace, setting is beautiful.

I am not quick to refer to this as a ""foreign film"", but it is considered foreign language.  If you feel the characters are ""too beautiful"", you may be right, as most appear straight out of the novellas.  You will get the feeling too, that it is a novella.  But that is no different from American made films, the mainstream popular Brad Pitt type where everyone is beautiful.  In generality, most of the foreign films do not feature all of the most beautiful people.

Subtitles are good, easy to read.  This is fun... Rizzo",1270857600,,1634,4.823741007194244
3029466,4,B000YIGNC2,"This is a fast moving little story that really reminded me of Ocean's 11.  And I can tell from other reviewers that I'm not alone in this opinion. However, I might add, I am not a fan of the Ocean's 11 series, but I did enjoy this particular movie.

First, let me say I was surprised by this movie regarding it's location (set in L.A.) This was my husbands pick and I didn't bother myself to research what this gem of a movie was all about. I was expecting some foreign location: Spain, Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, etc... you get the idea. So, to see the Los Angeles downtown area as a backdrop caught me a little offguard, but it was a pleasant surprise. We of course used the English subtitles and I'm glad we did as I only understood maybe one out of every thirty words spoken!

This is quite a good looking cast of actors, nice on the eyes, and well cast in their respective roles. The story is simple: Two theives want to rob a big time infomercial thug who has made his fortune preying on the hopes of his own Latino people. This is a story with heart, however, the theives themselves have no compunctions about robbery, they always held fast to the theives code of not robbing their own but they feel they must betray this rule because the infomercial guru is picking on their own people.  This justifies their actions against him.

There are lots of little plot twists, and flashbacks for some backstory, typecast comedic roles and a love story all combined make this a worthy movie pick for Friday (or Sat. or any night you wish) movie night.",1270080000,,1552,4.431578947368421

3029468,4,B000YIGNC2,"I rented this movie from the local store and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it as a part of our 'arsenal' at school.  As a foreign language teacher, we use foreign films to capture not only the language but cultures of other countries by showing films to our students.  Sometimes we integrate them as a part of the curriculum, whilst other times we show them as an end of term treat. We find difficult to find Spanish-speaking films for those under the age of 15, but this was very good in capturing different Spanish-speaking dialects and aspects of pop culture.
This film is amazing and will be loved by all; I showed it to my grades 7 - 9 classses and they loved it!  I have them hooked on enjoying foreign films :)",1261958400,,724,4.3088235294117645

I can't tell you any more of the plot of this tightly scripted movie than that, lest I spoil your fun. Oh, I suppose I could mention that the good 'bad guys' triumph, though not as you might expect.

The most fun in this film is in the language, and I doubt I'd give it five stars if it were dubbed or if I needed English subtitles. I played the Spanish subtitles, for the benefit of my wife, and in the end I got benefitted also, since much of the dialogue is in dialects that even Spaniards couldn't follow. The heist team includes immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, Honduras, Argentina, and perhaps other south-of-the-border lands, and they all toss off jokes and oaths in their own style. One funny moment in the middle of the film - very low key, mind you - involves the slang for 'money' in several dialects - lana, cero, plata, efectivo. There are a lot of such throwaway bits, enough to spice up the ""Italian Job"" structure, the perfect crime.

And there's a heart-warming message for those of us who regard the current immigration from Latin America - both legal and illegal - as another honorable chapter in the American Dream story.",1216684800,41,1313,4.559322033898305
3029472,4,B000YIGNC2,"A reptilian infomercial mogul who extorts money from poor Latino immigrants with his fraudulent cures is targeted by a group of clever Robin Hoods. This crew banks on the fact that the men and women who clean your office and fill your water glass are virtually invisible and can slyly commit grand scale larceny.  The standard caper stereotypes are deployed, but a heist that succeeds by pickpocketing and valet parking switcheroos is massively more believable than one that depends on blacking out Las Vegas (as in Oceans 11). Telenovela hunk Fernando Colunga helped Ladrn reach as high as #16 in the US Box Office top 20. A popcorn movie with a populist slant, it's the rare non art-house Spanish language movie to hit the multi-plexes--for now.",1214697600,,747,4.928571428571429
3029473,5,B000YIGNC2,"What fun! This is one of those flicks you'll walk away from with a big grin on your mug. LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON (To Rob A Thief) is a 2007 indie, budgeted with not much money, and is in Spanish, but with English sub-titles. It stars a stellar cast of unknowns - unknowns, that is, if you only watch Hollywood pictures. Apparently, quite a few of these cats make their bones in Latin tele-novelas and most have never before done feature films. No worries, though; everyone holds their own. And the lead villain, Saul Lisazo, is outstanding!

So this is a heist film, and an excellent one. Character driven, even socially relevant, it's also pretty damn funny. LADRON... opens with a humorous sequence involving a television infomercial guru hawking his cheesy wares. LADRON...'s director is pretty much a newbie, yet, going by this gem of a sequence, you sense that you're in good hands. The plot centers on  two Latin thieves, Alejandro and Emilio, who come to Los Angeles to pull off a heist, their mark being another thief, who happens to be that very same infomercial guru, Moctesuma 'Mocte' Valdez.

Valdez's infomercials, needless to say, are straight out scams. A big reason for Valdez being targeted is that he callously preys on his trusting fellow Latinos, immigrants to America. This really bugs Alejandro and Emilio. Valdez's products don't work and only the most gullible or desperate would even consider them. He sells various hand creams which can either make you lose weight or enlarge your member; there's a magic bracelet which cures arthritis; and, most reprehensibly, there's Agua de Dios (Water of God), which Valdez claims can cure cancer. Alejandro and Emilio have decided: dude must fall.

Suckering the Latino community has made Valdez millions. He keeps his cash loot in a vault in his opulent mansion, and guarded by a state-of-the-art security system and a team of bodyguards. To pull off the heist, Alejandro and Emilio are forced to hire on a bunch of immigrants. Twist is, these immigrants aren't professional grifters. They're day laborers, who must now pick up the tricks of the con. Their lack of expertise in this department tends to aggravate Emilio, a pro's pro. But, even more importantly, it presents the audience with plenty of chances to laugh.

LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON is an independent venture, yeah, but it does flaunt a bit of a Hollywood feel. As such, this picture speaks to every audience, although it may speak just a tad louder to minorities. One theme presented is that minorities - in this instance, the Latino immigrants - are often rendered socially invisible. Because of their menial jobs (and, yup, their nationalities), they're able to access high-security venues, virtually unnoticed. The two rogues, Emilio and Alejandro, are actually counting on that. So, absolutely, the filmmakers manage to sneak in some social commentary. But they do it with humor, instead of a hammer. The end of the film is a particular middle finger to the Man (the Man, ironically, in this instance, being a Latino himself).

Like all noteworthy heist cinema, we're treated to a slew of nicely realized conventions in the genre. Again, budget considerations dictated that this film won't even come close to, say, the Ocean flicks in terms of glitz, complexity, or technical aspects. Still, what we get is more than adequate. The con is pretty straightforward, yeah, although there is one twist near the end which I didn't see coming. But there's enough audacity on display here, enough clever subterfuge, timely distractions, and reversals of fortunes.

I really think that LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON is a classic in the making. Yes, it's in Spanish and sub-titled. Trust me, you'll be speedily caught up in the story; before you know it, you'll forget you're reading sub-titles. There are some good laughs and there are big laughs. One instance is the intro of Primitivo, the inhouse accountant; that bit had me giggling like a Frenchman. The good guys are very likable and interesting, with my favorite being Miguelito, the Cuban thespian, and Rafaela, the tomboyish girl mechanic. Ivonne Montero is Rafaela, and, apparently, she's more well known for playing sophisticated, sensuous women. But these women can't possibly be as engaging as Rafaela.

For those who're into special features, the ones here are okay. Several deleted scenes; the inevitable ""Making Of"" segment; and an audio commentary (in English) by the film's director and by the writer. This commentary generally makes for an interesting listen except for when the director goes off on his self-absorbed ""trusting your director"" tangents. I think that may be the only negative I can come up with about this dvd.

Go see this one (Man, this review has a weak finish).",1213056000,11,4769,4.981155778894473

The Spanish is clear, and with the Spanish subtitles, my students thoroughly enjoyed it.  They said that it's the best Spanish language movie they have ever seen.  It's a movie that I will enjoy watching over and over, sort of the same type of thing as ""The Sting"" from the 60's or 70's.

What I enjoyed about the film is that is it exploits the prejudices about (hispanic) immigrants in a way that is not insulting but funny.  The other things about this movie is that is it another take on one thief scaming another thief theme.  Do not expect is to be as sophisticated as ""Ocean's 11"", but I promise the film will make you laugh.  My favorite actors are father/daughter duo.  Those wo actors just steal away the whole movie.

Two charming thieves reunite to rob the richest thief of them all--does this remind you of certain movies with 11, 12 and 13 after the names? But the target here has violated the ""thieves code"" and made a fortune by preying on his own people, selling bogus weight loss, baldness and cancer cures via infomercials to Hispanics in the US. Rather than rely on technical wizardry and professionals, the perpetrators here round up a group of immigrants to pull off the heist, and the resulting fumbling and bumbling are hysterical. On a more serious note, along the way we get a glimpse of life as it really is for newly-arrived Hispanics in the US. I didn't know these actors at all, but I understand they're well-known in Latin America and I loved them--the performances were great and one of the two leads is absolutely gorgeous. The subtitles didn't bother my usually foreign-film-hating husband a bit. I can't recommend this film highly enough--it's light, entertaining fun that leaves you thinking but feeling good.

I actually watched this to the end because it was so bad, I just had to keep watching (and there's almost never an actual movie on in Spanish).  This was seriously awful.  It had the ridiculously hot mechanic girl who never wore skirts (but when she did she looked like a movie star, duh), the silver haired bad guy with chiclet teeth and his 20 year old bimbo wife, the dramatic death of the mentor as he passes on his legacy, the hot nanny, the nerdy guy who has panic attacks.  Seriously all it was missing was ""a hooker with a heart of gold"" to be the biggest movie cliche.

3263942,5,B000YIGNC2,"Appearing to be filmed in Calfiornia, this is a Spanish language film in American filmmaking style.  The 2007 film was directed by Joe Mendez who has done extensive episode TV work and producing.  It is very well done!  The story involves two thieves who partner with immigrants to take the money from an old partner, a millionaire Argentina infomercial Moctesuma Valdez, who has ripped of millions from unsuspecting Latinos.  With the Argentina banking system collapsed, the millionaire has all the money in a vault in the mansion.  It's akin to a robin hood story, but with thieves stealing from a thief.

The scheme is simple, but yet elaborate: hire immigrants, who are mainly invisible, non professional thieves, but skilled enough to do the job.  A phony workers' strike is set up, the immigrants will intermingle as scabs.

An elaborate Man of the Year Party at Valdez' mansion is the setting where things begin to fall into place cleverly, with humor, suspense, fun, action and skill.  The characters are vivid and memorable, acting is excellent, plot moves along at a fast pace, setting is beautiful.

I am not quick to refer to this as a ""foreign film"", but it is considered foreign language.  If you feel the characters are ""too beautiful"", you may be right, as most appear straight out of the novellas.  You will get the feeling too, that it is a novella.  But that is no different from American made films, the mainstream popular Brad Pitt type where everyone is beautiful.  In generality, most of the foreign films do not feature all of the most beautiful people.

Subtitles are good, easy to read.  This is fun... Rizzo",1270857600,,1634,4.823741007194244
3263963,4,B000YIGNC2,"This is a fast moving little story that really reminded me of Ocean's 11.  And I can tell from other reviewers that I'm not alone in this opinion. However, I might add, I am not a fan of the Ocean's 11 series, but I did enjoy this particular movie.

First, let me say I was surprised by this movie regarding it's location (set in L.A.) This was my husbands pick and I didn't bother myself to research what this gem of a movie was all about. I was expecting some foreign location: Spain, Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, etc... you get the idea. So, to see the Los Angeles downtown area as a backdrop caught me a little offguard, but it was a pleasant surprise. We of course used the English subtitles and I'm glad we did as I only understood maybe one out of every thirty words spoken!

This is quite a good looking cast of actors, nice on the eyes, and well cast in their respective roles. The story is simple: Two theives want to rob a big time infomercial thug who has made his fortune preying on the hopes of his own Latino people. This is a story with heart, however, the theives themselves have no compunctions about robbery, they always held fast to the theives code of not robbing their own but they feel they must betray this rule because the infomercial guru is picking on their own people.  This justifies their actions against him.

There are lots of little plot twists, and flashbacks for some backstory, typecast comedic roles and a love story all combined make this a worthy movie pick for Friday (or Sat. or any night you wish) movie night.",1270080000,,1552,4.431578947368421

As a foreign language teacher, we use foreign films to capture not only the language but cultures of other countries by showing films to our students.  Sometimes we integrate them as a part of the curriculum, whilst other times we show them as an end of term treat. We find difficult to find Spanish-speaking films for those under the age of 15, but this was very good in capturing different Spanish-speaking dialects and aspects of pop culture.

3263968,5,B000YIGNC2,"The central premise of the elaborate heist that hold this film together is that, in Los Angeles, immigrants are as invisible to their employers as water is to fish. I can't tell you any more of the plot of this tightly scripted movie than that, lest I spoil your fun. Oh, I suppose I could mention that the good 'bad guys' triumph, though not as you might expect.

The most fun in this film is in the language, and I doubt I'd give it five stars if it were dubbed or if I needed English subtitles. I played the Spanish subtitles, for the benefit of my wife, and in the end I got benefitted also, since much of the dialogue is in dialects that even Spaniards couldn't follow. The heist team includes immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, Honduras, Argentina, and perhaps other south-of-the-border lands, and they all toss off jokes and oaths in their own style. One funny moment in the middle of the film - very low key, mind you - involves the slang for 'money' in several dialects - lana, cero, plata, efectivo. There are a lot of such throwaway bits, enough to spice up the ""Italian Job"" structure, the perfect crime.

And there's a heart-warming message for those of us who regard the current immigration from Latin America - both legal and illegal - as another honorable chapter in the American Dream story.",1216684800,41,1313,4.559322033898305

This crew banks on the fact that the men and women who clean your office and fill your water glass are virtually invisible and can slyly commit grand scale larceny.  The standard caper stereotypes are deployed, but a heist that succeeds by pickpocketing and valet parking switcheroos is massively more believable than one that depends on blacking out Las Vegas (as in Oceans 11). Telenovela hunk Fernando Colunga helped Ladrn reach as high as #16 in the US Box Office top 20. A popcorn movie with a populist slant, it's the rare non art-house Spanish language movie to hit the multi-plexes--for now.",1214697600,,747,4.928571428571429
3263970,5,B000YIGNC2,"What fun! This is one of those flicks you'll walk away from with a big grin on your mug. LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON (To Rob A Thief) is a 2007 indie, budgeted with not much money, and is in Spanish, but with English sub-titles. It stars a stellar cast of unknowns - unknowns, that is, if you only watch Hollywood pictures. Apparently, quite a few of these cats make their bones in Latin tele-novelas and most have never before done feature films. No worries, though; everyone holds their own. And the lead villain, Saul Lisazo, is outstanding!

So this is a heist film, and an excellent one. Character driven, even socially relevant, it's also pretty damn funny. LADRON... opens with a humorous sequence involving a television infomercial guru hawking his cheesy wares. LADRON...'s director is pretty much a newbie, yet, going by this gem of a sequence, you sense that you're in good hands. The plot centers on  two Latin thieves, Alejandro and Emilio, who come to Los Angeles to pull off a heist, their mark being another thief, who happens to be that very same infomercial guru, Moctesuma 'Mocte' Valdez.

Valdez's infomercials, needless to say, are straight out scams. A big reason for Valdez being targeted is that he callously preys on his trusting fellow Latinos, immigrants to America. This really bugs Alejandro and Emilio. Valdez's products don't work and only the most gullible or desperate would even consider them. He sells various hand creams which can either make you lose weight or enlarge your member; there's a magic bracelet which cures arthritis; and, most reprehensibly, there's Agua de Dios (Water of God), which Valdez claims can cure cancer. Alejandro and Emilio have decided: dude must fall.

Suckering the Latino community has made Valdez millions. He keeps his cash loot in a vault in his opulent mansion, and guarded by a state-of-the-art security system and a team of bodyguards. To pull off the heist, Alejandro and Emilio are forced to hire on a bunch of immigrants. Twist is, these immigrants aren't professional grifters. They're day laborers, who must now pick up the tricks of the con. Their lack of expertise in this department tends to aggravate Emilio, a pro's pro. But, even more importantly, it presents the audience with plenty of chances to laugh.

LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON is an independent venture, yeah, but it does flaunt a bit of a Hollywood feel. As such, this picture speaks to every audience, although it may speak just a tad louder to minorities. One theme presented is that minorities - in this instance, the Latino immigrants - are often rendered socially invisible. Because of their menial jobs (and, yup, their nationalities), they're able to access high-security venues, virtually unnoticed. The two rogues, Emilio and Alejandro, are actually counting on that. So, absolutely, the filmmakers manage to sneak in some social commentary. But they do it with humor, instead of a hammer. The end of the film is a particular middle finger to the Man (the Man, ironically, in this instance, being a Latino himself).

Like all noteworthy heist cinema, we're treated to a slew of nicely realized conventions in the genre. Again, budget considerations dictated that this film won't even come close to, say, the Ocean flicks in terms of glitz, complexity, or technical aspects. Still, what we get is more than adequate. The con is pretty straightforward, yeah, although there is one twist near the end which I didn't see coming. But there's enough audacity on display here, enough clever subterfuge, timely distractions, and reversals of fortunes.

I really think that LADRON QUE ROBA A LADRON is a classic in the making. Yes, it's in Spanish and sub-titled. Trust me, you'll be speedily caught up in the story; before you know it, you'll forget you're reading sub-titles. There are some good laughs and there are big laughs. One instance is the intro of Primitivo, the inhouse accountant; that bit had me giggling like a Frenchman. The good guys are very likable and interesting, with my favorite being Miguelito, the Cuban thespian, and Rafaela, the tomboyish girl mechanic. Ivonne Montero is Rafaela, and, apparently, she's more well known for playing sophisticated, sensuous women. But these women can't possibly be as engaging as Rafaela.

For those who're into special features, the ones here are okay. Several deleted scenes; the inevitable ""Making Of"" segment; and an audio commentary (in English) by the film's director and by the writer. This commentary generally makes for an interesting listen except for when the director goes off on his self-absorbed ""trusting your director"" tangents. I think that may be the only negative I can come up with about this dvd.

Go see this one (Man, this review has a weak finish).",1213056000,11,4769,4.981155778894473
