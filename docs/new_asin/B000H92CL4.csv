8169432,5,B000H92CL4,Out dated but still a QUALITY Dvd from In-Fisherman! To me THEY ARE THE EXPERTS in Fishing and being new to Ice Fishing this will help! Only problem I encountered is after a segments it skips to the individual chapters.which is strange but there is NO SKIPS in the DVD itself! Maybe it was recorded or transferred that way! but I bought it used for $2.00...........so what the heck!!!!!!!! One GREAT bargin!!!!! I recommend the DVD!,1477267200,,432,4.697368421052632

8169436,2,B000H92CL4,"Don't judge a book by its cover, nor a DVD.  I love the old In-Fisherman guys as much as the next guy, but all this dvd was good for was a walk down memory lane.  The footage was all over 20 years old and the sport has evolved so much since then.  The info provided is good for a first timer, but lacks any of the technological advances of the sport.",1294444800,2,350,3.9014084507042255
