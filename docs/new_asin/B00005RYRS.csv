7952872,4,B00005RYRS,"I thought they did a great job of laying on stereotypes of white trash. While stereotypes, this was not that far from people and places that actually exist in the US and that I have seen, embarrassing as that may be to the US. But it was a horror to see it all put together and to see this kid who had tried to make it in Hollywood and failed try to return to his rotten and emotionally dysfunctional roots. How creepy! No matter how awful it was, it was home and he hoped he could find himself again after failing to find his acting dream in LA.

People actually do things like that!! In this sense there is a deeper message in this film. It tells a truth, but it is a grim and tragic one. Sorry folks but a quote from Saint Bernard is running through my head -- the monk who leaves the monastery to return to his family is like a dog eating its vomit. Harsh! But life in the 12th century was harsh. Life in many places in the world is harsh and dysfunctional today like Dogtown, in one way or another, but many people are in any event nostalgic even for their harsh and emotionally dysfunctional roots. There is a strong tragic atmosphere hanging over the film.

I am not put off by comments that the setting does not look like the real Cuba, Missouri etc. Who cares? The situation is what was important.",1360540800,,1306,4.22
7952873,5,B00005RYRS,"This movie has been getting panned for it's location and racial slurs.  Let me, as I am from Missouri, tell you this movie, while filmed in California, does absolute justice to the backwoods and Ozark area of where this movie is based.  This is how people are there, folks.  While it doesn't always look like the Ozarks, the flat plains of rural country towards the end of the film are a good depiction.

This movie is a gem.  It's one of Trevor's most powerful performances and it showed without a shadow of a doubt that he was and still is a contender.  Even on screen with John Faveroue he still commanded the attention.  Mary Stuart Masterson turns in a helluva performances, as does Karen Black and the character of mentally challenged Sarah Rose was played by such a wonderful actress.  She was really something.

This movie is a must see.  It's a sad tale of lost dreams, hopes and time.  It's a strange place and yet, so real and so a matter of fact that it's hard to not feel sorry for everyone involved.

The hook of the film is Trevor, though.  His character, Philip, is such an endearing, very translatable, guy.  He loved a girl ""Mary Masterson"" in school, she never gave him the time of day.  Her boyfriend ""Faveroue"" is still her boyfriend to this day and both are waste heads.  Trevor St John comes back to town after his many failed auditions. They believe him to be a celebrity and he runs away with it, all in an attempt to finally win this One girl's attention.  After all these years.

The movie takes on a very real and very sorrow filled shape after you realize he's done some things he's not proud of and still failed.  In his own way he's as big of a failure as the very town he grew up in.  He can just hide it better.  But that's what I loved about it and him.  He let his guard down and the pay off is Trevor's best work.  He's such a gifted guy.  He's such a talent.  I really do feel he needs to branch out of Day Time TV and take Hollywood in his hands and crush it.  Because he has it.  He embodies emotion like few can.  He can say so little, yet read the entire book by his looks alone.

I cannot recommend this movie enough.  Get past the setting.  Get past the racial slurs.  Get past the assumptions that this is what Hollywood thinks of the midwest, because this is a very small film.  Almost unheard of.  Hollywood had little to do with it, trust me.  The mood in this movie makes you want it to end... Not because it's a bad movie, but because the town, the characters and the realizations of it all being so very real and so very sad makes you want to never see it again.  Just like Trevor St. John's character, Philip.

Watch this damn movie!!!!!!!!",1284854400,3,2691,4.278330019880715
7952874,3,B00005RYRS,"Dogtown is a tail of two cities, as befits a shaggy dog story. It is Small Town USA vs. Hollywood--except it is the IDEA of Hollywood they are fighting, while Philip Van Horn (Trevor St. John) has seen it up close and knows that it is a dirty little city. Though he went there and failed to become a big star with a star on Hollywood Boulevard and his footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theater, to the people who have never left Cuba (AKA Dogtown, a small southern town, not the country) he is seen as the guy who escaped, who got out of Dodge--I mean Dogtown--and returned a big star.

Nothing could be further from the truth, but whenever he tries to claim otherwise, they just won't listen. Bad teeth and bad luck have taken their toll on the townsfolk, especially Curtis Lasky (Rory Cochrane) and Ezra Good (Jon Favreau); and to them he might as well be a Hollywood Star. Ezra, or E.Z., ironically, is especially resentful when it comes to the affections of Dorothy Sternen (Mary Stuart Masterson). There is going to be a showdown between E.Z. and Philip, and it will not be pretty.

Rory and Jon really uglied up for this role. Hard to believe that Favreau was only a year out from making Swingers. He is tough, bitter, and not concerned with making the audience like his character. Rory's Curtis is broken and beaten down, but he still harbors dreams of a better life. You almost feel sorry for the two, Curtis more so than E.Z., stuck in a small Dogtown where dreams go to die.

Mary Stuart Masterson is a master of playing mentally damaged women, like Joon in Benny & Joon. Her portrayal of Dorothy Sternen in Dogtown was more successful than her turn as Joon because it had the gritty backdrop of reality while Benny & Joon wavered between tragedy and screwball comedy. Here any redemption she gathers is earned, the hard way, and the audience is not cheated with a fake Hollywood feel good happy sappy ending. Philip has carried a torch for her since they met in the first grade, but his idealized vision of her doesn't include the loneliness and suicidal depression that haunts her.

Contributing to the gloomy atmosphere is Rose Van Horn (Karen Black), Philip's mother, who has had a hard life, and seeks salvation singing with a rock band that practices in their living room early in the morning. She does some of her worst singing since Rayette Dipesto obsessed over Tammy Wynette's ""Stand by Your Man"" in Five Easy Pieces.

This was the final film of Harold Russell, who won 2 Oscars for his role in the 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives. While training paratroopers some TNT exploded and he lost both hands. He won the Oscars for best supporting actor and received an honorary Oscar for being an inspiration for disabled war veterans throughout the U.S. No other actor has ever earned two Oscars for the same role, or had such a non prolific career. He was in only 4 films in a career that spanned 50 years. He really stood out in Dogtown. He had a tremendous stage presence that was totally authentic. He seemed like a real person, not an actor, and brought a heightened sense of reality to the whole drama. Blessed William was a blessing on the whole Dogtown production.
