4162497,5,B003OT4HH6,This movie has all the actions and thrills needed for a fun evening of movie watching. I would certainly recommend this to others.,1354406400,,130,4.695652173913044
4162498,4,B003OT4HH6,"Four shows for $5, an excellent bargain...the movies are a little far-fetched, of course, but entertaining for the price~and Tom Berenger gets the series off to a good start!",1354233600,,174,5.0344827586206895
4162499,5,B003OT4HH6,"I purchased this video to replace a VHS of The Substitute. I was very pleased with this video. Some of these I didn't even know existed so they were a very pleasant surprise. I was very happy with the person I purchased it from, it arrived in excellent condition, very quickly, I would recommend him and be happy to do business with him again.",1353542400,,343,4.375
4162500,5,B003OT4HH6,"The product arrived in excellent condition even though it traveled a long way to europe, it was as good as new. The covers as well as the dvd's.
We already watched the movies and they run fine. I would buy from this seller again.",1319328000,,229,4.2272727272727275
4162501,5,B003OT4HH6,"The first 3 Movies in the collection are great, the 4th one is okay. Tom Berenger and Treat Williams both star very well, and all have good plots, and are action packed.",1315267200,4,169,4.3125
4162502,4,B003OT4HH6,I love the movies and I love the Substitute movies and this is such a good deal when they all come together.,1311984000,5,108,3.9545454545454546
4162503,4,B003OT4HH6,"I remember seeing the first Substitute movie years ago along with one of the sequels. Probably on HBO. A lot of action, fun, kick ass kind of movie. The DVD set doesn't come with any extras or anything, but it is nice having all of the series in one package.",1311724800,4,258,4.18
4162504,5,B003OT4HH6,"THE SUBSTITUTE is a classic action film w/ Tom Berenger as a mercenary / teacher who uncovers a drug conspiracy while trying to find out who assaulted his girlfriend. Luis Guzman, William Forsythe, Ernie Hudson, and Marc Anthony are among the cast of good guys and bad guys. In THE SUBSTITUTE 2: SCHOOL'S OUT, Treat Williams takes over as the mercenary / teacher who faces more ne'erdowells and thugs while attempting to solve his brother's murder. THE SUBSTITUTE 3: WINNER TAKES ALL has Williams and his cohorts (including Claudia Christian!) up against college football players on steroids, and the mafia! Finally, in THE SUBSTITUTE 4: FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION, Williams is undercover as a teacher in a military academy plagued by a white supremacist cult. While the first one is my favorite, I enjoy all of these movies. Yes, the plots are insanely far-fetched. Yes, the characters are ridiculously over-the-top. Still, I am entertained whenever I watch them, and actually like Berenger and Williams in their roles. If you like gun-play, explosions, karate, or outrageous story-lines, then this 4-pack is a gift from the action gods!...",1306540800,16,1139,5.096256684491979

4162525,4,B003OT4HH6,"The Substitute 4 film-pack contains one good feature and three so-so/mediocre features that would be classified as TV's B films. The Substitute (1996) starting Tom Berenger and Marc Anthony is the quintessential film from the pack.  It is as good as 187 (1997) and Dangerous Minds (1995)...yes the 90's was the decade when the movie industry was making lots of films on America's ""brightest"" kids if I may say so.",1456358400,,413,4.9

4162531,5,B003OT4HH6,Have always loved The substitute.  There was a boom of movies around the same time all about the condition of a number of schools in America.  Art imitates life to draw the worlds attention to the problem. Substitute was my favorite. Shooting up the school is much more fun than reading poetry.

4162557,5,B003OT4HH6,"There were a few ""glitches"" in two of the movies, but the movies themselves are still some of the best watching avaliable!  Tom Berenger only plays in the first one, though, then Treat Williams plays in the other 3, although he's a good actor, I believe that maybe Tom would have pulled off the character a little better!!!!  Love Tom Berenger!!!  Gotta' watch Last of the Dogmen!!!!",1379548800,3,383,4.686567164179104
4162558,5,B003OT4HH6,Excellent movies. The Substitute series never gets old. Justice is the name of the game and going undercover to get it is also key.,1377388800,,131,4.5
4162559,2,B003OT4HH6,"Four movies on 3 DVD's - so 1 and 3 are one disc and 2 and 4 are on separate disks. Why do I hate that? Well first it's a pain in the butt to try to read the fine etched text around the hole in the disk to figure out which side is which. Plus the sound on the ""double disk"" is totally screwed up - it's too quiet, then too loud (it's either a defective copy or something else is wrong. The other two disks are fine though.  I guess I'll just get another copy of 1 and 3 on two dvd's and have four movies on four disks.  One thing for sure, I won't be buying anymore double sided movies.",1377043200,,586,3.7560975609756095
4162560,5,B003OT4HH6,"""The Substitute"" has long been a favorite of mine.  I have always like Tom Berrenger.  I loved how he handed the miscreant's backsides to them.  Especially that scrawny character played by Marc Antony.

The other 3 Substitute movies were equally enjoyable.  Treat Williams did a fine job as well.  He is very low keyed, but nonetheless serious and deadly when it comes to the punks.

This 4 pack was an excellent buy.  Well worth the money.",1368144000,,440,4.697368421052632

4162564,5,B003OT4HH6,I just watch em all again and have to say that an ultimate Sub movie with Tom and Treat would have been epic. I am a big Treat Williams fan and the first one with Tom Berenger was actually pretty awesome as well.,1358726400,,212,3.953488372093023
