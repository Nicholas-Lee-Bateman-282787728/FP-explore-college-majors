2965841,5,B000WC39OU,"I had forgotten all about this show until a few years ago. I did a little searching online and this is honestly the ONLY thing I could find. It's only season 1 so you don't get too deep into the series itself, but it's a great show for kids or young adults, like myself, who want to remember a simpler time when Saturday morning cartoons were all that mattered. The show itself doesn't have the craziest plot or story line, but it's a solid program that also has some morals sprinkled in for the young kids. Compared to most the crap that passes off as kids shows these days(Besides Adventure Time, Regular Show, and Clone Wars) Medabots is a breathe of fresh air, and in all reality is pretty original especially for the time period it first came out. I would recommend this to anyone under the age of 25 that either A) Has kids or B) Enjoys anime style shows along the lines of Pokemon.",1353974400,,888,4.355421686746988
2965842,5,B000WC39OU,"I really really love Medabots very much, I use to watch this show all the time on TV when I was a child.
I loved seeing the battles the funny weird odd silly cute stuff happening in the show.
It is a really good cartoon for all age groups really. I feel bad that it did not go really big like other stuff.
But I am happy they made this cartoon a lot.",1343520000,,350,3.808219178082192

2965845,5,B000WC39OU,"Before when they aired this show on tv I normally avoided it, but now since I have gotten the dvd, I have grown to love it, there is humor in this show so that is always a plus for me.",1322006400,,184,3.625

2965847,5,B000WC39OU,"An amazing anime that often gets short-changed. Almost no-one has herd of it, but I loved every minute of it. The first season is one of great (although the second season is my favorite!) This show has a nice balance between comedy and action, which many shows have trouble nailing. This collection is missing one episode of the first season, but that is available if you truly need to have every one. Its a great gift for any kid if you give it a chance, and while it dose not contain the Japanese audio- it is not a big deal as this is one of the most accurately translated dubs I have ever seen. The show did not do well when aired because it was put out at the same time a pokemon, but when I saw the show- It had a lot more depth of character then the often shallow episodes of pokemon and while I gave up on pokemon a while a go- this still has a nostalgia factor even enticing to an adult. If you give it a chance- it may not be your favorite show as it was mine, but it is definitely worth the price for the classic episodes of this hard to find anime. You will be hard pressed to find a more interesting character then Metabee in a children's cartoon.",1220400000,14,1160,4.11453744493392

8222354,5,B000WC39OU,"I enjoyed the product. The episodes I purchased were the same as those I saw on tv.

I agree with D. Mapes (Doenaught) who posted on October 2 2009, where they wrote that the animation on the box and the startup menu was not from season 1 and a few episodes are missing, which also suggests that this is a pirate copy.

But I still believe the actual episodes are still good.
If you are a completionist and you want every single episode of season 1 with the correct animation and box set, then this is not for you, but if you only want to enjoy the anime and like me you use to watch this in your local morning cartoon show and loved it, then this is still good.

Overall I enjoyed the product.",1385683200,,694,4.125925925925926
