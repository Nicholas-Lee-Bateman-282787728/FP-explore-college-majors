945965,4,6304968892,"This episode is by far one of my favorites in the series. Although after seeing this one you'll never want to see the last twelve again!!
Because.. oh, i won't spoil your fun. This episode drills right  into the minds of the EVA pilots. The human instrumentality program.  (mentioned in 0:8)its full of surreal images and thoughts and even an  alternate reality.
It reminds me of an old SNES game called terranigma.  The plot is so twisted doctors are going to write philosophy books on it!  (check them out in amazon.com)",922665600,,522,4.6923076923076925
945966,5,6304968892,"Now, a lot of fans were very unhappy with these two episodes as originally aired.  I agree, the movies do answer many more of the questions posed in the series.
However, the events in this tape complement the other ending,  making Shinji's eventual actions somewhat more understandable, and adding a  new dimension to the character development of the movie.
The director,  Anno, had the philosophies of this tape in mind as the culmination, the  ultimate aim of Evangelion.  He was forced by his budget to be more blatant  about the meaning than he intended, but it does not diminish the impact of  this very strange, yet moving tape.",920937600,,634,4.805555555555555
945967,5,6304968892,"the interesting thing about this last episode is that it is nothing like the other episodes and could conceivably be done without.  it is a very densely packed episode featuring deeply philosiphical ideas of ""the  self"" and neediness and lonliness.  quite intriguing, indeed.  may be  too much for the average animae fan, but can be quite thought provoking and  rewarding if taken with an open mind.  it's definitely the most rewarding  and interesting animae i've ever seen.",911692800,,475,5.077922077922078
946026,5,6304968892,"Honestly, there really is no better way to end it all. If you don't understand what I mean, then you should probably watch this tape of the last two episodes, for they really provide an excellent closure of the series. I do not want to spoil the experience, so I will not reveal what goes on except this: They do not have any action whatsoever. Instead Hideaki Anno is attempting to tell the audience a message and what he says in it is still being debated by many, many fans.
Despite what you may have heard however, these episodes are not an alternate from the movie. Gainax and Hideaki Anno have never released any statement (to my knowledge) to that effect. Instead they are compliments to eachother, with the episodes taking place at a crucial point in the movie.
Bear in mind that you need several viewings of this video to truly be able to think about it, for it disturbs, depresses, enlightens and uplifts (and in that order too, if memory serves me well).
Please toss out all stereotypes, previous concepts of the world, thoughts about you lifes problems and pretty much everything you can think of. Then pop this tape in and watch the magic of one individuals mind at work.",981417600,,1183,4.55868544600939
946027,5,6304968892,"After all that confusion with Second Impact, the last angel, the EVAs, Adam, etc., we finally get those question answered (well, most of them anyway). This is a very emotional packed video that takes you on a wild ride about learning life. Every bit of emotional problems that Shinji, Auska, Rei and Misato had are explored through brilliant artwork. Truley this is the best of the best. If you have to buy one Evangelion tape, make it this one. There is tons of art styles and emotion flowing throughout the tape that by the time your done watching it, your mind will be warped. Honest.",981072000,,587,4.6
946028,5,6304968892,"For someone looking for action, this tape doesn't have much action in it. It dives into how the characters define themselves. This tape was even more incredible because of a self-awareness seminar I had gone to a few months before viewing this tape. These episodes were almost like a condensed version of that seminar. It was so incredible to see the same ideas being presented in an original manner.
Here you have Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Misato discussing why they do their jobs as an unseen interviewer tries to get them to dig deep into themselves to find the answers. The questions are printed on-screen during the process so you only hear the voices of the characters. The final episode focuses on Shinji.
Some people have commented on the fact that everything doesn't get answered. Often life is better when you don't have answers just handed to you. To me, the series wants us to explore who we are.
As for the movies, I have not seen them, but I do know one of them simply uses scenes from the series. It's End of Evangelion that MIGHT answer some questions. I believe Manga has the video rights to that movie, and they are supposed to be using the same voice actors for the dubbing. We'll have to wait a bit longer to see if there are more answers.",978739200,3,1257,4.517543859649122
946029,5,6304968892,"This movie is basically what shinji had to deal with through the whole series. However this wasn't the best way to end this great series. This two episode tape dives into humanity and can make you realize that your life can have no meaning or does. Ive watched it twice now, and im starting to understand why they said what was said in the tape. I recommend this for people who want to think. There is barely any action to this tape, just psychological.",973987200,,453,4.404761904761905
946030,5,6304968892,This is amazing. It is so cool the way in which it deals with everyones feelings and you see into their soul. It is good to see a ending with no fighting. If you want action look to Genesis 11 and 12 but this is still very cool.,972000000,,228,3.7708333333333335
946031,5,6304968892,"Let's make this simple.  There are two endings.  Yeah, as in more than one.  However, instead of rambling on about how one is better than the other, I'll simply state that the endings come in different flavors.  The first (part of the series) contained  little action.  However, it is also the deepest episode yet.  It consists of Shinji coming to terms with himself and deciding that the only way to be of value is to make himself valuable (generally good advice).  It is a good conclusion, despite the critics. It is well worth buying.  The second ending (the movie - unreleased in the US), was created after so many fans complained about the first.  Hideaki Anno decided to give the fans what they wanted, and the end result is the most disturbing film I have seen.  In summary, it is a spit to the eye of anime. It has it's merits though.  It contains the greatest battle seen (mech style), enough blood to fill donations for the next ten years, and (spoilier) the end of the world as we know it (pun intended). The only reason this film was created was to tell the fans that they should be careful about what they wish for and to move on.  This also is very good advice.  For all those who claim it to be a ""revelation in to the human soul"" have gone a bit to far.  It is a show.  A very good show, but still a show.  So please stop complaining, writing reviews (don't I feel ashamed...) and move on.",969580800,4,1405,4.32183908045977
946032,4,6304968892,"What an amazing series Evangelion is, sad to say it ends without answering a lot of the questions I still had. A lot of reviewers got nightmares from  watching this clash of images and death and chaos... so did I. I had to  watch these 2 episodes about 5 or 6 times before I got what was going on.  Let me see if I can summarize:
About 12 Angels (though techincally only  one) come down to attack the Earth again, meanwhile NERV is under attack by  the Seele group which Shinji's father is actually in league with so they  can do the Third Impact. Since humans haven't killed humans in a long time  apparently, NERV forces falls easily except the command center. Misato gets  Asuka into her EVA (even though she is unconscious) and sends her out into  a lake to protect her... Misato then goes to rescuse Shinji, who is moping  around wanting to die.
Meanwhile, Ikari is at the bottom of NERV with Rei  preparing to merge her with the 1st Angel that they have kept hidden, Adam.  Misato finds Shinji and starts to take him to his EVA. She manages to get  him there but is killed in the process. Asuka wakes up in her EVA and  proceeds to attack the Seele forces and the 12 Angels around there. Asuka  power supply gets cut off but she manages to kill each of the 12 Angels  except for one and when she is going to deliver the final blow, a spear  shoots right through her EVA. The 12 Angels, who we thought were dead, wake  up and proceed to destroy EVA-02.
Meanwhile, Shinji is still wanting to  die, but his EVA-01 now has a soul of it's own and picks up Shinji and puts  him in the cockpit and leaves NERV. The 12 Angels and EVA-01 then proceed  to create an Anti-AT Field. Rei merges with Adam and decides to help Shinji  instead of Shiniji's father. After a lot of weird stuff everyone on the  Earth is killed and transformed into one soul, Rei also merges with EVA-01  and completes the Third Impact.
Shinji then learns some things about Rei,  Asuka, and Misato that he didn't know and that he is not the center of the  world, but Rei allows him to decided how to reshape the new world. All  Shinji wants is to be happy but doesn't know what it is. He discovers that  happyness for him is actually being with Asuka, even though she loaths him  and she always makes him miserable, but for his happyness he wants to be  with her for the rest of his life.
Then the movie ends. A lot of this  doesn't make much sense, but I think that the director left it open to your  own interpretation. Of course you want to see the end of this great series,  but this ending leaves you feeling empty and confused, I know I was.",965347200,,2617,4.254065040650406
946033,5,6304968892,"This is an emotionally touching ending to what I feel is the greatest anime ever. It's basically an insight into Shinji who desperately tries to find value in his existence. Not what most fans expected, but it works for  me, probably because I can relate. ;)
On a side note, the movie isn't all  that different--it still comes down to Shinji's mind.",962755200,,349,4.612903225806452
946074,5,6304968892,"Many people have admitted confusion over this, the final volume in the Evangelion series (but not the final chapter). The fact of the matter is, Hideaki Anno admitted to having problems he was working through while  making this series. My advice to you: pick up this strong psychological  finale and just enjoy the visuals if you don't get the psychotics. Then go  find a friend with bootlegs of the movies, because I promise you will  understand nothing and be completely blown away by these episodes.  (Unfortunately, the movies don't help much.) Just sit back and enjoy the  ride.",962236800,,583,4.8979591836734695
946075,2,6304968892,"The night after I watched this I had bizarre nightmares about having my brain melted, and I think this might be why.  It's a really disappointing ending to an otherwise amasing series--fortunately all is not lost, because  the creators knew that, and went on to make 'The End of Evangelion' movie,  which sums everything up and finishes off the series for us. :)",959040000,,362,4.714285714285714
946076,1,6304968892,"Ok,the series was great no doubt about that but this video...well lets just say it wasent entertaining at all..They could have made it much better but all it seemed to be was Shinji in a chair lots of flashbacks and  talking. Its not really the end..and it makes you want to see more but this  was such a disapointment to me..I returned it back to the store. Itll be  good to see just for the sake of seeing it but not worth $30!Sorry but the  onley reason this got a star is becuase it was the subtitled Japanese  verion and the last 5 mins was cool. Well thats all I have to say..sorry....  (It also make you wonder if the creator had any mentle problems)",956966400,,657,4.216
946077,4,6304968892,"One fact that's not too well known and I'd like to add: everyone thinks the last tape is all about Shinji. however, the truth is, it's all really about Hideakki Anno. The last two episodes of EVA are about how Shinji  thinks that everyone hates him. But everytime shinji says ""I""  imagine he's saying Hideakki Anno or Studio Gainax, and everytime he talks  about the other people hating him, imagine him saying the other anime  studios or the audiences. Studio Gainax was making radical new anime that  was freaking out the traditional audiences. And then good old Anno was  almost as screwed up as Shinji was. For four years before EVA came out,  Anno was a broken man, incapable of doing anything, because he realized  that if he stopped making anime, he'd have nothing left. Shinji says that  he feels like when he pilots EVA, others like him and his existence is  meaningful: this is a way for anno to talk about how he feels about himself  making anime. Watching EVA doesn't as much show you a cool series as  letting you see Hideakki Anno's soul nearly firshand.",955843200,6,1068,4.622340425531915
946078,5,6304968892,"It's really sad that this series is coming to an end. This video leaves you with more questions than answers. Although it is beautifully animated, with a wonderful plot. It makes you think about what the true meaning of  humanity is, and is the world really coming to an end? If you have a weak  heart don't watch this. But if your a true fan of the series and love to  watch asuka, rei,toji,misato,ikarki, and shinji then by all means buy  it!...",954547200,,447,4.414634146341464
946079,5,6304968892,"This video is what the Evangelion Series is all about.  To be sure its definetly not what you would expect after the 1st 24 episodes but it was still a great ending.  For those of you who enjoyed the series for its deep  psychological side, you'll love it.  If not then you should still see it  but the action/violence ending will be in the movie coming out this fall.  This movie expressed Anno's(the director) true vision of Eva.  It was never  about the Eva's but  about Shinji's growth into self-confidence.  There's  nothing else that can be said.",954028800,2,552,4.587628865979381
946080,5,6304968892,This entire series is absolutely amazing and i recomend that any anime fan watch this.

946081,5,6304968892,"I wish I could give this tape more stars than five. The last two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, while they do not contain as much action as the rest of the series, do in fact resolve most of the loose ends, and  everything that really matters is resolved. One warning. Episode 25 is  sheer torture to watch, in many ways. Be prepared for one of the most  depressing anime episodes ever made, and probably the single most  depressing. And make sure you have time to watch the last one. Episode 26  provides the emotional redemption the series required. The events which  take place in the mind of Shinji Ikari give closure, as well as being  incredibly moving. If this tape does not bring you close to tears, you've  probably missed the point. While the action stops after tape 12, the series  has an ending which resolves the emotional content, which is the point  Hideaki Anno is trying to make. This is why the movie, End of Evangelion,  complements episodes 25 and 26, rather than replacing them. A brilliant  conclusion to the greatest anime series ever made. Thank you, Mr. Anno, for  this ending.",952732800,12,1108,4.649484536082475
946082,5,6304968892,AMAZING! I  have been a fan of the series from the beginning and this was the perfect ending! A word of caution though this video is not for people who do not like to think deeply. It is years worth of philsophy crammed  into one hour and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE! Great animation and the shear ideas  of it will keep you glued to the screen and keep you thinking for many days  after it. But what happes in it? Well it is beyond words. If you have seen  the whole series up to this point then it takes what you think you know and  smashes it on the floor. If you have never seen it before. Then you will  feel like you have just had a brick hit over your head by a person  screaming. IT'S A BLAST!,951609600,2,694,3.9424460431654675
946083,2,6304968892,"I honestly don't think the episodes should all be rated individually but I do think that this final episode (or at least the last of the ADV published NGE videos) was terrible! It was probably the worst conclusion to a great  anime series that I could have expected. What you see on the cover of the  box is about all there is to it inside. Basically the main characters are  interviewed and they see what ""could"" have happened as an ending.  It was full of ""Everybody hates me!"" being every other sentence  out of the character's mouths... and compared to the rest of the series  this was just a very poor episode. No real action or even continuation of  the story, if Genesis 13 was never published, nobody would even miss  it.
I'm eagerly awaiting more from Manga Entertainment which is the  publisher behind the upcoming Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Movie...",951264000,2,862,4.655629139072848
946124,5,6304968892,"Let me just say that I don't think viewers should be evaluating episodes 25 & 26 and 25' & 26' (End of Evangelion) independently.  They're linked-- neither gives you the complete picture.  End concludes and answers  questions about the  bigger picture (about what happens to the world), but  25 & 26 conclude the micro, the resolution of many of Shinji's  psychological troubles.  25 and 26 give significance to the events of 25'  and 26', but without watching (and understanding) 25' and 26', you probably  won't understand what makes 25 & 26 significant.
In short, if you're  going to watch 25 & 26, watch End-- and vice versa.  They are not  alternatives, but are synergistically complementary (if that makes any  sense).",950313600,2,724,4.933333333333334
946125,5,6304968892,"I have to say that the final 2 episodes to the Eva series could not have been better!  It was a very refreshing to see a series that focused more on the characters, than on the political intrigue, or how the robots win,  etc...  In Eva, in the end, these things didn't matter.  All that matters  is how the characters come to terms with the struggles in their lives.
I  have seen the movies that were shown in Japan, and in my opinion, they were  simply made to pacify the mecha fans out there.  Please take my advice,  don't see them.  They seem to take what the intrigue/ violence/ mecha  freaks want, and shove it down their throats.  In short, the series ending  is the only ending for me!",949536000,,693,4.27906976744186
946126,5,6304968892,"This tape was a great big huge let down. I was diapointed that there was no real ending. I was following this series like it was a religion. But then again I love this series because it was different. We were all given  and ending that we didn't expect nor did we wish to have. All the anime  fans expected the ending to be hand fed to them. The ending didn't awnser  anyone's questions but it did give everyone a little insight to what the  characters thought and how they are motivated.  So i have watched this tape  over and over until I got its message. The ending is all in your mind, make  up your own ending or wait until the movies come over to america.

I wholeheartedly prefer the movie version of the ending to these two episodes. While I am glad I was able to glean some valuable insight from the psychological outpouring of this tape, I watch anime first and foremost to be entertained. I did not find this tape to be entertaining per se. I watched it with a sense of solemn duty. It's painfully didactic. It's not impossible to be both enlightening -and- entertaining. I am suspect of any who would claim that they found these episodes to be literally ""entertaining"". (Well, except for one short hilarious sequence which I won't spoil.) EoE maybe be every bit as confusing, perhaps more so, but I personally found it to be infinitely more enjoyable to watch... although it ranks much higher than the series ending in my ""Most Depressing Top 10"" list. :)

Be it known that the writer/director of the EVA series, Anno Hidekai, is an extremely troubled man.

EDITED July 16, 2001:

According to ""The Red Cross Book"" (which was sold at End Of Evangelion screenings during its original theatrical release in Japan in 1997 and was officially endorsed by GAINAX,) the original scripts for the final two episodes of the series were scrapped. The reasons are not made clear, but there are rumors that sponsor funding was cut due to controversy about the content, and that Hideaki and GAINAX were pressured to end the series differently, in a very short time frame. The result is the two episodes on the this tape. The book then goes on to say that the original scrapped scripts were essentially fished out of the trash and became the basis for the feature film End of Evangelion. In other words, it's arguable that the final two episodes of the TV series are invalid, and that EoE is in fact the true ending to the story.",946771200,2,1962,4.648414985590778
946131,5,6304968892,"Episodes 25 and 26 are the heart and soul of Evangelion. In the last episode we see the minds of all the characters COMPLETELY.

Evangelion is NOT complete without watching the movie. In my opinion the tow finall are  not different, but are parallel situations of the same reality, of the same  end. The end of the series focus more in the psycological aspect of Sinji,  with a bit of philosophical speculation. And in that sense the ending in  bright. The 2 last chapters offer a very detailed analisis of characters  specially sinji, made via a very well done introspection. Of course it  leave many misteries unanswred but that is why the movie exists. And as a  very pessimist personn, this the only optimistic kind of endings i accept.

946133,5,6304968892,"This is probably my favorite Evangelion episode (I have all 13 tapes).  I don't veiw this finale as a dissapointment; it focuses more on the mental/philisophical aspect of the series than the physical.  The tape  presents what happens to Ikari Shinji and result of the mental changes that  he endures throughout the series, and also leaves the viewer with many  insights to the human mind.  This tape will cause you to think quite bit,  and is really not for the people who don't ""get"" the more  philisophical and spiritual side of Evangelion.",945820800,2,543,4.826086956521739

So beautiful and original!), intricate plot, and  realistic characters! This spans Genesis 0-13, so it's more of an overview  if anything else. However, if u have not seen the separate VHS tapes for  each Genesis, or read the manga, then it's kind of easy to get lost in the  plot. So take it from the beginning and watch and rewatch -- the story is  amazing when U understand everything. It's sci-fi, fantasy, mecha, and  takes awhile to understand the leaning-towards-spiritual plot. But it's  worth it and it IS RATED NR due to mature situations! 5+ stars for this  video, but 10 for Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's mangas and the original TV-aired  episodes.

I saw this version of the  ending, as well as the one called ""Rebirth"" (where Shinji spends  most of his time screaming-- yes, screaming).  Genesis 0:13 doesn't explain  certain images-- like Katsugari's  and Ritsuko's corpses (you'll see that  in ""Rebirth""). The Instrumentality Project sounds like pure BS.  It merely accomplished what you'd hire a shrink for, so I was left  wondering why they had to employ the Eva for it.  Also you'll still be  wondering how the ""Second Impact"" came about, where Yui Ikari is,  what the point of SEELE was and what the Eva was really built for.",942796800,4,846,4.698630136986301

946187,3,6304968892,"After creating so many beautiful situations and so much heart-wrenching drama in the past 20-some episodes, Gainax dropped its trousers and urinated all over me in the last few volumes of Eva. I KNOW it's not the  true end to the story, which is dandy, but as a de facto conclusion to the  characters and events of the series, it's tremendously disappointing. I had  always thought that Eva had many things in common with the writings of  sci-fi mastermind Robert Heinlein, and 0:13 reinforces this as Shinji  finally leaves his troubled childhood and accepts his worth as a man. But  that's the only redeeming feature of the end of the Eva series as we  Americans get to see it. The alternate reality that Shinji summons in the  ending minutes borders on endearing (especially with Megumi Hayashbiyara's  Rei suddenly becoming a frantic, clumsy schoolgirl), but in the end is only  a detour.
The ending episodes weigh heavily in Cartesian and Spinozistic  philosophy, but who the hell wants to see an animated series based on the  works of Spinoza? I would have rather had a few questions answered,  particularly as to the true motivations of Gendo Ikari (is he utilitarian  or just an obsessive genius who killed his wife?), the bastardized lineage  of the Angels, what the full potential of the Evas was, and the reality of  Rei. Oh, and the character that is probably squandered the most in the  endgame is Asuka, who had the determination to overcome the destruction  inflicted by the Angels and her own past, but instead is turned into  another manic-depressive basket case like Shinji. That's not fate. That's  bad storytelling. Shinji provides enough think-skulled mopery for Eva and  three other series like it. In the end, he beats his demons - but we have  to wonder about everyone else.
Neon Genesis Evangelion was a brilliant  series, but it was brilliant not because of the copious theological and  scientific material, but because of the human element that made all the  characters close to us. For whatever reason, that human element is largely  lost toward the end - and Eva suffers big time. It's like having a  wonderful four course meal and then having it all ruined by a nasty piece  of Brie cheese at the end. Like that repulsive fromage, the end of the Eva  TV series is interesting, but it tastes awful and most definitely leaves  something to be desired. Sorry Eva fans, but this is a real letdown. I  expect the recut ending and movies to be as spectacular as everyone says  they heard they were. Let's bring them over here posthaste, so we can have  a real eclair-like ending, all right?",932515200,9,2614,4.776286353467562
7880282,5,6304968892,"This review is not just to do with the video, but it is doing with the whole series. this series may simply rated NR by Amazon, but this series is much involved to a 18+ rating. Strictly for the fact it was so violent it was nearly taken off the air in Japan. (Pretty violent eh?) This series was drawn byu a man who was insane (Seriousely!) This show is not for those who do not beleive that we are all a dream (IMO). This show deals with suicide, insanity, and many other things that you'll need to find for yourself. The show is about 3 choosen children that pilot this suits called Eva's. These suits are almost real, all they need is a soul to pilot them. There were 26 episodes counting Death and Rebirth which were kind of like OAV I guess. To learn more you'll have to watch the show..Bye",1005609600,,796,4.209150326797386
7880283,5,6304968892,"As one of the guys who wrote a review said: The most depressing anime. That is complitely true. The last two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion are the most depressing, sad, and mental illness (Im not sure if this word is the right one) that exist. Episode 25 was a heavy beat that I reseived one night. The next night while watching episode  26, it left me a taste of crying, it made my mind just.....fall. And from what Ive heard, that the two Evangelion movies are closely to the last wo episodes, just makes me wounder: am I going to get on after watching these movies?",1005609600,,574,4.364485981308412

Li os resumos na web dos vdeos e so um excelente complemento para a srie, q poderia se estender por muitos mais episdios. Esses filmes so para serem vistos e analisados, levam a uma reflexo profunda sobre a existncia humana, e mesmo lembra o apotetico Akira.

7880288,2,6304968892,"Evangelion is remarkable series: The characters are complex, the interpersonal politics are quite overt, the action scenes filled with lots of tension and emotion, the plots are many and are refreshingly complex.  It truly is worth owning this whole series.
Evangelion 0:13 is a departure from most of the above.  the director primarily tries to move the viewer into the dark parts of the Evangelion characters' mind by using surreal settings, storyboard sketches, and photographicc images as metaphores to represent the dialog. Unfortunately it falls short.  What may work well for poetry fails when applied to anime.
Evangelion 0:13 lacks in episodic delivery as well.  It is more stream of consciousness then story. You do see how these characters think and feel, but I would have rather discovered these traits through unusual situations and the craft of animation itself rather than dialog. I also wish a few loose ends would have been clarified.
Now, what makes this video so enigmatic, is that this is one of the videos in the series that I replay the most.  The last 6 minutes contain some powerful, psychological content and it connects with me. Though I like the last six minutes, that is not enough to give a five star rating.
This final episode did not maintain the animation or plot development that was delivered in the 12 previous titles.  Though it does get high marks from me in psychological content.  Perhaps you should rent or borrow before deciding to purchase.

Not since the Patlabor movies have I truly though about the ideas that an Anime director was trying to get across, but with these last two episodes, I find myself doing nothing except thiking. These episodes made me think about my own exsistence. Am I any better than Shinji, Rei, Asuka, or Misato. If you look deep enough into Evangelion you will see your life. Overall, probably the greatest ending to the greatest anime series of all time.
P.S.  for those that just finished this series you should go out and get either Cowboy Bebop or Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.",988502400,,745,4.398550724637682
7880290,5,6304968892,"These two episode are the soul most debated in anime history. They are something you love or hate - and you don't change your mind by watching them again.... or again, again, again, again, and again a lot more times in my cases. These episode have got to be the most depressing and powerful you'll see. Althou the ending does not provide a closing, that is because three movies were made. Death, Rebirth, and My Purest Heart for You. (commonly called ""The end of Evangelion"" by US fans) These episode spark the questions ""What are we? Why does everyone hurt? Why are we alive? What happens when we die? WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE ME?"" And a lot more. I can't picture a better ending for the TV series, but you really need to get a hold of the movies to appreciate Eva as a whole. Eva cannot be missed by anyone, and unfortually, a lot of people are missing it. Show Eva to everyone you know - even if they hate anime. Make them watch it. Everyone deserves to see this series! These episodes are basically interviews of the characters are presented in Shinji's versian of reality after 3rd Impact. Prepare to be teary eyed, by to smile at the end. And we all get a chance to hear Rei scream something in episode 26. :) See the ""order"" button? Click it!",984009600,,1247,4.379310344827586
