8447901,5,B004Y209LU,"M is a 1931 classic German film.  The drama-thriller is directed by Fritz Lang and is considered by many to be his finest work.  The plot of the story involves the hunt for a child murderer, not just by the authorities, but by local organized crime rings themselves.  There are a few aspects that made the film stand out for me.  First, although this is a classic of the 1930's, the storyline is one that is timeless and wouldn't surprise me at all to see in a current day blockbuster.  Also, I found myself torn by the race to catch the killer.  Should he be tried justly in a court of law?  Or should his heinous acts be dealt with by the criminal world themselves?  Finally, the perspective of the victims' mothers almost serve as a lesson to parents to keep a closer eye on their children and not take anything for granted.  This is definitely a quality classic that I would recommend!",1311292800,,889,4.404907975460123
