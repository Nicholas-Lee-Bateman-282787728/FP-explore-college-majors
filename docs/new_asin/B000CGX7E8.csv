8098943,3,B000CGX7E8,"The Film's Production Values And Script Are Somewhat Below Average.
This is the second work of a projected series featuring Lane Chandler.  Its direction and script are from J.P. McGowan, who also plays as a sheriff who leads a posse in search of Tex Broderick (Chandler), a wrongly accused man, as well as a rival for Broderick's girl friend.  This lady is billed as Janet Morgan, but in reality is erstwhile silent film star Blanche Mahaffey, making a comeback in sound pictures.  Although Broderick is not guilty of any of the crimes for which he is accused, in fact is believed to be a much sought-after masked bandit,  his ongoing persona as a robber, wanted for cattle rustling (from his own herd!) is not enough to avoid a discontinuance of what proved to be a lacklustre film series, the first of which entitled THE LONE BANDIT, was also helmed by McGowan.  Morgan, owner of a general store, gives shelter there to Broderick, wherein the latter is abie to hide from the obstinate sheriff and his posse.  She also gives sanctuary to an old gold prospector, performed by mushmouthed George ""Gabby"" Hayes, false teeth and all.  Erstwhile Silent Era Wampas baby star Mahaffey is easily the most skilled player in evidence and her scenes stand out.  There is  a prevalence of stock shots for what is one of the least successful Alpha Video releases, one wherein are featured undue repetition of scenes.  However, there is as well a solid performance from director McGowan, whose great populariy in his native Australia has remained great for years.  During  the late  1930s, Paramount Studios matched Chandler against another young Paramout contract player, Gary Cooper, and the latter was the Studio selection for further development.  However, if luck had favoured Lane Chandler, who had good looks, and adequate charisma, as can be seen in this film,  the latter may well have received Paramount's star treatment.  Although flatly handled,  the film is mildly interesting, a good deal of its appeal being to hard-core devotees of the Western genre, as well as for a large contingent of J.P. McGowan fans who will possibly enjoy his performance as a redoubtable sheriff attempting to corral Broderick.",1437782400,,2206,4.967302452316076
