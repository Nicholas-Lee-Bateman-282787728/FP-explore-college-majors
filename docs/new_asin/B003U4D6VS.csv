8405615,5,B003U4D6VS,The KOREAN WAR tapes  are part of my husbands past. He served in that war and  saw part  of thee tapes on the history channel. We lost power and never saw the rest. The tv never  replayed it and i have been looking for  it ever since. It is so nice  to always be able to find what you need on AMazon. The quality of the film is excellent. Thanks again.,1329955200,2,352,3.887323943661972
