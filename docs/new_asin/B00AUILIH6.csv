Jerry came to a local college class on musical history and the movies back in the sixties. He walked to the podium and said ""hello, please call me Jerry. His recognition as a composer was yet to be what he would become. He was humble, friendly and happy to teach us about movie music.",1437696000,2,388,4.256756756756757
8557920,5,B00AUILIH6,"I shelled out a pretty penny to purchase this DVD and all I can say is that it is worth it. The DVD explores Jerry's career in film music, his early fascination with film and his desire to write music for it, his talent, his early years at CBS and the impact that learning experience had on him, and explores some of his better music throughout a career that spans 50+ years in Hollywood. My favorite part is the behind the scenes look at his composing and conducting of the film The River Wild, which is one of my favorites. There are some bonus features as well, which includes interviews with friends and colleagues!! In my humble opinion Jerry Goldsmith was the greatest composer of our time and this DVD explores the reasons why that is.",1393459200,4,742,4.463235294117647
