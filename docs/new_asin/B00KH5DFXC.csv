6426709,1,B00KH5DFXC,"What a mess ! There is nothing, NOTHING new in this film. There is no new perspective or view on the difficulty of long-term relationships. What's more, this film takes way too long to prove it has nothing new to say or offer. Does the word ""editing"" mean anything to the producers of this thing? The chronology is maddening and makes NO sense at all. At one moment it's 2012 and then next moment its 2013, back 'n forth, what ridiculousness is this? The hag in the film is so annoying. She is beautiful, but excruciatingly self-absorbed (as are most of the characters in this montage of maniacs)--the cause of which may well be the inordinate amount of alcohol and drugs these folks consume. No wonder they feel like losers, they are in total denial through substance abuse. ""EastSiders"" everywhere should demand that this film be renamed as it does a disservice to ""Eastsiders"" wherever they may reside. There is some credible acting. The character of Tom, manages to convey some believability. But his partner in the film, is such a bore and apparently not very bright. For example, he sleeps with his boss and then announces he didn't know his boss was married. Huh? This is not credible at all. He sleeps with his partner's dalliance and gets angry that his partner has been unfaithful ? Huh? This is not credible at all. If the intent of the filmmakers is to convey messy lives through messy filmmaking--MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Yes, relationships are messy and difficult, SO WHAT? These characters are so self-absorbed, we don't care about them or their lives, we just want it to stop! And the music is simply dreadful. Amateurish, poorly produced, what a mess! Not recommended on any level.",1408752000,16,1695,4.78839590443686

6426712,5,B00KH5DFXC,"Great show, great cast, great writing. I came to the show as a fan of Van Hansis, when it first aired on youtube. After just one episode, I fell in love with the show and the amazing talent hat has been collected together in one place. Although the central couple in the show is gay, this show is much more than just for fans of the LGBT genre. The story could easily be playing out among your friends and family of any sexual orientation.",1407283200,2,439,4.238095238095238
6426713,5,B00KH5DFXC,Great show. Amazing cast. So grateful to Logo TV for airing it. So happy it's coming out on DVD. Can't wait until the second season.,1407283200,2,132,4.32

6426715,5,B00KH5DFXC,"What difference does it make, Internet production or otherwise? Good story and very interesting characters. I really enjoyed it, and look forward to Season 2.",1406419200,4,158,5.36
6426716,1,B00KH5DFXC,It should be noted that this is a production for the internet.  It is NOT a Hollywood type production.,1406160000,2,102,4.368421052631579
6426717,5,B00KH5DFXC,"I originally saw EastSiders as a webseries, first on youtube then on the logotv.com. My initial reaction was, ""Why isn't this on TV??"" It's better than 99% of network TV and probably 85% of cable. It's right up there with shows like Girls, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad. The story telling is wonderful and Kit Williamson's characters are fully realized people. They are perfectly imperfect people that you probably already know. The acting is flawless, and there are even a few heartbreaking scenes that might make you tear up. Van Hansis, who was on As The World Turns for 5 years, shows that he's progressed way past the soap actor stereotype (not that he ever fit that description, anyway) and creates a character in Thom that you will both despise and love - usually at the same time. Kit Williamson's Cal is that mess of a friend that you love and have to constantly watch sabotage their own happiness. You pity him even as you're yelling at him to stop being stupid. Finally, Matthew McKelligon's character, Jeremy, appears, at first, to be an amoral piece of eye candy but give it a few episodes and he'll break your heart too.

Even if you're not a big fan of the LGBT genre, you will enjoy this movie because it's not ABOUT being gay. Some of the characters just happen to be gay. Oh and I can't forget that there is a straight storyline - Kathy and Ian. Constance Wu's Kathy might be my favorite character. She's someone that would drive you crazy as a real life friend but is hysterical to watch. And her relationship with her adorably passive boyfriend, Ian (played by the equally adorable John Halbach) is both funny and sad. Overall, Kit Williamson has created a dark comedy that feels like a drama and is just about real people trying to figure out life and relationships. If you like character driven drama with a tinge of dark and sometimes controversial comedy, you'll love this movie!",1400716800,34,1899,4.635014836795253
6426718,5,B00KH5DFXC,The 'episodes' are short because this is when they were still a YouTube show. They do get longer on the second season. This is an amazing show. Basically a modern day Queer As Folk.,1508803200,,181,4.352941176470588

6426720,5,B00KH5DFXC,"Did not expect this. It was de javu all over again. Been there. Done that. Even the breakup at Christmas. So depressing. Opened up some old wounds from a long time ago. There was not a happy ending then, and there is not one in this movie. But well-played and well-done. Liked the music too.",1484006400,,291,4.3090909090909095
6426721,5,B00KH5DFXC,I binged this series in one sitting. A friend told me about it and as I'm very picky with tv shows I wasn't expecting much out of it but was pleasantly surprised. I could not stop watching it,1471478400,,191,4.052631578947368

6426723,3,B00KH5DFXC,"First off I would have to admit that Im a later comer to the show. I only discovered it on Netflix. Now either Netflix may have screwed up but it seemed to me that the episodes were slightly out of order. The premise of the show is ""Cal"" finding out that his boyfriend ""Thom"" has been cheating on him. Thought the acting was pretty darn good and were attractive but at times got pretty frustrated with the story line in general. Is everyone here just sleeping with each other?  And the actor who played ""Cal"" seriously just got on my nerves. He gets all upset, crying and getting drunk all the time when its so clear that he and boyfriend Thom want to be together and love each other. Than what's the problem here? They said over and over again that they didn't know what they wanted but again it was clear. But its possible that they had to go through all the random sex, three ways, and sex clinics to make them see it and to make a show. And whatever ever happened to the character of ""Kathy"" in season 2? It resolved nearly everyone else but never Kathy. Seemed like the characters were a bit too far fetched to be realistic. I don't recall ever being there age and with those type of jobs where one would make no money cause they rarely worked but yet have there own places, and seem to be having fun and going out constantly. Must be nice.",1467936000,,1345,4.2745098039215685

6426729,4,B00KH5DFXC,"This was a great script and well acted.

In my mind,  the theme was the drama of early adulthood.  It pretty well encompassed the gamut,  from hopeful joy to brutal rejection,  the mistakes and the lessons.  And it is a great illustration of the larger than life role those first 10-15 years of adulthood play in our emotional development,  even  though they are only a fraction of the time we'll spend as grown ups.",1457049600,3,416,4.527027027027027

I recently re-watched it as one 1 hour plus long movie and it retains its charms, with an incredible cast, the amazing interplay of drama and humor, and some truly wonderful camerawork.

6426757,1,B00KH5DFXC,"Web series are the new media, but indies like this get made all the time and they have to overcome having no money and, usually, no stars.

However, EastSiders has the latter, even if they were not necessarily stars at the time. Both Kit Williamson and Constance Wu were unknowns when they played best friends in this look at modern relationship dynamics. Now that both have major credits, one might be tempted to see their earlier work, but the work they do here is basic at best. Wu has the far better character and gives a much stronger performance than anyone involved, including celebs like Traci Lords and Sean Maher, both in small supporting roles.

The main storyline, though, involves an unintended three-way relationship between three gay men in LA, where one is cheating on a live-in boyfriend with a muscled Swede, gets caught, and then the boyfriend ends up hooking up with the Swede, who then becomes obsessed with him. Wu's character plays Williamson's best friend, who also has a straight relationship filled with issues, including an unexpected pregnancy.

If you're looking for greater details or observations in the story, it lacks them. Aside from sex-free bed-hopping and occasional glimpses of these characters' lives' at work or at play which could define they're perspectives, the entire focus is whether this long-term couple should stay a couple. 6 or 7 out of 9 mini-sodes into it, I stopped caring because it'd become too vapid. With so many vibrant characters to discover in LA, these three could not be less captivating as objects or people. The scripts sound monosyllabic and the acting's flat. Half the time, I can barely hear anyone speak. I don't think any one character is actually any different by the end, so just watching these people exist gets monotonous.

You might be tempted to watch, and if so, watch it for free, or not at all. I remembered not caring when it was online and seeing the final product doesn't change my opinion now that it costs money.",1437350400,3,1995,4.841642228739003
6426758,5,B00KH5DFXC,"LOVED IT! The chemistry between the two leading men was so believable that I thought they were truly in love with one another. The style of the movie was totally Hipsterlandia. Totally, ""The Squid and the Whale"" goes gay. But you have to be careful with these movies that appear all rosy on the outside. This movie deals with some tough, painful issues, unapologetically; and that was refreshing to see. (Side note: was wondering how Cal and Thom could afford that NICE apartment if Cal was making nothing at his art job and Thom was making crap at his bar-tending job. Just saying.) But in the end, I loved it and will watch it again, and cry.",1436054400,3,644,4.512820512820513
6426759,5,B00KH5DFXC,"Just watched this movie and the story was really good. It was nice to relate the movie to a real life, how cheating feels and how life keeps moving on. Van Hansis is a really a cute actor.",1436054400,,188,3.973684210526316
6426760,5,B00KH5DFXC,"Excellent script, outstanding acting, fabulous music score and a story line made plausible  by all three. If the production aspects were not so strong, the story would stretch the limit of  believability. The portrait of gay men is of highly promiscuity, but then, there are members of the gay and straight communities that have a difficult time making a commitment. I loves the film, and gave it five stars becasue I enjoyed it. Obviously, there are people who hate it, but give it a chance. It is certainly one of the best gay-themed films out there.",1435968000,,552,4.739583333333333
6426761,5,B00KH5DFXC,"Be aware the original format for this was a web series, not a full movie.  So it gives us a story showing the ongoing lives of its characters as they struggle through issues (infidelity, insecurity) in a short form serial format.  So it's not a full arc story ending with a fully completed point.  And it can be a little confusing because of the time gaps between episodes (and sometimes not chronological).

It leaves me wanting (desparately!!) to know what happens next.  The acting is so brilliant, it feels like they are real people, and each with flaws and redeeming qualities and I love them (even if I hate their decisions sometimes).  It leads you to think about the nature of relationships and commitment and how we handle our mistakes and the mistakes of our loved ones.  Perhaps the problems are a younger crowd's, with sex being too easy, and too easy to stray.  But it is done believably and with character complexity.  I can't wait for series 2!",1435536000,,959,4.627218934911243

Eastsiders is the story of a group of friends in their 20s in LA's Silverlake, going through romantic ups and downs, drinking too much and making mistakes, fighting and supporting each other. The writing is so funny and melancholy at the same time; I love the main character Cal's quips to his boyfriend Thom (who's played by an amazing Van Hansis). And it's so pretty to watch!

6426788,4,B00KH5DFXC,"Originally begun as a two webisode production which I saw, this series progressed to 9 total webisodes which I also saw online. I just saw the entire series full screen on DVD. The result left me with a different feeling. I was more impressed when I first saw it online. Now it seems more fragmented and discontinuous. On the positive side, the acting is excellent and the inclusion of Van Hansis for me was the primary draw. VH's breakthrough work on As The World Turns over a 5 year period was nothing less than superb as was that of Eric Sheffer Stevens over the last 9 months of that show. The chemistry between them was palpable, something lacking in EastSiders between the main characters and others. VH's earlier performance set a new standard and template for Daytime Soaps. Yet, EastSiders so far has not been able to build upon that new base. Indeed, after viewing EastSiders in a more continuous format, I found the total sum to be less than the parts. The flitting back and forth between years did not help and, from Day One, I always felt that Episode One should have been Episode Two since E2 actually took place the day and night BEFORE E1. It made things unnecessarily confusing from the start and made one feel that you had walked into a private situation a bit too early as some kind of voyeur. As the story begins and unfolds, we become eyewitnesses

 to a potentially crumbling relationship. Unfortunately, it is not until much later that we even learn how the two main characters - Tom and Cal - got together in the first place and why.  Even that is done in a cursory manner.  Also, from the outset, enters the obligatory BFF Kathy (Cal's friend) who is more of a distraction than anything else. She is also rather loud and, as the story progresses, she is more and more disruptive and a negative factor when it comes to the strained relationship of the two primary characters. She comes across as not only being self-centered but jealous of Cal's relationship with Tom. She is never encouraging and trashes Tom even though it is he who responds when she has to call someone to give her a ride home from a medical clinic. What is also disconcerting is the appearance that Cal and some of the other characters are borderline alcoholics. In one scene, Kathy even arrives in the morning at C&T's home with a bottle of booze just as Cal and Tom are going out for breakfast.  Kathy, however, insists that they stay and have an alcoholic brunch together. Never mind that C&T had just moved into their new domicile and were entitled to have some free time alone with each other. Between the drinking, smoking, the sexual square dancing, and the continuous overanalyzing of just about everything, one does not come away with a positive image of gay life. That's not to say that life is really a bowl of cherries and that straight people never have romantic problems. However, we never really get into any depth where our major characters are concerned. We get a very brief glimpse of Tom as a bartender but is that really his job? Cal works in a retail art gallery who is clueless about the personal life of his boss (deliciously played by Sean Maher) until after they have sex. What a revelation follows that situation!  And at a time that Cal is concerned about Tom's ""indiscretions"" no less.  Even before that, in a particularly incredulous moment, Cal locates Tom's ""sideline affair partner"" Jeremy and then proceeds to have sex with him!  Later, Tom discovers that Jeremy ""knows"" Cal.  Nothing is properly hidden if it should be at all and no one is truly discreet. In the end, we are left with a semi-cliffhanger. Cal and Tom are breaking up.  But is it for good?  Will Tom go back to Jeremy or get back with Cal? Who will Cal get involved with?  Season Two is on the horizon.  I would give Season One an A for effort.  It was, after all, only a beginning whose future was uncertain for a lengthy period of time.  This series does have considerable promise; and with its fine cast of actors, a bit more fine-tuning to the storyline, script, and characters (please let's have less of Kathy), could go far.  Here's hoping.",1430006400,,4140,4.581867388362652

Not sure where this east side is and it would be good to know; I guess it's west coast somewhere, probably California since it never seems to be cold in the scenes depicted. You end up feeling it could have been so much better were it structured as a full-length piece. Delightful work by the actors all around. It's all boys except for the role of Cal's college friend Kathy (Constance Wu). Haven't seen Sean Maher since Firefly, so that was really good. Van Hansis is excellent. Why don't we see him more often?

I smiled with all of them, I was sad with all of them and I wanted to hold each and every one of them. Traci Lords makes an appearance and Cal's Mom who dies like to drink, explains a lot about Cal.

And nobody gets any smarter of funnier when they drink -- just drunk.  Very boring.  And for those in LA, don't expect to see anything of Silver Lake or the eastside.

6426813,1,B00KH5DFXC,"I'm not sure what the point of this film was.  That LTR's are difficult, frustrating, and people get hurt?  OK.  And maybe for younger people, such as the characters in the film, the issues about monogamy\non-monogamy are important.  But to gay men of a certain age, this looks and feels like so much more of the same thing - gay men defined by sex, sex, sex.  You're in a committed relationship but another guy comes on to you - sure, why not?  This theme was worn out 15 years ago.  It's threadbare now.  I'd like to see a movie where that kind of thing happens and the character says:  ""Thanks but I have a partner.""  These characters are two-dimensional - like all gay men portrayed in film for the past 25 years.  I wonder what Vito Russo (The Celluloid Closet) would have to say about these films in which gay men are defined by sex.  It seems as though we went from films in which gay people didn't survive the end of the film, to films in which gay men are just two-dimensional hard-ons.  It's reached the point where it has become an activist issue because it's modern-day stereotyping.  Gay men have no thoughts or feelings - we relate to each other through sex alone.  We don't care about other people, or do justice in the world - we're divining rods led by our genitals.  Oh and we all look alike too (so you can't even tell which character is cheating on which other character with whom).

8658695,3,B00KH5DFXC,"Some interesting aspects to this three season gay melodrama. First, the acting throughout is first rate. And some of the characters are very interesting . Also, the music and location,in Silver Lake also good. It's also kind of addictive. You want to continue seeing the series to see what happens to the principals and their relationships.

Where the problem comes in to play, however, is that in way too many ways , alcoholism plays a major role in the series, and really interferes with the possibilities that the actors have in getting their lives together. There is nothing even the slightest bit funny about the addiction to alcohol ,and it has been the ruin of way too many lives. Probably the worst example is the very unnecessary role Cal's sister plays in the series. Her addiction, immaturity, and inability to function in general serves no useful function to the series or the relationships with the major players in the drama.

 It used to be, especially with young men, that the choices were to finish school, go to college, go into the military, get a job or start a family. With today's millennials, however, youth, indecision,insecurity ,and just plan laziness come into play for way too many years, and a great deal of time is wasted deciding what to do with your life. Thus, the self medication, perhaps.

You do find yourself rooting for the actors in the series to get it together, be successful in their careers, have good relationships that are stable,  and succeed dropping relationships that are not useful to their success. And to be free of STD's that can really ruin your day.",1517702400,,1604,4.797101449275362

8658703,5,B00KH5DFXC,"This season completes (one is tempted to say fulfills) what has become a trilogy in the lives of gay couple Cal (Kit Williamson) and Tom (Van Hansis). From the outset (Season 1), which depicted uncertainty, betrayal, a sense of disconnect, and lack of firm commitment in their relationship - thereby leading to an eventual (and temporary) separation - through a reunion and the rebuilding of trust and acceptance ultimately achieving a positive resolution (Season 2), we are now shown the two as a legitimate intimate loving couple (Season 3). This current ""Season"" comprises an actual road trip from NY to CA - a return to their original home in more ways than one - which serves as a kind of metaphor for this couple's relationship.  Along the way that relationship is tested by a variety of mishaps, challenges, and revelations which inevitably leads to a new understanding, a sincere expression of love, and genuine commitment.

This Season is divided into 6 stand alone Episodes that are also interlinked in one way or another. The campiness and shrillness of previous Seasons has been replaced with a much more serious and mature air. (This also applies to all the original characters from past Seasons.) But it is not overbearing and has many a laughable moment. Indeed, it is far more true to life than what you might find in comparable films of this genre. The dialogue (thanks to Kit Williamson) is credible and the behavior is quite natural. As is the case in other movies that revolve around a ""road trip"", this is also one of discovery.  (As an aside, the titles of some of the Episodes is a humorous double entendre.) The acting is uniformly excellent and the entire story is most satisfying and never preachy. There are a couple of noteworthy ""cameo"" appearances and Traci Lords makes a brief but critical appearance as Cal's mother. With Season 1, I felt that the story of Cal and Tom was a work in progress. I'm happy to say that this work has now been satisfactorily completed. Bravo!",1511654400,4,2002,4.797101449275362
