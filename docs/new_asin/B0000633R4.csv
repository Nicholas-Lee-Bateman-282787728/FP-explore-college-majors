1687493,5,B0000633R4,"'Only You' is one of the best romantic comedies around in my opinion.

Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) believes very much in destiny and soul mates and as a child obtained the name of her soul mate from a ouija board. Fourteen years later and she is about to marry a podiatrist when she answers a telephone call from a gentleman by the name of Damon Bradley - the name of her soul mate. She is determined to meet him before her wedding, but the only problem is he is at the airport on his way to Venice. Not to be deterred, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate Corvatch (Bonnie Hunt) set off in pursuit of Mr Bradley. They arrive in Venice too late, so pursue him further to Rome, where Faith bumps into a man. The man is smitten by Faith and this is a match made in heaven except for one teeny, weeny little problem - his name is not Damon Bradley but rather Peter Wright (Robert Downey Jr). Whilst in Rome too, Kate starts a bit of a fling with a seducer by the name of Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) who actually helps the slightly enlarged party find a Damon Bradley in Positano. But things turn out not to be as they seem, although everything eventually is sorted out to the satisfaction of all.

If you are going to make a romantic comedy, there can be no better place to set it than Italy, and no better places in Italy than Venice, Rome and Positano. The setting of the film certainly helps no end with some wonderfully beautiful scenery as the backdrop to the story. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr make a quite wonderful couple and there seems to be genuine chemistry between the two. Bonnie Hunt is well cast in the supporting role of sister-in-law with doubts about the fidelity of her husband. Well crafted in both story and finished film, this is another fine effort from Norman Jewison, better known probably for Moonstruck.",1104537600,3,1834,4.439169139465875
1687494,5,B0000633R4,"OK, the script may be somewhat cheesy - it is lighthearted, but the actors are utterly delightful and humorous, and the scenery is breathtaking.

Marisa Tomei plays Faith, a young woman whose brother played a prank upon her when they were teenagers and paid a fortune-teller to tell her that she would get married to the main by the name of Damon Bradley.  This worked like a hypnotic suggestion - it stuck in her mind.  She was just about to get married to someone, and while she is fixing her wedding gown, when the phone rings and a friend of her husband to be presents himself as Damon Bradley.  This triggers the words of the fortuneteller and off the chase begins to at least find out who this man is before she commits an error of getting married to the wrong guy.

She only manages to find out that Damon Bradley is at the airport en route to Italy.  There is no time to be wasted and without packing anything, dressed in her wedding gown, off she goes lest she'd miss the man of her life.  Bonnie Hunt is absolutely priceless in her supporting role - as a best friend, she, too, drops everything and decided to accompany her smitten friend on a wild chase through Italy. That wasn't such a hard decision to make since her own marriage was on the rocks.

While the actors are wonderful in their roles, it is this wild chase through Italy and the scenery that gives the movie special charm and appeal.  Some places are simply more conducive to romance than others - they feed your heart and soul with beauty, love, inspiration and romance.

It's here in Italy that Robert Downey, Jr. stumbles upon Marisa Tomei and then he begins designing events to convince her that he is the right guy, originally even misrepresenting himself as Damon Bradley, and eventually incorporating a little bit of help from his friend, played by Billy Zane.  As each of his schemes are uncovered, Marisa feels more and more disappointed and frustrated that he is trying to trick her, but at the same time she ends up developing greater and greater affection for him and realizing that he is actually a sweet and charming guy drops the fortune-telling prediction and decides to follow her heart.",1102291200,43,2179,4.5758354755784065
1687495,5,B0000633R4,"This has to be one of my fave movies of all time. I love Robert Downey Jr. If he still looked this good-check please-I would take him home any night. I honestly believe this is the most romantic movie i have ever seen, a clear cut between comedy and romance. Anyone can relate to any of the characters. I love Marisa as Faith, you can easily compare her to yourself or any other romantic girl walking this earth. Faith is looking for a name she got off an ouigi board that is supposed to be her destiny, now like myself i believe in fate, destiny, soul mates etc so watching this movie is like taking a trip down a lane i know i will someday walk into . If you are a die hard romantic, looking for a few laughs(there ARE many in this film) and a story to enlighten your soul and give you faith to find your soul mate, watch this!.. it is certainly worth a few dollars.",1090972800,6,868,4.1117647058823525
1687496,2,B0000633R4,"I don't really understand all the favorable reviews of this movie.  Let me list the things I like:
Marisa Tomei's opening scene in the classroom
The beautiful scenery
The allusion made by her name--Faith
The rest of this movie was a huge disappointment to me.  Especially as I was expecting something of the same calibur as Sleepless in Seattle, which lot's of people compare this to.  First of all, a ridiculous plot.  Who would fly half way around the world because of a NAME of someone you were supposed to marry?!?  Secondly, Peter (aka, Damon 1) claims to be in love with Faith after knowing her less than 24 hours.  And alleged feelings seem actually to be only sexual chemistry.  Not much basis for a long term relationship between ""soulmates.""  Yes, I know they had some common interests.  So what?  I have common interests with hundreds of people, some of which I might be attracted to--not really enough reason to declare lifelong devotion after only a few hours.  The premise of this movie does exactly what Kate (Faith's sister-in-law) claims that movies do.  They paint a picture of a false reality.  I know all movies do so, but most movies don't claim NOT to.  And if this is someone's idea of reality, pity to them.  Wake up!  Love is much deeper and more multi-faceted than this farce of ""divine predestination.""  Of course, as a good Calvinist, I believe every event is predestined--both good AND bad.  However, not every predestined relationship will be all asparkle with sentimentality and unbridled passion.",1085788800,5,1528,4.833976833976834
1687497,5,B0000633R4,"I guess that Only you is the kind of movie that really makes you wonder if there's someone out there who was born to be with you for a lifetime,.... and where he/she might be!!!
Sometimes love is around the corner, or sometimes you just have to travel the world to grab it and never let it go. This is a funny, romantic, silly and fantastic story, in the landscapes of beautiful Italy, that makes you laugh, cry, dream and follow your heart no matter how crazy it may seem.
Marisa Tomei is that new kind of Cindirella: she is every woman, every modern woman looking for love, in its pure shape, ...and Robert Dawney Junior is that kind of guy, not too big, not too smart, but kind and sweet enough to fight for her.
If you want to have a romantic dinner & movie night, this is your choice!!!! (this movie inspired me to cut my hair long time ago), and my biggest dream is to fly to Italy and walk on the streets of Rome, with that person born to love me.
Great movie for romantic people.",1053907200,7,987,4.2

After living here, this movie was totally believable, if a little smaltzy!!",1039132800,,333,4.387096774193548
1687500,4,B0000633R4,"That is what it is when you watch this movie.  Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey, Jr. has such chemistry it's hard to believe they're not a couple in real life.  Tomei plays Faith, an engaged woman chasing her destiny all the way to Italy.  Unbeknownst to her, Downey IS her destiny.  This movie really makes you believe in true love, destiny, and that one special someone.  See it with someone you love.
And I personally love all of Downey's works--but I'm biased.  To me, there is no better talent in this movie.  And he is so good looking!  I fell in love with him too!",1030147200,6,569,4.352380952380952

1687505,5,B0000633R4,"This has always been one of my wife's and my own favorite titles. The film has never been produced on Blu-Ray, so your only option for HD resolution has been through a streaming service.

This is an Ultraviolet title, but the encoding transfer for the film (Disc-to-Digital) did not work for me using the VUDU-to-go app on my home PC. At the time, I was borrowing my parents copy of the film, and so I was motivated to purchase my own copy of the DVD, for use and (cheaper) UV transfer.  Buuing the HD streaming title outright on VUDU is $13.99.  Knowing that my new DVD copy of Only You would also not register (which I have since verified), I planned to have the film transferred at the Walmart Photo counter using their in-store conversion process.

Just this week (March 21st, (?)), VUDU updated their mobile application to include a Disc-to-Digital bar code scanning feature.  Accordingly, an individual may scan a DVD bar code in their home library, and then transfer the film to an HD (or SD) stream. However, VUDU has added a copy protection feature that uses GPS and prevents a user from scanning titles (in their local Walmart or other) to fake the ownership process for digital transfer. Should this work for me, it may eliminate the need to wait at the Walmart photo counter for certain titles.
All this stated, Only You is a romantic comedy worth owning. Marissa Tomei is the consume beauty, and this younger Robert Downey Jr., as always, delivers on his acerbic, comedic wit.",1490313600,,1489,4.6679389312977095

1687579,5,B0000633R4,"Faith was eleven years old when she got the name of her soul mate from a Ouija board she and her brother Larry were playing on.

Damon Bradley.

A few days later, a psychic at the fair peered mysteriously into her crystal ball and told Faith and her best friend Kate the same name: Damon Bradley.

Fourteen years late, Faith (Marisa Tomei) is 25 and a teacher. She tells her students all about destiny and Plato's theory of soul mates and how all they have to do is follow their hearts to find their other half.

When Faith gets together with Kate (Bonnie Hunt) and their friend Leslie (Siobhan Fallon), she announces that her boyfriend, Dwayne, has proposed to her. She hasn't accepted yet, but says she plans to, and she shows them the ring. It is clear by her friends' reactions that although they are being supportive, they know that something is off.

At their engagement party, we see that the match between Faith and Dwayne is not great. He tries to control everything, even the way she wears her hair. And without consulting her at all, Faith finds out that Dwayne promised his mother that Faith will be happy to wear her old wedding dress. When Faith protests to him, he pushes her into it, saying how much it will mean to his mother.

Faith tries the dress on, attempting to play along. But the dress is simply horrible. When her friend Kate see it, she tells her, ""If I had this dress, I'd give it to someone.""

During a heart to heart conversation between Faith and Kate, during which Kate admits that she is not happy with her husband (Kate's brother Larry) and that she has lost her faith in romance, Faith tries to encourage Kate while dealing with her own doubts.

Then the phone rings. It's an old high school friend of Dwayne's. He's not going to be able to come to the wedding. She asks for his name. It's Damon Bradley.

He says he's at the airport, on his way to Venice. Faith doesn't even take the time to change her clothes. Still in the hideous dress, she grabs her coat, catches a cab, and heads to the airport to catch a glimpse of the man she believes is her destiny.

When she arrives too late, Faith decides to follow Damon Bradley to Venice. She calls Kate, and together, ten days before Faith's wedding, they set off for an adventure in search of this man she has dreamed of.

Damon Bradley proves more illusive than they expect. He leads them on a wild chase from Venice to Rome where they got lost in the countryside. Finally, they find the restaurant he is in and Faith goes to introduce herself, getting to his table just after he leaves! Chasing after him through the streets of Rome, she loses a shoe. It is rescued by the truly adorable Robert Downey Jr. who follows her, replaces it upon her foot, and reveals to she and Kate that he is Damon Bradley.

I have always loved this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Marisa Tomei are two of my favorite actors and their chemistry together onscreen is lovely, playful, and sweet. Nothing in this romp is as it appears to be and just as you believe that you know what is going on - it switches again, keeping you on your toes.

The scenery is beautiful and the romance is high. Faith and Kate both make big realizations about expectations and the realities of love, romance, and magic. Tender, heart-warming, with some laugh out loud moments, this is one of those ""feel-good"" movies that I never get tired of, no matter how many times I see it.

1687594,2,B0000633R4,"Bonnie Hunt is superb.  The scenery is wonderful.  Supporting characters are wonderful.  That's it.  Tomei is hampered by the script and direction.  (How did Bonnie Hunt escape the same fate?)  Downey appears as a guy who did this film because he didn't have anything better to do at the time, like play golf.  The brother is clearly on the verge of domestic violence, yet Hunt's character ""realizes"" that she loves him deeply.  This is standard abusive behavior.  Hunt's character, 'Kate', has given up.  She believes that harmful relationships are normal.  You think what a wonderful sister-in-law she is to assist Kate's wild adventure with such dedication, but then you realize that she considers herself completely unworthy. I'd wager that Hunt is fully aware of characteristic abusive situations, and it must have been tough playing that part.  (But how could I even make this conjecture?)

Antonia Rey as the Fortune Teller, makes her mark, even in the briefest scene.  Superb.  Consider that anyone in supporting roles in this film did one heck of a job overcoming the shortcomings.

Music by Rachel Portman fits, and helps get through this overall bad movie, in which you, if you must view it, will see countless snippets of pieces of classic romantic films.  They're annoying.",1407715200,,1286,5.0476190476190474

1687665,3,B0000633R4,"Only you is a stylish and funny little romantic adventure, that while beautiful to look at with great actors and a memorable score from composer Rachel Portman, never seems to completely suspend our disbelief. It's one thing to see a young woman throw away her wedding plans for a whim of an idea that takes her from New York to Italy, in search of a man who she's convinced is her prince charming, all based on a Ouija board session as a child. But it's another when the complexity of the situation is really simple enough that we are almost rejecting the plausibility of it by the end of the film. So it's true, she DOES find her prince charming, but by the time we get there, we are almost feeling like Dorothy who was wearing the Ruby slippers the whole time and wondering if we might have had a better time just watching a documentary about the countrysides of Italy.

I give this movie three stars because it IS well made. So get this one for the quirky moments, Downey's always endearing ""deer caught in the headlights"" disposition, the beauty of Tomei and the beautiful scenery and music.

It shows both his ""goofiness"" and also why he would make a believable leading man.  I'd love to see him do a really nice romantic comedy now that he's older, sexier and more mature, though his box-office strength is building on other stuff currently.

1687695,5,B0000633R4,"""Only You"" presents many questions.  Is Mr. Right predestined?  For that matter, Mr. Wright?  Is it impossible to make a bad rom-com set in Italy?  Why wasn't Marisa Tomei a bigger star than she became?  Why didn't Bonnie Hunt become a star?  Regardless, this film is an incandescent joy.  It embraces hopeless romanticism like a badge of honor.  Can't go wrong with a flick that references ""Roman Holiday"" and ""South Pacific"" as influences.  Director Norman Jewison knows how to push all the buttons as he did in ""Moonstruck"" and he does even better here.  Cinematographer Sven Nykvist captures the landscapes of Italy in all their sunsplashed glory that kind of acts as a Greek chorus to what happens in the film.  When this came out in 1994 I was probably waiting for the next testosterone extravaganza starring either Arnold, Bruce, or Jean-Claude so naturally it would have flown under my radar.  What puzzles me is my wife has no recollection of it.  This is perplexing because ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is probably one of her favorite movies of all-time.

Downey is perhaps the worst leading man in recent memory; he's the Robert Lowry or James Ellison of our time.  The story is simply ridiculous and utterly unbelievable.  Still, one can imagine teeny girls in theaters all over the world weeping into their popcorn.

Do not hesitate to see these two transcendant actors, (Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey, Jr.)both of whom rise from the Hollywood ash heaps of mediocrity again and again, this time in this pleasant tribute to ""Roman Holiday."" Other reviews focus on this sometimes charming screenplay that owes large tribute unnecessarily to ""Roman Holiday."" All the hallmarks of success stand ready for inspiring boldness that never comes from the script. Despite its gorgeous cinematography, inspiring casting and substantial direction, ""Only You"" becomes a modest disappointment.  Once you get over the unnecessary male-bashing and stereotyping of the chauvinist pigs, the holy tour of the ""Roman Holiday"" sights, you get a peek at a rough thread of a fine romantic comedy. A Garson Kanin would have thrown away the final script which slows too much on Wyler's footsteps, although, as if gaining confidence or embarrassment,the characters move away from Rome to the coastline and nearly succeed in originality. Marisa Tomei is one of the rarest actors who could survive a silent movie with her incandescence on screen. Throughout this enjoyable romp I thought Marisa was gowned by Adrian she was so stunning. Like Audrey Hepburn, another flawed and enchanting beauty herself, Ms. Tomei's reading of her lines is dead-on throughout with Robert Downey a close second. Yet, with the sound muted, this romantic comedy remains great eye candy to any romantic. In a just world, Marisa Tomei's star will rise again as surely as Robert Downey's and I hope it will be in another romantic offering.",1274054400,,1661,5.2209737827715355

Personally I find Tomei highly underrated as an actress and she is brilliant and gorgeous in this movie and in general the actors carry the movie, as does the amazing landscapes and communities in Italy depicted herein. The story line is predictable yet sweet, feel good and yet forgettable... nothing wrong with that however if your expectations are not for a cinematic master piece (deserving of 4 or 5 stars) then why rate it 1 for disappointment?

1687724,3,B0000633R4,"Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. sounds like the formula for a really great movie, but alas, it is not so great. I enjoyed watching the two of them, but I watched them with pity for having to be in such a lame excuse for a movie.

Faith (Marisa Tomei) is convinced that the man she will fall in love with and marry is named Damon Bradley because first it surfaced on a Ouiji Board, and later, a Coney Island fortune teller told her the same name. She is going to marry a podiatrist who gives her a big diamond engagement ring, but other than that, is not very romantic. One day while at his place she is trying on the wedding dress that the podiatrist's mother wants her to wear. It looks good, if a little old fashioned. Faith answers his phone and takes a message from a friend of his. When he says he is Damon Bradley and he is going to Venice, Italy, she rushes to the airport in her wedding dress to try and find him, but she has just missed him.

She decides to fly to Italy to find him. She calls her sister-in-law and tells her to pack her bags and meet her at the airport, but when she gets there she decides to go with her. Her sister-in-law is convinced her husband is having an affair, though there is no evidence whatsoever. He does take her for granted and is rude, but he isn't having an affair, just for the record.

They arrive in Venice, but keep missing the elusive Damon Bradley. They follow his trail to Rome, and almost catch up with him in a restaurant. She chases after him on the streets of Rome, and has a Cinderella moment when her red high heeled shoe gets stuck in the cobblestones. Who should find it but Robert Downey Jr., who turns out to be Damon Bradley. Or is he?

------------------
Faith: How could you do this to me?
Peter: Because I'm in love with you!
Faith: Ha! What kind of an excuse is that?
=================================

I can suspend my disbelief when it's called for, but this film was asking too much. Marisa is supposed to be a school teacher, which came in handy when Robert Downey Jr. refered to a poem he thought was by Goethe that she was able to quote, and corrected his assumption, since the poem was by Rilke. But the scenes of her teaching were terrible. She was some kind of air head teacher with syrupy ideas about romance and literature, I just didn't buy it, and even in the rarified atmosphere of high school academia, a teacher like her wouldn't last one second. Even for someone who likes poetry, literature, and romance she was too far out there.

Later, when in Rome, she is spending lavishly, and somehow has an incredible wardrobe, that her sister-in-law was able to throw together at the last minute. The clothes were marvelous, and Marisa looked marvelous in them, but I just wasn't buying her as a schoolteacher. I wasn't buying the whole premise--that she would drop everything and fly to Venice in search of Damon Bradley.

Robert Downey Jr. was at least believable as buyer for a high class shoe store. He seemed to be a little bit too into the shoes, even, but he walked that tightrobe between total depravity and just being a fashionable and competent buyer well. Downey was top notch, but even he couldn't save this turkey. The locations in Venice, Rome, and the Italian countryside were spectacular. It even gave them a chance to pay homage to Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. Still, couldn't save this movie from falling into the abyss.

------------------------------------
Peter: This guy, by the way, could be the biggest loser who ever walked the face of the earth. He could be a grump, a jerk, a pervert, a cynic, a man who's mind is infested with dark thoughts, he could be a criminal... he could be... truly sick.

Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the movie ends, and as the credits roll, you hear...

The scenes in Italy are really great, especially near the end and the acting isn't too bad. However, it seems like the premise has so many possibilities that go unrealized. In the end, the movie sort of quickly wraps things up in a way that should have been building all along. It sort of detracts from the storyline that the Peter character continuously engages in lies and deception, even when there seems to be a little magic building. In the end you think that he's the perfect guy except that he's so sleezy. It would have been nice to see the movie build on some of the things the main characters have in common rather than constantly regressing back to the deception mode. This is a cute, watchable romantic comedy, but it could have been an all-time great one with a few adjustments to the storyline.",1227916800,,924,4.505952380952381

The filming takes place in the USA and Italy, and if you have ever visited Venice and Rome, you will love to revisit these spectacular places. As her wonderful sister-in-law, Bonnie Hunt delivers a rather wonderful performance as the married woman who because she believes her husband is having an affair, travels to Europe to redefine her purpose.

Robert Downey Jr. is magnificently romantic. If you are not careful, after watching this movie you may simply purchase a ticket and go to Italy in search for romance. Don't miss it!",1219622400,,828,4.664383561643835

I really didn't have a clue who RDJ was until seeing Iron Man.  Now I'm trying to find all the movies he's played in.  Hence I watched Only You again.  I won't say anything about the plot, enough has been said about that already (why reviewers feel they have to constantly repeat the plot is beyond me... just tell what you think about the movie).  Overall the movie is cute and fun to watch, despite it's weaknesses (for me Marisa Tomei was one of them) but RDJ's presence and acting ability is what carried the movie for me.

""Only You"" is something of an enigma--you can never find it in stores, rarely even in a rental shop.  My sisters and I loved this movie in our teens--Sarah holds the record for ""Most Times Watched.""  She's not pathetic, it's just that enjoyable.  Like ""the cop and the waitress"" or ""While You Were Sleeping"" it's one of the genre that belongs in your rotation.

Here's what the editor didn't tell you:

Bonnie Hunt and Marisa Tomei are beautiful.  I still have a crush on Marisa Tomei...well, at least enough to chase down whatever movies she's been in since I saw this one.  Also, it's quotable.  Not quite as good as ""The Princess Bride"" but a lot of fun to rehash!  (""It'ly!  My wife's in It'ly!"")

Yes, the scenery.  Yes, Robert Downey Jr. is at the top of his game.  And I've gotta say that with all the scandalous behavior in the movie world today, I feel so good about the treatment of marriage in this movie.  (I'll spoil this much of it for you.) This movie makes 3 true statements: Both finding the right person and marriage itself are nearly impossible quests, but both are well worth working out.  And you can tell a lot about a woman by the shoes she wears.

1687748,3,B0000633R4,"Poor Marisa Tomei. She made the fastest career beeline from the B-List to the A-List and back to B thanks to this overly formulaic 1994 romantic comedy. Directed by Norman Jewison in a dreamy manner that seems designed to repeat the unexpected success of ""Moonstruck"", the movie is placed squarely on Tomei's shoulders to carry right after her questionable Oscar win for ""My Cousin Vinny"", and she is unfortunately given a petulant, irritating character to play here. As Faith Corvatch, she is a Pittsburgh schoolteacher about to get married when destiny seems to interject with the appearance of a man whose name, Damon Bradley, was predestined to be the identity of his soul mate. A chance phone call leads her impulsively to Italy where she leads a bumbling Clouseau-like chase to find him. Accompanied by her sensible but supportive sister Kate, she misses him in Venice but thinks she lands him in Rome. He instead turns out to be a designer show salesman named Peter Wright. Smitten with Faith, Wright decides to help her find Damon but only to make her realize that he is her soul mate.

Tomei has obviously been positioned as an Audrey Hepburn-type gamine, but her persona is too jittery and agitating to make the ruse work. She is also unfortunately overshadowed by her co-stars. Robert Downey, Jr. shows genuine comic lan as Wright, and it's unfortunate that it takes nearly 45 minutes before his character even shows up to complicate matters. The sharp-tongued Bonnie Hunt is almost too good as Kate as her character goes through her own sketchily-written marital trauma at the same time. She comes across as so clever, likable and well-grounded that she takes the focus off Tomei. The rest of the cast seem to play up their respective stereotypes - Joaquin de Almeida as a Roman lothario chasing Kate, Fisher Stevens as Kate's lunk-headed contractor husband and Billy Zane in surfer-dude mode as Faith's possible love interest. What does work unequivocally is the beautiful cinematography by Ingmar Bergman's great cameraman, Sven Nykvist. Venice, Rome and especially Positano on the Amalfi Coast rarely have looked more inviting onscreen. The 2004 DVD has no extras other than the original theatrical trailer.",1157932800,2,2222,5.038043478260869
1687749,4,B0000633R4,"This is the story of a school teacher named Faith (Marisa Tomei) who believes in destiny and true love. When she was a young girl a Ouija board and a fortune teller separately came up with the name of Damon Bradley as her future soul-mate. 14 years later, days before her wedding, she's trying out her wedding gown when she picks up the phone and speaks with an unknown friend of her fiance's - by the name of Damon Bradley. Faith, still in her wedding gown, trails the name all the way to the airport and ends up flying to Italy. And into Robert Downey, Jr's arms.

Robert Downey, Jr. plays a shoe salesman who tells Faith he's the fabled Damon Bradley, only to admit later that his real name is Peter Wright. Peter, who is in love with Faith, nevertheless, helps her to chase down her elusive soul-mate. But what if that soul-mate isn't the man of her dreams?

Only You is essentially a romantic-comedy road picture, with the gorgeous boot-shaped country contributing as a key co-star. Faith and Kate journey the breadth of Italy in search of Faith's destiny, in the meanwhile treating us to many lush and romantic sceneries. This film is replete with cute and mushy moments, abetted by that musical standard ""Some Enchanted Evening."" And, of course, wonderful, sunlit Italy, with its beautiful country- and seasides and its weight and sense of history, is always drawing you into that touchy-feely state of mind.

You'd think it'd all be too corny and overdone (with over-the-top lines like ""I was born to kiss you"") but, somehow, it all works. I particularly enjoyed Faith and Damon acting out a scene from A Roman Holiday (good impression of Gregory Peck). I doubt that Italians in general are so obliging, but one hopes that if one were stuck in an airport and in need of desperately switching planes, an Italian airport crew would be as  accomodating, in the name of love.

Marisa Tomei is sweetness personified, innocent, starry-eyed, and cute as the short-tressed Faith. Faith's hopeful outlook on life is juxtaposed by the discontented unhappiness of Kate, her sister-in-law and travel companion. The more practical Kate, played by the excellent Bonnie Hunt, is in a married relationship that isn't working out. Hunt is both sensitive and funny and proves yet again that she is a very good actress.

Robert Downey, Jr. is one of my all-time favorite actors. From The Pick-Up Artist onwards, I've seen everything he's done. Downey has an ingratiating quality that makes him accessible to the viewer. He's witty, wry-humored, and can act. He can act a lot. And because of his personal missteps, he's always been seen in the light of an underdog. Here, as ""Damon Bradley,"" his charm and screen presence are as reliable as ever. The supporting cast of Fisher Stevens, Joaquim de Almeida, Billy Zane, and John Benjamin Hickey don't embarass themselves.

If you believe in leaps of faith and taking chances, and in the magic of old-school romantic cinemas, then this movie is for you. Only You is hopeful and hopelessly old-fashioned, with a sound message:  that, while it's okay to believe in fate, in the end, you make your own destiny.",1157328000,6,3142,4.805555555555555
1687750,2,B0000633R4,"The plot was OK and Tomei charming and delightful, but to say I was not taken by the appearance and performance of Downey falls within the department of understatement.

1687752,4,B0000633R4,"Norman Jewison's ""Only You"" doesn't try to be an Oscar caliber movie, it's a sweet, simple little film that's meant to be just that, and succeeds mightily.

Marisa Tomei is Faith, a twenty-something school teacher who optimistically believes in fate and ""The One"".  Her best friend, Kate (played to hiliarous perfection by Bonnie Hunt) is also her sister-in-law and she is engaged to the dependable but dull Dwayne, a very serious podiatrist, and her life is zipping along just fine, if a little quietly, until she receives a phone call from one of Dwayne's former classmates by the name of Damon Bradley, who called to say hello before heading to Italy.  The catch?  Back when they were kids, Faith's brother played a trick on her with both a Ouija board and a carnival fortune teller, telling her that her future husband was a ""Damon Bradley"".

Faith immediately heads to the airport to stop Damon Bradley and upon missing him, flies to Italy, along with a doubting Kate.

This is where the film really sparkles, detailing Faith and Kate's adventures thru Italy as they search for the elusive Damon Bradley.  The beautiful scenery is a definite love note to Italy - - it is so gorgeous that you will be tempted to book yourself a flight as soon as the movie ends.

Along the way, we learn of Kate's own marital disappointments and concerns, and bump into Robert Downey, Jr. as a shoe salesman in town for a show, who calmly informs Faith that HE is Damon Bradley.

As in true romantic comedy style though, the road to true love is never a smooth one and more trevails follow.

The lead performances are warm, honest and earnest.  Marisa Tomei has never been cuter and her sweet, almost naive, Faith is worlds away from her role just a couple of short years earlier in My Cousin Vinny.  Robert Downey, Jr. shines in a comedic performance that seems written just for him - - it's easy to believe that he and Faith would instantly fall in love.

While the story is fairly standard stuff, the actors really make this movie shine, and the stunning Italian scenery is breathtaking.

For a taste of Italy, without leaving your living room, and a healthy dose of romance, it's ""Only You"".

Definitely recommended.",1140652800,3,2207,4.681347150259067
1687753,5,B0000633R4,"You're sure to fall in love with Bella Italia in this movie, more so than the characters themselves.  This is a cute story of a young woman who flies to Italy on a whim to find the man of her dreams. Bonnie Hunt steals the show as her humorous, wise-cracking sister-in-law.

The plot is over simplified, but it's the stuff dreams are made of which makes this an enjoyable film.  Truly both romantic and comical.  This one's a keeper.",1140652800,2,433,4.443037974683544
1687754,3,B0000633R4,"I enjoyed this film even though it's farfetched and you will think as if. The story is pretty simple a women who is about to get married leaves to europe becouse she thinks she supose to end up with some one by the name of damen bradley, things get complacated when a man falls in love with her. The film has funny moments and romantic moments and some corney moments. Bonnie Hunt is a scen steller and the charactors are enjoyable. The movie is highly predictable at every turn. Overall I liked the film and all the charactors.",1138492800,2,528,4.3979591836734695
1687755,1,B0000633R4,"or something to that effect. Sure, the scenery is nice, but the camerawork is shoddy and the continuity is inconsistent. Together with awkward cuts and sudden leaps in the story it makes for a rather jarring movie. All of sudden I could see why Sleepless in Seattle, for example, is of much better quality (OK, so it was time for me to wake up and smell the coffee).

If you can honestly say that you love somebody if the other person has just lied to you about his (or her, depending on your situation) real name, and then creates a setup with another man (or woman) in which you are led to believe that this is the real one (which it then turns out to be it isn't), OK then I guess you will absolutely love this movie.

You will probably also love this movie if you can get past the cheap romantic tricks that ordinary men tend to play on women (and the lies that go with them) and if you have absolutely nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Otherwise, save your time for something better. I wish I had after watching this cheap Hollywood ""crap"" encouraged by all the 4 and 5 star ratings on Amazon. The acting isn't even good, so there you have it. Go Tom Hanks!",1129334400,3,1176,4.245535714285714

The story is about a woman who goes all the way to Italy to find her true love after she gets his name from a Oujia board when she was young.  Sweet story with a happy ending.  Very funny too!

1687759,5,B0000633R4,"There are a few movies I can watch over and over and this is one of them.  Okay, I am a huge Joaquim de Almeida fan (I do his web site) which was the draw for me to watch it the first time.

However, there's something so charming about this movie I'd have liked it anyway.  While I do find Marisa Tomei somewhat annoying in the movie and didn't like Fischer Steven's character - the movie is enchanting.  Beautiful scenery!

Bonnie Hunt by far stole the show from Marisa Tomei in this.  And Joaquim turns in a wonderful performance.  Most people in the U.S. only know his ""bad guy"" roles (such as Clear and Present Danger, Desperado, and ""24"") and haven't seen him do comedic roles.  He handles it well and he is the perfect seductive character while being totally likeable.",1109376000,4,774,4.439716312056738
