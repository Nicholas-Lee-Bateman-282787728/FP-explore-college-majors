5616283,5,B00BGDCX0A,"I've followed Disney's ""Nature"" series since Earth, watching every release in theaters and also grabbing the direct-to-BD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disneynature-Crimson-Wing-The-Mystery-of-the-Flamingo-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B003QF1NAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disneynature: Crimson Wing - The Mystery of the Flamingo  (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>. I have always been satisfied by the glorious images and heart-warming narrative. DisneyNature is every bit as good as the BBC documentaries and are must-haves for any 1080p fan who wants to show off their High Definition TV.

Now about ""Wings of Life"" - I pretty much knew from the start that I was going to love it, being a butterfly fan, but I had no idea how much I would truly LOVE it. The images you see in this movie go beyond impressive and into the realm of unbelievable and surreal. The picture quality is better than my wildest imaginations.

Streep's narrative is crisp and neat, much better than Tim Allen's work on Chimpanzee, and a pleasure to listen to. There is a good deal of education in here, as well as occasional storylines more geared for the youngsters. If you think Butterflies and Hummingbirds aren't interesting enough to fill a full-length documentary, prepare to humbled by this masterpiece. Of course there are plenty of other exciting critters along the way.

OVERALL: Another A+++ release from DisneyNature. I only wish that it had been released in theaters (IMAX would be amazing) and that there were more bonus features on the BD (the only supplement is an exciting preview of ""Bears,"" their next documentary). I am very, very satisfied. This is something you're going to want to watch over and over again.",1366070400,18,1750,5.642585551330798
5616284,5,B00BGDCX0A,"Everything that Disney does is top notch and Wings of Life by Disneynature is no exception. I was thrilled to find this division of Disney as I hadn't yet had any exposure to it. The movie is as extraordinary as I would expect of Disney and more. The above pictures just you just a glimpse of the amazing photography involved.

I was so blown away by the ability of the camera's to get close enough to capture the images that it did with such clarity and vibrant color. I have never seen the detail of a bee's face or the pattern of a butterfly's wings so close up before. Learning about pollination and seeing it up close and personal is something my kids would never get to experience like this.

Narrated by a flower, we are taught the importance of the flower in nature and how it impacts all living things. I learned so much science and even history from watching this. My three and five year olds were glued to the TV and I really thought they would lose interest once they saw it wasn't a cartoon. Instead they asked me all kinds of questions about what they were learning. It was like a huge science lesson.

Paige has always been intrigued by Hummingbirds so she loved the section learning about them. Reed really loved the bats and thought their long tongues reaching into the flowers was the funniest thing ever. I didn't expect them to be so entertained by an educational movie.

From the incredible visual appeal to the dynamic accompanying music and the soothing voice of the narrator, it is an all around unforgettable experience.

The magnificence of Wings of Life is something you have to experience for yourself because I can't even begin to do it justice.",1366070400,31,1674,4.548172757475083
5616285,5,B00BGDCX0A,"This is an extraordinary film. This was shown at a film festival in January where I live, and people are still talking about it. One of the attendees said she was moved to tears by the beauty of the film, while one of the children in attendance said it was one of her favorite movies of all time. Not only is the cinematography extraordinary, but the story is nothing short of stunning, and eye opening at the same time. I would highly recommend this film.",1365206400,58,456,4.376470588235295
5616286,3,B00BGDCX0A,not everyone in the world has a blu ray player - why do these Disneynature releases always come in the double pack - spend a little money and make the single dvd available to customers - it's beyond ridiculous,1364428800,19,209,4.384615384615385

I originally saw this production on Netflix and was enthralled with it, hence bought the DVD.  I am in the process of returning it to Amazon.  Very disappointed with the unreasonable complexities of simply trying to play a dvd.  The production is beyond excellent.the complicated machinations of trying to play the dvd sucks!!!

5616304,5,B00BGDCX0A,"This is the best nature documentary I've ever seen. As a homeschooler, I try to take cues from my children about the subjects to highlight. They are really into gardening, butterflies, birds, and things of that sort right now. This was absolutely captivating for both of them, ages 3 and 5.

This touches on bats, butterflies, birds, etc and their life cycle, feeding, migration on a global scale from a flower's ""perspective"". It is really amazing to see how everything is connected. I really love how the end ties it all together with environmental responsibility and a call to action. It inspired me.

Meryl Streep as the narrator is quite nice. She really does a lovely job and her voice seamlessly blends in with the breathtaking visuals. I have never reviewed any sort of tv or movie on Amazon, but I was so impressed by this today that I had to come here and praise it. You should check it out!",1445472000,,901,4.590062111801243
5616305,5,B00BGDCX0A,"I first had the pleasure of seeing this on NetFlix streaming, I found it to be so mesmerizing I watched it night after night for perhaps 60 times when then NF took it off streaming. I didn't think after all those veiwings I'd miss it but I did!  I found it here on Amazon and put it in my orders queue but since I am on my SS did not have the money for it until much later (about 11 months).  I finally ordered it and got it home, but that night before I could watch the disc my amplifier went out unexpectedly, it is the sound system I always used for listening to my DVD/BD.  I put the BD in and tried to play it anyway using just the TV sound, but the BD had errors on it and would NOT play.  Very disappointing.  I put the second disc (DVD)  in  and it played great except for one thing, the narration was sooooooooo low you could not hear  Meryl Streeps beautiful voice as she so eloquently described each scene and happening in the movie!  More disappointing.  So, thank goodness it is a double disc set but unfortunately you need a separate sound system such as an amplifier or a DVD /BD player with it's own speakers (i.e. sound system) to be able to enjoy it to it's fullest.  I had my amp repaired and now all is well,  I get to both see and hear the most extraordinary documentaries of all time in it's fullest glory!",1444435200,,1328,4.124513618677042
5616306,3,B00BGDCX0A,"Beautiful.  But VERY strong evolution-based narration.  Hard when it is not even stated as a theory but as fact -- confusing to Christian families wanting to explore God's creation without having to almost turn off the volume to enjoy the movie.  Most of Disney's Nature Movies are adorable, informative, and touching.  This one doesn't fit that mold as it doesn't follow one animal or family and give us a story.  Worth watching, but so disappointing about how strong the evolution narration was explained.  We stopped the DVD and had a discussion about it as a family, just wished that Disney would have kept it a little more fact based and not so strong on a theory when narrating.",1442448000,,684,4.754237288135593

There are so many scenes filmed in ultra high motion, so you can see the movement of wings that its impossible for human eyes to otherwise track.  The narration is understandable by young children.  The gorgeous views fascinated our four year old granddaughter, while the narration taught her a little biology.  She watched it raptly.  Great present for kids!",1415491200,2,512,5.195121951219512

5616345,5,B00BGDCX0A,"If David Attenborough is not available, then Meryl Streep is a sound choice for a narrator.  Her soothing voice is actually very appropriate for a documentary in which the speaker is the voice of every flower.  A wonderful asset to my Blu-ray collection.  My 3-year-old niece was entranced, particularly by the bats feasting on the saguaro cacti at night.  She cried when I paused it to go to the bathroom:  ""No!  Don't stop it!""  That says a lot about the program.  The hummingbirds were amazing as well.  I have seen them fly backwards and upside down near my feeders and in many documentaries, but I have NEVER seen one do a spin as captured on film here.  The monarch butterfly migration was nothing new to me, but I imagine it will be fascinating to those who have never seen it documented.  Disney did a fine job here.",1402531200,,824,4.537414965986395

Louis Swartzenberg has done a truly remarkable photo essay of the natural world around us. One segment depicts a hummingbird flying still, then backwards and then upside down in a spiral fashion to catch a bug and it's all in slow motion. One of the mysteries of this film is how does the camera follow the Monarch butterflies as it floats above the foliage and follows thousands of the Monarchs in flight. Truly a remarkable film in every respect.",1399766400,,556,4.626262626262626
5616350,1,B00BGDCX0A,"The cover shows a butterfly. The title is ""Wings Of Life"".  Most people as I did would assume the story is about butterflies. It is Not! The story is about how flowers developed the ability to have 'sex' to propagate the species. The narration talks about how flowers have developed the ability to have sex over the millions of years.  'Sex' in flowers is the main theme of the dialogue!

I bought this for my daughter's first grade class. She teaches the life cycle of the butterfly. The movie only shows butterflies in passing. As a side note. Where are the 'Wings Of Life'?

The narration is so boring that you want to turn the volume off!  Meryl Streep talks in a whisper like she does not want to interrupt the sex life of the flowers. Meryl Streep never changes her monotonous tone during the entire movie. I turned the movie off before it reached the half way point.

I have purchased 16 other Disney movies for my grand daughter. I would purchase the old 'True Life Adventures"" series because they were so well done. However, the cinematography of these 1960's films looks terrible in high definition. I still love the narration by Winston Hibler.

The cinematography is very good but does not make up for the misleading title and bad narration!

5616361,5,B00BGDCX0A,"Unbelievable extraordinary film told from an unusual point of view, from that of a flower. Meryl Streep does a great job of narration and the visuals, especially the macro and timelapse sequences, are the reason for purchasing this DVD. Hummingbirds in slow motion and thousands of monarch butterflies will take your breath away. The music for the most part is beautiful as well, except when it descends into the typical Disneyesque orchestratral moments that sound like every other Disney moment.  Nevertheless, Louis Schwartzberg's cinematography is worth watching more than once, and the ending, with suggestion on how to support wildlife with simple actions, is a winner as well.

I felt that it somewhat jumped around quite a bit from one place to the other suddenly. Overall, the filming was very detailed and at times really incredible. However, the narration was TERRIBLE! I had to force myself to stay awake during the narration. The tone is slow, low and too monotonous. Its a shame that such good filming is accompanied by such terrible narration. Narration is just as important as the filming and its the narration that keeps one interested. It comes to show that Hollywood actors are not always good narrators. In this case, Streep was terrible. Not only is the tone drab, but the commentary is useless. The words just seem not to fit the story and I felt that they were trying to use fancy words when a choice of simple words would have done fine. So, if you don't like drab commentary, avoid this one.",1382400000,2,934,4.5

5616365,5,B00BGDCX0A,"A Hidden World.

What an amazingly beautiful film!  Filled to the top with stunning footage of flowers, insects, birds and bats it will take you to places you may have only imagined but will
never have experienced.  Cameras and nature photography have come a long way since Disney's ""Seal Island"" (1948).  Things that those early film makers could only dream about are now common place.  Microphotography, ultra slow motion, time-laps photography: all have improved over the years and Wings Of Life will show case them all.  It will show you aspects of this hidden world that, in many cases, have remained obscure.  Nowadays, nature documentaries on both the big screen and TV have become very popular: National Geographic, BBC, Nature and Nova on PBS and, of course, Disney.  This latest offering from Disney/nature is a welcome addition to a long tradition of science/film making.  To me, the narration is an important part of any documentary.  So the choice of the narrator is as vital to the film as picking your leading actor.  The narrator of this film, Meryl Streep, could only be as good as the ""narration script"" provide to her by the film maker Louie Schwartzberg.  Streep's delivery is as good as anyone's but the script itself leaves much to be desired.  I can't imagine who would think that this cutesy-pie, childish, concept of a ""flower telling the story"" was a good idea.  Schwartzberg was at the helm so if you don't like the narration blame him not Streep.  Another important part of any film is the music and the score for this film was outstanding.  Light when it needed to be and moving when necessary.  Symphonically done by Bliss in perfect coordination with the images on the screen.  In spite of the poor ""narration script""  I was very pleased with this fine addition to my nature film collection.

This was so bad we would love to return it, the narration was a drag, the overall story a disappointment, however, the slow-motion videography was good.

My son, 3, picked this movie out for his mom for Mothers Day. He knows she loves butterflies and chose this over the Flamingo film, Crimson something. The butterflies were far and few between, and then bees, bats, and more. The main story was about a flower, or rather flowers in general, and the pollination that occurs thanks to the flying creatures (pollenators).

They could've put a couple of those on & a couple of similarly themed cartoons.  They wouldn't have had to pay a cent & could've even presented them in standard definition but at least there would've been more content. 2) The second problem is the price.  It's the same price now as it was release week & the whole preorder time.  Of course the stores prices were even more outrageous (although many didn't even carry it).

The links between various species has long been known and understood by our scientists.  Yet, almost nowhere is this story told in our schools except in basic biology classes in high schools.  This environmental web should be known by everyone.

Disney's ability to use sharp graphics, crisp and clear photography has long been impressive.

5616411,5,B00BGDCX0A,"I have been lucky to be able to watch all Disney Nature documentaries produced to date, and I have to say that this mega studio has made the correct decision to make them. They are as entertaining and educative as any other in the market, and I am happy to inform you that ""Wings of Life"" is their best yet. It is such a delicious and precious show that you don't want to see an end to it, especially in the superb screen definition of the Blu-ray.

The film opens with a line that perfectly describes what we are about to watch: ""Life depends on little things we take for granted."" In other words, basically, we'll see life as it happens from a flower point of view -- pretty ingenious, if you ask me.  For this purpose, director Louie Schwartzberg and his talented crew travel to the rainforest of Panama, where they examine the tricks used by flowers to attract pollinators - mostly insects and birds --, which they refer to as ""love messengers."" The filmmakers also discuss the evolution and importance of pollen dispersal. In the same fashion, Schwartzberg then takes us to the Sonoran desert, where we witness the same processes, this time between cactuses and bats. In addition, we are then taken to the USA, to learn how important bees are to man and nature, not only for their honey, but also for their pollinating abilities. Of course, we also get educated about Monarch butterflies and their annual migration from Mexico to the USA and Canada, and how important they are in the pollinating world. Furthermore, the filmmakers also mention all the forces that are exterminating natural pollinators, such as deforestation and pollution, and they explain the conservation efforts that are being made to save them from extinction. Clearly, the planet will be doomed without them.

""Wings of Life"" is excellent in its story telling and its awesome photography, especially the flying bats in slow-motion and the micro-scale habitats of the insects -- mesmerizing, really. It is also important to add that some of the proceeds from the film will go to Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund. The film is narrated by Meryl Streep. Released on April 16, 2013. The Blu-ray + DVD combo includes a segment on the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund and its work. (USA, 2011, color, 80 min plus additional materials)

5616412,4,B00BGDCX0A,"""Life depends on little things we take for granted."" This opening title sets the stage for another of those jewels of natural filmmaking in the Disneynature series -- a series that deserves all the attention of tentpole blockbusters but are released quietly on Blu-ray/DVD and perhaps in a few theaters.

The latest is called Wings of Life, a title that barely encompasses the depth of what you experience in this brilliant film, shot in razor-sharp clarity, even when capturing microscopic miracles.

The title implies birds, but the story is about insects and flowers. Narrator Meryl Streep's words are those of the plants, trees and flowers, explaining in first person how they all interact with each other.

""One might imagine that the most important life forms are large or flashy or smart,"" narrates Streep, ""But it is love among the little things that runs the vast machinery of life."" How true this is. (read my review of Lincoln for this same concept on a human level, as applied to the muckety-mucks and the folks in the trenches).

From bees to bats, hummingbirds to beetles (Paul is the cute one), the creatures are part of a spectacular spectrum of survival, balance and innate skill.

To me, the stars of the film are butterflies. There is one sequence in which what appears to be milliions of butterflies burst from trees and settle in the grasses. It must be seen to be believed.

None of this is done with CG or special effects, yet it is every bit as astonishing as a megablockbuster movie -- albeit with a soothing, ethereal tone, due in no small part to Streep, whose superb narration comes as no surprise to those of us who love her recording of The Velveteen Rabbit with pianist/composer George Winston.

No extras to speak of, unfortunately, since seeing how this was filmed would be fascinating. No matter, the color and majesty makes Wings of Life like a naturalistic Fantasia.",1366675200,17,1902,4.815950920245399
5616413,3,B00BGDCX0A,"As other have previously stated, the video footage is nothing short of incredible. My wife and I were so excited about watching this movie with our grandchildren, we paid for expedited shipping to get a copy sooner. We have so enjoyed Louie Schwartzberg's other material (especially the gratitude video on YouTube), we decided to preview the movie with two of our adult children. Had the video footage not been so captivating, I would have only given this movie one star. Mr. Schwartzberg is an incredible cinematographer and he does a great job of documenting activities in nature; had he only added music to his work, I would have considered this a documentary. Unfortunately, he added narration, and some of it is more subjective than objective. We were all very disappointed with the content and the delivery of the narration. This is not a so much a knock on Meryl Streep as it on the director, Mr. Schwartzberg; the director is responsible for the entire package. The ""I am a flower"" angle was different, but the talk about flower's romantic lives and their ""love messengers"" just seemed weird (we understand the pollination process, and that gender exists in the plant world). If you believe plants evolved over millions of years, you will not be disappointed; if you have other beliefs about how the world was created, consider this a content warning. There are a couple of scenes younger children may find unsettling, but they are brief and can be used as teachable moments. Toward the end, the movie shifts gears and instead of showing the marvels of nature, it begins to focus on the negative effects humankind has on nature. We believe everyone must be responsible stewards of the earth and that people need to understand how their decisions affect the environment. We just did not see the need to include scenes of dead bees and trees being felled in a forest in a movie we wanted to show to our younger grandchildren.

In summary, the movie is worth purchasing for the awesome video footage (high speed, time lapse, and macro). If you hold a more conservative viewpoint, turn down volume on the movie, pick some music your family will enjoy, and listen to it while you watch the movie. Either way, you will walk away with a new appreciation of flowers, birds, bees, and especially bats.",1366502400,37,2300,4.808080808080808

5616415,5,B00BGDCX0A,"This is some of the best footage of hummingbirds and bats that I've ever seen, and I've seen lots of nature documentaries over the past 3 decades.

If you're into nature documentaries, this one is a must have.  Meryl isn't quite as good of a narrator as David Attenborough, but she does a fine job nonetheless.  The footage from this is on par, if not better than, Planet Earth/Blue Planet and the likes.

Very educational and fun for the whole family.  Even my spastic kid sat still to watch this with us.",1366156800,4,506,4.456521739130435

8568050,5,B00BGDCX0A,I like the way this movie is shown from the perspective of a flower. Telling all about all of the different types of pollinators and how they help the environment,1530921600,,162,4.433333333333334
8568051,2,B00BGDCX0A,Just got this in the mail for my kids and the whole thing was destroyed. The casing was cracked and the disc was loose in the entire package box. Highly disappointed but thankfully no scratches on the disc. If it plays it stays...,1520812800,,230,4.372093023255814
8568052,3,B00BGDCX0A,"The animal life and scenic images are excellent.  The narration is annoying.  A monotone voice pretends to be a flower...yes, a flower telling you it's story.  Just give the facts straightforward without the cutesy shtick.  Also there is the old leftist agenda items that they just have to shove down your throat...evolution, global warming, etc.",1520726400,,346,5.236363636363636

8568059,2,B00BGDCX0A,"Bought the series for my 3rd/4th grade classroom.  Beautiful photoghraphy but the vocab is ridiculously high for children.  Can't play with sound.  I play and explain things as it goes along.  Vocab better suited to high schoolers with a dictionary.

This makes it inaccessible to children as you lose them because of the vocabulary.",1483228800,,333,5.092592592592593
