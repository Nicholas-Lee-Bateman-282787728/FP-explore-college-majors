5692492,5,B00C7A8WY2,"I collected Marvel comics since I was 9 years old and read many a storyline but this no holds barred about abuse,control,and getting your own worth to overcome and road block in your life is what I took out of this story. I really enjoyed this concept of his origin and recommend this to Marvel fans,new and old.",1374019200,,312,4.396551724137931
5692493,4,B00C7A8WY2,"Great story, great voices.  You could tell a lot of thought went into this.  I looked forward to each episode.",1373846400,2,110,4.45
5692494,4,B00C7A8WY2,"Before you make your purchase, please beware that this story is truly about the origins of the boy who would become the man that would turn into who we know as Wolverine. Before Professor Xavier, before Alpha Flight, before the X-Men, the battles with his nemesis Sabretooth(although he is definitely foreshadowed), James Howlett's early beginnings bear no resemblance to what his life would later become. The ferocity and strength he would later develop would not allow one to guess that as a young boy he was very sheltered, very weak and came from wealth. This is a history that I had never considered but Marvel has done well with choosing this for a motion comic. As the first review mentions, the voice acting is superb, and while I have to concur with the thought that Spider~Woman, Agent of S.W.O.R.D. is done better, this is not by any means not worth the purchase. I do not say this to merely suggest I am comparing one motion comic to another, but once you are smitten with one, your expectations start to rise even if you are not necessarily aware of it. Listening to the creators and understanding the process to produce the original artwork is a treat within itself, and for myself, I think Marvel would do well to re-release the original comics in their pencil form by Andy Kubert: it looks that good. Even the colorist Richard Isanove's approach to complimenting Kubert's works are fascinating, as well, so indeed, this gets a hard earned 4 stars.",1373673600,7,1463,4.741176470588235
5692495,4,B00C7A8WY2,"Another excellent motion comic from Marvel Knights. Remember, this is not a ""regular"" cartoon but a motion comic. It's not the same. The original artwork is intact with rudimentary movement added. The voice acting is very good. I did not realize how tragic Wolverine's early life was. Watch this to find out. Still, my favorite motion comic is ""Spider-Woman"" which, I think, was the first one and the mouths did not move. Each motion comic that Marvel releases has it's own unique artwork. I hope this form of art continues.",1373241600,17,524,4.833333333333333

5692504,5,B00C7A8WY2,"Remember this isn't a cartoon.  It's a moving book.  If you think motion comics are weird this may sway you.  The story doesn't rely on action as much as most motion comics so you focus more on the story, and it's a damn good one.  The voice acting helps quite a bit and they have a good cast on this.  The story retains it's mystery and has all the misdirection of the comic.  Clever story, well acted, and cheap!  What a great combo.

If you like motion comics already this one is a must have.  If you're not sure about them check this out and it may turn out to be a good ice breaker.",1404086400,,587,4.034782608695652
5692505,1,B00C7A8WY2,"This was a waste of money for me.  For one, it was drawn in some old style that I haven't seen since the 70's.  I think it was worse than South Park.  Their's 5 episodes and each one is only around 13 minutes long.  They could have put more into each episode and drew it better to match today's animated films.  It didn't have to look like Cars or anything, but damn, it could have at least matched DBZ or something.  If I'd seen a preview before purchasing, I wouldn't have even wasted my money.  Not to mention, it didn't even seem like the real Wolverine.",1402963200,,558,4.2075471698113205

5692507,5,B00C7A8WY2,"If you are a marvel fan,  or a Wolverine fan then this is a MUST buy.  An indepth retelling of Wolverine's origins.",1394841600,,115,4.181818181818182
5692508,1,B00C7A8WY2,The weakest wolverine story so far and I think I found my first goodwill donation for the year. Weak and hard to watch.,1394323200,,119,4.217391304347826
5692509,2,B00C7A8WY2,"Are not the animations I had in mind, when I'd purchased these particular ones! I was quite surprised to know that they were kind of a still animation of sort. I know it's too late, but I prefer next time not to buy this type of animation for my collection. It's Weird! Is theres any kind of way, that you all can say what type of animation the DVD is, before I buy it? The first one I bought one of these were: Black Panther. I was like ""OH!"". But I guess the cheaper it is; the more it's going to be one of these, Right? If that's the case; then I'll pay closer attention this time. I don't want anymore of these. It's like: a drawing, that someone is trying to make move, little-by-little. Kind of a lazy like drawing of animations. ""It's Weird!"".",1393027200,,750,4.179310344827586
5692510,3,B00C7A8WY2,"Not bad, but it's a moving comic book, not exactly a animated movie. But the story was pretty good. Showing where Logan came from and how he became who he is now.",1392768000,,162,4.09375
5692511,5,B00C7A8WY2,"It is a masterpiece. As simple as that. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The story, the art, everything is just perfect. If you like comic books, you must watch it.",1390435200,,175,4.176470588235294
5692512,4,B00C7A8WY2,"Didnt realize this when I bought it. It took me by surprise at first, but really enjoyed one of my favorite Wolverine stories come to life. If you enjoyed the book, and like motion comics its aneasy choice to buy. Wish they would have included that it was a motion comic in the description though.",1387756800,4,297,4.418181818181818
5692513,1,B00C7A8WY2,"It was a horrible the item was damage, and the description  of the item was in good condition. I returned it. A bad experience",1386460800,,126,4.25
5692514,5,B00C7A8WY2,"I've never been a fan of Wolverine, but I like the character nonetheless. I'm a comic book reader who feels his origin should have remained untold as doing so added the mystique to him. However, this story did exactly the opposite of what I thought would happen if Wolverine's origin was ever told: it enhanced his mystique. This story is one of the capstones of Joe Quesada's tenure as Marvel Comics' Editor-In-Chief.

I enjoy the Marvel Knights animation series as I believe it exposes people like me who haven't read many of the Marvel Knights titles to some great stories that might be worth checking out via trade paperbacks. I'm always fascinated with how the animators use stop motion techniques to maintain the integrity of the original comics in both story and art. I believe this piece to be one of their best projects yet. I salute Marvel for this effort.",1385337600,4,866,4.735099337748345
5692515,5,B00C7A8WY2,I've always liked wolverine. I liked the comic and I loved this even more. I couldn't asked for anything better.,1382832000,,112,4.65
5692516,5,B00C7A8WY2,This was a great buy. No regrets. Beautiful with a great story and connected all the dots so compelling watched in one sitting.,1379808000,,127,4.565217391304348
5692517,2,B00C7A8WY2,The story was long and drawn out hate the animation it was like something from 1920s. It was like a pop up child picture book. A waste of time.,1378771200,,143,3.9655172413793105
5692518,3,B00C7A8WY2,Giving a rating of 3 because of disappointment about the story not continuing unless there is suppose to be another release of part 2. Looked on the internet and I can't find more information. I like the story line and the animation reminds of book stories in the 80's.,1378339200,,269,4.510204081632653
5692519,4,B00C7A8WY2,"If you know this story, you know how important it is for Wolverine fans and how well crafted it is.  This is an animated comic and if you enjoy the story and the animation style then this a no brainer.  But if you don't meet both of those criteria then you might want to give it some thought.  My wife will watch most animated shows with me but she will not watch these because of what she calls ""that still frame animation.""",1378080000,,425,4.158536585365853
5692520,4,B00C7A8WY2,"I enjoyed this story, but it is not my favorite story of how Wolverine became to be.  It is to the producers credit to try to tie up loose ends and entertain fans at the same time.  Recommended.",1377993600,3,194,4.078947368421052
5692521,1,B00C7A8WY2,"Marvel takes the story of the origin of Wolverine and renders it almost unwatchable.  The crude style of animation turns every serious moment for the characters into a joke.  The animation is so distractingly bad, I'm not sure if the acting is really as horrible as it seems or just hopelessly undermined by the sub-Superfriends animation.  Animation this primitive works well with the crudely drawn figures and environments in South Park, but carefully detailed character drawings simply do not go with an immobile face and a flapping jaw that bounces around with a life of its own.  They would've been better off telling this story with sock puppets.",1377820800,,652,5.0092592592592595
5692522,3,B00C7A8WY2,"I was excited to hear this DVD was been made. However, I was slightly disappointed on the final product.  I thought the storyline could've continued a little more.",1377561600,,163,4.821428571428571
5692523,3,B00C7A8WY2,"was kinda disappointing i have the comic & i was hoping for a more live action of it i also have the IN HUMANS as well and i had high expectations but i had hoped they could of done a better job on it story is good but the way to view it , if i had of known it was like this i would never ever have bought it.",1377388800,,309,3.4285714285714284
5692524,5,B00C7A8WY2,I own the graphic novel to this movie and I truly love them both. Marvel comics are the best ever.,1377302400,,98,3.95
5692525,5,B00C7A8WY2,"What most of us have learned to expect is a current day Origin story and you'd be wrong to expect that given James Howlett's life span. This story takes place in the beginning of the industrial revolution during the character's youth and we witness his ability to labor, to heal from injuries, his learning of the existence of Samurai, and many other facets of what become his character. A must have for any fan of Wolverine and in some ways better than the theatrical film version.",1376870400,,482,4.616279069767442
5692526,2,B00C7A8WY2,This is a paperback on film!! Have no idea what was the purpose of doing this but it sickens me to look at it!! This not animation- not in the least,1376352000,,148,3.806451612903226
5692527,5,B00C7A8WY2,Finally we get to see the true origin of marvels greatest and most beloved x-men/superhero around wolverine. this was a great idea the story is awesome and well done. I thought that this was a movie but it is actually a motion comics mini series that was on marvel.com. wolverine's untold origin is set date in the late Victorian era and it tells his childhood story and where he came from and who his parents are and how he found out about his mutant powers. this is a great story and i'm glad it was finally made and I think every wolverine fan will be happy to. if you have not seen this then I recommend you do,1376265600,,614,4.211864406779661
5692528,5,B00C7A8WY2,A MUST BUY VIDEO! Marvel needs to do more of these movies seiously! Keep up the pace with DC! SERIOUSLY very very GOOD!,1376179200,,119,4.217391304347826
5692529,4,B00C7A8WY2,The animation is kinda lousy but for those Wolverine fans it's okay. The story line is gripping very much like the graphic novel. Still a great movie.,1376006400,,150,4.592592592592593
5692530,2,B00C7A8WY2,Short animated clips...not worth it. Rather spent the money on the old XMen DVDs or the new Wolverine and XMEN,1375747200,2,110,4.55
5692531,5,B00C7A8WY2,"Brilliant in nearly every way except it was never specified that it would only work with ntsc whereas I live in england and have pal. Still, I found a way to make it work.",1375747200,,171,4.0588235294117645
5692532,1,B00C7A8WY2,"I bought this movie with hopes it would be good like must others. Dead wrong! It is horrible. The story line is crap, makes everything that you read or seen a lie, along with how he became Wolverine. The movie itself is made up of smaller tales that run together that honestly, I had to bare through it due to the fact I paid for it. If you read the comics, and like the movies, do not buy this. The creators of this product should be ashamed of themselves and trust me when I tell you this, but I would pay them to take it from me.",1375315200,,532,3.9813084112149535
5692533,2,B00C7A8WY2,The origin has been overly done and it needs a rest. The animation needs the usual Marvel touch but all in all its oaky for a couple of beers and a good farmer's daughter joke. Where are you Hugh Jackman?,1375056000,,204,4.125
5692534,5,B00C7A8WY2,Very hard core drawn out story but entertaining at the same time taken right from the comic leaves nothing to the imagination,1374624000,,125,4.7272727272727275
5692535,3,B00C7A8WY2,"But this was pretty good. The long overdue origin of the Wolverine and faithful adpatation from the comic. Set in Victorian times, a side of Logan you have never seen before.",1374451200,,174,4.645161290322581

8577951,2,B00C7A8WY2,"While I appreciate the effort to fill in the blanks about Wolverines past, I cant say the writers have improved on the character of Wolverine but introducing this story line. I am disappointed that there seems to be so little talent for writing great stories at Marvel Knights. Not sure what the reason is but the lack of writing talent is clearly and issue for Marvel Knights. I don't mean to seem insensitive to the writing efforts of the writers but hey, they are getting paid to write and they are making their work public and thus they invite honest criticism.

I really did have a hard time forcing myself to watch each chapter. It is a drama with little to keep your attention besides the curiosity of what happens next and how will it end. (And early on you began to want it to end).

Sorry people, I just think that the story could have been a whole lot better considering it was to fill a void of unknowns about a major Marvel character.
Where has all the great writers gone?",1421971200,,985,4.406593406593407
