So when I found this and saw that it also came with Moulin Rouge I couldn't have been happier! Great movies, they worked great, no problems what so ever.",1424563200,3,282,4.339622641509434
8551452,5,B00AGKHAK2,"Sunnydale Chick here, And I finally saw Moulin Rouge last night, I thought it was very romantic, very sad and very good....and I remembered I thought It was a nice contrast to this Romeo and Juliet A movie I saw in theatres and already had. (Another thing fun is I'm listening to the soundtrack I just got.....Very cool!) And although it's a sad movie....I like that like In Romeo and Julie they still get to be together in a way.",1418774400,,430,4.3875
