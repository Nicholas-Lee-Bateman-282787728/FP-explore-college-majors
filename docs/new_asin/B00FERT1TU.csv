5985022,3,B00FERT1TU,A poisoned dog comes back to Earth as Dick Powell to discover who killed it. You may have a tendency to believe this picture is more intelligent than it is. It ain't. Support this only to encourage studios to keep searching out rare stuff.,1385683200,,239,4.454545454545454
5985023,5,B00FERT1TU,"This film is quirky, funny, moving and oh so clever. I first saw it on TV around 1988 and I've loved it ever since. However I'm not going to review the movie itself as plenty of reviews on IMDB.  This review is about the disc itself.

I've not had it long, but the image and sound is crisp. My hearing is not great, so decent soundtrack is important for me. A good clear dialogue and image. No noise spots or any problem whatever. I assume that it must have been restored because the only prints I had seen previously on TV were very poor.

I've bought DVD's of other old films and was disappointed as poor image and sound, so You Never can Tell was a wonderful experience.

I can't think of anything negative about it at all and that is saying something.",1385596800,8,755,4.258741258741258
5985024,5,B00FERT1TU,"If you're looking for a wonderful, one-of-a-kind film for your family to enjoy, then look no further.
""You Never Can Tell"" is one of the most charming and funny fantasies ever put on film, and it holds up beautifully after all these years.
I was happy when I learned that this movie was finally getting a DVD release, and I didn't care if it was a DVDR ...... just get it out, already.
I watched it with my family the day it arrived, and everyone enjoyed it immensely, especially my 8 year old granddaughter.
I first saw this movie on TV, back in the late 60s, and I hadn't forgot the joyful impact it had on me, so what a delight that my granddaughter had the same reaction. Fortunately, she won't have to wait another 40+ years to see it again.
The only drawback of this DVDR is that the print used was not in the greatest shape. I have bought many of the MOD movies and have been very happy with all of them, but the one used here is a little darker than most and with a lot of speckling throughout. The sound was fine, but for a 'B' movie of this caliber, I really wish they would have found a better print.
The bottom line is that I'm very happy just to be able to watch this film again, anytime I want.
I would love to see this movie connect with a newer generation and become better known.
It truly deserves it.",1381795200,28,1318,4.172549019607843
5985025,5,B00FERT1TU,"""You Can Never Tell"" is a one-of-a-kind dog and pony detective tale that is as heartwarming and joyful as anything Frank Capra ever directed.  Director Lou Breslow, best known for his work with the Three Stooges, in in rare form here.  This is one of those delightful films you caught once on TV and fell in love with immediately.  I only wonder what took them so long to put it out.  The synopsis above is sufficient to inform the uninitiated and let them begin a riotous romp in what must be one of the most charming films ever concocted.  For me, it is one of those ""holy grail"" movies that I have been searching for for decades.  If your tastes run to films like ""Topper"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""You Can't Take it With You"", you'll love this one.",1380153600,17,778,4.405594405594406

5985112,5,B00FERT1TU,"If you buy only one of these overpriced Universal MODs, buy this one! If you buy two buy ""If I Were King"", but that is another story. I'd like to think that Dick Powell was wealthy enough by 1951 that he could largely pick his projects, because this one is a gem of Dick Powell parodying the Dick Powell private investigators  of the noirs. He plays a German Shepherd dog who inherits a large fortune from an eccentric owner and then is murdered by poison. When he arrives in Animal Heaven he says he knows who the murderer is and wants time back on earth to bring the murderer to justice. It's nor juar his untimely death that requires justice, though, because his kindly keeper was next in line for the estate, and down on earth she is suspect number one, so he also wants to clear her name in the process. He is given that chance, but he must return to Animal Heaven by the new moon or forever remain a ""Humanimal"" - human in form, animal in nature. To become a humanimal and return to earth not knowing that you are one is the punishment of bad animals. Rex will return knowing his state and his mission. He is given a deceased Kentucky race horse as his companion and helper on his mission.

It's just hilarious seeing Dick Powell sitting in a PI office as Rex Shepherd, talking like Philip Marlowe and nibbling on dog kibble instead of peanuts. Goldie, his human-horse companion, has hat styles that are pure palomino. The murderer is no mystery - you learn the identity pretty much up front. The trick is catching the perpetrator. Also, as a human, Rex finds he is having new rather confusing feelings for the woman who was his keeper during his life as a dog. How can this all work out and not bust the production code? Watch and find out.

Let me also say that the transfer is outstanding. All I have seen in the past are poor VHS transfers from TV airings. This one is worth going back to again and again for the hilarity and the magic of it all.",1417219200,2,1956,4.33879781420765

The notice I got from Amazon that it was available (in answer to a request I made in 2007) was really exciting and I ordered it right away.  This is a whimsical comedy and Dick Powell did a great job in it.  I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1951 or 52.  Do not remember exactly for obvious reasons.  My only disappointment was that some of the scenes I remembered were not there.  I will watch it over again and look very hard for the scene where Dick starts to follow Peggy into her bathroom for a bath as he did when he was her dog.

5985143,5,B00FERT1TU,This is one that is a perfect crazy comedy. Dick Powell is incredibly funny as a murdered canine who come back as a PI to see justice. Nothing like watching him chow down on his bag of kibble while being the consummate tough guy.,1404172800,,229,4.2272727272727275

5985205,4,B00FERT1TU,"I first saw this movie on TV when I was around 10 years old, back in 1966-1967.  I don't remember many of the movies I saw back then but for some reason the ending stayed with me, the woman running up the moonbeam to become a horse.  But I could not remember the name!  A while back I started searching on the Internet and at last I found it.

I would really like to see a remake of this movie as its premise is unique.  A dog inherits millions, is poisoned, and goes up to heaven (Beastatory) where he meets the King of Beastatory (a lion) who explains the rules of animal afterlife to him.  The dog says that he wants to go back to earth to clear his mistress' name because she was falsely accused of poisoning him.  The lion says yes, he can go back, but under certain conditions.  He then assigns a former racehorse to be the dog's assistant.  The two return to earth, disguised as humans, to solve the case.

Even by 1951 special effects standards the Beastatory scenes are pretty crude which indicates that the producers probably didn't have much of a budget.  But don't let that put you off.  This is a charming story which really deserves a second look.",1391299200,3,1161,4.324074074074074

It's a great little movie and a hoot to watch. Considering when it was filmed, the FXs are first rate for the time.
