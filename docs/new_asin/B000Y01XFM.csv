This dvd was suggested to me by an experienced picker and I enjoy the challenge. I have all four dvd's. For the price of a lesson, how can you go wrong..",1379462400,,287,4.052631578947368
8230450,5,B000Y01XFM,"For anyone who is thinking of learning the banjo or anyone who has been trying to learn the banjo, you can't go wrong with The Murphy Method. This ""tablature free"" approach will have you playing in no time, and it also trains for long-term progress. Tablature is so frustrating to me, and I can't find the time/budget to pay for private lessons right now. To me, this is like having an instructor at your fingertips any time of day. The one downside (obviously) is that you don't have someone to tell you if your technique is wrong.

Jam Session Standards specifically has some fantastic tunes that are all fairly easy to learn. I believe this falls into their ""intermediate"" category of learning, but I didn't have too much trouble picking it up after playing for about a year. And there you have it!",1313366400,3,801,4.601398601398602
