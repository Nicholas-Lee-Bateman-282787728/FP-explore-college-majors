7809758,4,6301069005,"Not the least bit sophisticated or classy & quite lacking in production values. But the slapstick works & it really made me laugh, again & again. It was very enjoyable & good-hearted.",1198800000,,183,4.75
7809759,3,6301069005,"This movie has got to be the worst over-acted movie I have ever seen.  The scenery gets all three stars.

Don't bother unless you get it at a garage sale or have time to waste",1135209600,,175,3.9714285714285715

7809761,5,6301069005,"They didn't want this movie to be funny, well, THAT funny anyways. It was hilarious.  Stupid. Bad acting. Terrible plot. The works. It was downright foolish.  But, it was still hilarious.
I'll give you a little insight on what you're getting into. A little monkey befriends a little kid. Only the monkey, no doubt portrayed by a midget in a costume, talks. That's right, he talks. The end of the film is simply pee-your-pants hilarious when the monkey flies off a dock and jumps onto the boys boat, all the while yelling the kids name and screaming: ""Biiiiiiilly!""
A downright pee-on-yourself film fest. Enjoy.",1032220800,,610,4.855769230769231
