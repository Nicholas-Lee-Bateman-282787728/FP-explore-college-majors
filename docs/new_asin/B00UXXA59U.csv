7071801,5,B00UXXA59U,Definitely a great anime. The animation itself looks great. The soundtrack oozes quality and has some catchy tunes. The best part of the cartoon is the world and the characters involved. Even fringe characters have great amounts of depth and background. I looked forward to this release for a while and it definitely didn't disappoint. The DUB is pretty good as well.,1435708800,,367,4.935483870967742
7071802,5,B00UXXA59U,"4 1/2 STARS -- FOR A BEAUTIFUL AND FUN ANIME WITH SOME COMPLEX STORY ARCS

SEE NOTES ON JAPANESE vs. ENGLISH DUB BELOW

Tokyo Ravens is a terrific anime centered around the use of magic and casting spells, with a romance at its center of course. The art is beautiful and the main characters are well fleshed out (some minor characters could be more developed). The story arcs are nicely complex and a lot of characters, invented magic terms, and mysteries are thrown out to the viewer so it can require a little concentration at times. For me that was a plus because I enjoy anime with a lot of thought put into it. That aside, this one still has no problem staying light and fun thanks to some great characters.

THE PLOT (no spoilers): Harutora is a member of a branch of the famous Tsuchimikado family which was a founding member of Onmyo Magic. Unfortunately he seems to have no aptitude for magic like his ancestors and just wants to be around great friends and have fun. The story opens as he hangs out with Touji, his best bud, and Hakuto the young girl he thinks of as just a friend. They affectionately call him ""baka-Tora"" (stupid-Tora as a take on his real name Harutora) for his goofy and good natured personality. Naturally, Touji is the only one that seems to really understand everything that is going on between the two. However, another female childhood friend named Natsume re-enters Harutora's life and things get complicated. Natsume is the heir to the main branch of the Tsuchimikado family itself and its next head. It is even said she is the reincarnation of the very founder Yakou. Ultimately, Harutora will return with Natsume to Onmyo Prep school to pursue his magic studies. Together with friends old and new, Harutora's circle will be caught up in cataclysmic power struggles between magical organizations. There are continual battles of magic, both real and those held in practice at the school arena. Harutora will have to sort out his feelings while progressing along his own journey of self discovery. Many other characters have their own strange secrets to be revealed.

It is a tale of conflicting organizations such as the Onmyo Magic Investigation Agency that is supposed to protect, and the Twin Horn Syndicate with its creepy and enigmatic ""D"". It is also a tale of three powerful clans that founded Onmyo Magic, led by Tsuchimikado but including Kurahashi and Souma. Besides the lead characters, there are many others that are very memorable. Suzuka Dairenji (the prodigy) is the youngest of the Twelve Divine Generals and has this ominous whistle tune that plays in the background when she arrives (a take on Ennio Morricone music from the Fist Full of Dollars films). I love that tune and she's hilarious! Kon is a little fox spirit type familiar for Harutora that is adorable. The list goes on.

JAPANESE vs. ENGLISH DUB: On the DVD/Blu-Ray version, you have your choice of original Japanese or the English Dub. On Amazon Streaming, you have to choose on or the other separately. Overall I was pretty impressed with the English version and the voice acting was quite good. However, there are naturally some trade offs. Some characters, though acted well, loose some of their characteristic personalities in the English versions. Touji is less edgy (as in cool) than the Japanese version, and both he and Natsume have slightly more mature voices. Kon the familiar however is pretty much dead on with her counterpart. For personalities sake, I prefer the Japanese version. However, there are so many invented magical terms, organizations, story arcs, personalities, and relationship nuances thrown out that I found the English version far easier to absorb what is going on, and I am a Japanese speaker. The script from the English dub also differs in minor ways from the script on the English subtitle version and it makes if flow a little better (visual image is unchanged). This is possible because the English dub does not have to match Japanese simultaneously as the subtitles do. The translation in general is quite good and the English dub keeps it very colloquial to match the appropriate slang here and there. I can't guarantee it matches everyone's taste, but this is definitely a high quality anime!",1427673600,11,4249,4.855172413793103

8708686,4,B00UXXA59U,This review is for Part 1 and 2. Tokyo Ravens has a good storyline with interesting characters and character development. The story is 99% complete for me since it doesn't exactly end with a cliffhanger but rather a sort of dream maybe not a dream kinda ending. If you like mage characters and spells I think you will enjoy this series. Its realistic (as you can get) and keeps your interest throughout the show with a few unpredictable turns and action. There is some romance but its one of those teen angst types where no one says they like each other until way later. However that doesn't detract from how genuine everyone's feelings are for each other. The dub is good; lots of familiar voices. Good artwork and since its more than 12 episodes Id say its worth watching.,1443571200,3,774,4.575539568345324
