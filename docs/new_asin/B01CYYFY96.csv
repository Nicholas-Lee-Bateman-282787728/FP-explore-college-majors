7694753,4,B01CYYFY96,"Great to have it on DVD. While not as good of resolution as a Blu-ray, it is miles ahead of the VHS copies I had. Really glad to finally have this!",1465171200,3,147,3.774193548387097
7694754,5,B01CYYFY96,"I loved this show when it first came out and I'm ecstatic that it has finally come out on DVD.  I wasn't able to see all of the episodes due to frequent traveling, so it was really pleasing to see some of these episodes for the first time.  I'm a fan of martial arts shows and Jeffrey Meek shows off his talents as a martial artist in this action packed series.  Added flare and comedy is added with the addition of Lee Majors as his close friend.  If you are interested in an action packed martial art series, then Raven the 1992 TV series is for you.  Highly recommended!",1464480000,15,573,4.220183486238532
7694755,4,B01CYYFY96,A classic series. FYI DVD is region locked so you will need a region free player or computer to watch.,1463702400,9,102,4.15
7694756,4,B01CYYFY96,"I've only watched the pilot so far but the picture and sound quality are great. Lots of ninja action,sunny Hawaiian setting and Lee Majors as Ravens scruffy heavy drinking private detective sidekick. I docked 1 star because of the DVD casing. The clasps that are suppose to hold the DVD's in place are too small and thin. The DVD's were loose in the case when it arrived. Luckily none of them were damaged.",1461628800,8,406,4.575342465753424

7694760,5,B01CYYFY96,This show was way ahead of its time for 1992. Sadly it only ran one season as the last half of the series strayed away from storyline of a ninja hunted by other ninjas and became more of a Private Investigator with martial art skills.,1497744000,,234,4.222222222222222

with Lynne Ellen Hollinger.",1496707200,,59,5.666666666666667
7694763,5,B01CYYFY96,"Excellent series that I had not seen since 1997, is just 20 years old.

For years I was hoping the release of Raven in DVD, in addition to the excellent CD with the soundtrack of the series, published in the early 2000's.

What's more, just that this show is beautiful and blithely crosses over time without a wrinkle. The stories are always also stakeholders, very fair actors, the grandiose and always as aggressive karate scenes, not to mention the very successful additional music of Christopher Franke who bring an undeniable charm to these adventures hectic and sunny.

Kind of a must !",1493337600,2,592,4.784313725490196
7694764,4,B01CYYFY96,"Ha there my friends, . .

I definitely had my doubts, as some of you might, if this was the real deal or a glorified Bootleg or just a shotty transfer that wouldn't be worth the money.

But too my surprise this is a very sharp and high quality DVD, as one would expect from Sony Entertainment.  Unfortunately, not much here except very bare bones ( not even a simple 'Raven' menu screen ) which is why I gave it 4 stars.

But just to have the fun / action packed series finally on a nice-grade DVD is quite exciting and lets be honest some of us have shelled out big money just for the ""Return of the Black Dragons"" Raven movie on VHS at one time or another.

Is this the DVD that Raven deserves, . . . No, not at all.  I'm sure most big fans like myself would have loved commentary from Jeff Meek and Lee Majors, as well as some behind the scenes stuff, tv interviews, cut scenes and bloopers. So even though the series is intact and looks very nice, this seems like a generic rush job by Sony too get the series out on it's 25th Anniversary.

So I can only hope in the future Raven gets better treatment. But this still is a good buy if you love the short lived series.",1489104000,8,1171,4.0873362445414845
7694765,4,B01CYYFY96,"It is not a bad series, but not quite the acting from Lee Majors! I find him not the actor he used to be.",1486857600,,105,3.4166666666666665
7694766,5,B01CYYFY96,Jeffrey Meek was outstanding in this action/drama. Too bad the writing wasn't better. Very good martial arts and Jeffery did a great deal of his fighting. Impressive. Check it out!,1486080000,2,180,5.033333333333333
7694767,5,B01CYYFY96,Big fan of the show.  Wish CBS had given it more support.,1485216000,2,57,3.75
7694768,4,B01CYYFY96,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD TV SERIES DVD.  IF YOU LIKE MARTIAL ARTS, YOU'LL LOVE THIS SERIES.  THE ONLY ONLY FAULT IS THERE IS
NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES FOR THE HARD OF HEARING.",1482451200,,165,4.125
7694769,5,B01CYYFY96,I have been waiting forever for this series to come on on dvd,1480982400,,61,3.769230769230769
7694770,5,B01CYYFY96,"I enjoy this series when it was on, and was disappointed when it was canceled. So when I saw the series was on DVD, I just had to have it.",1478822400,2,138,3.6333333333333333
7694771,5,B01CYYFY96,"It is what it is. It's pretty much as I expected. I caught a couple of episodes when it was on TV, I thought i would give it a whirl, It's like Miami Vice in Hawaii with Ninja's....LOL What's not to like? DVD-R's look and sound good to me. I have modern TV shows that don't look or sound as good as this 90's TV show on DVD-R. Even some pretty cool guest stars thru the series, people who were not famous then but are now. Enjoy!",1475798400,9,429,3.942528735632184

7694774,3,B01CYYFY96,I gave this one only 3 stars as I feel the picture quality could have been a lot better.,1469491200,,88,3.6842105263157894
7694775,5,B01CYYFY96,I loved the series & waited a long time for it to make it on Dvd ! The Cost was a little steep!!!!! But I PURCHASED IT ANYWAY! I was one of the ones who signed a petition & talked to one of the people who was involved in its restoration !!!,1468800000,7,240,3.6346153846153846
7694776,3,B01CYYFY96,"LOVED this show growing up. I have literally been looking for this on DVD since 1993. Imagine my shock when after years of searching, I found it! DVD series came quickly, was in great condition and plays well. So maybe the way I remember this show isn't quite as good as I remember it, but it's still great!",1467504000,2,307,4.310344827586207
8754387,5,B01CYYFY96,Awesome memories from my teen years!!! Love that show! It has a lot of martial art action. The principal actor is a real martial artist with black belts in Tae Kwon Do and Aikido.,1537228800,,179,4.294117647058823
8754388,5,B01CYYFY96,"I am so... happy that they released the complete series on DVD I loved this show when it was on CBS and watched it religiously.  Great mix of action, drama, and hot chicks (probably not politically correct these days) very happy with my purchase.  As for the quality of the DVDs could be a bit better but definitely is watchable.",1527120000,,329,4.466666666666667
8754389,3,B01CYYFY96,Ok,1524182400,,2,2.0
8754390,5,B01CYYFY96,Great DVD. I remember watching this back in the early 90s. Full of martial arts & philosophical quotes.,1523750400,,103,4.777777777777778
8754391,4,B01CYYFY96,"This show is very much an artifact of its time and is heavily influenced by previous TV hits written, created & produced by Stephen J. Cannell (ROCKFORD, A-TEAM etc) and Glen A. Larson (MAGNUM PI, SWITCH)...which is no surprise, since RAVEN writer/creator Frank Lupo worked for them both for many years. RAVEN is pure, escapist fun that doesn't take itself too seriously (in fact, its much better than I remembered it). And Lee Majors is terrific in a supporting role -- his first after a string of hits as a leading man in action-adventure shows. Majors pretty much stole the show from Meek, which wasn't too hard. Meek was likeable, and a talented martial artist, but didn't have much charisma. Nobody would mistake him for the next Tom Selleck, James Garner, or even Lee Majors (in his glory days). Even so, I'm surprised the series didn't last longer...perhaps it was a matter of timing, hitting the scene just as this style of television was becoming dated and stale (at least for the time being). This was Meek's second attempt at TV stardom (having previously starred in the short-lived latenight series THE EXILE) and would have one more failed shot (MORTAL CONQUEST) before the networks gave up on him as a series lead. The DVD transfer is slick and sharp.",1523059200,2,1265,4.780821917808219
8754392,4,B01CYYFY96,The picture quality is fine. A lot better than VHS quality DVDs that was only available before. It says on the back cover that it only has a Mono track. I feared that is was correct and they didn't use the original Stereo track. It was wrong. It does have the Stereo track. I used it on my Onkyo receiver and the upmixer function PL2 Movie. It takes a Stereo track and simulates it to a 5.1 surround track. It sounds good.,1513123200,,422,4.158536585365853
