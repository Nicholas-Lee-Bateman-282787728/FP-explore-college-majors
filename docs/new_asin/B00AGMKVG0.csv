8551456,5,B00AGMKVG0,Nice price and easy enough my 8 year old was able to follow the moves. An overhead view would probably have helped. A nice intro to break dancing. Don't spend a lot of money until you can see how committed you are. This is a good start.,1491177600,,236,4.042553191489362

8551458,5,B00AGMKVG0,"After watching the video, I was truly impressed by the time and attention to detail. Each move was well explained. The moves were shown slow enough and with front and back views to teach anyone how to dance each move correctly.

As a dancer myself, I enjoyed learning new, cool moves to use out in the clubs. However, what was most exciting to me, was to see a friend of mine learn the moves quickly and easily. He's not much of a dancer and was hesitant to even try the video. He was amazed at how well he was learning to dance. For a man who always found an excuse not to go out dancing with us, he is so ready to go to the club now!

An amazing product! I highly recommend it to dancers of all levels.",1391299200,2,704,4.057553956834532
