With her daughter, Xanna, she displayed intense knowledge about exercising with the big yoga ball in a very white windowless studio. The mother and daughter team do a terrific job in conveying information and enlightening audiences in a two brief workouts. They practice what they preach. Charlene Prickett has been a fitness pioneer and champion in bringing exercise, nutrition and common sense to audiences worldwide.

I wished Charlene Prickett who had a television series, ""It Figures,"" in Canada and America on lifetime television network from the 1970s to the 1990s would come back again. She looks fabulous at her age here. Her daughter, Xanna, is a university graduate with a degree in Kinesiology. I often remember her with her mother in the series as well. They work well together not just as mother and daughter but as colleagues.",1524096000,,917,5.072847682119205

I have been using her videos and DVDs for years, and she is the only instructor who consistently puts together a routine where I will work hard, break a sweat, and have fun at the same time.  She gives awesome cues and provides valuable health information.  Her warm personality comes right through.  She needs to make more DVDs!  Charlene rocks!",1256342400,4,393,4.893939393939394
