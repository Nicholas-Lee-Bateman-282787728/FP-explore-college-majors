6648840,1,B00NG3ZDBY,"From the Strangers to this?  Much like its predecessor, Mockingbird deals with the home invasion sub genre only this time instead of being based on a simple premise and downright terrifying, it's implausible writing, and characters make it an unwatchable farce.  Several different people get a ""present"" in the form of a videocamera left on their doorsteps and all of them idiotically begin filming themselves unabashedly.  And that's before it gets stupid.  Just @#@%# me with a chainsaw already.  This is pure nonsense.",1414195200,,521,5.228915662650603
6648841,2,B00NG3ZDBY,"Mockingbird is a recent release by the same director of Strangers. This time, various strangers play a game while recording every moment on a video camera or else they will die. I expected a Saw-like film, but instead it played more like Strangers 2. There are some effective moments and some good acting. But the story has some flaws in logical character reaction that Bertino was smart enough to cover in The Strangers. Watchable film, but nothing spectacular.",1413849600,,462,4.935897435897436
6648842,2,B00NG3ZDBY,"This is another bad hand held camera film. It uses dark scenes with people talking for those who prefer to watch radio. Oh the realism!

The film opens with us watching a child getting shot in the head. It jumps to three people getting a camera delivered to their door: a family (Todd Stashwick/Lee Garlington), a single girl (Audrey Marie Anderson), and Leonard (Barak Hardley). They all enjoy their new prize: a camera that doesn't shut off and seems to have an infinite powered battery. They get subsequent instructions that delve into their personalities and fears. The family fear for their kids, the woman is alone and fears she will not be liked, and Leonard looks for a life outside of his mother and hand.

Leonard gets a clown suit, i.e. the guy on the cover. The idea was interesting enough, even with the fact there was no closure. The problem I had was the poor execution. Everything was done through the jerky dark movements of the camera. The script was for the most part boring, in part due to said cameras. When the screen goes dark, it becomes a film I could make myself and certainly compose better dialogue.

If you love the hand held cameras, and don't care about closure, this is your film. I liked the ending. I didn't like the way it got there.

Parental Guide; F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1413676800,2,1311,4.56595744680851
6648843,5,B00NG3ZDBY,"Amazing! Kept me interested and nervous the entire time- would love to see this on the big screen. The ""family"" was my fav-

6648845,1,B00NG3ZDBY,"Insanely idiotic garbage about three sets of people who receive a camcorder which they all think is a prize from some sweepstakes even though it was found sitting on their doorsteps instead of delivered by the post office or UPS.  They all start taping themselves (including the single girl living alone who gets a camera) because that's apparently what people do when you give them a camera--they start filming everything like they're in a Paranormal Activity movie.

There are cards with the cameras that say keep filming but that leads to one of the many problems in logic in Mockingbird--since this takes place in 1995 these camcorders use tapes--why don't the characters who are doing hours and hours of taping ever run out of tape?  Why don't they ever change the tapes?  Keep in mind that initially all of the characters think these are normal consumer camcorders that they won.  Eventually the characters receive a creepy VHS tape that ends with a boy getting his brains blown out and they are told if they don't play the game or if they contact the cops the same thing will happen to them.  They are supposed to solve clues which don't actually exist in the movie which eventually leads them all to the same address.

All of the characters in Mockingbird are incredibly irritating in the way characters in camcorder horror movies almost always are so it's impossible to care what happens to any of them.  For the ending to happen the way the the villains want the characters all have to act in the most irrational and idiotic way possible--if they didn't everyone in the movie would survive.  The characters oblige with blind stupidity because they're stuck in a stupid movie and have to do what the stupid script says but man is it painful to sit through this one to the end.  The final twist where you find out who is behind everything made no sense whatsoever--not only is it completely nonsensical it's also impossible from a practical point of view--but the rest of the movie is so bad it's really pointless to complain about the head-scratching ending.  It is possible the ending is a nod to Sinister, but that's probably giving the filmmakers too much credit.

Mockingbird is part of Jason Blum's straight-to-video deal with Universal.  He's the producer of low budget horror like Sinister and The Purge films.  Hopefully Mockingbird isn't indicative of the quality of his future straight-to-video fare.  If it is Universal should ask for its money back because they shouldn't be putting their studio logo onto something this bad.",1412985600,3,2546,4.8341013824884795

6648847,4,B00NG3ZDBY,"I didn't want to watch this but they made me.  I started to squirm from the beginning and didn't stop until the end.  If you like horror films, this will not disappoint.  If you are a coward like me, watch in the presence of others but do watch just for the dark beauty of some scenes.",1412812800,5,285,4.053571428571429
6648848,4,B00NG3ZDBY,"For about a half hour stretch in the second ""act"" of this found footage suspense-horror (I know, stay with me), the film manages to get the tension ratcheted up so high, every slight movement and sound in the film threatens to snap you in half. It's the kind of flick that isn't content to throw what I call ""point blank shocks"" at viewers, instead waiting to spring jump scares on its audience after mounting the suspense for a relentless period, begging for release. It's a flawed film that reaches some frantic heights and I'd recommend it to any horror fan I know. Is $18--as of 8 Oct 2014--a little much to pay for a digital rental? Obviously. But if you have the time to spare and like films that'll dig their way under your skin for ninety minutes, Mockingbird has a mischievous heart, believably panicked but genre-savvy, cautious characters, a great series of baited-breath surprises and--save for a few minutes near the end when the movie's validity is called into question by a final-act twist--doesn't let its audience out of its tight-fisted grip until the credits roll.",1412726400,14,1083,4.7967914438502675

6648850,4,B00NG3ZDBY,"Yes, finally a microbudget horror movie I can recommend! I don't like to provide any spoilers, and it's critical - especially - in this film that no one give you any hints or ""nudges"" as to what's going on... with that said, this one's absolutely unique and a cut above the glut of found footage horror on the market today. I absolutely recommend this one.",1416528000,3,356,4.492307692307692
6648851,5,B00NG3ZDBY,"This is an experiment, but an experiment with solid results. The filmmakers take the constraints of found footage movies and push them to the limits. The idea of weaving different stories together, all within the same plot constraints works pretty well and has some pretty creepy results. This film is gritty, and raw, and above all it has a sense of realism that is sadly missing from most found footage movies.",1415577600,,412,4.816901408450704
6648852,1,B00NG3ZDBY,Dont waste your time. Its a first person crap fest with people that don't behave anything like real people would in a situation like this.

6648853,1,B00NG3ZDBY,"This film started out looking about average for a found footage offering, but it's potential score diminished steadily with each passing scene. When these films can do a possible job progressing towards the final act, the ""payoff"" typically determines whether the film was with the time and effort.  For Mockingbird, the ridiculously dumb ending forfeits any chance at redemption.

Total waste of time.",1415232000,,402,5.365079365079365

6648855,1,B00NG3ZDBY,"1.  Unlike the majority of my friends, I LOVED The Strangers.  I find it impossible to believe this came from the same person.

2.  This is NOT a found footage film, I noticed that term was used in other reviews.

3.  Regardless of what kind of footage it is, it's one of the most cheaply made and boring horror films I've seen this season and I watch at least one new movie every day.  (between Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and sometimes via rental - I'm not rich, unfortunately)  Films fall into two categories for me - multitasking deterrent or multitasking encouragement.  Mockingbird created a category of it's own - multitasking inspiration.

On an unrelated note ... People - PLEASE stop posting reviews that tell us what happens in the dang movie!!!  Go read some reviews for reference if need be, try rotten tomatoes on for size.  Merriam Webster should help as well:

review noun \ri-vy\
: an act of carefully looking at or examining the quality or condition of something or someone : examination or inspection
: a report that gives someone's opinion about the quality of a book, performance, product, etc.",1414713600,2,1116,4.75
6648856,1,B00NG3ZDBY,Terrible.  OnE of the worst movies I have ever seen.,1414540800,,52,4.2
6648857,2,B00NG3ZDBY,"Found Footage. It's getting old. There are a lot of reasons why, but high up on the list is the acrobatic exposition required to explain why Regular Joes are filming this stuff to begin with, leading to Found Footage Rule #1: someone, at some point, has to complain about the camera. In case you're wondering, Found Footage Rules #2-88 are all about how you don't need good dialogue, good framing, good characters, good plotting, or even a decent story. Because the difference between found footage and regular movies is the difference between a novel with an omniscient, third-person narrator versus one written from the first-person point of view. I'm not saying one is better than the other, but I am saying that one requires a LOT less skill, because any flaws in the story can be chalked up to flaws in the character who's telling it.

MOCKINGBIRD isn't a smart film, but it is smart enough to deal with the basic found footage logistics from the get-go. At the start of the film, red boxes with white bows appear on three different doorsteps, each containing video cameras that can't be turned off (apparently they also have endless battery power). At first, all of the recipients (a college girl, a young couple, and a loser-ish dude who lives with his mom) believe they've been chosen for some sort of reality competition (there's a lot of talk about filling out applications for contest forms), but it quickly becomes clear that something a lot more sinister is at work than your average reality TV show. In other words, it's really, really sinister.

Is it scary? Meh. There are a lot of moments designed to be spooky, but the creepiness is diluted by how clearly orchestrated everything is. In other words, it's not that scary because it's trying so hard to be scary. Consider a moment seen in the trailer: the college girl weeps in terror while, unknown to her, a hand with a knife waves over her head from an open window. Ooooh! But nothing comes of it, and it's pretty clear that -- like every single spook in the movie -- it's only done for effect. Our baddies, in other words, are more about mental torture than anything else, and since they're not very creative about it, it quickly gets old.

Probably the most common flaw among horror films is that they so rarely stick the landing; many figure out how to keep you on the edge of your seat, but so few know how to tie everything up in a way that is both disturbing AND intelligent. (This is probably because it's a lot easier to make scary moments than it is to come up with scary story arcs.) However, this flick's ending isn't just a letdown: it's so idiotic and forced that it turns what could've been a passingly fun flick into a 90-minute punchline. This is bad for a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is that there's no real build up to the film. You're only pulled along by the mystery of what powerful individual or group is orchestrating all of this complex lunacy (they're seemingly omnipresent, capable of messing with phone lines and circuit breakers, blasting creepy megaphone recordings from front yards without ever drawing the attention of neighbors or cops, able to pound on windows and doors and disappear within seconds). The climax is hardly a surprise -- it's actually kind of a relief, given how painfully it's foreshadowed -- but the final reveal (the final twenty seconds, really) make the whole story so stupid that not even kids would buy it, which is ironic, considering that the death of a child is what starts the whole stupid mess.

Here's my final thought: If you want to make a scary movie, before you send out your final edit, you should relive the story from the mind of the bad guy. Don't just imagine why they did it; think about every action and reaction that had to go into them creating this kind of horror. If you do that with this film, you'll realize even more painfully how ridiculous the entire thing is. If you're drunk or high on Halloween candy, this movie might do for a bit, but any serious fan of horror will leave the story feeling insulted.",1414368000,,4063,4.607734806629834
6648858,3,B00NG3ZDBY,"Why?!  Why must every movie these days attempt to give us a twist that is so insane you can't believe it?!  Unfortunately, Mockingbird does this and completely fails in every way possible (in my opinion)!  There are numerous things in the movie that make for a totally unbelievable experience, but they can be overlooked.  I mean, how many people (even the ones with a land line) don't have cell phones today?!  Again, a few of those things can be overlooked.  However, the final act,....CAN NOT be!  It is so broken and not even remotely thought out that I can no longer (after REALLY enjoying the bulk of this movie) recommend this film to anyone.  Man, what a total disappointment.

The reason I didn't give this movie a single star was because for an hour and 15 minutes I really liked it!  On top of that, the acting is top of the line!!!!  I honestly can't understand why movie studios these days waste so much money on actors that no one even cares to see instead of getting actors of this caliber.  Unfortunate (once again) the ending completely ruins it all!

This film with its jerky scenes ala THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is almost as bad as the home movie that appears to have been shot with a cell phone camera -- THE MOTHMAN CURSE. My girl friend left the room and I waited it out to justify buying it. I kept hoping that it would make sense -- that we would learn what the boy shot in the head in the beginning has to do with the rest of the cast. Who shot him and why? And how is he related to the youngsters shown at the end in the house of balloons? Are they getting revenge on all of the other characters? If so, why? Are they ghosts -- supernatural beings? Should we call in Sam and Dean from the show SUPERNATURAL?
