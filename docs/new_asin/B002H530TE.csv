It is a recording from TV and the DVD production appears to be amateur, however this movie is not available in any other format as far as I could determine. I had trouble with the first DVD I received but the seller was prompt in sending a replacement. It would be great if this movie were commercially available in a high resolution format. There are not many good movies about age different relationships, this one stands out and is a classic.",1354924800,4,505,4.56043956043956

It's also about 1950s New York and its legendary garment district, which then still held considerable sway in the fashion world.  The May-December romance portrayed in this film is nothing new, and it has been and will be played out in endless others.  But the signts and sounds of the city are what really catch your attention.

Ah, New York---people all around the world may try to eclipse its gritty glamour but no one anywhere will ever be able to top it.  Through its glorious art venues and entertaining theater life, its splendid architecture and public spaces, and its savvy and eclectic populace, NYC has already forgotten more than other urban contenders will ever have a chance to create.

If only this film were available thru Amazon!

View it for Novak and March, but don't bypass the story of the city played out here.",1293494400,6,894,4.766233766233766
8370185,3,B002H530TE,"This film was too New Yorkish and too much like a Studio 0ne televison play for me. It`s about the romance between a young woman (KIM) and an older man (MARCH). So, who cares already? Rather dull by today`s standards.  Good acting and well written for what it is. To me it`s a woman`s film that was just added to the collection for filler?
Understandably it was not well received at the box office.",1286064000,,398,4.378378378378378
8370186,5,B002H530TE,"It is a real mystery, wrapped in a puzzle, inside a conundrum that this great film is so inaccessible to those who love a terrific story, well-acted, written by one of the most gifted play and screen writers of his day, Paddy Chayefsky. Fredric March and Kim Novak give consummate performances that are so rich in both feeling and shading,so realistic,that the viewer is transported to a different time and dimension. This film is universal in its insight of aging widowers who still long for the closeness of female companionship and emotional release. Filmed in the 50's in black and white, the story is given its grainier edge and starkness. One would hope that ""Middle of the Night"" will be re-released to a wider audience, particularly for the benefit of aspiring young actors so that they can see for themselves what the defintion of superb acting really is.",1271548800,13,864,4.844594594594595
