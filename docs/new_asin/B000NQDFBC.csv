8180995,4,B000NQDFBC,"Although this would not be my ultimate set it is a very good one. Up front let me say I have not bought this set but was wondering about it. I took a close look and saw that I have most these movies and have seen the rest. If you don't already own these movies it is a great buy. If you figure the movies are worth at least ten dollars a piece you can see that you are certainly getting your moneys worth. Some are down right excellent movies and others aren't bad. I don't recall a one in the bunch being a stinker so you can't go wrong. I recommend it to anyone that is just getting their DVD library started. The set includes ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Misery"", ""Fargo"", ""Manhunter"", ""Hannibal"", ""Kalifornia"", ""Eye of the Needle"", ""House of Games"", ""Gangster No. 1"", ""The January Man"", ""Malice"", ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Special Effects"", and ""Dead Man Walking"". Check the individual reviews on these and you will see it is a good set. The only movie I wasn't impressed with was ""Special Effects"".",1186444800,5,995,4.472527472527473
