Import-Latin America</a>] LA AMANTE PERFECTA (THE PERFECT LOVER) IS A GEM FROM MEXICAN CINEMA!!
Produced and filmed in 1969 it stars the EXCELLENT LEADING LADY MISS FANNY CANO in a dramatic role that pushes the envelope for the changing times during the '60s. Mayra (Ms. Cano) is a beautiful exotic dancer that stops at nothing to make a living,sells her body at night. Little does she know the day will come when she will have to sell her soul too. A rich man (played by the EQUALY EXCELLENT Mr. GUILLERMO MURRAY) offers Mayra to role-play into his world of fantasies only to drag her deeper into a psychological & disturbing reality of deceit. BE WARNED: DEFINITELLY FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY!! On the technical side the DVD transfer is excellent & the color of the film is bright & sharp.",1309910400,,1005,5.706666666666667
