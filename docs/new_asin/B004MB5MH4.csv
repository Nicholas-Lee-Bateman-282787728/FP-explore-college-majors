4429569,5,B004MB5MH4,Beautiful! Well done & presented. Very informative and insighful into the world of cloistered religious life and in particular the Carmelites.,1337558400,2,142,5.809523809523809
4429570,5,B004MB5MH4,"I so much appreciated the way this video was made. It really shows the silence in the Carmelite nunnery.
My father's aunt was a nun in a Carmelite nunnery in Birmingham, where I visited her once.
It's very special for me to watch this video and get a more complete picture of the life of my relative.
Amazing that a man was allowed to visit the inner parts of this nunnery to tell the world about the life inside.",1323129600,8,413,4.2405063291139244
4429571,5,B004MB5MH4,"Our world is full of noise and many things that try to pass themselves off as depth when in fact they are often nothing more than trendy and fog.  I think the way these women chose to talk about their way of life reflected a longing most people have for meaning but are distracted from finding in the flash and glare of post modern living.  It certianly is not a life for everyone but I think that the way the film presented their life, it had something to offer anyone wondering what this modern fuss is all about in the long run.",1323129600,4,531,4.196078431372549
4429572,5,B004MB5MH4,"Stunning! Anyone who considers religious life must see this. There is no need for ""sales talk"".All one has to do is witness the joy,order, and continuous life of prayer and support among the sisters to understand what holiness and comittment to a monastic life is.",1321056000,39,264,4.888888888888889
4429573,5,B004MB5MH4,"This documentary gives a rare glimpse into the lives of nuns in an enclosed monastery.  You feel as though you are there with them.  I have watched this video over and over and enjoy it every single time.  I especially love the bonus interviews! Very uplifting and inspiring.  Makes one realize that there is always time for prayer.  If you have ever wondered how nuns live out their vocations, this is a must see film for you.  On a scale from 1 to 10, I would have to rate this film 10+!  Wonderful!",1318636800,24,501,4.32258064516129
4429574,5,B004MB5MH4,This is an excellent insight to a beautiful vocation and life style.  Wish more people would take the challenge.,1312502400,5,112,4.894736842105263
4429575,4,B004MB5MH4,"One of the cloistered nuns of the Carmelite Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity, Notting Hill, London, spoke poignantly about the silence that is deliberately created there as a way to bring the sisters into closer communion with God. Except for two recreation periods a day (during which some kind of work is usually still done) and the set times of community prayer and Mass, the nuns don't speak out loud without real necessity. So this documentary -- very much in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Great-Silence/dp/B000UL61CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Great Silence</a>&nbsp;-- is more about catching the rhythms of religious life in the large, austere, Victorian house than anything else.

Ironically, even though the women move about with as little noise as possible, the quiet is still broken by such raucous inventions as the manual ""rattle"" used to awaken the nuns at 5:20 a.m., the washing machines, the power saw used in trimming the garden's trees, the machine that stamps out layers of communion wafers which the monastery sells to help support itself, etc. So, silence is a relative term as modernity has not entirely passed the Carmelites by.

Still, these women who have given their lives to contemplative prayer for the betterment of the world, use it to deepen their personal walks with God. As some of the sisters interviewed conceded, the silence of the cloister forces them to deal with their own shortcomings. Many modern people distract themselves with television, music, and other chatter to avoid having to do just that, but it is a vital part of becoming a Carmelite to seek to be able to live more easily with oneself. The prioress said that she struggled for eighteen years with uncertainties about her worthiness before God. Others also spoke of the the ""dark night"" (in the works of St. John of the Cross) they experienced. Still others also mentioned that living in community with others for the rest of your life requires adjustments and can present challenges when there are the inevitable differences of opinion.

Also, in the last forty years, many Catholic orders have made changes in their traditions. Some women's orders have stopped wearing habits, for example.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Greater-Love-A-Unique-Portrait-of-the-Carmelite-Nuns/dp/B004MB5MH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Greater Love: A Unique Portrait of the Carmelite Nuns</a>&nbsp;shows this monastery to be one in which English, not Latin, is used in liturgy, but the only noticeable change in the black and white habits is that some of the nuns have chosen to stop wearing the wimple, although a few still do.

By and large, the nuns look serene and even joyful. A few are very old, but most are a range of ages and very active in performing all the tasks that need doing. A little humor comes through in the film, but mainly in a few of the still photos and especially in one of the special features in which a dramatically-inclined sister plays her own hilarious version of Romeo and Juliet for the others.

The film's respectul but penetrating and very beautiful photography captures the soul of the monastery, especially as two of the nuns sang together or all gathered for prayer. The film also seems to capture the grace and love within these monastery walls. These women are living that ""no greater love"" -- their love for God, and they have generously allowed us a glimpse inside their cloistered, ""silent"" world. NO GREATER LOVE is both art and a view into hearts of women giving all they have.",1305331200,96,3635,5.303819444444445
4429576,4,B004MB5MH4,"I recommend this movie. Beautifully filmed.  Unfortunately, it doesn't get any where close to the truth, goodness and beauty of ""Into Great Silence"" . . . that dvd was beyond five stars.  ""No Greater Love"" is the runner up.",1301875200,23,223,4.6923076923076925
4429577,5,B004MB5MH4,I enjoyed this DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD for all young women discerning a vocation or curious about life in a convent.,1301702400,10,126,4.478260869565218
4429578,4,B004MB5MH4,"I have always wondered why anyone would sign up for Poverty, Chastity and Obedience and this film shed light on the women who have.  Very respectfully produced, No Greater Love provides insight into the lives lived by these holy women and traces their days through prayer, chores, rituals and conversations.  They live a life of quiet and meditation but are far more aware of what is going on in the outside world than they might let on.  This film shows what a life in love with God looks like within the context of Catholic culture and offers some surprises.",1301616000,117,560,4.636363636363637
4429579,4,B004MB5MH4,Shows the wonderful dedication and faith these women have. Silence is golden. Thank You,1443225600,,87,5.285714285714286

4429582,1,B004MB5MH4,"IF THIS FILM IS DESIGNED TO PREENT A  FAITHFUL  ACCONT OF CARMELITE LIFE, IT DOES NOT.

IT CONSISTS PRMARILY OF UNHAPPY-LOOKING WOMN TALKING, THEN  TALKING  SOME MORE, FOLLOWED BY THE SAME.

WHERE IS  CONTEMPLATIVE  SILENCE ?  FEELINGS OF LOVE OF GOD ?  NOWHERE IN THIS FILM THAT  I  COULD FIND.",1429660800,2,295,4.68
4429583,3,B004MB5MH4,This was a disappointment. The nuns are truly sincere and inspiring but this was just too long to tell the story.,1428364800,,113,4.428571428571429

4429585,5,B004MB5MH4,"If you have already seen Into The Great Silence, you know what I mean.
That is a wonderful documentary, showing the daily life of the monastery. I was deeply touched by the part of the Easter rituals.
I loved the extra material, with the interviews of the sisters talking about their personal experience with meditation and silence, pray and the community life.
I recommend!",1404691200,2,374,4.859375

4429587,2,B004MB5MH4,"I'm not Catholic, but am Catholic friendly.  I was hoping that I could draw some inspiration from a group of dedicated Christians.  Sadly, they are afflicted with agnosticism and doubt, and more driven by ritual and works than love and faith.  Good pic if you want to study the culture, not so if you hope to draw inspiration.",1387238400,3,326,4.586206896551724
4429588,4,B004MB5MH4,"This is a lovely and touching window into the lives of holy and loving women in London in our own time.  As a devotee of St Teresa of Avila,I found this particularly interesting.  Since this is a true and living depiction of the lives of these nuns, this would not be a great choice for someone who requires action and constant dialogue to enjoy a film.",1374537600,,353,4.333333333333333
4429589,5,B004MB5MH4,This is a very interesting and in-depth documentary of the life of those pursuing life as a Carmelite nun.  Beautifully produced.,1373328000,,129,5.142857142857143

4429592,5,B004MB5MH4,"This is a wonderful DVD to see how the Carmelite Nuns spend their time, each day in prayer, daily chores, and peace within their Community as a whole.  It's an inspiration to those young women who would be considering a Nun's life away from family and friends for the rest of their lives.  Best video, in my opinion!",1364601600,,316,4.431034482758621
4429593,4,B004MB5MH4,"This film is beautiful, inspiring and heart-warming for seekers from all paths. The daily lives, both prayer and work, of a Carmelite order in the middle of London has been captured with dignity and sensitivity. The film immerses you in world they inhabit, the vows they have taken, and especially noticeable the full life given to God. Most of the nuns are elderly; one dies within the film-span and her simple ceremonial burial in the convent cemetery is shown. Another nun, the youngest, joins the order in and her profession is shown. Having seen Into Great Silence about the Carthusian monks, i found myself comparing the two films and while both are similar in a number of ways, Into Great Silence, to me, is superb art while No Greater Love is an inspiring documentary but not of that quality. One of the notable differences is that the filmmaker was allowed to go into the monk's rooms and film them at prayer and study. Had the filmmaker for the Carmelite nuns been a woman, she might have been given more access to the nuns. There are a few scenes of the mother superior and some nuns speaking individually about their life and these are precious. The only part i didn't like about No Greater Love is the way the filmmaker juxtaposed scenes of silence and serenity with scenes in which the nuns were running noisy machinery, inside and out, and it really jarred the nerves. Overall it's a beautiful film if you're interested in the religious life and old world orders of today. Don't miss Into Great Silence.",1359936000,6,1518,4.689138576779026
4429594,5,B004MB5MH4,"A truly beautiful and inspiring movie about such a beautiful and important vocation (a calling), that of the nuns. These sisters are highly educated and smart. They live happy lives and show great ardor in their mission.

You will have an insight on the lives of some sisters in Christ, and on this beautiful order. I can't recommend more. You will be happy that you bought it.",1358208000,,377,4.626865671641791
4429595,2,B004MB5MH4,"I was expecting to see more of the daily life of the nuns rather than almost all interviews. I viewed ""Into Great Silence"" and love that movie and was expecting something similar. If you like movies with interviews, you will like this one",1357171200,5,238,4.558139534883721
4429596,5,B004MB5MH4,"The best thing of watching this documentary is just watching the being of these nuns, how they think, present their ideas, the deep peace in their attitudes and prayers. Consoling, insightful.",1354924800,,192,5.225806451612903
4429597,5,B004MB5MH4,"I love this genre of films.  It is refreshing to see something about pursuing the love of the good God.  My heart swells at the thought that these women give all they are to God and man.  Their prayers are of such great value more than gold to us lovers of God in the world.  It is the type of film that gives a person like me courage and peace in my life of reparation. I am sure, if you are a seeker of the Almighty Lover, you will glean much from this work.",1349136000,7,460,3.8617021276595747
4429598,4,B004MB5MH4,"No Greater Love, which allows viewers a glimpse into the lives of cloistered nuns in London, is a beautiful movie.  Love, for God and one another, can clearly be seen in the eyes, the voice, the expression of each cloistered sister.  They have found their place, they have found their peace, and are sharing it with us.

I would recommend this film when you want a quiet moment, when the world and all its trouble momentarily becomes too much, when you need to put life in perspective.  It will uplift you and give you hope, regardless of religious affliation.

The only (very slight) drawback is that the running time is only 105 minutes...not very long, and may leave you with questions or wanting more.  So it might best be  viewed as a companion to Into Great Silence, the documentary about the Carthusian monastery, and a true, five-star masterpeice.

Even if films such as this are outside your usual genre, take a chance, say yes, and see what happens.  You will not be disappointed.  No Greater Love is well-deserving of its many awards.",1337644800,15,1045,4.6923076923076925

8435893,2,B004MB5MH4,"A haphazard portrayal of Carmelite life. Moves from kitchen to cleaning floors to chapel.  No logical arrangement. The singing is very poor, in fact, off-pitch throughout.  The Holy Week services lack full solemnity.
Questions posed and questions answered cannot be understood because of thick British/Cockney accents.  Even with English subtitles, many questions and answers are not dubbed in.  Disappointing.",1452816000,,410,5.898305084745763
