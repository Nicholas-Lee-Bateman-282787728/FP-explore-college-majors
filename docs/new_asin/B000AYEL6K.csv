2398067,3,B000AYEL6K,"I got this as a gift for my ultimate Packers fan husband, he has a whole packers bedroom of his own. And he did enjoy the first dvd, but he has not watched the second one yet because we can't find the remote to our DVD player, wah! It's only getting 3 stars because at least in the first dvd, it was not a collection of all the Super Bowls. It was just highlights, and it showed a lot of different footage on other teams and players. My husband did still really enjoy it, and he is looking forward to watching the next DVD, but it wasn't exactly as expected.",1452988800,,558,4.081818181818182

8080881,2,B000AYEL6K,This was not at all what I expected. There is very little game footage from Super Bowls I and II. The coverage contained in the DVD is not even in cronological order. There is lots of unrelated material. Overall very disappointing.,1524096000,,231,4.658536585365853

8080888,5,B000AYEL6K,"This was a seriously amazing buy!  You all know how I feel about my Green Bay Packers. They are the winningest team in the NFL -- After all,  Green Bay is called Title Town for a reason, right? This is a high quality 2 dvd set.  It features 29 years of Packer History and even has footage of Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II!  It highlights many of our glory years with Coach Vince Lombardi, breaks our hearts with reminders of the not so glory years and features the rebuilding of the team with the aquistion of the amazing QB and future NFL Hall Of Famer -- Brett Favre!  That obviosuly means more Super Bowl footage! Woo Hoo! That is probably my most beloved era because I watched all of the games with my dearly departed Mama. This was released in 2009, so obviously the current stuff is missing. Any Packer Fan would be proud to own this DVD! I gave 4 away as gifts and kept one to watch with my own lil Packer fans. If you love the Pack, Vince Lombardi or Brett Favre, you'll love having this dvd set!",1462147200,5,1005,4.186528497409326
