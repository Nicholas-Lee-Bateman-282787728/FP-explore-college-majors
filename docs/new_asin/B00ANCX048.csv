8554591,5,B00ANCX048,"Classic Hitch, I'm almost sad to say, for those of you who never knew of Hitchens when he was alive but who have found him over the net, this is a great little debate. While I'm no William F. Buckley fan, I will say that todays (as of 12/22/2015) republican party is a far cry from how reasonable Mr. Buckley comes off in this debate. Hitchens' youth is also quite odd to take in if you're used to his more modern/middle age appearance that most people know him though fame. This, however, in no way makes him any less quick witted and sharp against his opponents. If you love Hitchens and for some reason want a hardcopy of this debate, it's a decent price to pay.",1450742400,,665,4.285714285714286

8554593,4,B00ANCX048,It was a treat to see an interview with a youthful Christopher Hitchens.  I have not read this book by him and the interview made me want to buy it.  Looks like Amazon will be able soon to chalk up another sale.  The interview included John O. Sullivan and the exchanges were a delight!,1371168000,5,286,4.2592592592592595
