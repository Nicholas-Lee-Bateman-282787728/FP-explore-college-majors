2833036,1,B00005JPVK,"This movie is so poorly written (trite, trite, trite) and badly directed as to be almost laughable and all but unwatchable.  And the insanity of casting Jennifer Lopez as a ""blonde American who doesn't speak Spanish!""  A waste of any thinking person's time and money.",1201564800,6,267,4.911111111111111

2833038,5,B00005JPVK,"I was actually skeptical when I first came across this movie. But I took a chance on seeing it. Now I can't wait until it actually comes out on DVD. This is an EXCELLENT film. Being that I'm a US Citizen living in Mexico for a few months I see exactly what the film is talking about. It's just a shame that not many people actually know what is going on here. This film could be a cultural phenomenon that could help to change things. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FILM. Only problem that I had was that J.Lo is trying to act like a stereotypical ""gringa"" and it's really easy to hear her accent.  Other than that, I loved the movie.",1193529600,47,633,4.188524590163935
2833039,5,B00005JPVK,"I can't reccomend this film highly enough. See it. It's news you won't see on CNN. I have never liked Lopez, but this movie isn't about her or Banderas. It's also not a typical hollywood movie either.

The central theme never deviates away from the story about a 16 year old sole survivor of an attack and her desire to survive, which means she needs to capture her attackers or they will kill her because she can identify them. The story is very human and a realistic protrayal of how systems and cultures can work against victims without being obvious.

Anyone saying the film is political has discounted the reality and importance of these rapes and murders, now numbering in the thousands within the last few years. No single authority has even attempted to document them all until recently, and that's been through human rights groups. This story should be embarrassing for authorities - on both sides of the border.

There are various subjects explored which might create the circumstances that allow these crimes to continue happening, such as corruption, NAFTA, class, greed, racism, bias, corporations, but they are not conclusive, central or over-dramatized. But even the exploration of these subjects will make this film politically unpopular and even more important to see.",1192579200,9,1285,5.023474178403756

2833070,5,B00005JPVK,"Bordertown is the movie that tells the truth about the American Corporations that take their work to other countries like Jarurez, Mexico.  Lauren played by Jennifer Lopez is a career woman with no man or children and is passionate about being an overseas reporter.  Jennifer is an American reporter for the Chicago Sentinel heads to Juarez  which is a Mexican Bordertown on the American Border., Jennifer investigates a series of mysterious slayings involving young factory women from all over Mexico. As she discovers hundreds of victims, she gains the trust of local factory workers but falls into danger, when she takes one of the girls who survives the torture, rape and actual murder of her.  She manages to come around a dig her way out of her own grave where the two men who had raped her and buried her.

Jennifer takes the young girl in who is working in one of the American Factories in Juarez, Mexico.  Antonio Bandares is the old flame in her life who is running a radical Newspaper which has had the Mexican Police Harassing him and the paper he owns constantly or shall we say daily.  He assists Jennifer and the young girl who is the only one that has walked away alive from one of these brutal tortures, rapes and murders by two men of Mexico or America you can find out and have the realization come to light what American Corporations are doing to young women in other countries and they use them as cheap labor, working long shifts, and most end up one of the dead after they leave the factories which are long hours and back breaking work for the young and the older women are used far less because they are unable to do the work that the young teens can do standing on their feet for long hours and pennies to send the goods back to the U.S.A. to be sold to us.

I will not tell you the whole story,as it is horrifying and TRUE.  The women Jennifer plays eventually takes over the paper from which Antonio had been running and to this day is still there and running that paper.  The young girl and her family are under protection from a world group for justice for the innocent victims of brutal crimes..

Here is some of the cast and below a link to the Trailer to watch and the price is right for this wonderful movie that will open every American's Eyes to what Americas Rich Corporations are doing in other countries to women and to some men.  They Lobby to our House Congress and Literally get away with MURDER, as well as they are taking the work from Americans for their own perverted sexual demented mindset that women and young girls are their's to use and abuse, as well as MURDER..............:

2833072,4,B00005JPVK,"Bordertown deserves a far better reception than what it got for tackling a difficult but gripping subject.  Undoubtedly, much more could have been done with the subject and it's worth revisiting for a longer TV series.

Bordertown looks at female killings in Juarez, where nearly 400 women have been killed - according to official reports.  Unofficial estimates are much higher.  Staggeringly, 3000 people were killed in the ongoing drug wars in 2010 alone, highlighting a situation and area that's out of control.

On the dramatic end, Jennifer Lopez and Antonio Banderas give strong compelling performances, but the movie's stylish visuals are sometimes at odds with its MOW (Movie-of-the-Week) script moments.  It feels that despite the subject matter, some of the punches are pulled.  The chemistry between Lopez and Banderas could have been a tad stronger, and the story could have dug deeper and darker into the issue.  And like the American journalist that Jennifer Lopez plays, we never get to fully explore the machismo culture of Mexico and other social issues because we remain on the outside.

The film isn't without its faults as a thriller, but it deserves an audience for bringing up an important issue.  Reviews in Imdb.com and wikipedia indicate average reviews.  This is better than that.

J Lo is a good actress and should be doing more films!",1333324800,,1362,5.085585585585585
2833073,3,B00005JPVK,"This movie only touches the deep-rooted problem in Mexico, that Mexicans find unpleasent to admit.  Martin Sheen was not the best choice as the Editor of the Newspaper that allows the Hispanic Female Reporter to go to a Bordertown in Mexico to look into the Rape and brutal Murders, and Kidnappings of young female Hispanic Factory workers.  The topic is never discussed by Hispanics in America.  Few seem to be concerned.  But in Mexican Border towns, hundreds upon hundreds (possibly over a thousand) of these young female factory workers either disappear, or turn up raped or tortured, or brutally murdered.  This movie attempts to bring this taboo topic to the attention of America. This movie is Loosely based on actual events in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico.  Another Movie called Juarez, is a poorly acted action drama cashing in on this dilemma, with a very substandard attempt to exploit the situation with a very badly acted movie.  Avoid that one.  I didn't, and it really stinks.",1327708800,,984,4.9573170731707314
2833074,1,B00005JPVK,"I took a chance and bought this movie since I use to live in El Paso and visited Mexico often. My biggest problem with this movie was the PROFANE language and the nudity! This type of crap OFFENDS many people and is completely unnecessary. Oh yes, nearly everyone I talk to feels the same way! When will Hollywood realize that they could sell many more DVDs if they offered two versions of a movie? One of course being a family friendly version! The good news is I paid less than a dollar for this crappy movie, so things could have been worse.",1311552000,,544,4.3431372549019605

2833076,5,B00005JPVK,"I have seen almost all of Jennifer Lopez' movies and I came across this one, which I hadnt even heard of. This movie is amazing. It's based on a true story about the factory women in Juarez, Mexico who have been found murdered or still missing and noone was doing anything about it. Jennifer Lopez plays a journalist who is determined to find the truth about whats going on, along with another journalist played by Antonio Banderas. Since I knew nothing about this story before hand, I was uterly thrilled to see the outcome, hoping that they found the killers and things would get better but it was much more than that. What an amazing portral of what goes on in Mexico. May those women rest in peace. If you haven't seen this movie, do so.",1243814400,6,741,4.455882352941177
2833077,3,B00005JPVK,"Anyone who has been to the border between the U.S. and Mexico knows there are some seriously shady happenings.  Where cheap labor can be combined with higher-priced imports into the U.S., there are bound to be conditions considered unhealthy.  Many of these places are called ""donkey shows"", but that has nothing to do with this movie.  Others more dangerous are ""maquiladoras"", factories where mostly women are employed, because they complain less about the long hours.  It turns out that many of these women have been heinously raped and murdered; some approximations are in the hundreds of thousands.

In this particular reenactment, one young, attractive women leaves work like normal.  Instead of staying with the rest of the employees, however, she wanders downtown by herself to shop.  Soon thereafter she is attacked by an employee of the public transportation system.  Enter Lauren (Jennifer Lopez), a Chicago Sentinel reporter who is sent to uncover the truth behind the crimes.

Lauren flies down to Juarez - her massive backside counted as a carry-on - and meets up with former lover/friend Alfonzo Diaz (Banderas), who now owns a small, yet controversial newspaper.  Previously the two worked together in El Paso on some rag that undoubtedly ran countless articles about zombies mistaken for Marc Anthony.  Together they help the one surviving victim fight through the crimes and pervasive political cover-up exploding within Mexico's borders.

There are a few problems with the movie's message, however: I don't see where maquiladoras are to blame.  It seems that the scorn is misdirected, and the aim should be towards corrupt politicians and police officers who all but encourage the lawless behavior to persist.  Perhaps some of the blame could be spread around when considering working conditions, but the brutal rapes and murders should not be on the maquiladoras' collective conscious.  Are they supposed to provide security for each employee throughout their diverse journeys home?  Why not armored cars, personal bodyguards, and ADT home security systems while we're at it?  It seems middle man is taking the brunt of the blame when there are obviously larger players (i.e. foreign governments) deserving ridicule and disparagement.

One other personal pet peeve of mine reared its ugly head in this movie.  I don't see why Hollywood screenwriters insist on casting non-smoking stars in smoking roles.  In this movie, J-Lo ""smokes"", which is simply her holding a cigarette once or twice and letting it smolder.  The addition provides no substance, no depth, no extra angst, and the miscast only makes the movie's underlying message that much more irritatingly ridiculous when one considers that cigarettes kill infinitely more per year than those scaaaaaary maquiladoras.

This topic of this movie is powerful and has limitless potential.  By all accounts, this should be a widely discussed epidemic.  The movie is not fully effective, however, because politics and a certain someone's ego got in the way.",1233100800,5,3027,5.2845188284518825

But the folks who made the movie are more concerned with telling us how corporations are bad than actually weaving a plausible narrative into fact.

It appears the only true link between the murders and corporations is the fact that some women were killed/disappeared during their commute.  (How many...the majority? the vast majority? 10, 200?)  And that is evidence of a massive conspiracy leading us to blame NAFTA and corporate greed for serial murder?

2833082,5,B00005JPVK,"Allowed for exhibition in Mexico City for what amounted hardly to three weeks, this suspenseful, gritty, moving thriller with an Oscar-worthy script brings to mind two others: Hotel Rwanda (a globally ignored, unhinging genocide) and the Brave One (a not-so-credible story of a self-centered and unhinged woman carried to success only by Jodie Foster's sublime acting). The viewer, I feel, will be able to tell why after they see ""Truths that Kill""/""Verdades que Matan"" (its title in Mexico), a title that for melodramatic Mexican ones is, for once, too right. Everything in this story of femicide-genocide is rooted in these hard truths, wilfully ignored by at least two partners of an agreement known as NAFTA, so much so that the story could not be explained without them, so much so that they continue to kill even as I am writing.
Truths that will continue to kill unless visionary and creative leaders in both Mexico and the U.S. have the guts to renounce the ""free""-trade doctrine, have the courage to substitute the word FAIR instead of ""free"" in the North-American (Not)Free-Trade Agreement.
I vaguely knew Gregory Nava, had not realized that other bright, smart evocative thriller, ""Mi Familia"", was made by him. Now I have watched how meticulously he reconstructed the facts of what could be the life of any one of those girls working in a row daily at maquiladoras I can say how extremely impressed I am by his devotion to a job of love; how his constant collaboration with Jennifer Lopez (it's amazing and worrying how mainstream media have trivialized her and what she does- a brilliant actress so rightly cast for the role, whose capacity I first knew in seeing that little-known fable on forgiveness directed by Robert Redford, ""An Unfinished Life"".
Much has happened since the inception of the maquiladora program, from the days when young girls taken from the surrounding regions were involved by USAID in a program providing them with contraceptives so they didn't get pregnant and slowed-down productivity. Lpez embodies Lauren Adrian, a strong but not cold woman, courageous and resolved as so many Mexican women are, so human even in her mistakes, but with a vulnerability that toward the end will turn into her strength and turn her life around. She's a reporter in a Chicago paper, she covets a foreign-correspondent position. Instead she is sent to investigate the rapes and killing of -officially- between 375 and 700 women in Ciudad Jurez and its offshoots like the Colonia Anapra. Almost all killed women were workers in Jurez's maquila factories. After reluctantly giving in, she looks for the help of Daz (Banderas), an erstwhile co-investigator and (maybe) something else. She went away but now she hopes he will help her out.
Antonio Banderas is so convincing as the director of modest newspaper El Sol de Juarez, which dangerously insists on exposing the truth on the killings as they happen, though often its copies will be confiscated by authorities as soon as they are released. What I find amazing is he never shows off his celebrity, he'll get under the skin of the ordinary, somewhat beaten up overwhelmed man struggling to keep running the sole paper in Juarez unwilling to toe the corrupt authorities' line. What Diaz tells Lauren on the unofficial figures for raped and killed working women in Juarez, is unbelievable but most surely one more Truth.

Though not exactly allowed to film in Juarez, Nava perfectly clinches the oppressive climate that the population and these women live in. Under a non-sheltering, blinding-light sky, under a suffocating heat, mothers of missing daughters daily pry every inch of vast stretchs of arid land, they are the only ones able to find their dead daughters' bodies. Under orders, police is unable to find even a single one.
The unexpected jewel in the film is 16-year-old Eva, fleshed out by Maya Zapata, who surely seems the most promising actress any side of the border. An indigenous girl, most significantly from Oaxaca, natural and unpretentious, she is one of the girls chosen to be doomed but decidedly will not, the survivor who refuses to remain the victim, whose decision for life and justice moves forward the events and through her own vulnerability turns Lauren's into the strength which ultimately will make her whole and help Eva herself find a modicum of light and justice at the end of her own particular dark tunnel.
Brilliant as well is Martin Sheen, the only fine actor who could deliver to Lauren the news of the sad present state of investigative reporting in the face of big politics and corporatocracy, and mainstream media's servitude to them.
Of course differences in acting styles are apparent, but even this plays to the movie's advantage, to point out the sharp contrast between prosperous owners of the assembled computers and T.V.s in the US and poor, traditional-valued poor families' struggle to survive.
You see, Mexico is one of those now-not-so-singular places where the vast majority of nationals own nothing. Whole rural families headed by women --the men are long ago ""on the other side"", or trying to get ""there""-- are despoiled of the most basic resources and thus have to head North. Poverty is then feminized, the fact that migrants are now women unleash a series of nefarious consequences; they could be avoided, and dignity restored, if only the countries involved had the political will to provide the resources and prevent these dire consequences. Many women in Juarez were harassed and/or received death threats for having provided the information necessary to tell the story. Thanks to their courage the viewer, as another reviewer noted, will be challenged to try not to help. The DVD offers the resources to do it. Conscionable and generous viewers would like to do something for these abandoned women and our poor in general (the present administration often seems to want to erradicate poverty by altogether eliminating the poor), and maybe this help will turn on a light that will conduct these punished people (and their counterpart in the US) out of the NANFTA --the North-American, Not-Fair-Trade Agreement-- tunnel.

[Friends interested in knowing more can also read the fine NACLA's report on the matter in its last weekly update, ""NAFTA's Road to Ruin: The Decline of the Mexican Social Compact"", Parts I and II, [...] On the poor's immigration, David Bacon book ""The Economic Politics of Migration"" is most illustrative.]",1219276800,3,6464,5.04018691588785

We usually hear everything about what's going on in the life of Jennifer Lopez, but her starring role in this film was largely ignored.

Contrary to the criticism of one reviewer that the politics of the film are ""confused,"" the politics are actually quite clear and accurate.  Female workers in towns like Juarez are being treated like slaves, and the wealth of their labor is being concentrated in the hands of the corporations that moved there to avoid taxes, labor concerns and environmental regulations.  The result is a dysfunctional dystopia of crime, violence and poor health.

2833086,5,B00005JPVK,"Bordertown where ""Enough"" meets ""Traffic"". This movie is a must, must , must see !!!!It gives a very informative,accurate  and  dramatic presentation of the  exploitation of women currently going on along the US/Mexican Border. Bordertowns, like Tijuana and Juarez are set up  by the  complicity  of Multinational Conglomerates, Corporations and the US and Mexican Governments,and legalized and  endorsed  by  NAFTA,the Free trade agreement. The  conditions have been created and sanctioned for legal exploitation of  women. The economic policies created by NAFTA,  are created for corporate  profits, motivated by greed  and have no provision for workers rights. Poverty and taxes move these women to these ""bordertowns"", away from their homes  and family where they are forced to live in ""ghettos""  set up by  by the various conglomerates. As  strangers to their environment they  are isolated  and invisible, forced into submissive labor and to conditions which make them invisible to society, governments  and the world.  The US and Mexican Governments have chosen  profits over womens right and have once again created conditions for exploitative labor that was  criminalized in the US  in 1908. Women are  ""chosen"" over men for these indentured position since they are less likely to be ""seen"" , complain  and unrecognized as  human beings. Bordertowns have  created the condition for these women to literally disappear into these ghettos and factories and find themselves vulnerable  for any and all forms  of exploitation;  including sex trade, murders, forced pornography  ,organized crime. Anyone looking to exploit,rape, harm and kill women. Ms Jennifer Lopez deserves recognition for a great and intense  performance. The film chronicles the  work of a reporter( Ms. Lopez) sent by a Chicago newspaper to investigate the systematic disappearance of the Women in Juarez. AS this reporter starts to uncover the truth, she realizes  the magnitude of the  complicity of Corporations, Conglomerates  and Governments for profit.  This then becomes  her  own  personal journey to  find her true self and her life's purpose. . As she tries to expose  the truth  she realizes  that she has become a target  since  she  becomes a threat both Governments and Corporate interest and  puts her own life in jeopardy.",1213315200,3,2314,5.380281690140845
2833087,4,B00005JPVK,"The movie was great but Jennifer Lopez character was hard to swallow.
Her acting wasn't good in this movie.  I was surprised at Antonio Banderas' character.  I didn't know that was him at first.  Good movie!",1210291200,,207,4.694444444444445
2833088,3,B00005JPVK,"I worked in El Paso as a TV news photographer, so I'm somewhat familiar with those events in Juarez.  I think this is definitely an important topic to make a movie about, but, as some of the other negative reviewers have stated, much of the dialog and acting is too over the top.  All the heated arguments between Lopez' character and her boss back in Chicago, and then the tense personal arguments between her and Antonio Banderas about whatever problems had happened between them in the past, was totally unnecessary to the story, and only served as distractions from the main subject matter, the mass murder of women in Juarez -which in and of itself is dramatic enough, so why add all the silly dialog about ""if you do this I'll give you the foreign correspondents job..."" bla bla bla...

Another thing that annoyed me was the way in which they tried to blend into the story certain elements from real life, but those real life things are all chronologically mixed up.  For example:  She's talking to her boss about the Egyptian suspect the authorities had arrested, and later, they hear the Juanes song ""La Camisa Negra"" on the radio.  That got me a little confused as to when this story was supposed to be taking place.  The Egyptian guy was arrested in 1995.  ""La Camisa Negra"" was released in 2005.

Also, When I worked in El Paso, I covered a press conference at the Cereso prison where the Egyptian guy spoke to the press -so extensively, in fact, that some of the TV reporters got annoyed, asking him, ""How much of this do you really expect us to be able to fit into a 2-minute news story?""  So, the scene where the police detective angrily refuses to allow the press to interview the Egyptian, is somewhat inaccurate.

Lastly, when Lopez and Banderas arrive at the scene of one of the murders, the way Juarez police confiscated her camera and didn't allow them to take pictures, is the opposite of how I recall their relationship with the media.  Our CBS affiliate had a Juarez stringer who was always bringing back extremely gruesome closeup video of the cadavers.  Police over there would actually give the media much more freedom to photograph crime scenes, to the extent that journalists were allowed to cross the yellow police lines and walk everywhere the detectives went.  Not to say that was good, but I remember that's how it was.",1210032000,,2351,4.647342995169082
2833089,4,B00005JPVK,"Loosely based on several of the many Ciudad Jurez murders, BORDERTOWN is two parts docudrama/political commentary and two parts suspense/thriller.  Though the subject of the film is an important one, the movie does suffer from a few major flaws.

Most likely, you've heard little or nothing about the 15-year serial killing spree(s) in the neighboring Mexican cities of Jurez and Chihuahua.  Probably you've read a short article, maybe buried in the back of the ""international"" section of your local paper, about the latest death toll.  Maybe you've seen a few pieces over the years, each giving rise to an eerie sense of dj vu: ""Haven't I read this before? Didn't the police already catch this killer?  Surely this is a different case...""

Between 1993 and the present day, at least 400 women, primarily employed in the maquiladoras established along the Mexican/American border, have been found dead.  Raped, murdered, strangled, mutilated.  Dumped like trash.  Another 5,000+ women are reported missing.  Most likely they are dead, but their families will never know, can never rest, because there is no outcry, no investigation, no justice.  Government corruption, police incompetence, and international indifference have all conspired against justice.  After all, these are poor brown women we are talking about.  Disposable women in a disposable society.

BORDERTOWN attempts to tell the tales of all these women through the story of one girl, Eva Jimenez, a 16-year-old factory worker who is kidnapped on her way home from work, raped, and buried alive.  Left for dead.  Though her assailants - two men, gang rapists - thought they killed her, she survives and, with the help of two reporters (played by Jennifer Lopez and Antonio Baderes), tries to bring them to justice.

While I generally enjoyed the movie (as much as you can ""enjoy"" a movie about femicide), it does tend towards the melodramatic at times.  The acting is generally adequate, though Maya Zapata is a standout as Eva.  (So much so that I immediately hopped onto Netflix and put all her films in my queue.)  Most of the melodrama is due to the script, rather than overacting.  There are also a few plot holes, which I won't get into for fear of spoiling the ending.  However, one is so large that you'll know it when you see it. (Just in case you don't, a hint: it involves the trial and the immediacy of Eva's testimony.)

Even so, BORDERTOWN is monumental film, in that it addresses an ongoing situation of gross human rights abuses that the mainstream media has largely ignored.  Any time you can get A-list stars to sign on to such a project, it's a big f'in deal.  And while the film itself isn't as rigorous in detailing the Ciudad Jurez gender-cide as I would prefer - the subplot about Lopez's childhood and her character's relationship with Banderes was distracting at best - it's still a good vehicle for getting the message out, for letting people know what is and isn't happening south of the border.  The DVD extras, which include two documentaries (""Exposing the Juarez Murders: The Making of Bordertown"" and ""La Frontera - The Border""), as well as a ""get involved"" menu (the first time I've ever seen that on a DVD!) are particularly poignant and compelling.  So while it certainly isn't a great movie - maybe a B-/C+ at best - it is still a movie that you, along with your friends and family (and Lou Dobbs, if you can compel him!), should see.

And, after the movie's over, don't forget about these women like the rest of the world.  Use the resources provided to learn more, to take action, to get involved.  As Eva Canseco explains in ""La Frontera - The Border"", we're all citizens of the same community; we need to protect one another, to care what happens to our neighbors, to act while we still have the agency to do so.  The women raped and murdered, the men tortured into confessing - they could easily be you or I.  Human rights abuses are not limited to ""developing"" or ""third world"" nations.  Read the paper more closely (better yet, a feminist blog or two) and you'll be surprised to see what's happening in your own backyard.",1208476800,18,4129,4.811347517730496
2833090,5,B00005JPVK,This movie left me speechless and in amazement that we know so little about thats going on in other countries around the world. To think that these problems happen and makes you see that your life might not be as bad as you think. I applaud all the people involved in this project for trying to inform people and get this story out there. This could be the reason it went straight to dvd it was such a powerful and controversial story and since it had to do with NAFTA something the US made and as told in the movie wants to expand. It just goes to show you just as the Mexican government is keeping things from  their people whats going on here that we don't know about???,1206835200,,673,4.217054263565892
2833091,5,B00005JPVK,"Hundreds (some say thousands) of women have been murdered in the Mexican town of Juarez over the years. Their raped and mutilated corpses scatter the desert. This is not fiction. The ""women of Juarez"" are real. Their murders continue to this day.

Who murdered them? NAFTA!

That's according to BORDERTOWN, a Hollywood ""message movie"" that tries to be entertaining as it preaches, and mostly succeeds. Its politics are so confused that libertarians, anarchists, feminists, Marxists, paleo-conservatives, anti-globalists, and Gibby the cat should all find something to cheer.

The film has a typical ""message movie"" structure. An Outsider investigates an Issue, educating us along the way. In this case, Jennifer Lopez is a Chicago reporter assigned to cover the Juarez murders. Her editor (Martin Sheen) rattles off statistics, sounding less like a jaded journalist than an activist/actor lecturing to us. Lopez dislikes the assignment because Mexico is a career dead-end. But after she relents, she reconnects with her Mexican roots, discarding her blond hair dye to accept her authentically black tresses.

Lopez learns that Juarez, just across the Texas border, is a creature of NAFTA. A town full of maquiladoras, factories that assemble TVs and computers for the U.S. market. Maquiladoras exist all along the Mexican side of the border.

How are maquiladoras to blame for the murders of women?

BORDERTOWN informs us that maquiladoras ""hire mainly young women because they work for lowers wages and complain less about the long hours and harsh working conditions. Most maquiladoras operate 24 hours a day. Many women are attacked while traveling to and from work in the late night and early morning. The companies provide no security for the workers.""

You see, factories are responsible for workers' safety, not only on the job, but while they're commuting. (And perhaps at home, too?)

Yet there are libertarian nuggets in this film. By morally obligating businesses to protect their workers offsite, this film admits that the state has failed in its core duty. And BORDERTOWN pulls no punches; its corrupt Mexican police not only fail to protect, they also cover up murders and frame innocent suspects.

So much for relying on state protection -- these women need guns! Yet when Lopez enters a dangerous situation undercover, she arms herself ... with rocks. Sic!

BORDERTOWN offers other libertarian insights. One rape victim/factory worker (Mexican actress Maya Zapata) says she'd rather live on her farm, but the government keeps raising taxes to push people off their land, pressuring them to accept low-wage jobs out of desperation. ""We cannot pay the taxes, so they tell us, go to the border and work in the maquiladora. Make money to keep your land. But there is no money here. The government and the factories take everything. All the money is for them. For us, nothing.""

Well, she gets $5 a day, so when she says ""nothing,"" she presumably means wages are so low, she can't pay the taxes. Taxes raised not for revenue (people can't pay them), but to create cheap labor. Thus does the government collude with business (perhaps for kickbacks?).

Marxists call this ""market exploitation,"" but libertarians will recognize it as ""market distortion.""

The U.S. government is also condemned, for not mandating worker protections in NAFTA. ""The screams of the women of Juarez are silent because no one will listen,"" Lopez writes in her news story. ""Not the giant corporations who make their profits from the labor of these women. Not the governments of Mexico and the U.S. who benefit from the free trade agreement. All the evidence points to the fact that there are many killers. A whole culture of murder that gets worse the more it's denied and covered up. Covering it up is less expensive than protecting these women. Everything is about the bottom line. And so the death toll mounts.""

Lopez is right about there being many killers. ""You want to kill a woman for any reason, you come to Juarez,"" a local journalist tells her.

Juarez is a bad town. Most slums are. And police rarely expend resources on poor victims. But this is an old story. It has nothing to do with NAFTA.

A U.S. Senator and the newspaper's corporate owner pressure Sheen to kill the story. They want to expand NAFTA to Central America, and don't want bad press. Sheen tells Lopez that corporate America's news agenda is ""free trade, globalization, and entertainment."" Lopez snaps, ""It isn't free trade. It's slave trade. It's a goddamn scam.""

She means low wages and no protections, yet she inadvertently has a point. Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne too opposed NAFTA, as a form of managed trade (i.e., a scam), saying, ""Free trade can not be achieved through committee negotiations and lengthy regulations.""

A Mexican industrialist tells Lopez, ""I buy politicians on both sides of the border."" State and industry collaborate in BORDERTOWN. Marxists see this as global capitalism, but libertarians recognize it as statist corporatism (i.e., economic fascism).

I recommend this DVD. It highlights important issues. The women of Juarez are real and deserve attention, irrespective of BORDERTOWN'S confused politics.

Special features include Jennifer Lopez accepting an Amnesty International award for BORDERTOWN at the Berlin Film Festival; a documentary about a murder victim and the innocent suspect arrested and tortured by police. (Most of the maquiladoras shown here are Asian -- Sony, Sanyo, Hitachi -- so why doesn't BORDERTOWN condemn the Japanese government?); and a documentary that follows a woman's attempt to illegally cross the border into the U.S.",1206316800,11,5666,5.171584699453552

2833095,3,B00005JPVK,"THE BONUS MATERIAL IS WHAT MAKES THIS DVD IMPORTANT

This movie covers an important and interesting topic, but in a melodramatic, over the top way.  The movie also has a cheap look to it, like a made for cable movie.  The acting and writing are good in some parts, bad in others, but mostly mediocre.  The DVD has some great extras.

The background for the story is the murder of young women in Mexican border towns along the Texas border.  This did get some press a few years ago.  I remember reading about it in the newspaper and seeing coverage on TV.

This movie brings back this tragedy in a heavy handed and inaccurate manner.  And portions of this movie are like a bad slasher movie.

Jennifer Lopez is a reporter for a Chicago newspaper sent to Mexico to cover the murders of young women working in the border factories.  She hooks up Antonio Bandares, who is the publisher of the local newspaper and used to be her lover.  Mercifully, that aspect of the story is handled superficially.

The movie shows a grand conspiracy to cover up the murders.
The police and the politicians want to squash the story.  The police confiscate newspapers, harrass the reporters and chase Lopez.  Back in Chicago, the conglomerate that owns the Lopez's newspaper kills the story.
Unknown bad guys shoot at the reporters.
-->The truth is that this story has been told.  I remember reading about it when the first murders were discovered and later when things seemed to esculate.  However, I must admit that I haven't heard much about it lately or how bad it had gotten.  It is just one of the many horrific global stories where the US seems to lose interest.

There are holes in the plot.  For instance:
Lopez meets a girl who survived a murder attempt.  She can't go to the Mexican police, because she thinks they will kill her.  She and Lopez go hiding from the police and get a picture of the man who attacked her.  So, now the police set a trap for him, capture him and she agrees to testify.
And one point, the girl thinks she might not testify, and Lopez worries about the attacker going free.  But, the attacker also attacked Lopez, and took her to a mass grave.  Couldn't she just as easily testify?

Parts of this movie are just like a bad slasher fick, but without the blood.
Lopez goes after the attackers of the girl.  She gets chased by the bad guys and almost killed.  She fights them off and ends up either capturing them or killing them.

It is apparent that the movie was filmed on a tight budget.  The scenes are often tinted in yellow and greenish hues to try and add atmosphere.

The DVD has two great extra documentary featurettes.  One is about life working in the border factories.  The other is about one of the border murders and how the murdered girl's cousin has been arrested for the murder.  The second documentary goes at great lengths to show how the cousin was wrongly accused.  It may be true, but I have to wonder.  The story is very one sided.  With the heavy handed approach of the main movie, I have my doubts about the fairness of the documentary.  There is no rebuttal from the authorities.  But, I don't know if that is because they refused to participate or the documentary makers didn't want to bother.

It is too bad that a mediocre, melodramatic movie was made to highlight such an important story.",1203638400,2,3332,4.515912897822446
2833096,5,B00005JPVK,"I wondered why this film went straight to DVD.  I had been wanting to see it for quite some time, but I was afraid I would be disappointed after the lack of attention it received.  Thankfully, just the opposite occurred.

'Bordertown' is a film about real people in real life situations.  It's well-acted, well-executed, and very suspenseful.  But behind the qualities of a good film lies a much deeper aspect: humanity.  This film exposes the true stories of thousands of women along the border who have been raped and murdered as a result of harsh working conditions in the factories (called ""maquilas"") and a lack of security provisions.  It's very eye-opening to the heinous crimes that are still going on today.  The film also shows the power of good journalism.  As a journalism student, I am very interested in investigative reporting and the benefits it brings.  'Bordertown' reflects the idea that good reporting is sometimes the only mechanism of discovering and exposing the truth and, ultimately, saving lives.

Maya Zapata, whom I had never heard of prior to this film, gives an excellent performance as Eva, the girl ""taken to hell and back by the devil""--the only girl to survive a rape and attempted murder by brutal killers in the town of Juarez. Jennifer Lopez proves that she CAN act, giving us a solid, layered performance as the main character, Lauren, a women thrust into a world where she must struggle to come to terms with her past and identity.  Antonio Banderas is great as usual as the local Mexican reporter striving to tell the truth at the risk of his own safety.  Martin Sheen and Sonia Braga do well in their supporting roles.

'Bordertown' has all the qualities of a good film.  At times, it is difficult to watch, but it's an intriguing yet disturbing story that will impact most viewers, leaving them with something to think and talk about long after the movie ends.",1202342400,5,1902,4.791411042944786
2833097,4,B00005JPVK,"BORDERTOWN is more than a suspenseful film about a tragic reality that has been terrifying Juarez, Mexico for years.  This film, written and directed by Gregory Nava ('Mi Familia', 'El Norte', 'Selena', etc), approaches a public service campaign on the part of Nava and the rest of his cast and crew - especially producer/star Jennifer Lopez. After the stunning effect of the film, the viewer is encouraged to watch the several excellent featurettes on the DVD - and then try to remain uninvolved.

Chicago Sentinel editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) convinces the reluctant reporter Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez) to fly to Juarez, Mexico to cover a combustible story about the ongoing rapes and murders of women who work the factories along the border for little pay.  Lauren would prefer becoming a foreign correspondent and extracts a promise that if she takes on this ugly assignment ('I don't speak Spanish and I don't know anything about Mexico'), Morgan will grant that request.  When the beautiful blond Lauren arrives in Juarez she is shocked by the reality: a very young factory worker girl Eva (the fine young actress Maya Zapata) has managed to survive a rape and attempted murder, literally climbing out of her grave and escaping.  Lauren and Eva bond and Lauren realizes that her story about the 5000 victims of this heinous serial killing may just rest with the information Eva holds: she can identify her assailants. With the aid of anxious newspaper owner Alfonso Diaz (Antonio Banderas) the three begin the dangerous struggle to unveil the truths about the cover-up of the deaths: the police and government corruption in Mexico are matched by similar deeds in the USA in order to protect the NAFTA arrangement which apparently holds the profit of the mega-factories of more importance then the mere lives of thousands of Mexican women.  How the trio infiltrates the corruption (and the buried secret realities of Lauren's humble beginnings) provide the remainder of the film.

Nava elects to shoot this film in garish light and emphasizes the tragic filth and mire of the living conditions of the peasants along the border - each hoping to escape the life situations by crossing into the US.  He manages to maintain a coarse cinematic effect that enhances the story.  Not only  Is Lopez in top form, but also she is assisted by a fine cast of fellow actors including Sonia Braga, Juan Diego Botto, Zaide Silvia Gutirrez, Rene Rivera among others.  Yes, the story has been told before, but that only means there are many people who want this contemporary tragedy to end.  In one of the features on the DVD  we are given addresses and names to contact to help stop this horrendous 'feminicide'.  Take serious note.
