6265345,5,B00IIJ9F42,Loved fast times and animal house. Dazed and confused was badly written and not that funny.,1477440000,2,91,4.75
6265346,5,B00IIJ9F42,"Two out of three of these movies are classics and the third is amusing. The two classics, ""FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMOUNT HIGH & ANIMAL HOUSE are hysterically funny strait through,from beginning to end. I remember seeing these movies for the first time in the early 1980*s at the Corram drive in,in NY out on the Island. ANIMAL HOUSE, Great ensemble cast with the late John Belushi portrays early 1960*s college fraternity high jinks will have your sides splitting with laughter. FAST TIMES,is a nice mix of coming of age,the last days of high school and getting stoned. In my opinion this is-was Sean Penns best role. For me these movies are quite representative of what i was into at the time. Dazed,is an ok flick but I didn't remember it. So if you want an evening to just chill then go ahead and get these dvds,kick back,relax and in enjoy...",1477008000,3,841,4.613333333333333
