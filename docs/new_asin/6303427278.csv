It will probably take viewers who are western or old movie fans to find this movie entertaining but if you have that interest you won't be disappointed.",1363305600,,422,3.976470588235294
7847308,3,6303427278,"There is more than adequate financing for this Paramount effort, fourth cinematic interpretation of the Zane Grey novel, second with sound, and producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman, creator of the William Boyd starring Hopalong Cassidy series, utilizes the extra funding to mount a generally well-crafted piece, although fiscal considerations cause a change in the film's lead as veteran supporting player Douglass Dumbrille replaces an always bothersome George Bancroft due to the latter's customary excessive salary demands.  In this  most faithful version to the original, stage nurtured Dumbrille is cast as Pecos Bill, a masked Robin Hood figure of the old west, a cover for his true persona, Ben Wade, who was falsely accused of murder 20 years before.  Accompanied by his comical partner Frosty (the future Charlie Chan, Sydney Toler), Ben returns to the crime location to exact retribution, a risky business, but he has come as well to see his grown daughter and is able to assist her to avoid an inappropriate marriage while committing to her true love, a ranch hand played by Russell Hayden.  The film moves along crisply under the well detailed direction of reliable Lesley Selander until a flagrant continuity flaw occurs involving Frosty, not recovering, while additionally a viewer will find it difficult to imagine Dumbrille in his vigourous role, despite excellent stunt work and valuable participation by cinematographer Russell Harlan, editor Sherman Rose, and old hand Western players Monte Blue, Earl Dwire and Glenn Strange.",1122681600,,1537,5.365145228215767
