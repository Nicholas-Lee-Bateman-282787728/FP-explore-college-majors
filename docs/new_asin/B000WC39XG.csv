2965437,5,B000WC39XG,"I bought this DVD to show my kids as we have a parody based on the Cthulhu mythos called ""A Shoggoth on the roof"" I figured the joke songs would make more sense if they had seen the original source material.
  I had forgotten how genuinely humorous the play was, and my 13 year old and 17 year old laughed out loud at several points. The nine year old wandered off to read sometime during ""Matchamaker, Matchmaker"".
  The acting is great, the music is wonderful, the scenery fits the story perfectly. I was always amazed that a musical with such a sad ending was so popluar though. I can remember walking out of the theater the first time I saw a production with such an overwhelming sense of depression since I knew that it had been based on things that really had happened.",1239235200,,775,4.398601398601398
2965438,5,B000WC39XG,"For those of you whom have not seen it, this is the best musical ever made. For those of you who are fans, it's a great full version movie cd. The extra music cd on the side is not the soundtrac to it though. It is just a cd with some so so 70s music on it.",1238976000,,257,3.526315789473684
2965439,5,B000WC39XG,This movie is awesome. Love the singing and dancing and not to mention the lessons about life in it. :D Great movie.,1237161600,,116,4.318181818181818
2965440,5,B000WC39XG,so glad to find this movie on dvd.  I loved watching it as a teenager and no can enjoy it again.,1236556800,,96,3.5714285714285716
2965441,5,B000WC39XG,"A must in everyone's collection.

However, it took way, way to long to get the item.  The delivery estimation was way off and highly unexcusable.",1232409600,,251,4.319148936170213
2965443,4,B000WC39XG,"If you are looking for a good movie, here it is. An old classic brought to you in a new format. The bonus cd is not a soundtrack from the movie, but songs from the 70's, not particularly pleasing to me.",1232150400,,202,3.951219512195122
2965444,5,B000WC39XG,"This is Topol being so brilliant that he really becomes a Jew in Czarist Russia.  His voice and his diction are excellent, and the supporting caste are all good.  It is very funny at times, and the songs are great.  It shows a way of life, long lost, and with the pograms, how it was lost.  This story goes from joy to misery, but ends with hope for the future.  Most enjoyable!",1231718400,,378,4.194444444444445
2965445,3,B000WC39XG,"I'm not about to review Fiddler on The Roof or a give a complete history of all its various incarnations like other reviewers have. We all acknowledge it's great. One of the best, if not THE best, musicals ever. I'm here to write about this particular packaging of the ""DVD with CD"". I don't know about you, but I naturally thought the CD was a CD of the soundtrack so that you can then listen to the songs while driving in your car or hanging around the house. No - it's not a soundtrack CD, which explains the relatively low price - it's a CD of 70's songs. While some are great (Let's Get It On by Marvin Gaye and ABC by the Jackson 5), what the heck does ""The Night Chicago Died"" have to do with Fiddler on The Roof? Or ""Reunited"" by Peaches and Herb? Maybe they thought Herb worked in the deli down the street!?!?!

I'm not sure if the same CD is included in everyone's package, but here's the listing for my CD:

Billy Don't Be A Hero-Donaldson & The Heywood's
Maggie May-Rod Stewart
The Night Chicago Died-Paper Lace
ABC-Jackson 5
Ant No Mountain High Enough-Diana Ross
Lets Get It On-Marvin Gaye
War-Edwin Starr
Reunited- Peaches&Herb

To paraphrase Edwin Starr, ""What is this CD good for?"" Almost absolutely nothing as everybody should already have Marvin Gaye, The Jackson 5, Diana Ross and Rod Stewart on their Ipod already!?!?!? If you want a DVD of Fiddler on The Roof and another version is cheaper - go for that version. Don't think you're getting anything special with the bonus CD.",1230422400,132,1498,4.5
2965516,5,B000WC39XG,"The box and cd are in excellent condition and was received within a few days. The story is great about changing traditions. Our kids liked ie, also.",1374364800,,148,4.518518518518518

2965519,5,B000WC39XG,"A wonderful movie that our entire family, young and old, really enjoyed.  It is educational, too.  That don't make wonderful movies like this anymore.  Highly recommended.",1363651200,,171,5.5
2965520,5,B000WC39XG,I did not see Fiddler on a Roof until a few years ago.  It is a great movie and I am happy to own it.,1360281600,,101,3.04
2965521,4,B000WC39XG,This is a classic definitely worth having in your library.  One word:  TRADITION!  Such great music and a wonderful timeless story!  I only gave it 4 stars the cinematography doesn't compare to modern movies but clearly it's a classic story worth 5!,1355097600,,249,4.857142857142857
2965522,3,B000WC39XG,"When I purchased this item, I thought that the accompanying CD was perhaps a soundtrack of the movie. However, it was a CD of popular songs from the 1970s (""Billy, Don't Be Hero,"" ""Maggie May,"" ""ABC,"" ""Reunited""), which I like no better now than I did then.  Had I realized this, I would have simply ordered the movie and skipped the CD.",1265587200,2,337,4.435483870967742
2965523,5,B000WC39XG,My favorite part of the movie is the music. I just love the Eastern Europen Jewish music and think it is important to preserve it for future generations.,1244419200,,153,4.5
2965524,5,B000WC39XG,"If you have never seen this movie before, I'm sorry.  This is one of my all time favorites, and always will be.  It's a funny/silly/serious/shocking type of film.  It will make you pay attention a little more to the real world, but still give you a wake up call to how ""the others"" think.  By this, I mean the culture outside of your own.  And then the humor kicks in.  People are people, we all live our lives, just like a ""Fidder on the Roof"".",1243900800,,445,4.176470588235294
2965525,5,B000WC39XG,"After seeing Topol in his farewell tour of Fiddler on the Roof on stage at the Benedum Theatre in Pittsburgh, I was anxious to purchase the original movie version.  It was great......amazing how after almost 30 years, his performance was as strong as in the movie.  I've watched the movie several times since purchasing it.  A wonderful film for the whole family.  Could probably do without the CD though, since it has nothing to do with the film.",1239408000,,447,4.6923076923076925
