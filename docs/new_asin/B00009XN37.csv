1895503,5,B00009XN37,"I have watched every single episode of Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister. The humor is unmatched and the english delicious. If only all of us had the wit of Humphrey Applebee, a boss as dense as Hacker and a subordinate as devoted as Bernard....wouldn't our professional lives be perfect? Strongly encourage anyone who loves the Queen's english and British humor to buy this DVD.",1065484800,8,381,4.876923076923077
1895504,5,B00009XN37,"...don't be put-off by the ""no rating"" category... this is as unoffensive as it can get (these programs aired before the 9 o'clock news on BBC 1 originally, that being in the so-called ""watershed"" time slot to be suitable for family viewing).
Very British humour, utlizing fully the scope of the English language without too many regional dialects that can make this hard to understand by non-English viewers. Always entertaining, I can honestly say that this stuff has aged extremely well in the course of 20yrs since I originally saw it.",1063843200,3,539,4.934065934065934
1895505,4,B00009XN37,"THIS SET WILL BE MUCH MORE BETTER IF IT HAS ENGLISH SUBSTITLES.
IT SEEMS HEARING PROBELM IS NOT AN ISSUE IN UK AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY BBC KEEPS PRODUCING DISCS WITHOUT SUBTITLE FOR THE MILLIONS WITH HEARING DIFFICULTIES.
BESIDES, THE LANGUAGE USED IN THIS SITCOM IS WELL...TOO ENGLISH AND SUBTLE, WITH WORDS I HAVE NOT HEARD BEFORE. SO IT'LL BE A LOT HELPFUL IF THE BBC COULD MAKE FULL USE OF THE DVD TECH TO BENEFIT ITS CUSTOMERS.
ACTUALLY, THE YES MINISTER SERIES ARE NOT THE WORST CASE. THE LAST TIME I BOUGHT THE BLACK ADDER SET HOME AND TURN THE DISCS ON, I ALMOST WANTED TO RETURN IT AT ONCE BECAUSE I DIDN'T CATCH THE GAGS MOST OF THE TIME.
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF ASKING WHY BBC KEEPS DISAPPOINTING THOSE WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH OR HAVING HEARING DIFFICULTIES WHILE THE REST DO NOT.",1063497600,11,799,4.47945205479452
1895506,5,B00009XN37,"This is the finest political satire in existence. The ever verbose Humphrey almost always gets what he wants. Sometimes the Prime Minister gets a few unbridled moments of pleasure, however this is rare, the public service runs Great Britain, not the politicians. Written by two former British public servants, it's a fascinating insight into the real working of politics. Americans may find the humour hard to understand as the english vocabulary used is quite extensive, and if American sitcoms are anything to go by, the average vocabulary of an American is used twice over in an episode of Sesame Street.",1062633600,9,607,5.08
1895507,5,B00009XN37,"--Sir Humphrey.  The Yes, Minister episodes continue with Jim Hacker moving to #10 Downing Street, bringing along private secretary Bernard and, of course, reuniting with the newly promoted Sir Humphrey (whose sentences seem to get longer with each episode).  The audio level is better on this set than on the previous one.  The cover artwork is not as clean (there are scan lines through the images), but the back cover is very nice with new photos of the three main characters (no photos on the inside as there were in the previous 4-CD set).
The 17 brilliant episodes begin with the 1984 1-hour Christmas special that illustrated the chain events elevating Hacker to #10.  The special features include the Sir Humphrey's lengthy review of  the Yes Minister Diaries, ""Christmas at the Ministry"" clip, a 1986 Paul Eddington interview, Jonathan Lynn interview, and profiles on the main actors as well as others. A touching biography of Paul Eddington (Nigel Hawthorne was featured in the first set) in also included.  The bio includes scenes from 1950s Dixon of Dock Green, Adventures of Robin Hood, and many scenes from The Good Life and some insight on what Margaret Thatcher thought of Prime Minister Hacker.  Eddington's wife, Felicity Kendal, Hawthorne, and Derek Fowlds are among those interviewed.  It also includes very sad clips of one of Eddington's last interviews when he was suffering through the last stages of the skin cancer that took his life.  He handled his illness with much courage and the interviews with his friends and family reveals how fondly he is remembered and how many lives he touched.  This set is a must-have for Yes, Minister fans.  I have yet to search for the ""Easter Egg"" the box promises, so happy hunting.",1062374400,79,1744,4.938356164383562
1895508,5,B00009XN37,"The culmination of the ""Yes, Minister"" / ""Yes, Prime Minister"" series from the BBC! I was very happy to find out that the ""Yes, Prime Minister"" box set INCLUDES -- and BEGINS WITH -- the ""final"" episode of ""Yes, Minster"" called ""Party Games"", which was rarely seen in the US.
""Party Games"" was a ONE HOUR special Christmas episode; the show where Sir Humphrey becomes Cabinet Secretary and Hacker becomes PM.
Of course, all the episodes from ""Yes, Prime Minister"" are included.
DVD Special Features include some very interesting video clips. First, there's a bio on Paul Eddington, as well as an Eddignton interview broadcast at the start of the season. In addition, they included TV segments from BBC news shows which aired on the morning of the debut of ""Yes Prime Minister"" .  Coincidentally, I viewed that special feature first ... and I admit that I did feel the same ""anticipation"" that must have been felt in 1986!
A must-buy ... along with the box set of ""Yes Minister""!!!",1061942400,7,980,4.764705882352941

Unfortunately, the main character Paul Eddington, died quite a few years back with a melanoma Prior to this series he had starred in ""Good Neighbors"" a series even the Queen treasures.

1895599,5,B00009XN37,"So this series is to me, the penultimate political show. For those of us who are not British, some of the various jokes don't make complete sense. But the show itself shows the farce that is government in a lot of way, showing the political masters being subverted by their underlings, with a clear determination to get what they want.
The politics are a bit dated (cold war, etc), but still the overall theme of the show is still extremely relevant in the world. Its a shame the remake was not nearly as good, but how could they replace the three main actors with someone else? They were simply too good and its great we have a living testiment to their acting skills, comedic timing, and superb writing.",1469404800,2,705,4.515625

How unfortunate then that the Home Secretary should have been pulled over for drunken driving.
No, it couldn't be hushed up because he drove his car into a lorry (truck) loaded with nuclear waste, right before the eyes of a news reporter.
So he had to resign.
Then, with his hated enemy, the Home Secretary out of the way, the prime minister announces his retirement.
The civil servants, Sir Humphrey and Sir Arnold plot to place Jim Hacker into ""Number Ten"".
Jim has the attribute they want.  He can be easily manipulated.

So Jim becomes Prime Minister and the series ""Yes Prime Minister"" is born.  This series is a masterpiece of humour and satire.  Take it from me.  You will love it.",1438473600,3,783,4.686131386861314

Despite the fact that the series is almost thirty years old, it is still very, very funny and entirely capable of entertaining a new generation of Anglophiles.

1895786,5,B00009XN37,"Yes, Prime Minister is a political satire of the British governmental system. As a satire, it makes many hilariously funny (and surprisingly accurate) political points. The following line from Sir Humphrey Appleby illustrates the show's witty humor well: "" The purpose of clarification is not to make oneself clear; it is to put oneself in the clear! "" This TV show focuses on the conflict between the British Civil Service and the politicians. The acting is fantastic; every major actor/actress fit their role perfectly.

1895891,5,B00009XN37,"Without missing a beat the cast and writing of the phenomenal ""Yes, Minister"" segway nicely into the higher echelons of power.  After democracy in Britain ran its course (aka behind-closed-doors pressure and manipulation by civil servants) Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) became Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorn) became Cabinet Secretary and Bernard Woolly (Derek Fowlds) became Permanent Private Secretary to the PM.
Despite the gap of a few years between the production of ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes, Prime Minister"", this new series feels like the excellent writing and acting never stopped.  Frankly, the episodes of ""Yes Prime Minister"" deal with such hot-button, serious national and government issues that they makes the situations of ""Yes Minister"" feel like petty quagmires.  National defense, nuclear armament, economic turmoil, corruption in government, and diplomatic relations with other countries are made light and funny by the expert team of Anthony Jay and Johnathan Lynn.  However, the big issues are exhausted easily and the writers were smart to only write two series worth of episodes.  The cast are just as great, just in grander jobs within the British government, and the system of ""politician wants to change things... civil servants do everything they can to stop change... nothing changes in the end"" still applies at the highest level of government.
So enjoy more smart, witty comedy and watch how government really functions behind-closed-doors.",1409961600,,1525,5.5

1895957,5,B00009XN37,"Although somewhat dated due to it's 1980's release timeframe, the show remains remarkably ""current"" in that political concerns are a constant across the ages. The show, which exhibits the traditional British understated and ironic humor, is a fascinating and insightful look into the machinations, duplicities, contradictions, self-interests, and self-protecting characteristics of government. The show was a classic during it's time, but still remains a great form of entertainment today. And, as an added bonus, one can learn a bit more about the intricacies of British government as it existed both then and now. Highly recommended.

Note:
Now that the UK has voted for a ""Brexit,"" this show can be seen to demonstrate a prescient view of this event 40 years in advance. The show was made right as the UK was signing the first initial papers that moved the kingdom towards deeper integration with continental Europe, and I must say that now that this referendum has passed, watching this show takes on a whole new meaning, almost a historical artifact with unintended overtones.

 I won't swear to it, but Yes, Minister and its continuation, Yes, Prime Minister, may have been the first of the great political satires in TV series form. They follow the rise of a not-too-sharp minister to leadership, and the scheming civil service official who is really running the country.  These series, which were international hits, rip politicians to shreds with a deadpan gentility that is laugh-out-loud funny.  And, since political buffoonery is timeless, they work as well today as when they first aired. .

This is the daddy of shows like Amazon's Alpha House, House of Cards (US version, and older UK original), Hulu's charming Battleground, or the very mean though also brilliant and hilarious BBC series (free on Hulu here),The Thick of It (a show which also raises cursing to an art form).",1396828800,,853,4.855172413793103

The laughter is not 'canned' but authentically real.  Anybody could send off to the BBC for tickets free of charge, and be part of the audience.
It was an urban legend back in the day that the actors found performing these thirty minute scripts to be something of an ordeal for them.  If it was true, it certainly doesn't show.
Personally, I find the whole 'Yes, prime minister' saga to be as relevant today as it was back in the mid 1980s when the shows were first staged and recorded.  Usually in one take amazingly. I love the dry humour and the dark cynicism that never pales with the passing of time, but then I would wouldn't I, because I'm British.",1392681600,,794,4.308724832214765

1896256,5,B00009XN37,"Nothing much needs saying about this show, so here's the gist. Some people dread a sequel series, but I can assure everyone that the writing/scripting style is almost exactly identical to the original ""Yes, Minister"" series. We still have the triumvirate of Paul Eddington, Derek Fowlds, and Nigel Hawthorne. The dialogue is still witty, droll, and just a little bit naughty (but in that subtle way you either understand or you don't). The plots are still unflinchingly critical of politicians - but sometimes try to get to the root of what appears to be mere hypocrisy to passers-by.

And in a mixture of fierce hilarity and sad reality, this is also as timeless and timely as its predecessor. The only shame of this series is that they didn't make more episodes.

So sit back and put yourself in the capable hands of Sir Humphrey and his puppets (er, cohorts...er, bosses!).",1387756800,,876,4.833333333333333

While 1980's era politics may not sound funny, or even interesting to some, this series is absolutely hilarious.  Like all great humor it hits close to the truth.  Statements like, ""We freely admit everything to the press...that they would find out any way,"" show the two-faced nature of government and the sad but true way things are done.  British actor Tom Baker once told me that UK politicians watch the show so THEY can get a better understanding of how government works.

It brings forward issues and still disputed arguments over concepts such as democracy and self determination, public policy, state secrets, relationship with the media, foreign affairs, polling, budget, bureaucracy and leadership. Best of all, the comedy is applicable to U.S. politics. The show is rich in material and language. There is no need for junk or coarse language because it is very well thought out, to the point in which it is hard to even figure out the Prime Minister's ruling party. The comedy is for everyone and it really is funny. Personally, by having the training in political theories and thoughts, the show  sounds extra hilarious.

As always stuck in the middle trying his best to balance his loyalties to both and do the right thing for everyone is the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary Bernard Wooley played by the lovable and understated Derek Fowlds.

1896294,5,B00009XN37,"Yes Prime Minister is a very witty satire of, primarily, of the British Civil Service and political system (or at least of the time the show ran, which was the early to mid-1980s). However, it is more than that. It also satirizes, though to a smaller degree, other things British such as the class system, education and the arts (of the 1980s). As the show is quite subtle in its humor one does have to have an understanding of its topics to appreciate the series (i.e., role of the civil service in advising political figures, the English educational system, etc.). Hence many who are not familiar with these topics would not be able to appreciate the humor.

The show is extremely witty and quite well written. It is the very epitome of well written satire. The ancient Greek playwright Euripides once said something to the effect that satire, to be truly successful, has to be almost indistinguishable from what it attempting to satirize. Yes Prime Minister, along with its predecessor, Yes Minister, manage to hit this nail right on the head. It is as if the writers of this series are Euripides incarnate.

The one I watched last night, ""Big Brother"" (which was in yes minister) about admin running roughshod over personal information... You know, the technology may be a bit different, but the issue is the same bull...oney as we are seeing with FISA and the NSA today in 2013.

A Diplomatic incident turns a state funeral into a French farce, literally, when negotiations over the chunnel are endangered unless they can find a way to not accept a puppy (that would violate quarantine but would insult the French president and his wife who accepted the Queen's gift of a puppy on a previous visit). And then it gets complicated.

Definitely more true to life if you deal with a bureaucracy and office politics on a daily basis, but despite being rooted in the structure of the civil service and the UK political system, it's surprisingly relevant today.

Oh, and it's funny. Really funny. If you like quirky, character driven shows and don't need lots of explosions. No explosions.",1377561600,,1092,4.7368421052631575

The focus is always on the politicians (the ""party"" and the ""opposition""), and the civil service. The politics are mostly from a centrist viewpoint, and I don't think any but the most extreme wingers would find the subject matter objectionable. I'm not British, so I'm quite sure some of the more subtle humor is lost on me.

My wife had seen both series back in the '80s on TV. She raved about it, so we searched and found both of them. The acting is excellent, the comedy is constant, and fans of British TV shows will recognize many of the supporting characters, who have gone on to careers in many other TV series and some movies, as well. The DVD of YPM also has ""Extras"" that include interviews with some of the main characters - one of whom has since passed away.
  I find it to have been ""prophetic"" in its criticism and caricature of what happens when a nation has a ""big government"" perspective. Every episode offers explanations as to how ""big government"" comes about - and how it is maintained and expanded. All presented as some of the best comedy ever presented on TV.
  I highly recommend both ""Yes, Prime Minister"" and ""Yes, Minister"" to anyone who is interested in comedic political commentary that STILL TODAY relates to the policies and political atmosphere in the U.S. When I have more time, I want to send ""clips"" of their discussions of various governmental policies and issues to some of the U.S. talk show hosts.

Somehow, Britain is able to get its top actors to appear in sitcoms -- Dame Judi Densch springs to mind -- and this series continues that tradition with Sir Nigel Hawthorne and his worthy companions Paul Eddington and Derek Fowlds. Perhaps the key is writing of such quality that both liberals and conservatives would put aside their bickerings for half an hour to watch all sides get skewered.

However, I was so disappointed with the quality of the images. Dark shadows around the faces and when the people move you can see smears across the screen. It has the quality of a bootleg version. Not at all worth the BBC label. The effect is somewhat diminished when I run the episodes on my small screen laptop which is my only option.

1896435,5,B00009XN37,"This is the best political satire that I know of, exposing the hilarious relationships between a novice Prime Minister, his private secretary, and his civil service advisor representing Britain's government bureaucracy (known generally as Whitehall).  Americans who understand their own central government will recognize some similarity between Whitehall influence in framing the PMs decisions and the role of Presidential staffers and (sometimes) department secretaries in helping shape our president's understanding of, and positions on, complex policy questions. You will also note that lobbyists for special interests in Britain gets little coverage in this series because most of their focus in trying to shape national policy will be on ministers in the government's cabinet or on the relevant offices in Whitehall.

Almost all the humor derives from the hapless attempts of the Prime Minister to ""lead the nation"" and ""determine policy"" while dependent on his chief advisor who usually can, with hilariously convoluted argument, lead the PM to accept the advisor's position as his own. I have never had one program, except maybe ""Seinfeld"", that had me rolling on the floor with laughter so often.

1896441,5,B00009XN37,"""Yes, Prime Minister: The Complete Collection"" includes all 17 episodes of series on 3 discs. The first episode ""Party Games"", during which Jim Hacker MP is elevated to Prime Minister, is a one-hour special that aired in 1984 and is not officially part of the series. ""Yes, Prime Minister"" had two series of 8 half-hour episodes each that originally aired on the BBC 1986-1988. The characters are visibly older and not quite as funny as in ""Yes, Minister"", which ran 1980-1984, but it's still laugh-out-loud quality, and there are some real gems. The dynamic between Sir Humphrey Appleby (Sir Nigel Hawthorne) and now Prime Minister Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) has changed a little, as Hacker is beginning to feel that, as the PM, he should not be pushed around by a civil servant.

""Party Games"" finds Hacker, to his own surprise, in the running to become the next Prime Minister when the current one resigns and the civil service finds the leading two candidates for the job too independent-minded for their taste. Sir Humphrey is appointed Secretary to the Cabinet, replacing Sir Arnold (John Nettleton), and uses his position to maneuver the malleable Jim Hacker into Number 10. As PM, Hacker confronts issues such as Britain's nuclear deterrent, budget cuts, a complacent Foreign Office, appointing a Bishop, covering up a Soviet mole in MI5 during the Cold War, unemployment, bailing out an investment bank, making local government accountable, and coping with an potential international incident involving a puppy that France is using for leverage.

The funniest episodes are often the backroom power struggles, as when Sir Humphrey and the PM's sharp political advisor Dorothy Wainwright (Deborah Norton) fight over office space and influence, or when Sir Humphrey and Permanent Secretary of the Treasury Sir Frank (Peter Cellier) compete to be head of the civil service, or when the preceding PM makes unkind comments about Hacker in his memoirs. Writers Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn felt that the series would be too predictable if Sir Humphrey was always able to outwit Hacker, so, in ""Yes, Prime Minister"", Hacker sometimes uses the weight of his office to beat Humphrey at his own game. Out of 17 episodes, I observed that Sir Humphrey takes the day in 8 and the PM in 6. In the others, their interests are aligned.

This back-and-forth works well, not only because it is unpredictable, but because Jim Hacker is transformed from a hapless, well-intentioned MP to a pompous, self-important PM. The position has gone to his head. He's convinced that anything that might embarrass him will undermine the fabric of government. He is more frank, cynical, and interested in preserving the status quo than he was as an MP. In a way, this is not as funny, but, curiously, it posits that the PM may not have much power, after all, as he is more vulnerable to public opinion. For those who loved Sir Arnold in ""Yes, Minister"", he is back for 5 episodes. Sir Frank features in a few episodes. And Dorothy Wainwright is frequently the source of the PM's better ideas. Worth buying so you can watch it more than once.

The DVDs (BBC Warner 2003): This is a 3-disc set. My one complaint is that the volume must be turned unusually high to hear the dialogue clearly, as the laugh track is too loud in comparison. There are 7 bonus features. ""Funny Turns: Paul Eddington: A Life Well-Lived"" (26 min) is a BBC special about Eddington's life and career, made after his death in 1995, that interviews his wife Patricia and his closest colleagues about his long career and his final illness. ""Christmas at the Ministry"" (2 min) is a short sketch that aired on BBC-1 in 1982. ""Cabinet Minister Sound Bytes/Jonathan Lynn Interview"" (12 min) is an excerpt of a BBC program that interviewed Lynn and a number of former MPs in 1986 on the debut of the new series. ""Paul Eddington Interview"" (9 min) was done by his friend the actress Felicity Kendal in 1986. ""No, Prime Minister"" is a text review by Sir Humphrey of Hacker's diaries.

1896459,5,B00009XN37,"This series is very funny and a little sad.  The show aired in the eighties -I think- but the themes and the political discussions are much the same today as it was then.  The tone is very cynical and so also a bit scary.  It does not matter which party is in power, because they are both subject to the same rules and thus the same tactics to remain in power.  In the show, there is a line used by the civil service that ""Prime ministers (politicians) come and go, but the civil service (bureaucrats)always remain.""  I truly believe that the writers on these Brit shows are superior to any we have here the States.  I could not imagine coming up with the situations shown here and making them funny.  Its a very well written series. One word of caution...  I tried to share this show with some friends and they had trouble understanding the situations because of the differences in British government and a few had trouble with the accents.",1307491200,2,941,4.461988304093567

It would likely be helpful for current political leaders to see some of these episodes - they could learn that political and human interactions and reactions are timeless. Austerity budgets, concern about the Common Market, interactions with American industry and politicians are relevant today. I am always quoting "" But Minister, if Harrods sold missiles these are the missiles they would sell!"" The wit is incredible and I LOVE Sir Humphrey's character(and Bernard's dry witty comments under his breath). In Yes Prime Minister you can see the growing awareness of Jim Hacker about how to counter and manipulate Sir Humphrey so the characters evolve and grow. I can watch this over and over. Other than Last of the Summer Wine (when will ALL of that be available), these ""Minister"" series are the best written British Sitcoms over the last 30 years.

1896462,5,B00009XN37,Very funny series much funnier and better than a lot of the political government comedy's and drama programs these days.  Rip Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne(Sir Humpy)and Derek Fowlds are an amazing bunch.,1301097600,,209,5.333333333333333
1896463,5,B00009XN37,"There are simply not enough superlatives to describe the genius of ""Yes, Prime Minister."" British comedy has always been in a class above and beyond all else and ""Yes, Prime Minister"" as a mature comedy in my opinion sits at the very top of that class.
Each of the three main characters are played to pitch perfection by Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds. There is the Honourable James ""Jim"" Hacker, who finds himself suddenly elevated to the office of Prime Minister in a delightfully played out series of events in the final episode of ""Yes, Minister"" in ""Party Games."" The well-meaning, anxious-to-please, Hacker is, however, constantly thwarted in his designs by the mischievously loveable Sir Humphrey Appleby, ""Humpy"" to his friends, who considers it his duty not to allow politicians to interfere in anything as serious as governing a country. Finally, the long-suffering Bernard, as Principal Private Secretary to the PM, is constantly placed in the uncomfortable position of having to balance his loyalty to his Civil Service boss, Humphrey, and his obligations to his political master, the Prime Minister.
Humphrey can always be guaranteed to block Hacker by the use of his extensive verbal arsenal, interlaced with Latin, into a never-ending maze of incomprehensibility. Apart from the view of British politics, we also get an insight of the British worldview. The episode ""Diplomatic Incident"" for instance, is simply brilliant and hilarious in this regard. The supremacy of Oxford & Cambridge in academia & learning are constantly hammered home in the numerous instances where Hacker is reminded of the inadequacies of his own education at the LSE. The esoteric exchanges between Humphrey & Bernard regarding the finer points of Latin or Greek grammar, all in the presence of the befuddled Hacker, are annoyingly delightful but serve the same purpose.
The only times when Hacker seems to have a level-playing field with his Cabinet Secretary is when he is closely backed by his political adviser, Mrs. Dorothy Wainright, such as in the episode ""The Key"" or in the one instance when the adorably pompous Humphrey makes a series of indiscreet statements ""off the record"" which land him in hot water in the episode ""Tangled Web."" At the same time the series does also comment on some troubling aspects of politics, such as the symbiotic nexus between politics and media, and the manufacture of the contrived incident for political ends, as seen in ""Party Games."" Finally, although a minimum amount of understanding of British politics and terminology can be helpful (certainly viewing the ""Yes, Minister"" series will be very appropriate in this regard), but once immersed in this witty comedy even the unfamiliar viewer will be able to follow along in the corridors of power in Number 10 Downing Street, Whitehall and the Cabinet Office.

1896464,5,B00009XN37,I loved this series since I saw it on cable back in the late 80's and early 90's.  The satire and ironic humor is really great.,1276560000,,127,3.8846153846153846
1896465,5,B00009XN37,"I am not certain that there is much to be said in reviewing this series, as it is a self-evident fact that, when one considers the magnitude of the topics covered, and the overwhelming sense of obvious hilarity, it becomes blindingly, even conclusively, transparent that this is, not to put too fine a point on it, and taking into account the multifarious merits and demerits of the plethora of other television shows (produced both in Britain and its transatlantic ""cousin"") so as to accord them appropriate recognition for their indisputably meritorious contributions to the much lauded arena of unrefined comedic diversion, the single most amazing, hilarious and entertaining television show ever produced.
Which is to say, this (and its predecessor, ""Yes Minister"") is the best comedy show I have ever seen. Ever. Brilliantly funny, with crack performances from the entire cast, razor sharp but deliciously understated wit, and, of course, Sir Humphrey, the villain you can't help but love - whilst waiting with bated breath for his next speech.
The stories are simple enough in and of themselves - a sometimes less than efficient, but always well-meaning, Prime Minister who must always battle his underlings for each and every change he hopes to make. But don't let that fool you. This is comedy that will cause you to laugh out loud - and make you feel like your IQ went up ten points every time Humphrey opens his mouth. ;-) The only downside to this show is that the ""politics"" behind politics depicted herein rings so true of ""politics"" in general that one can only get the distinct sense...*ahem* Nevermind...you'll see what I mean when you watch it - and I strongly encourage you to do so! This really is the best of the best.

10/5 stars for this one!",1272931200,5,1764,4.88
1896466,5,B00009XN37,"""Yes, Prime Minister"" really has provided, in a most entertaining fashion, insight into to the way government really works.  It illustrates the difference in attitudes between the (theoretical) ephemeral nature of public office to the (almost) permanent nature of civil service.  Both are subject to the affects of corruption due to power, from elected officials' reoccupation with public opinion affecting all their actions regardless of their good intensions (if any) to the civil servants' almost total disregard of public opinion.  Both ""know"" what is best for the public.

The incredible thing is that when I had originally watched the series, I used to root for Hacker but later found myself taking some amount of sadistic glee over the manner in which Sir Humphrey gets his way. This series is one of the best ways to learn about politics, government and corridors of power in Britain. While the series has been abundantly exaggerated to create the element of comedy, sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. This is a series for intelligent viewers... each episode will seem better when you view it again.... there are far too many little details that you may not pick up on the first time round.

However, since no one else seems to have found it & I can't find it at imdb or moviemistakes or any other half-way competent sites revealing how the easter egg is to be accessed & what it contains, I feel it incumbent on me to do so here.

Go to the ""special features"" menu on disc 3 & move your mouse (if you're watching this on a computer) over to the line dividing the article on the left & the features menu on the right. Just to the left of the last item, ""Trailers"", a crudely drawn blue present will appear. Click on that & you will be given a clip from the ""Christmas Morning with Noel"" broadcast from 1987.

1896487,5,B00009XN37,"For all political junkies, I recommend ""Yes, Prime Minister"" as a possible substitute to the cancelled West Wing

The sequel to ""Yes, Minister"" is also filled with razor-sharp political humor and superb acting.  Paul Eddington - Jim Hacker, the PM - is very funny and is constantly at odds with his chief civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby played brilliantly by Nigel Hawthorne.

The show provides a cynical, realistic, and very entertaining look at politics and politicians in general and the British in particular.  From ""Yes, Minister"", Hacker's role has changed.  Instead of fighting the civil servants in his department, protecting his turf from his fellow cabinet colleagues, and appeasing the Prime Minister, Hacker as PM has only one objective: create his place in history.  Of course, he needs also to get re-elected.  The traditional conflict between the elected politicians, who think that they run the country, and the un-elected civil service, who more or less run the country, evolves further.  The political humor gets deeper and the policy issues discussed in these series range from the health effects of tobacco to appeasing all  the ""Continent"".

Paul Eddington's performance as an incompetent minister and later prime minister were so admired by Margaret Thatcher that she awarded him the honor of Commander of the order of the British Empire in 1987.

Like the preceeding Yes, Minister series, this one carries on with insightful satirical barbs on the comedy which sometimes is known as government bureaucracy and politics.

1896499,5,B00009XN37,"Jim Hacker, MP is Prime Minister of Great Britain.  At odds with him is the cabinet secretary and head of the home civil service, Sir Humphrey Appleby.  If you are not familiar with the inner workings of the British Government and Civil Service, the elected, political side is always at odds with the hired or permanent civil service side.  And poor, poor Bernard Wooley, the PM's Principal Private Secretary, technically a civil servant but also a servant of the Prime Minister is always caught between them in their struggles for dominance.

The series is hilarious, and my favorite episode is ""A Diplomatic Incident"" where the French try to present the Queen of England with a puppy as a gift at a state funeral (which would violate the nation's quarantine laws and therefore create a diplomatic incident) to get their way over the Channel-Tunnel negotiations.  The lines are priceless in that episode.  ""Darling, this is a working funeral!""...""Excellency, you must ask the president not to bring that b**** with him!""...""See if the Bulgarians have got any spare umbrella tips""

Other good ones include, ""Power to the People"", ""The Grand Design"", ""The Smoke Screen"", ""A Victory for Democracy"" and others.  There were a few I really didn't like but on the whole they didn't take away from the series as a whole so I'm still giving it 5 stars (besides, it's a DVD, you can select out what you don't want!)

1896501,5,B00009XN37,"At almost 20 years old now, this award winning series still represents the finer aspects of great British comedy. Set in the 80's in which it was made, it satirically mirrors the politics of the era with a wry and subtle genius that is a joy to behold. All that said, a little familiarity with British politics, or the British culture in general helps tremendously. I am not surprised at the success of this series here in the States, but the uninitiated viewer may be being sold a little short on the finer aspects of the characters, and the dry humor. Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) is the central character (following on from the Yes Minister series) thrust almost unwittingly into the limelight of the Prime Ministerial race, and sets about running the country with the same graceful ineptitude he applied to his previous ministerial post in the deparment of administrative affairs. Nigel Hawthorne is masterful as ""Sir Humphrey"" his ""advisor"" and head of the civil service who has his own agenda throughout, and plays all sides against the middle with varying levels of success. The final main Character is Hackers private secretary Bernard (Derek Fowlds) who often naively walks a middle line between helping the PM, but always being aware of his own allegiances to Humphrey (being a civil servant himself). This set begins with Hackers rise to power, and then contains all the subsequent episodes where the three characters play out some hilarious, and often thought provokingly satirical situations in a balanced and polished collection. Being a topically based political comedy obviously has its pitfalls, and those too young to remember the ""Thatcher"" years of British government, soviet spies, and the peaks and troughs of the economy during the 80's may view this a somewhat bland. I'm not suggesting for one minute that ANY viewer would not find great comedy in watching this collection, but it has to be said that it will almost certainly appeal to a narrower audience ultimately. Lots of extra's on the DVD collection and BBC video are to be congratulated on the excellent picture and sound quality of the presentation.

The central theme fueling this wonderfuly written and performed series is the never ending conflict between the permanent unelected Civil Service(big government if you will)who administer policy and the elected, yet oh so temporary politicians(self serving populists if you will) who make the policy. There are valid and hilarious skewerings of all sides, all beliefs and all conceits. This is equal opportunity satire and well worth the rather high cost. Rather educational as well.
