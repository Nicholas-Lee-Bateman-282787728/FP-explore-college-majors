3594881,5,B001G1FL4C,Hang on to youth when it's gone and this is what happens.  Should be required viewing for every guy over forty.  Hilarious.  (Especially the anger management sessions--Coogan's description of his drug use is sidesplitting),1267142400,2,222,5.470588235294118
3594882,4,B001G1FL4C,"My girlfriend brought this over a few weeks after we'd watched Hamlet 2.  I kindof groaned because I felt like Hamlet 2 was stupid mainstream Scary Movie-type crap.  Devoid of subtlety.

But Saxondale is really clever and fun, and has one of the best title sequences ever.  Too bad they edited that part down for the second season.

I really like the concept of a hardcore roadie who toured with all of the rock greats, now in his 50s and having to deal with the realities of a 9-5 job and suburban malaise.  The characters all have endearing quirks and interesting relationships.  It's definitely a good change of pace from American sitcoms.",1242518400,3,642,4.678571428571429

3594884,5,B001G1FL4C,"Saxondale is hilarious, charming and witty.  Anyone who is a fan of Steve Coogan's other shows like Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge will already know this. Coogan made an all too brief appearance in the Hollywood blockbuster hit ""Tropic Thunder"". It was just about the only funny moment in that train wreck of a movie, but it certainly was a hilarious turn.
Saxondale shows off Coogan's funniest and most human sides to date. This show would never air in America because the FCC has it's head up it's you know what.  It is a BRITISH SHOW, yet anyone can relate to the frustrations and joys of Tommy Saxondale.
Buy this DVD and enjoy.  Then you can show it to your friends and lovers and watch in amazement as they realize (finally) just what a cultured and well rounded person that you really are!",1236124800,2,808,4.558620689655172
3594885,5,B001G1FL4C,"Coogan has done it again, in this very original suburban comedy. The rock humor and how he flip-flops or changes his belief system whenever it suits him is outstanding.  The episodes with Coogan as the mod/emo kid Keanu Reeves are especially funny.  What an original show!!",1234137600,6,273,4.913043478260869
3594886,4,B001G1FL4C,I enjoyed every episode of this show and thought it was a good character but it pales in comparison to Alan Partridge. Now where is the second season of Alan Partridge Region 1?,1231113600,3,177,4.393939393939394

3594888,5,B001G1FL4C,What a great show.  I really liked the character.  The second season is better in that he looses the makeup in favor of his own beard!,1385510400,2,134,4.115384615384615
3594889,4,B001G1FL4C,"Steve Coogan plays Tommy Saxondale, a former rock band roadie for the big acts of the 70s who is now a pest control man in Stevenage, UK. Tommy is completely and quite proudly out of step with the world and while clearly an intelligent guy he has serious issues relating to things without resorting to 1970s comparisons. Each episode starts with him disrupting an anger management group session he is attending before moving on to the story.
He lives with his girlfriend Mags who is an offbeat but very kindhearted woman and their relationship is clearly the best thing in his life. He's also taken on a young assistant who adds a droll straight man quality to the proceedings.
Very funny at times and actually quite intelligent humor at that. I found that the more I watched the more I enjoyed. Coogan gets off a lot of very good sarcastic lines in his role as Tommy the outsider.",1384041600,,881,4.582278481012659
3594890,5,B001G1FL4C,I love this series and am so happy that I found it!!  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys British comedy! And the product was received when I was told it would and in perfect condition.,1382659200,,194,4.243243243243243
3594891,3,B001G1FL4C,".....but it's a good 'un.

He's a 70's rock burnout never-was still trying to maintain an aura of cool in a shit job to an uncaring world.

Some of the bits repeat themselves too much (like the lady back at the office who keeps letting him know how unhot he is) and the supporting cast is not up to Alan Partridge standards.

A solid rental, but not a buy.",1377129600,,356,4.130434782608695
3594892,5,B001G1FL4C,"First.  Both seasons are showing on Netflix.

I've watched both seasons several times and they never get dull or boring.  There's just so much to laugh about.  His manners, his actions, his phrases and language.  Hilarious!  My girlfriend is now hooked on the show!  She sometimes finds it hard to catch every comment because of his accent and choice of words and phrases....but when I explain what the English terms mean, she just cracks up laughing.

I wish he made more but the best Tv shows never do.  The Office (UK) and Fawlty Towers are 2 examples.

The opening scene of each episode, where he's in the anger management class, is just too funny.

Tommy: ""I'm gonna leave now for two reasons. One: I don't want to lose my temper, which I think you'll agree shows some growth, and two: this clown's just let one go... don't deny it.""

LMAO",1365552000,,844,4.553333333333334
3594893,5,B001G1FL4C,"This show is brilliant. I wish there were more seasons. I keep telling friends that play music that they have to watch this show, but I don't want to lend them my copy for fear it will be scratched. Fortunately, Netflix put the show back up on streaming, so it's accessible if you have that service.",1364947200,3,299,4.357142857142857
3594894,5,B001G1FL4C,"Hilarious! I watched this over three times while it was available streaming over the past year. When it was no longer available to stream it became a must have purchase.

Steve Coogan has a unique comedic genius. He is a master of character acting, so much so that he has two roles in this show, and after four viewings I had never realized it till watching the extras! Neil Maclennan and Steve Coogan display remarkably convivial insight into the human psyche with each unique, funny and touchingly human character they created for the series.

I enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knowing-Me-Knowing-You-with-Alan-Partridge-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0009RQRF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;well enough, but I absolutely adore Saxondale. This show has immense replay value. With only 13 half hour episodes you can kick back and watch the whole show on a rainy day whilst you laugh yourself silly.

The show has genuine momentum. Each episode builds upon the humor from the last, by the final episode your stomach will ache from laughing at Tommy's rollicking antics. The only regret I have about this purchase is that its not available on Blu-ray. The DVD quality is acceptable, but you'll be laughing so hard that you won't notice that its not in HD.",1330732800,8,1370,5.576923076923077
3594895,5,B001G1FL4C,"This show is hilarious and filled with so many jokes about music, you won't get them all, but that's because Tommy is smarter than you... but is he?",1327449600,2,148,4.321428571428571
3594896,5,B001G1FL4C,"I am buying this because it is about to no longer be available on Netflix.  I have seen all the episodes more than once and still want it.

This as far as I can recall was my first exposure to Coogan.  He is very believable in his roll.
I have since seen him in other roles such as Lies and Alibis and seeing him closer to his real self shows his acting ability is great.  I now want to see his other comedies.

It does not hurt that my first car at age 16 was a yellow Mustang Mach One like he drives on the show.  Though he does in error call it his Boss 351 which was a different car.

I don't know why this show only lasted two seasons.  I think it is great. Must be something different about great British TV comedies.  There are even fewer of the great series Fawlty Towers starring John Cleese.  Oh well I guess we are luck to have what we do.

The start of each episodes anger management sessions are always a great start.  His consistent mentioning of great 70's rock bands and attitude towards new music is humorous, and not all that off base IMO. If you are middle aged you can likely relate to many of his attitudes in the shows even if they are tinged British a bit.  This is on Netflix but they said it was going get cancelled though still in my queue.  Even so if they do I will be buying this set as it is the sort that you can watch multiple times and still find both the repeats humorous or catch new bits you may have missed in a previous viewing.  If you can preview it in such a way that may prompt you to want to own the entire series.  If not a member then I would certainly still risk it if you either like Coogan's work or Brit TV comedy in general as it is one of the best.

I was very convinced of Coogan's character Tommy on this show when I had not seen him yet.  He does an very convincing job of believing in his character (and perhaps in some way relating to parts of it).

There are other characters that help fill out the show but Coogan is the stand out for sure.  Several regulars and even saw one show featuring an actor that appeared in Harry Potter films.

There are a total of 13 episodes covering the two seasons and I only wish there were more.  But it is the sort of thing that you can enjoy watching more than once as I have already done so and am still purchasing this.

I like Black Adder and the UK version of The Office and Wilfred (along with the US versions also) and this fits in with my tastes for British TV comedies.

This is one of my all time favorites so I find it hard to imagine anyone reading these reviews to get an idea of what it is about and not liking it after purchase.",1322438400,2,2635,4.032755298651252
8303640,5,B001G1FL4C,"Probably the best TV comedy to come out of Britain since Python, and just as timeless.",1500854400,,86,4.4375
8303641,5,B001G1FL4C,"How Steve Coogan isn't a huge star, I will never understand. What? Oh, he is. Well now I understand even more than if I'd read. 'How to Understand Stuff' by Edgar Leroy McGuff. (Don't bother looking it up, it only exists in my mind). Coogan is a wonderful comic actor and, even when he's playing a smug, know-it-all, pain in the neck, like Saxondale, he does it brilliantly and makes you feel empathy with the character.

This is a truly wonderful comedy show that should be bigger than Game Of Thrones. Well, ok, maybe not bigger than Game Of Thrones, but bigger than Peter Dinklage.  Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's really good, in a really great kind of way.

You'll need to brush up on your classic rock trivia to get a lot of the references in this series, but it's well worth the effort. This is undoubtedly the best show, about a former rock band roadie who now runs a pest control business, ever made.

Buy it, you won't regret it... unless you regret everything, in which case this will be right up there with your favorite regrets of things that you bought at the same time as you bought this.",1495152000,,1108,4.416666666666667

8303646,5,B001G1FL4C,"This is a very, very clever, quirky vehicle for Steve Coogan (who co-writes).  Steve plays Tommy Saxondale, a 70s roadie who toured with Deep Purple and a number of other significant bands (but not with Led Zepa continuing joke).  He now works in Stevenage as a pest control specialist.  He lives with his partner Magz, a charming, obese operator of a tee-shirt store in a mall.  Her store is called Smash the System.  He has recruited an assistant, Raymond, who also lives with them.

Each episode begins with an anger-management encounter group meeting in a childrens school and each episode includes some banter with his office manager/job broker, Vicky, a passive-aggressive who has dedicated her life to getting under Tommys skin.  The second season adds a smarmy neighbor, Jonathon, who sells phones and kisses up to their neighborhood association board.

Coogan wears a fright wig (his own hair in the second season), beard, moustache, prosthetic brown-stained teeth and a padded mid-section.  The humor comes from dazzling writing, rapid-fire dialogue, clever pop-culture references (`a la Dennis Miller) and from Coogans accents, timing, facial moves and postures.  The character is a complex onecountercultural in some ways, conservative and even apolitical in others.  Tommy knows his history, not just that involving pop culture.  He has a wry, cynical, but also good-humored take on the world.

Some of the British cultural references will be tricky for international audiences, but there are so many hilarious lines that that is a small price to pay.  Coogans timing is something special and all of the supporting cast play off of him very effectively.

Each show is just under 30 minutes in length, so this is the perfect series to fill in gaps in your TV schedule.  Each episode is hilarious, high-energy entertainment.

Most American audiences will know Steve Coogan from his performance in the film Philomena.  His films The Trip and The Trip to Italy are excellent.  I will be reviewing his earlier work as Alan Partridge in a future post.  He is one of the most inventive comic voices in contemporary entertainment and a most impressive writer.  If you have not yet discovered him, you have a treat awaiting you.",1432944000,,2232,5.076923076923077

8303649,3,B001G1FL4C,"This was disappointing. Steve Coogan is usually extremely funny and enjoyable in all of the stories I've seen him, but this is just silly and not enjoyable.
