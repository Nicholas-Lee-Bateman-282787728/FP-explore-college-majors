Get your lazy butts off your couch and type a little more information on it. I guarantee there were people who looked at this dvd just like me and decided not to buy it because you guys are freaking lazy.",1285545600,3,361,4.171428571428572
8340563,1,B001T4Y1CE,"Two things really bug me about this dvd.  FIRST. This dvd is only 43 min. long.  My bad for not reading the posted run time according to Amazon.  Whem the Military Chnl origanally aired this, it was a four part series, running an hr each part.  I haven't had a chance to watch the whole disk to see what was edited out, put obviousley a lot was. SECOND  and MOST IMPORTANTLY...THIS DISK WILL NOT, say again, WILL NOT PLAY IN A REGULAR DVD PLAYER!! I've tried it in 3 different ones.  The bootleg quality menu comes up, but the movie will not play.  It works in my laptop, thats about it.  I contacted the discovery channel store to find out what the problem is, & they told me they had nothing to do with the production of this dvd, that it was an amazon only product, produced by amazon for sale on amazon.  What little I've watched is AWSOME, I just feel cheated by the viewable content being so short, and being non-compatable with any conventional dvd player I've come across.",1250208000,13,980,4.370165745856354
