8201380,2,B000RMHV5I,"Despite what it erroneously says on IMDb, Emmanuelle Arsan did NOT write the story, nor is the script based on her work. I had to buy an import DVD of this depressing turkey to find that out. I like Erika Blanc, but she did not get to play the Emmanuelle created by Arsan.

This is about a depressed young woman sleeping with a variety of characters (male & female) while on a road to self-destruction. The message is actually very anti-sex, and morally condemning... unlike Arsan's work. Hope this clarifies, and I advise anyone who disagrees with me to watch the DVD and stare at the credits carefully! I did, and was crestfallen when I realized there was no connection.

I'm shocked at how many people online post the wrong info without fact checking. Every time someone corrects IMDB or wikipedia, someone else puts this dud back on there!",1259366400,,843,4.651006711409396
