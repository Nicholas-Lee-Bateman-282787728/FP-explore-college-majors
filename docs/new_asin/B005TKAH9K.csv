If you are in to folkloric dance - this video is for you. Steps and combos well explained, so have fun!",1414022400,2,270,5.3023255813953485
8486318,3,B005TKAH9K,"After seeing the dabke performed, I looked forward to learning it as well as other fun, high-energy folk dances.  Well, the mood of this DVD wasn't very fun - actually, the 2 women in the background dressed in very drab clothes accompanying one man like he was their guru gave off kind of a creepy vibe.  Maybe the technical instruction on these dances is good, and Nagi seems to have good credentials.  I just didn't feel inspired to dance by his lessons.",1349827200,7,456,4.536585365853658
