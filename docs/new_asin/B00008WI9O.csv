1865340,3,B00008WI9O,"... Anyway, if i were to grade this as a critic, I would've given it a 2. It's not Martin Lawrence's best work, but it has it's funny parts and the action's fair.
The thing that really annoyed me was the amount of racist jokes. Sure, Martin Lawrence doesn't mean to insult everyone, but it seems like everyone's aganist the white cop, and he never really gets back at Lawence. Is this how black people felt about ""Undercover Brother""? Anyway, all of that aside, it is a good movie in some ways. It has your usual Martin Lawrence jokes, which is disappointing to some people, but to a lot more, it's just fine. Martin plays the same thing as he does in just about every single other movie he's in...a cop. Well, not at first, he isn't. At first, he plays a rejected LAPD trainee who just got booted. Cracky and upset, he makes his way back to his car, when he realizes he left his keys inside. He reaches his hand in the half open window, making it appear he's trying to [take] the car, so a cop stops to talk to him. That's when the ""because I'm black"" lines start. I won't reveal what happens between the two, because that's a main part in the movie, but anyway, the cop is cranky as well because his partner was recently killed. The movie's a normal length, about an hour and a half, but in some parts you feel like you've just got done seeing The Two Towers. Corny and unbelievable, you can't go to see this movie with hopes of ""Dr. No"", not that anyone does, but this Lawrence movie does have an unusaully high action level.
Go see this sometime. Bring a friend. Ignore the paper and the critics.",1042848000,7,1600,4.318936877076412

Instead of being even the slightest bit funny it is offensive and stupid.
Steve Zahn was understated and garnered audience sympathy, but couldn't save this sinking ship even if he possessed super powers.

This movie however is a funny movie. Martin Lawrence is in rare form as he plays the race card and pretends to be a victim of police brutality. The funniest moments are when the alleged abuser is facing his captain.

1865476,4,B00008WI9O,"National Security is much funnier than I went in expecting, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised with Martin Lawrence as main character.  He's usually always hilarious and delivers with the laughs once again here.  It's about a cop who loses his partner during a shooting incident and eventually his replacement becomes Martin Lawrence when the two of them find themselves unintentionally teaming up to shoot down the bad guys in a soda factory.

This movie is based around fast-paced shooting or car chasing segments that are totally outrageous and far-fetched, but this *is* Hollywood after all.  The humor comes in the way the character of Martin Lawrence and his partner communicate with each other.  They are total opposites in every single conceivable way and yet, they somehow eventually become the perfect partners for a major assignment.

National Security isn't the funniest movie out there of course, but for a fairly brief display of comedic value (around 80 minutes long and that's it) it's pretty satisfying.  I especially like the bumblebee scene which leads to a beat down and speculation of sorts, and the cop who tries to take control during a critical situation by forcing a woman out of her car but ends up having to deal with the woman taking exception to being forced out so he ends up riding in the back seat instead!  These are two examples of solid writing.

Overall, National Security is a pretty funny movie and one I highly recommend watching with your family.",1316649600,,1488,4.896414342629482

Lawrence gets tossed from the LAPD Police Academy for his antics, and Zahn is booted for supposedly beating Lawrence in a traffic stop.  Further injustice is added by Zahn losing his girl friend because of his supposed racist act.

Both become security guards and accidentally meet while a major burglary takes place at a location they are supposed to protect.  A few arrests (dismissed) and silly chases later they apprehend the bad guys (including a couple of bad cops), Zahn is restored to his LAPD status, Martin is placed on the force, and of course, they become partners.

In short, the acting and the plot are average, while the humor and the dialogues are slightly below average.

Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting, not to mention that to call the ending ""predictable"" is the understatement of the year!

In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.

No masterpiece here... 2   Stars",1131321600,,539,5.068181818181818
1865501,3,B00008WI9O,"I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies. But compared to his other movie of 2003 (that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II), National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs. A lot of them, surprisingly, coming from Lawrence himself.

Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn)is a cop who is unfairly thrown in jail for apparently beating a black suspect (Lawrence) who just got kicked out of Police Academy. With his career in tatters he emerges from the slammer with only one job opportunity available; a lowly guard for a lowly security company. Determined to follow up on the big case he was involved with before serving time, he crosses the path of fellow security guard Earl Montgomery (Lawrence again) and the two reignite their old conflict.

The old love/hate buddy thing may be old and the plot may be silly but it's a great excuse for loads of action set-pieces and humor. The potentially dangerous comedy of black vs white never becomes offensive and is handled with such lightness that it never becomes an issue. Both men have their failings and bonuses and are as equal as each other. You really do feel a great partnership between them despite their arguing and fights.

Give National Treasure a try. It's slick and fast-moving and is a helluva lot better than Bad Boys II. You'll probably be surprised at how funny Martin Lawrence is. I was.

The DVD is in great looking 1.85:1 widescreen with pretty good Dolby 5.1 sound. The scenes where Lawrence uses his automatic pistol really pack a heavy punch in the .1 LFE channel. The usual deleted scenes and commentary are included on the DVD but I was surprised the extended ending wasn't included in the film.

These two guys end up working as security guards for the same company (named National Security). Then the two team up to halt a smuggling ring as well as try to uncover corrupt LA officials if they can stay one step ahead of the real police and not kill each other at the same time. I think the 'because I'm black'/victim mentality adds to the humor of Lawrence's character and Zahn is well cast as Lawrence's sidekick. Or is Lawrence Zahn's sidekick?
 Anyway, I thought the added features with the alternate and deleted scenes were interesting. I also felt that the alternate ending (which is included in this special edition) should have made the final cut. Overall I enjoyed this movie.

When, six months later, the two find themselves unwittingly together as security guards protecting a warehouse during a heist, they team up to track down the bad guys.  Lawrence is funny at first with his poor-oppressed-black-guy routine, but it gets tired - and even offensive - fast, mostly because Earl is such a buffoon; he seems too clownishly stupid to be much more than a stereotype.  Hank is the straight man, and you can't help feeling sorry for him as he endures Earl's completely misguided riffs.  Yeah, this film has some laughs, especially during the slapstick scenes, but they are either mild or mindless, fine as long as you don't expect uproarious comedy.

The movie centers around Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence), a security officer, and Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn) an ex-police officer who turns security officer after what seems to be a phony Rodney King type beating. Now, this is where the movie starts to go wrong. It takes the typical black/white man stereotype and turns it into a cop movie that dares to enter where no one has gone before- make consistent black jokes from a black guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm not using black in a derogatory way, but merely to point out that these ""African-American"" or so called black jokes are unfunny and dull.
Later, the two somehow stumble upon a plot to take a precious metal-alloy that will make a crooked cop and some other thiefs rich. By coincidence, this group is also responsible for Hank's partners death. Because of this, Hank goes to revenge his partner.

So there's lots of reverse racist slurs present in the script, but hey; I live in NZ: Land Of The Half-Witted Foreshore Debate. Aeoter-farttaxicus. So I can handle it. No prob, Bob.
The mismatched pair reluctantly (as is always the case) team up to catch the monotonous villain- played by Eric ""Julia's brother"" Roberts, a token drug dealer. Though Eric was admittedly good as ""The Master"" in that DR WHO TVM a few years back. Unfortunately he hasn't been good in much before or since.
At first glance this appears to be LETHAL WEAPON with the races reversed- but that would be an insult to the ""classic"" series. You needn't worry, NATIONAL SECURITY is far too pedestrian to come close to reaching the heights of even LW4.
There's lot's of crass humor- minus the laughs, car chases & general mindless stupidity. The leads have about as much onscreen chemistry as Stallone & Estelle Getty in STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT & are just as obnoxious.

Add to that the comedy action genre that proved more than successful with films like Bad Boys and I Spy, and I was expecting to spend a good entertainng hour and a half.
How disappointed I was: it was one of the very few films that had I watched it in a theatre, I would made my excuses and fled, whereas thanks to my fast forward key on my DVD remote, which I had to use several times, the agony of boredom was minimized.
The problem with National Security is not the acting. All actors are good, even including Eric Roberts who was terribly miscat for this yet another baddie role. I rather blame the plot, script and directing.
An example of how bad the script is, is in a scene when Zahn, a policeman is prosecuted for an alledged beating of Lawrence.(he was instead trying ot kill a wasp!?! is this not remotely funny or what?).He gets six months in jail, and the next second he comes out and works for a security firm.
He then by chance meets Lawrence again (who happens to help prosecute him and was in court for the trial) and he tells him he got six months because of him. Lawrence is shocked and asks: six months only??
And it gets only worse after that.
Moreover I think the writers were pretty confused about Lawrence's character, as we are first introduced to him as this inexplicably over the top unstable man. In addition to that the film is full of over stretched cliches about Caucasians and African-Americans.
Trust me this film is pretty bad, and waste of time for really talented actors, and a proof that a movie to succeed it is imperative that it should have the right good combination of acting, directing and script..remove one and you will end up with a big flop!",1062460800,2,1853,4.452941176470588

Zahn's character loses his job as a cop after being accused of beating up Lawrence but both characters come together and inevitably become best buddies in the end.  It's not the best Lawrence movie out there and when you compare it to some of his best (bad boys, blue streak) it downright disappointing.

1865567,3,B00008WI9O,"""National Security"" is yet another Martin Lawrence buddy cop comedy that falls a little short of his previous work.
THE STORY:
Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn) is a cop whose partner got killed on the job.  Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence) is a cop wannabe with a ""white man holding down the brother"" attitude who's too much of a loose cannon to get on the force and is thus reduced to being a security guard.  After a minor altercation between Hank and Earl that gets blown to Rodney King proportions Hank is out of a job and in jail.  After serving his time Hank is reduced to becoming a security guard.  Following the trail of the men who murdered his partner, Hank finds that he must now team up with the man who put him in jail to stop a smuggling ring and avenge his fallen partner.
THE COOL THINGS:
Overall, the story is somewhat, neigh, VERY predictable but is filled with some decent action and some decent comedy.  That's about it though...
THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
Like in most of his movies, Martin Lawrence's comedy is clearly the driving force behind the film.  Unfortunately in this particular flick they lost quite a few steps.  Earl's ""White Man out to get the brother"" shtick wears thin VERY quickly and the character becomes pretty annoying after a while.  The tension between the two characters is played out very well and Earl does get his comeuppance but Earl's character is easily more of an annoyance to the viewer rather than the fun guilty pleasure most Lawrence characters usually are.
BEST SCENES:
No real best scenes in this film.  Everything is basically one huge joke as Hank and Earl work they way around.
THE DVD EXTRAS:
As far as DVDs go, this one is pretty sparse with the only things of note being the requisite commentary track and the alternate ending.  Here's what you get:
1. Director's Audio Commentary Track - decent as always
2. 2 Deleted Scenes - pretty much rubbish stuff
3. Alternate Ending - decent alternate ending that could have worked
4. Music Video - some rap song by some rappers, ehhh
5. Trailers for National Security, Bad Boys II and Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle
THE VERDICT:
Well, yet another Martin Lawrence buddy cop comedy.  Some things worked here, some things didn't.  This was easily the worst of his efforts.  While the basic plot of the film worked the Earl character was just a bit too much.  Again, some nice subtle potshots about racial relations usually work best but Earl's character was just way too much.  While the movie had some pretty funny stuff comedy wise and some decent action, Lawrence's character more annoying than funny.
The DVD extras are almost non-existant so you don't get that much value for your buck here other than the movie itself and handful of extras.
THE GRADES:
The Move:  2 stars
The Extras:  3 stars
Overall:  2.5 stars
There's some decent action with some funny stuff if you can stand Earl's mouth.
Mild Recommendation:  Stick with Blue Streak or Bad Boys",1060560000,7,2952,4.695145631067962

Earl mouths off, and then panics when a bumblebee tries to sting him. A tourist catches the incident on film, and poor Hank is sent to the slammer.
I actually LIKED National Security, the acting was well done, some of the gags were humorous, and the dynamic between Earl and Hank was funny.
The downside: At times the racist bile spewed by Earl went a bit too far. I also found the Earl character a bit difficult to like. He was bigoted, emotionally needy, craving Hank's approval, and  at the same time rejecting him because he was white.  The sad thing was, this behavior is constantly being rewarded. This left me with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling. I would've liked to see  Hank and Earl learn to respect each other, and for Earl to apologize for not being honest at the trial and for Hanks' incarceration. Moreover, I guess, I would've liked to have simply LIKED Earl, and for Earl to be more engaging.

I don't understand why so many people are put off.  Lawrence was hardly subtle in playing a black Rodney-Kingesque character who then has to team up with the white cop who allegedly abused him.
And Lawrence's character is put in his place later in the film when he finds that the Steve Zahn character has a black girlfriend.  I admit that this was a little heavy-handed, but that's how this movie goes.
That said..it was not a great movie.  it was very predictable in plot.  I knew right away who the bad guys would turn out to be, and pretty much how the story would unfold.

This film revolves around a man (Martin Lawrence) who is trying to be a cop. He gets kicked out of the police academy and must resort to being a security guard. One day he comes face to face with a police officer (Steve Zahn) who accidently thinks Lawrence's character is breaking into a car. What happens next looks like a Rodney King beating, but really isn't. Zahn's character is sent to jail and when he gets out can only find a job as a security guard. Zahn's partner was also killed, so once he's out of jail, he's on a quest to find his partner's killer. Lawrence and Zahn then team up, under crazy circumstances, to find the killers and bring them to justice.
There are a few funny moments in the movie, but they are far and few between. Martin Lawrence's previous films, such as ""Bad Boys"" and ""Nothing to Lose"" were much better and funnier. I would have to agree with others when they say there were too many racial jokes throughout the film. Just about every sentence that came out of Martin's mouth had some sort of racial slur in it. After awhile it became very annoying.
Those who really enjoy Martin Lawrence's films may enjoy this movie, but I would suggest just leaving this one on the shelf and waiting for ""Bad Boys 2"" to come out this summer.",1055721600,12,1363,4.456

1865593,3,B00008WI9O,"As with Kangaroo Jack and Darkness Falls this is another entry that makes me question the rating system anymore. National Security is a title that five years ago would of been R for language. Today it is PG-13.
The story behind National Security is that Martin Lawrence is training to be part of the LAPD. However with that mouth of his and recklessness he never passes training. Steve Zahn is a cop who just lost his partner in a shoot out. Martin Lawrence one day accidentally locks his keys in his car and is trying to reach in to open up his car. Zahn shows up thinking Lawrence is trying to steal the car. LAwrence starts throwing his mouth and eventually Zahn trys to arrest him, a little more forcefully but still trying to arrest him. Then a Bee shows up which Lawrence is allregic to. Zahn trys to swat it as Lawrence is screaming like a school girl and a family get this all on tape. Zahn is arrested and goes to jail for 6 months. WHen he gets out he becomes a security guard. From there he inadvertadly ends up working with Lawrence and they get tangled in a big crime scheme.
The reason this should of been R is language, probably the deciding factor in many films.  LAwrence uses every piece of profanity in the book with this movie and it still ends up with a PG-13 rating.  Overall this movie should of been R or at least found something less colorful for the dialouge.

1865598,2,B00008WI9O,"Well, the problem is that Martin Lawrence is worthy of a much better script.  One might also expect something better from the Director of such hits as Big Daddy & Happy Gilmore, even Problem Child! This is actor/director Dennis Dugan's first film since 2001's Saving Silverman (also featuring Zahn), which wasn't very good but did have some funny moments.  National Security has its moments too, but there are too few.  Still, I don't blame the Director, the fault is in the writing.  When I found out that the guys that wrote ""I Spy"" & ""Serving Sara"" wrote this, it started making sense. Martin Lawrence (also exec producer, whatever that means) seems to be doing a lot of cop comedies - Bad Boys, Big Momma's House (he's FBI in that), and Blue Streak, not to mention Bad Boys 2 and Blue Streak 2 coming soon!  Seriously.  Granted each of those roles has a twist, but here he is once again in a similar role playing a security guard/cop wanna be in National Security.  I'm a big Martin Lawrence fan, but National Security just wasn't very good in comparison to those other films.  The major weak spot is the running racial jokes (""DWB = driving while black"", ""Even the light is white!"", ""I'm against interracial relationships, when the man is white."", blah blah blah).  Actually by the time that last line came, the theatre audience I was with on opening night was dead silent.  The fact that Martin's character acts like he doesn't like white people is hammered in to the viewers head and anything that might be funny about this is drained out about half way into the film.  There are also stereotypes of black people, a lot of them played out through Lawrence's character and others like the woman who Zahn's character orders to get out of her car and then the she slaps him like 3 times and goes crazy.  How many times have you seen this in a movie? Lawrence's other films are strong because they can appeal to anyone and racial humor is all but non-existent.  This film in no way measures up to his other films in laughs.  There are funny parts, actually very funny parts, but they're almost eclipsed by the continuous ""joke"" that must remind us every 5-10 minutes that ""by the way, Martin's character hates whitey!  ha, ha, ha!""  Oh yeah, I liked how they had to ""justify"" the white cop and show he wasn't a racist by giving him a black girlfriend (Did they actually ever kiss each other? and if she loved him, wouldn't she know he didn't lie about beating Martin's character? Guess not.)  Also the only cop of high rank who wasn't crooked was the black cop, nice touch.  This movie doesn't just casuaully use racism as a source of humor...it's obsessed with racism.  Its like the writers just ran out of ideas and said what could we make Martin's character like...I know, he can dislike white people and mention it every 5 minutes!  This is the last kind of movie this country needs right now.  If its point was to show how stupid racism is, that would be different, but instead it just treads the same territory and uses the same old tired racial ""jokes"" & stereotypes that have been done to death.  Wow, I thought ""Black Knight"" & ""What's the worst that could happen?"" were disappointing!  By the way, the new catch phrase ""what the problem is?"" can only be funny the first few times.  Around number 12 it kind of got old.  ""Its like that?""  ""Oh its like that.""  I'm gonna go watch Blue Streak now!",1043971200,3,3407,4.5426229508196725

It stars one of the best comedians today (Martin Lawrence) and another funny misfit (Steve Zahn from SAVING SILVERMAN). The movie is funny yet has good action. Here is the plot.
Steve Zhan plays Hank. An LA policeman who is bent on revenge to finding the guy who killed his partner in gun battle. Lawrence is Earl. A guy who just got kicked out of the force after turning a practice session into a disaster. Plus Earl always thinks that people have a problem with him because he is black- not because of his attitude. One day while Earl is trying to have a regular day, he realizes he left his keys in his car and tried to stick his hand in and get it. Hank catches him and interrogates what is going on. While that is happening, a bee comes by and Earl is allergic to bees and so Hank tries to get the bee away but the way they were positioned, it looked like Hank was beating on Earl and a guy who near by got the whole thing on camera. Because of that, a huge commotion started thru out the state about a white cop beating a black civilian. Hank is fired from the police and sent to jail for 6 months and Earl just kicks back and lets the whole thing happen even though he knows it was a bee.
Hank serves his six months and after getting out he tries to do something similar toward police work- a job as a security guard. While on the job, Hanks gets called about a robbery and goes to check it out. It seems that the robbers were the guys he had an encounter with in the past and one of the guys was his partner's murderer. Hank goes into action right away and a fellow security guard who worked in the building comes to back up Hank and that person just happens to be Earl!! The two would've had a long argument but realized it wasn't the time and chased the bad guys but they were stopped by the police. Police that Hank kidnapped Earl for revenge but Earl decided not to have anything bad happen to Hank this time although it would have felt real good. Hank goes on to try find these guys who did the robbery because its personal and Earl thinks it is personal too because one them called him a monkey- and he thinks he was called that because he is black. Both Hank and Earl go on the case even though they are not policemen and along the way they go through many arguments that sometimes lead toward zany consequences like fighting over which to go on the street- right or left and they end up jumping the highway into a pile of portable toilets. Hank and Earl must try to put the past aside so they can help each other to try and find these bad guys.
National Security loaded with intense action, thrilling chase scenes, gun battles, fist fights, and many parts that will make you laugh hard. It's definitely as good as blue Steak and you should see it while it is still in theaters.",1043539200,21,2907,4.174377224199288
1865600,4,B00008WI9O,"I saw the previews for this one, and I thought that, at the worst, it would a buddy, cop, action, comedy movie that would be a good way to burn an hour and a half. Color me surprised, then, when it turned out not only to to be a buddy, cop, action, comedy movie, but an engaging buddy, cop, action comedy movie with some weight to it.
Taking its cue from Rodney King, the film shows honest cop Hank having his career ruined when he is videotaped helping a black cop-wannabe, Earl Montgomery, avoid a bee sting. Naturally, he looks like he is beating Montgomery, who does little to help him when questioned by authorities. Railroaded into prison, and then forced to take a job as a security guard, Hank works to solve a very personal case on his own time. Naturally, he is forced to team up with Montgomery, also a National Security company employee. Along the way, there are lots of stunts, shootouts, and action when the bad guys try to stop Hank from solving the case.
The film had some good moments of drama as well, from the opening sequence, to Hank's admission of what he saw and how it affected him, and why he wants the bad guys to pay. I also liked the way it turns the ""bad cop"" and ""racist cop"" sterotypes on their head. I had to wonder if Hollywood has started to lean away from the PC, lock-step, hard left, traditional view of race relations (what with recent films like ""Barbershop"" and ""National Security""), in favor of a more honest and realistic view of the issues.
The film was nicely compact, tightly designed, directed, and scripted. And did I mention it was funny? The disasters that face Hank, and then both Hank and his ersatz partner Montgomery, are right on the money when it comes to laughs. Martin Lawrence reigned in his more annoying qualities as Montgomery, while Steven Zahn was a pleasant surprise as the put-upon police officer Hank.
I wouldn't say that ""National Security"" was groundbreaking cinema or anything, but I really had a good time watching it, and I think you will too.",1043020800,4,2014,4.535714285714286
