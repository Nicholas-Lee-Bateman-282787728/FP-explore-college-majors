4331141,4,B004D0AMN8,"Being fascinated by Waters and Gilmore, I found this DVD very watchable, from start to finish.  I think it presented a great summary of that relationship, and the one between Waters and the other members of the group, so I recommend it for all fans of The Floyd.",1310342400,8,262,4.458333333333333
4331142,2,B004D0AMN8,this video just shows all the same old gripe that has gone on for years. its a good view for hard core fans other wise not much new in this tale of whoa.,1307491200,2,153,3.6666666666666665
4331143,5,B004D0AMN8,This DVD presents some more information on the behind the scenes history of one of the greatest bands in the last 40 years. It is a must for Pink Floyd fans,1302912000,7,156,4.064516129032258
4331144,5,B004D0AMN8,"Enjoyed this program very much, especially the background of and what's happening with Roger Waters now. Personally, I always felt that he was the main force of the band. ""The Wall"" is still my favorite today. This album (Whatever happened to..."" is very well put together, the music thoroughly ""Pink Floyd"". If you're a fan, buy it. You won't be disappointed.",1301875200,9,360,4.918032786885246
4331145,4,B004D0AMN8,"Okay, it arrived.  I thought it worth watching, but probably only once.  Honestly, I also just watched ""Shine On,"" and it was much more informative and engaging, simply because it was 100% interviews with the band members, as opposed to  ""experts""  discussing their opinions.  I could pick this apart, but I'm not that dedicated as a reviewer.  I learned a few new things.  :-)",1298678400,20,377,4.796875

8424526,2,B004D0AMN8,I couldn't help but feel like the cover text was misleading.  Did this documentary tell us anything we didn't already know?  No.,1445299200,,128,4.7727272727272725

8424528,3,B004D0AMN8,"For what I paid and what I got and watched, wasn't worth the money. But I am a Pink Floyd fanatic, so I kept it, with all my other Pink Floyd memorabilia.",1397520000,,154,3.84375
8424529,3,B004D0AMN8,Were a few moments when Roger and David spoke more profoundly about their split.  Still enjoyed the disc.  Could have. should have been more.,1394150400,,141,4.833333333333333
8424530,5,B004D0AMN8,It is hard to find Pink Floyd products that my husband doesn't have and this was the exception. A must for any Pink Floyd fan.,1368403200,,126,4.08
8424531,5,B004D0AMN8,"The exact copy of this DVD is found in ""Pink Floyd: Then and Now"" relabelled as Disc 2.. It is a 2 disc documentary set that also contains (labelled as Disc 1) ""Classic Albums under Review: Meddle"" A great 2 disc set, but why pay $20 for this when you can get it for $15 included with the story of ""Meddle"".. Don't get ripped off the way I did.. Enjoy!",1360800000,4,352,4.042857142857143
8424532,4,B004D0AMN8,"I liked It. Except It was but together using old clips( probably an unauthorized publication ), still informative and entertaining. if I would have previewed the Video, I would have held off.",1359244800,,191,5.0
8424533,5,B004D0AMN8,"Loved this work, it is well documented, in my opinion, and neat in its presentation. I wish it were longer and contained more images and clips, but all in all, it is ok, I enjoyed it.",1341360000,,183,4.111111111111111
8424534,2,B004D0AMN8,"What kind of title is 'Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd'?  We're not talking about some one hit wonder band that the world has completely forgotten about, we're talking about one of the greatest, most relevant bands in history.  A band whose members still create and perform new music, as well as keeping the older Floyd songs in the spotlight through brilliant live performances.  Waters has been packing the house with his Wall tour, and Gilmour put out a fantastic new album a few years ago, followed by an incredible tour.  We know every bit of what these guys are doing now as we did in the 70's.  The Wall at MSG, On An Island at Radio City, and The Allmans at the Beacon are by far the best shows I've seen in the past 5 years.  Here's another good title for ya, 'Whatever Happened to the Allman Brothers Band'?  Answer: they're alive and well and better than ever, just like Waters and Gilmour.

Oh, and for the record, I haven't seen this DVD.  I just dislike the title that much.",1310428800,5,988,4.444444444444445
