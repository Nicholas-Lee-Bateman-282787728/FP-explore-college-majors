4892513,5,B005TTEG0M,"We watched ""The Greening of Whitney Brown"" on a family movie night, and everyone in the family loved it.  It was a great lesson for my 2 daughters to see what is really important in life - not things and material items, or being the most popular person, but family and being a good person who does the right thing, is what really counts.  We would recommend this for audiences of all ages.  We are planning on buying it when it comes out on Jan. 3rd so that we can watch it over and over again.  It is the kind of movie that will leave you smiling. :)",1325030400,44,551,4.074074074074074

Sammi Hanratty is just adorable in her lead role as Whitney Brown. The story is fun,lively and heartwarming.

4892580,4,B005TTEG0M,"A pretty good story even though it starts out horribly like a young teen flick with all the soap opera drama expected in pre-teen and young teen girls.  But it improves, especially once Bob, the horse, gets involved.  The horse is obviously well trained and his relationship with Whitney is wonderful to watch.  Kris Kristoferson is his usual great self, this time as a grandfather Whitney cutely refers to as ""Grumps"" instead of Grandpa, etc.. If you can get through the first 15-20 minutes of it, you'll enjoy it.  Pre-teens will definitely enjoy it as they will ""get it"".",1397260800,2,574,4.767676767676767

4892609,4,B005TTEG0M,"Tommie Turvey caught my attention as the trainer of the Clydesdales for the 2013 Superbowl Bud commercial.  I found out he had trained the real star of this movie, Bob, the Gypsy Vanner horse, so I had to see the results.  I always enjoy watching trained horses and how they respond, but this movie was a joy to watch in general.  It does a service of keeping horses in the eyes and hearts of young people.  We are becoming an increasingly urban society with little heart for animals.  Movies like this help a lot.  Thanks!",1359849600,,523,4.4526315789473685

4892611,4,B005TTEG0M,"The movie was a bit cheesy, especially at the end when the horse is riding in the vehicle. However, it made some great points regarding whom you can count on. Some ""friends"" aren't friends at all. Others are true through and through. Great lesson for my 11-year-old granddaughter.",1357862400,,280,4.854166666666667

My daughter teaches fourth grade and I loaned it to her and she said that from the time she put the movie on until it went off, you could have heard a pin drop. There is a need for more wholesome movies like this. She loaned it to another teacher, and that teacher said she got the same response as my daughters class and all the children begged to watch it again.",1349481600,,472,4.175824175824176

4892617,1,B005TTEG0M,"I got this movie from the library because I love Gypsy Vanners, and because it had pretty good reviews on Amazon. Wow, it was awful! The horse was the best thing about the movie, for sure, though Brooke Shields looked great and was fine in her role. The unbelievabilty of the whole movie made my brain hurt: giant gaps in logic (eg- she has internet access at the library yet somehow cannot contact any of her friends for months), painful editing (horse is barefaced, yet in close-up has halter, then barefaced again), etc. But that's just the tip of the ridiculous iceberg- they live ""a couple of hours from Philadelphia"", she says at one point, yet she has no hesitation about riding a horse (he's not even HER horse!) back there so she can go to the formal. Whuh?? And then she has no problem abandoning the horse, who is supposedly her best & only friend, far from home or from Philly, so she can hop a train to get to the dance. And the horse later shows up at the dance to prove that the girl's story wasn't a lie. Because of course Bob the horse had no trouble finding his way to the school he'd never been to before. I won't even go into the fact that Kris Kirstofferson's character describes the girl as having ""natural horse sense"", even though the first time she gets on a horse it's not only from the wrong side, but she ends up facing backwards. And as for a moral- Your human friends will probably go behind your back & steal your boyfriend and try to embarass you at the formal (or else just forget about you when you move away), but your horse friend will come to your rescue and he'll show them! Nice. I know my 2 young nieces would be both bored and annoyed by this dumb movie, and I can't recommened it to anyone, young or old.",1341792000,7,1746,4.310030395136778
4892618,5,B005TTEG0M,"I really liked this movie, it's a good family movie.  Whitney even though things changed in her live, she handled them very well.  The parents in this movie did a good job of parenting her.  She was upset but not a brat about it.",1336780800,,229,4.159090909090909
4892619,5,B005TTEG0M,"I got this for my 2 year old (yes, she loves to watch horses) and was surprised by it. The movies was a bit tongue and cheek at times, but really showed a wonderful relationship between a girl and a horse. My little one kept saying ""Bob"" when the horse was on-screen. The main character is just a joy to watch with the star horse. The cast is well known and does a good job at keeping the story going. I liked it because it was fun and interesting to watch. The movies was interesting and you saw the horses do cool and fun stuff. Don't expect a Steven Speilberg production, just a fun girl and horse movie.",1336694400,4,607,4.1525423728813555
4892620,5,B005TTEG0M,This is a good family movie. The horse was very pretty and one that I had never seen before. Will watch it again! Worth the money.,1332720000,,130,4.038461538461538
4892621,3,B005TTEG0M,"This film was a great film for anyone older then 10 or 12.
It chronicles the story of Whitney Brown who is living life HIGH with parents who are apart of America's rich.
Then one day her father loses his job and they are bankrupt..

Whitney's school President life is turned upside down in an instant.
And only then does she find out who her true friends really are.

Forgiveness, reconciliation, adapting to new surroundings and many other themes play out in this film.

Due to some scary scenes I wouldn't recommend for all ages but anyone older the 10 will be fine.",1329523200,33,568,4.495145631067961

4892623,5,B005TTEG0M,"This is a good movie for kids, it shows them what is really important. It starts with a spoiled brat getting pretty much everything she wants but then learns the true meaning of friendship. I think this is a good movie to watch with your child and then talk about what is important in your family.",1329004800,8,297,4.321428571428571
4892624,4,B005TTEG0M,"It's a tweeny movie for sure, but could family fare. The acting is predictable but Bob the horse is beautiful (the Gypsy Vanner breed is highly under rated. They are a smart, gorgeous breed of horse). A good family night movie.",1328572800,4,227,4.560975609756097
4892625,2,B005TTEG0M,"After reading the 4 reviews already on here, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I was disappointed and found the beautiful Gypsy Vanner horse the only thing I really cared for in the movie.  Yes, the movie DID teach valuable lessons, but in a very unrealistic way.  I've had horses for over 50 years and, believe me, they do NOT behave like this horse.  They are wonderful, perfect animals but this was way beyond anything that would happen in real life. And riding a horse to a dance in Philadelphia....please. Also, utterly, beyond belief, was the horse helping Whitney hop a train.....oh my..... The movie could have taught the same life lessons without being so ridiculously unrealistic.......",1325894400,7,707,4.915966386554622
