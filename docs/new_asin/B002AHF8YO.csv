3884129,5,B002AHF8YO,"I highly recommend this dvd for those people seeking to understand the
 realities of what the church has done for so long to the Jewish people.",1414886400,,143,4.5

3884131,5,B002AHF8YO,Provocative and engaging treatment of a subject that too often is subject to ill-informed cant.,1414281600,,95,5.4
3884132,5,B002AHF8YO,"I had heard of this some years ago but wasn't able to find it.  Amazon finally picked it up so it has been on my Wish List for some time.  I stumbled upon a Youtube of this and was able to ""try before I buy"".  After seeing the Youtube I had to order it for my personal library.

Simple and well acted, it keeps the focus on the topic. This film serves as a good introduction to the topic for those unaware.  Most people won't care about the crimes and sins of the past, but some do.",1399248000,2,482,3.9278350515463916
3884133,4,B002AHF8YO,"Only the grainy quality of the film, which I didn't mind very much, keeps it from being five stars. Wonderfully written",1396483200,,119,4.714285714285714
3884134,5,B002AHF8YO,This historical dialogue is challenging; it is very well done and makes one think.  It helped me to understand how my Jewish brothers might perceive Christianity.  The Disputation leads to interesting conversation and inter-faith dialogue.,1385596800,2,239,5.8
3884135,4,B002AHF8YO,"It gives a fair view of debates that could have taken place during the reign of King James of Aragon.

3884136,5,B002AHF8YO,"I am thankful that I took someone's advice and sent for this video. I watched it three times and enjoyed it more after each viewing. I understand that the program was not given much promotional attention when it came out, probably due to its subject matter (persecution of Jews ).It is a performance for intelligent people- no explosions, superheroes, or kiddie animation!",1352073600,9,372,5.016129032258065
3884137,4,B002AHF8YO,"This film intends to portray the religious dispute between Nachmanides and Pablo Christiani before King James I of Aragon in 1263, which I described in my review of Nachmanides' book The Disputation at Barcelona. Readers may want to look at this review for some details about the debate.

There are several problems with this film. Nachmanides' account of the debate is rather brief, only 42 pages in the English translation, and the film cuts it further. The film seems to focus more on King James' adultery than on the debate probably to show his hypocrisy; he is interested in the truth of religion, while he is sinning. Nachmanides is curiously depicted covering his head with a shawl during the debate before the king, but meets with him bear-headed face-to-face. Nachmanides says on the first day that he considers Midrash only legends and parables, but Nachmanides writes in his book that he did not do it until the second day. The film states that two subjects were to be discussed, while Nachmanides says there were three. Also, the king asks for Nachmanides' blessing and bows to receive it, an act that never occurred.",1298419200,10,1129,4.880208333333333
3884138,5,B002AHF8YO,Fantastic little movie that  shows history from an angle that I don't think many people have ever considered.,1264550400,5,109,5.055555555555555
8359482,4,B002AHF8YO,"The digital transfer is not very high quality; it looked really bad on my HDTV (and I don't have a very large screen).  But the film itself is pretty good.  (Note that there is an error in the text on the box.  The Barcelona disputation took place in 1263, not 1623!)  The Barcelona disputation is a very important event in Christian-Jewish relations, and the account by Moses ben Nachman (the Jewish representative) gives us unusually full documentation of the issues and arguments, at least as he saw it.  In his view, of course, he pretty plainly won the dispute over Friar Paul, a former Jew turned Dominican.  In fact, he pretty much humiliated Paul, and King James of Aragon just made matters worse for the Christian side.  Unfortunately, the Christian accounts are much more perfunctory so it is hard to know what to discount in Rabbi Moses's account, and it is his account on which the film (based on a play, and very much showing the signs of it) relies.  If viewed with due caution, bearing in mind the biased source, it is a really good window into the event.",1500940800,,1070,4.594736842105263
8359483,5,B002AHF8YO,"This film was fantastic. What a surprise! It is more of a play that was filmed, rather than a movie, but the dialogue was excellent. It really took a somewhat dry (true) story about a theological dispute and made it actually really interesting! I was riveted. Really. Even better than the new book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Debating-Truth-The-Barcelona-Disputation-of-1263-A-Graphic-History-Graphic-History-Series/dp/0190226366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Debating Truth: The Barcelona Disputation of 1263, A Graphic History (Graphic History Series)</a>, which I recommend after the movie.",1496793600,,637,7.621621621621622
8359484,5,B002AHF8YO,I'm a collector of historical reenactments. This is a theatrical expression of a historical event. It is well acted and it covers the historical facts fairly well.,1496793600,,163,5.074074074074074
8359485,2,B002AHF8YO,"The DVD is a shocking quality. Poor color, bad focus. The cover erroneously dates the disputation as having taken place in 1623--about 400 years out. King James of Aragon emerges as the saint; Pablo Christiani correctly as a very nasty person, and Nachmanides as a brilliant erudite scholar!
Acting is good, but editing is atrocious! The qualitity of the DVD destroys any possible enjoyment.",1485129600,,391,5.125
8359486,5,B002AHF8YO,I love all of Sir Christopher films and that is including Peter Cushing and Christopher's wonderful singing voice.,1457740800,,114,5.388888888888889

8359488,2,B002AHF8YO,"The content is good, the camera work and sound and dialogue are all sub par. Too bad because the subject is so important. I was terribly was disappointed.",1437523200,,154,4.535714285714286
8359489,5,B002AHF8YO,"Great movie that shows the real scenario of The Disputation of Barcelona. A very good story. The quality is not amazing because it was a Tv movie and was converted from VHS but, it is worth it because of the great story. No matter where you go, there is no better quality; so you might as well live with it.",1433376000,,307,4.133333333333334
8359490,3,B002AHF8YO,"It served it purpose, letting one realize that the culture that the KJV Bible came out of was one that was filled with anti-antisemitism. Illustrating how a Bible can be influenced by political beliefs when it is transcribed.",1426550400,,225,4.947368421052632
8359491,5,B002AHF8YO,Amazing commentary on story with an unlikey outcome.  So much we can all learn from this DVD.  Done very well.,1425254400,,110,4.45
