7841065,5,6303215653,"This 1991 film in which the late John Thaw plays the irascible, heavy drinking, scholarly trained, efficient, and persistent Chief Inspector Morse is one of the best of the BBC Morse TV series. The Greek chef of a local Oxford Greek restaurant is found murdered in his rented room. His neck had been snapped, apparently by an expert in hand to hand combat. The chef owned his own restaurant in Greece and it is unclear why he came to England to work for the last several months. Additionally, he had come to England previously and worked for a seemingly unscrupulous investor who was trying to bring a Greek ship to England as part of an amusement park. Why did he leave this man's employ? Who killed him and why?

 The chef's sister travels to England for her brother's funeral. Surprisingly, she brings her infant boy who is only several months old. Why did she bring the toddler? Morse discovers that she is unmarried. Who is the child's father? Is he a Greek or an English man who traveled to Greece? She makes a mysterious call to someone. Shortly thereafter, she is found murdered, again with a broken neck, and her child is kidnapped.

 During his investigation, Morse encounters a very rich Greek man who is in competition with the seemingly unscrupulous investor. He wants the Greek ship to remain in Greece. He is an expert in hand to hand combat. Is there a connection between the murder of the chef and the competition about the Greek ship?

 Morse also meets an English professor who is also involved with the ship, but from a scholarly perspective. The professor is married to a beautiful TV star who gives advice on marriages. Although the couple is unable to have children, they publically tout that they have an ideal marriage. Morse wonders if they ""protest too much.""",1291248000,3,1786,4.6900958466453675
7841066,4,6303215653,"A childless couple, who host television shows, profess to have the ideal marriage which has now lasted fifteen years.  The husband, who also has filmed documentaries, has been off to Greece recently to do one on ancient Greek war ships.  On this particular trip, his wife did not accompany him.  Upon his return, a Greek chef is murdered - later in the episode a young Greek woman, the chef's sister, is also murdered using the same M.O.  A gentleman building a theme park in Britain, which will include full replicas of the Greek navel ships, and a Greek restaurant mogul are suspects.  Along with the murders we find blackmail and kidnapping. You must bear down when viewing this entry as it is somewhat involved.  Morse must do the same, but of course he ultimately unearths the culprit.  This is quite a good four star effort.",1175472000,5,830,4.682758620689655
