295805,5,6300268683,"I think ""Wait Until Dark"" is excellent!  It looks sort of theatrical, like a play, most of the story takes place in Audrey Hepburn's apartment.  The story is about criminals looking for a doll full of heroin  that they think is in Hepburn's apartment.  They take advantage of he blind  state and put on clever ""skits"", so to speak, in order to find  the doll.  However ""The World's Best Blind Lady"" proves that her  loss of sight is a small hindrance and that she is a very clever opponent.  The climax was heartstopping!  If you like thrillers this is a must-see!",923356800,,564,4.4950495049504955

295940,5,6300268683,"Wait Until Dark (1967) has been recently released on BluRay by Warner Brothers, and if you love suspense movies it deserves a spot on your shelf. The film was based on a play by Frederick Knott which opened in 1966 with Lee Remick in the starring role. The story revolves around Susy Hendrix, a married woman who has recently become blind and is still learning how to navigate in a dark world.

The film opens with a woman (Samantha Jones) is flying from Montreal to New York with an old doll that is being used to smuggle heroin. When she arrives, she sees a man she apparently knows and gets worried, so she gives the doll to another passenger who happens to be Sam Hendrix, Susy's husband. Sam brings the doll home and it is promptly lost.

Later, two con-men enter a New York apartment to wait for information about a job. Mike (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston) make themselves at home. After waiting a while, they are joined by Roat, who they have never met before. Roat (Alan Arkin) blackmails the two and promises $4000 each if they can help him find the heroin. They are interrupted by Susy, who comes home, as they are still in her apartment. They quickly learn that they can stay in the apartment undetected as long as they don't make any noise.

The next day they cook up an elaborate ruse to convince Susy to turn over the doll. Mike plays an old Marine buddy of Sam. Carlino plays a police sergeant, since he used to be one before switching to a life of crime. Roat plays an old man who burglarizes the apartment and later an apologetic son. The scam gets complicated when the latchkey girl from upstairs comes down to assist Susy with grocery shopping. Initially Hepburn trusts them all, but she starts to notice behaviors that don't make sense.

I won't spill the beans on the rest of the plot, but the last fifteen minutes is as suspenseful as any movie can get. While Hepburn's character is as sweet as any other role that she played, she is willing to do anything to protect herself and the ending is quite violent for a 1960s film. Director Terence Young magnifies the suspense by having some scenes with little or no light and only sound (or complete silence). The two trailers included as supplements both warn audience members that no one will be admitted during the last eight minutes of the film. They also ask smokers in the audience to extinguish their cigarettes near the end of the film so that the theater will be completely dark.

Hepburn gives a masterful performance that was nominated for an Academy Award. You will truly believe that she is blind. Alan Arkin, in a very early performance, alternates between goofy creepy and scary creepy. Richard Crenna gives an excellent performance as a con man who sounds completely earnest as he lies through his teeth. Jack Weston is also good as the angry and frustrated ex-police sergeant. I'm dumbfounded how Mr. FBI-from-TV Efram Zimbalist, Jr. was nominated for a Golden Globe. He seems slightly miscast for his part.

Charles Lang's cinematography is drab at first, but it is outstanding for the long finale which was shot with little or no light. This is a new 2K color-corrected transfer, and will look excellent on a large TV screen. The film is captioned in English only.

As you would expect with a film based on a play, most of the action takes place in the apartment where Susy is trapped by her blindness and the criminals. The beginning of the film does have some expository scenes at the airport. We also experience some important scenes taking place on the street outside the apartment. The soundtrack has been remixed from mono to stereo. Henry Mancini's score is just as disturbing as the film. He tuned two pianos a quarter-tone apart for a very distinctive sound.

As for supplements, there are two trailers included. The longer one is transferred in high-def 1080p. There is also a featurette that was produced either for the original DVD release or for TCM. Alan Arkin talks about how people hated him after the film was released because he was so mean to Audrey Hepburn. Mel Ferrer (Hepburn's husband and the film's producer) talks about how he convinced her to play this role so that she could stretch herself as an actress.",1502150400,,4231,4.647058823529412
295941,5,6300268683,"The year is 2017. No question about it. I saw this movie this movie starring Audrey Hepburn in 1967 entitled ""Wait Until Dark"" 50 years too late. This film was based on a Broadway play tells a story of a blind housewife that is being trolled and harassed by three criminals in search for a doll that contains drugs. Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Efrem Zimbalist Jr.,Jack Weston and Samantha Jones co-star with Hepburn in a film directed by Terence Young.

No question that I saw this film too late as it made no impression that it was indeed a 50-year-old movie. The plot was definitely contrived and weak as it lacked realism especially on how the blind housewife Susy was able to overcome a criminal as well as how the criminals were totally obsessed with just a few grams of drugs contained in a small doll. Added to that,the movie started slow and there are too many unnecessary parts particularly the criminals in a discussion at the blind housewife's house at the start of the movie as well as the introduction of Hepburn's character where it required too many scenes to establish that she was indeed blind before it got going to tell the story.

Despite of what I have stated previously about the slow pace and the contrived story, the movie would still managed to entertain the viewer at present for many reasons. First, the acting was definitely extraordinary in the story. Hepburn was definitely credible as a blind woman. Added to that,the criminals - Crenna and Arkin - were definitely great to complement Hepburn. Second was the music by Henry Mancini which was definitely extraordinary. Third,the direction by Terence Young was good as he was able to provide tension and thrills through the mood and atmosphere of the film. That is why it still managed to get a perfect rating. Overall,acting,music and tension overcame the weaknesses of the story.",1501113600,,1860,4.7912772585669785

295998,4,6300268683,"The movie/story is worth 5 stars.  I saw it in a theater when I was young.  To this day, it is the only movie that ever made me jump (I will not ruin it for others by saying when it happens) when watching it.  The reason for 4 stars is the blu ray transfer.  It is good, particularly the black levels/delineations, but I think it could have been better.  The look is soft; detail is not as good as others Warner Archive has done (and they usually do a very good job--I have quite a few of their catalog blu rays).  The DTS-HD MA 2.0 sound is quite good.  Dialogue is clear.  Overall I give this a 4.4 rating.  The movie is well worth watching.",1494633600,,643,4.08

I thing Miss Hepburn has deserve an Oscar for this role. This film is absolutely clssic and blu ray-transfer is very good; with vivid colours, shrap picture and good sound.

296092,5,6300268683,"Like everyone else, I'm an Hepburn fan and though she made only 17 pictures in her brief career, this film like ""Nun's Story"", ""Two For The Road"", ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" and ""Robin & Marian"" established her credentials as a premier film actress.  Forget about the disasterous ""Bloodline"" or ""Paris When It Sizzles"", this thriller about a blind woman overcoming 3 villains out to get an doll laced with heroin from her still gets a jolt out of me after 50 years.  Arkin has never been more devious or psychotic and Crenna delivers as Mike, an anti-hero who shows his true colors in his final confrontation with Suzy.

Here she leaves behind her regular ""girl next door"" routine and steps into something more daring.  She's both strong and weak, fierce and vulnerable.  And she play's both very well.  Alan Arkin shows us a truly sinister villain that is somewhat shocking for an actor who is known and loved for his lighthearted comedy.  The final confrontation is a brilliant work of suspense that would make Hitchcock proud.  A good movie for fans of classic thrillers.",1476403200,,605,4.815533980582524

Her acting is very believable as a blind person trapped in her own home. The supporting cast is somewhat lackluster. The dialogue and plot needed at least one more rewrite before it was released.

296474,4,6300268683,"Yes, it's highly artificial - and somewhat stage-bound (the material originated as a Broadway play). But the movie version is smoothly constructed, features strong acting turns from everyone involved (especially Alan Arkin), and director Terence Young deploys a slow-burn technique that suddenly explodes in the famously terrifying climax.  And it's surprising to realize how many tropes that would become cliches in later thrillers - from the stolen drugs to the inscrutable, manipulative sadist - originated here.  So it's a landmark, and always worth a look.",1447632000,,561,5.588235294117647

296579,4,6300268683,"""Wait Until Dark"" is a still sizzling 1967 thriller starring Audrey Hepburn as Suzy, a young blind woman living in an apartment in New York City with her photographer boyfriend Sam.  Sam will unknowingly brings a doll loaded with heroin into the apartment, followed closely by a sadistic thug named Roat (an outstanding Alan Arkin), who wants the heroin back at any cost.  Roat, assisted by two small time con men, will bring on a campaign of terror on Suzy, trying to trick her into revealing the whereabouts of the hidden doll.  Suzy will have to outwit the three criminals in a seemingly uneven fight.  The suspense is excellent.  The supporting cast, which includes Richard Crenna and Efrem Zimbalist Jr, is quite good.

The action is completely implausible, which is a fatal flaw for a thriller. People would not act as they do in this film. The little girl who is supposed to help out Hepburn was not at all believable (esp. in 1967). She was a neighbor girl, who was getting paid to do some shopping, etc.for the blind Hepburn. It was  not believable that she would have thrown a huge tantrum as she did in this film. Hepburn not calling the police, or not screaming for help? The actions of Hepburn were not close to being credible. And, the idea that she would be trusting all these new, unknown people coming into her apartment? No. This film has not aged well. Hepburn did act like she was blind, but her patrician accent and her supreme devotion to being a good housewife was a bit hard to take seriously. As a historical document, take a look at this film. But, don't expect it to be an entertaining thriller.",1427587200,2,1015,4.342105263157895

However, the plot in this movie erases much of that by having the lead character blind. In fact, the lack of full sensory perception makes us in awe of Hepburn's character. I show this movie in a film class when discussing horror and suspense, and my students love it (even though it's ""old""). Although they find Hepburn to be a bit overly dramatic at times, they like her spunk. Also, the idea of ""good"" guy and ""bad"" guy are very successfully stretched so that my students didn't always like the guys they ""should have."" They say that they like one of the main criminals (understandably), HATE the husband (I'd agree with them), and both admire and despise Alan Arkin's character (whom I believe Marlon Brando might have observed before creating Don Corleone?).

Tremendous performances by all involved, tension, surprises, suspense, a little humor and romance . . .  Whenever TV Guide would describe it, the magazine always said something along the lines of ""Three criminals terrorize a blind woman.""  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They attempt to *con* her -- a classic scam.  We know it's a scam, but Susy (Audrey Hepburn) does not -- at least not at first.  I'll say no more so I won't ruin it for you.

She noticed that ""Scarsdale Sr.and Scarsdale Jr"" wore the same shoes!!! 2) Very much like the best Hitchcock for suspense,maybe even better than many of his films;3) Hepburn's acting was superb;so was Alan Arkin's;extremely ingenious plot;music complimented the narrative and dramatic highlights beautifully;Crenna was surprisingly good;I don't understand why Zimbalist,Jr.,was nominated for any awards because his role is so small.

Also wonderful are a young Richard Crenna, one of the greatest character actors of all time Jack Weston and of course Alan Arkin who plays his menacing baddie as a Beat Generation Charlie Manson. What I could not get past, however, was the overshadowing melodrama of the film in the performance of Audrey Hepburn. It seems impossible now that she was nominated for an Academy Award for what I found to be a ridiculously shrieky performance. Not only was it unbuyable that she was blind but her breathy ""woe is me"" intonations border on whiny.

297603,2,6300268683,"SPOLILERS:
A drug carrier (Lisa) smuggles a doll loaded with drugs into the U.S. As she departs the airplane, Lisa recognizes bad guy Roat(Alan Arkin) and quickly gives the drug doll to another passenger, (Sam Hendrix) to protect the contents.

Roat takes off with Lisa while Sam takes the doll home.

Later, we find Lisa dead in Sam's apartment.  Roat has killed her and somehow tracked down where Sam lives.

Apparently Roat had time to take Lisa to the apartment, kill her, and put her in the closet with no one noticing.

Roat also enlists two thugs to meet with him in Sam/Susy's apartment while neither of them are home.

Sam's wife Susy (Audrey Hepburn) who is blind eventually comes home.  She likes to leave her door unlocked and tell every stranger who comes through the door everything and anything about Sam and herself.

Instead of threatening or torturing Susy to find out where the doll is, Roat decides to have his two thugs attempt to trick Susy into disclosing the whereabouts of the drug doll by posing as a family friend and police officer.

Although she knows nothing about the doll's contents, Hepburn
uses her extra sensory skills to outwit the baddies throughout the film.

The plot was utterly ridiculous which in turn destroys the movie.  Apparently this film was originally a play.  The entire film takes place in Susy's apartment.

Hepburn's character was valiant and brave as a blind woman but this does not save the film.

Thrilling suspense, dramatic irony, no curse words, only a few scenes with very small smears of blood on hands or clothing, no nudity (one scene shows quite a bit of breast cleavage), minimal violence (all wounding and or killing is done in a hidden manner that old movies are good at). The only drug references are in the opening scene. Even though the entire plot revolves around obtaining smuggled heroine, it isn't talked about after the first mention. It's not a drug movie. It's suspense, smart, thrilling, with a resolution that doesn't leave you hanging. Audrey is convincing as a blind woman. She is vulnerable enough to make you want to jump into the scene and protect her. Yet, she's sharp enough and brave enough to make you feel like a loyal fan, rooting for her victory with every smart move she makes. Every character is on point, all maneuvering together - appearing and disappearing at all the right moments, weaving the story into an increasingly thrilling experience until it is over (which is when I noticed the tension in my muscles and my facial expression finally relaxing).

297775,3,6300268683,"Little dates as much as a once-groundbreaking genre piece, and Wait Until Dark is no exception. Audrey Hepburn's `world champion blind lady' finds herself letting an unlikely number of total strangers into her apartment, all searching for a doll stuffed with heroin, though that's not the story they tell her as they try to trick her into giving it to them. See, husband Effrem Zimbalist Jr was persuaded by the courier (now dead and hanging in Hepburn's wardrobe) to hold onto it at the airport, and if you think that's an unlikely plot development, you ain't heard nothin' yet. Now a very nasty Alan Arkin, channelling Lenny Bruce, wants it back, coercing smalltime conmen Richard Crenna and his ex-cop partner Jack Weston into staging a little drama to convince her that it's her hubby who killed the girl. The plot is absurdly convoluted, the suspension of disbelief occasionally stretched to the limits as characters behave in increasingly absurd ways simply to advance the plot until it's just Audrey and one very, very bad man with a can of gasoline and a box of matches in the dark

With a plot this unlikely, everything's down to the execution, and thankfully the film is well-cast enough and, a rarity for his post-Bond films, directed strongly enough by Terence Young for the oft-imitated and now predictable plot developments and shocks to still work. Mostly restricted to a single set (it began life as a play by Frederic Knott, the author of Dial M For Murder) there's an imaginative use of total darkness at the end, and Henry Mancini's score, alternating melody with off-key notes, is effective. It's so full of plot holes you won't buy the story for a second, but if you can put your brain on hold for a couple of hours it still delivers enough entertainment to be worth a look.

297779,5,6300268683,"Adapted from a play for the screen, Wait Until Dark (1967) is highly effective suspense thriller, that owes much of its success to a solid story, a quick pace, and some very strong acting performances.  Most of the film takes place in a basement apartment in New York City, where a blind woman played by Audrey Hepburn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charade/dp/B006TTC5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charade</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breakfast-at-Tiffany-s/dp/B001UHOWW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a>)  becomes involved in a web of intrigue, surrounding a shipment of drugs.  She will need to draw upon all her wits and strength to survive a night of sheer terror.  Some spoilers follow.

Afraid that it will be stolen, a woman smuggling a doll stuffed with heroin on a flight from Canada into New York, passes the doll to a stranger, Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) a photographer.  Hendrix takes the doll home to his apartment, where he lives with his wife Suzy (Hepburn), who is blind.

A criminal named Harry Roat (Alan Arkin), gets conmen Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston) involved in an elaborate scheme to try and trick Suzy into giving them doll.  The criminals first get Sam out of the way, and then Talman moves in pretending to be an old army buddy.  Carlino plays a cop investigating a murder, while Roat plays a variety of characters.  With Sam gone, Suzy's only ally is Gloria (Julie Herrod), a teenage girl who lives upstairs.

Audrey Hepburn's performance is simply marvelous, ranging from bubbly and full of emotion to absolute terror.  Suzy is remarkably capable and intelligent, and Hepburn is very convincing playing a person unable to see.  When things turn dark and dangerous, Hepburn makes you feel the chill of Suzy's fear and panic, with Henry Mancini's fantastic score also contributing to heightening the drama.

Alan Arkin (Inspector Clouseau, Catch 22) may have been known for quirky comedic roles, and while he displays some comedic talent in one of his various guises, he is truly chilling playing a ruthless criminal.  Richard Crenna's performance is so good that even though you know Mike is a bad guy, you wish he wasn't.  Jack Weston (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Mr-Limpet/dp/B007VFF7JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Mr. Limpet</a>) might be more familiar in lighter roles often playing the loyal friend.  Going a bit against type, Weston doesn't quite fit as a heavy, but is still fun to watch.  Although Gloria starts out as a bratty kid, she becomes a key character later.  Julie Herrod's performance may not be the most polished, but it adds a certain sense of realism to the drama.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. isn't in the film very much, but is a steady presence when he is.

Although some elements from the play may not translate seamlessly to the film adaptation, the story holds together well and flows nicely, under the direction of Terence Young (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-No/dp/B001AQO3U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. No</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Russia-with-Love/dp/B001AQO3WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Russia with Love</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderball/dp/B001AQO45K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderball</a>).  From early on, it is clear that Suzy is very vulnerable and in danger.  This situation, along with Audrey Hepburn's animated performance, draws your attention to Suzy, and the superior performances of the rest of the cast, make the world inside the apartment seem real and intimate.  Even if you are familiar with the story, Wait Until Dark still remains very compelling and suspenseful.

Except in this little psychological thriller of a film, Wait Until Dark, from the late 1960s Ms. Hepburn seems to be doing just fine, just fine in her newly sightless world and therefore I will only need to provide back-up. And I am ready, more than ready to provide such service if that main villain here, played by Alan Arkin, comes anyway near the neighborhood. He may not be pure evil in the Faustian literary sense but on the streets of New York (or name the city) he is as close as one needs to get. And live.

Needless to say given the times, then or now, criminals, especially low-life master criminals like Arkin looking to move up the drug cartel food chain are a blight on society. And a terror to those without sight who stand in the way of, in the case, a drug-filled doll from foreign parts unknown brought in by a ""mule"" who decided to turn pro and run her own operation who passes off her ill-gotten bounty to Hepburn's unsuspecting husband (played by Zimbalist) when the heat is on (and Arkin is hip to her plans). But here is where the dramatic tension comes in with the life and death duel between Arkin (and his confederates) balanced against the blind Ms. Hepburn's fear-driven efforts to foil the bad guys which is a great sign for our side.

After studying the theories of personality development, I show the students Wait Until Dark and have them select one of the characters and one of the theories, then write a paper analyzing that character's personality.  They have really enjoyed the movie and the assignment, while learning a great deal about psychology.
I know exactly when the audience will jump, as does any fan of this movie, and I really get a kick out of watching the audience when that part comes up.  Once, a girl was sitting by her boyfriend, totally engrossed in the story, and she had his hand, holding it in a death grip up near her mouth when the ""jump"" part happened.

297893,5,6300268683,"I remember watching this movie when I was about 12 or 13 at home on cable. I was alone , it was nighttime and it scared the s__t out of me. It is not a slasher movie so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. It's more of a psychological suspense movie than anything else.
Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who's husband has inadvertently come home with a doll full of heroine. The guys who are looking for it are right around the corner, and start devising a plan to get it. Now I believe the movie works so well because of Hepburn, you BELIEVE she is blind, there is no ""Oh, that's Audrey Hepburn playing a blind girl"", no way, she IS blind. And her character is so likable that you find yourself screaming at the screen, ""Get the HELL out of there!"" was a phrase I remember repeating that night so many years ago. Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna as two of the three bad guys were superb, one cool and collected, the other a simmering pot of slimy oil just about to go up in flames. There is also a little girl that lives upstairs that you want to strangle or at least hope the drug dealers take her ; ) But my least favorite character is Audrey's husband, he is such an insensitive ass that you wonder why she doesn't just leave him. I know about tough love but the guy is a pain. I remember feeling this when I was a kid and when I watched it again the other day I felt the exact same thing. But maybe because he is such an idiot it just makes you want to root for Audrey's character even more. By the end you are so invested in her and her plight that you are just jumping in your seat trying your best to will her out of there.
I believe to get the best effect this movie must be watched in a completely dark room and let yourself get immersed in the atmosphere, you'll have a frightening good time.",1316131200,12,1815,4.129943502824859

On the other hand, Hepburn also displays quick thinking in other portions, and the plot is creative in how Arkin et al try to fool Hepburn into revealing the doll's location.",1315526400,,678,4.705882352941177
297895,4,6300268683,"I still have this very vivid memory of when I was about ten and I was obsessed with scary movies (or the idea of watching them) and my mother, who was VERY opposed to me watching anything remotely `scary' decided to rent a slew of older, classic scary films.  I spent a weekend watching movies like `What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' and `Psycho' and `Wait Until Dark'.  I don't know if that is where my love for classic cinema started, but I still love all three of these films to varying degrees, and it did open my eyes to the different shades of `scary film'; as opposed to being completely blinded by modern cinemas fascination with dismemberment and torture.

When watching `Wait Until Dark', one is instantly reminded that this is an adaptation from a stage play.  That isn't a bad thing really, but it is a constant reminder thanks to the singular space used for the film (it basically takes place in a single apartment) and the theatrical performances.  You can certainly see the shades of the stage spread thin throughout the engaging performances by the entire cast; especially Audrey Hepburn.

LOVE HER!

The film revolves around a blind woman facing a terrible situation when she (or more specifically, a doll in her possession) becomes the target of con man.  You see, that doll contains heroin.  Audrey's character Susie has no idea what that doll contains, but that doesn't stop the sadistic Roat from harassing her for the doll.  Despite her apparent handicap, Susie is more than prepared to take care of herself; which is a good thing since Roat has no concern for her wellbeing whatsoever.

Now that I'm older, rewatching this film certainly delivered in many aspects while I do feel it falls short in others.  I love Hepburn, and I feel that she does an admirable job here, but I also feel that she is almost too proper and controlled to really get inside the character.  When I mentioned earlier about it being theatrical, or stagey, I mean that mostly when regarding her take on the character.  When you are performing on stage it is a different animal than performance in front of a camera.  There is an intimacy that is needed in film that is somewhat put aside on the stage (since stage performance need to exaggerate to convey to an entire audience).  Hepburn is a wonderful actress, but she does take the film down slightly for me.  Arkin is a maniacal genius here though, and his dastardly portrayal of bloodthirsty Roat basically writes the manual for any and all aspiring villains.

He sends chills.

I found the production team to be particularly worthy of mention since that apartment is perfectly staged to create a homey yet tense atmosphere, and the direction and film editing values are most noteworthy.  This film really understands a depth of `fear' that is not entertained in trashy modern `horror' films.  Sure, this isn't the scariest film out there and it isn't one that is going to elicit the nightmares that some of the more modern gorefests can muster up (sure, these torture porn films can really scare the pants off of you) but it is certainly a classier production and one that will stay with the viewer for better reasons; it's a good movie as opposed to just a good scare.",1313452800,,3222,4.6873889875666075

This classic stars Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Samantha Jones, Jack Weston, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Julie Herrod. Basically, the movie is about heroin that is smuggled inside a doll at a Montreal airport. When a con woman, Lisa (Samantha Jones), notices a man spying on her, she gives the doll to a total stranger named Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist). Hendrix is a photographer who has a blind wife named Susy (Audrey Hepburn). The heroin-filled doll ends up at this couple's residence in New York City. Some con men try to take advantage of the fact that Susy is blind and do everything they can think of to get the doll from her. Do they get the doll?

The music by Henry Mancini is perfect for this '60s suspense thriller about drugs. The instruments seem to be a little out of tune and the music off key. It fits the atmosphere perfectly.

I thought Audrey Hepburn played her role brilliantly. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. She was a great actress. She was pretty and cute all in one, an unbeatable combination.

This DVD is in widescreen format. The extras include a short 8-minute feature called Take A Look In The Dark, where Alan Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (Audrey Hepburn's real life husband at the time) talk about how the movie was made. A feature called Stage Frantics describes the transformation from a stage play to a movie. You can read the ""Warning"" word-for-word that movie theaters posted about what was going to happen in the closing minutes of the movie. It's quite interesting and a sign of the time period this movie was made in.

I highly recommend this movie to fans of suspense thrillers and fans of Audrey Hepburn.",1299024000,7,1767,4.653846153846154

It starred Lee Remick and Robert Duvall (as the villain). Julie Herrod reprised her role of young Gloria for the movie version.

In a straightforward adaptation directed by Terence Young that's set in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village, Miss Hepburn is a recently blinded woman victimized by demented Arkin, whose Lenny Bruce impression here surely was picked up on by Dustin Hoffman when he portrayed Ratso Rizzo in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MIDNIGHT-COWBOY/dp/B000CRQX3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MIDNIGHT COWBOY</a>&nbsp;two years later. In this taut thriller, Crenna and Weston are Arkin's partners in crime.

The three bad guys that come to Susy's apartment to search for a drug-filled child's doll take advantage of her good nature and blindness. They visit one at a time, pretending to be a cop, an old man and his son and a friend of Susy's husband (Zimbalist), who'd recently returned from a Montreal trip carrying a doll that was given to him at the airport by a woman he'd never seen before.

Now that mysterious lady is dead, murdered by the homicidal ""Roat,"" who first eliminates his two inept partners and then targets Susy. By this point however she's on to his game and although sightless is able to fight back with effectiveness. Their final terrifying scene together is unforgettable!

This is a classic fright film, one devoid of special effect trickery, that's all the more effective because it plays out like real life. Don't miss it!

 Here I am 42 years later and this movie has the same effect on me today as it did back then, and this comes after the blood and gore that producers rely on today to scare the bejesus out of us. Pretty poor attempt in my opinion.

 Audrey was nominated for a well deserved Academy Award but, unfortunately, she lost to the other Miss Hepburn. Nonetheless, this movie has withstood the test of time and is well worth watching.

In it, Audrey Hepburn plays a woman who is learning to live life as a blind person after an accident took her sight. She becomes involved with three shady characters after her husband gets a doll from a woman he met on a flight back home, and now the doll is missing. Anyway, the men want the doll back and will stop at nothing to get it and drive poor Audrey to the brink of insanity!

Hepburn plays the role convincingly and the cinematography is really cool. There are moments when there's nothing but pitch-blackness on the screen and so you get a sense of what the main character must be experiencing as she's being terrorized by these thugs!

The special features include:

Featurette--""A Look In The Dark""--8:35-minute
interview with Alan Arkin, who plays the sadistic ""Roat,"" and producer Mel Ferrer, who was married to Hepburn at the time.

Theatrical Trailer & Warning--
warning is a voice-over with text that tells audience members not to light up cigarettes in the movie house (wow, they smoked inside the theater back then!)during the pitch dark scenes so it wouldn't take away from the scene.

298075,5,6300268683,"This was the last film that Audrey Hepburn made before she retired at age 38, deciding to quit while she was still on top. Although she later made ROBIN AND MARIAN with Sean Connery, and made a few later appearances in later films, this was the end of her star career. Appropriately, it is one of her very greatest performances, with her skills as an actress, if anything, continuing to grow. Audrey plays a woman left alone in her apartment who is preyed on by three men attempting to recover a doll filled with narcotics her husband has accidently acquired.

The cast carries this film. Audrey Hepburn is so good that it would have succeeded regardless of what anyone else in the film had done. As a recently blinded person learning to cope with her new condition, she is utterly convincing. She manages to persuade completely the viewer that she really is quite vulnerable yet completely unwilling to give in to her situation. Alan Arkin, in one of his earliest film roles and his first since his Oscar nominated performance in THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!, gives a chilling performance as Roat, the leader of the bad guys. It was interesting casting, since Arkin was primarily a comedian, one of the founders of the Second City comedy troupe. It is one of the finest performances of his career. Richard Crenna was primarily known as a TV performer at the time, having been a regular on two of the most successful shows of all time, OUR MISS BROOKS and THE REAL McCOYS. He is very effective as the con artist who comes to like and admire his would-be victim.

It is not a perfect film. If one didn't already know that it had been a stage play, any perceptive viewer would be able to tell by watching. It is a profoundly ""stagey"" production, and the way the various characters traipse in and out of her apartment is a bit hard to swallow at times. It feels too much like characters walking on and off stage in a theater. Still, the acting is so exceptional and the situation so compelling that it is easy to cut the film a lot of slack. I will add that the last fifteen or twenty seconds of the film are a little off putting. It functions on a symbolic level, but it unsatisfying emotionally. I wanted to scream: ""Just go give the woman a hug, you jerk!""

The last thirty minutes of the film really are about as scary on a psychological level as anything Hollywood has produced. When it was originally shown in theaters, in the scene where Audrey Hepburn begins breaking all the light bulbs in her apartment, the theater would either darken or dim the lights in the house, with each bulb she would shatter. In the spirit of that, I definitely recommend watching this one in a darkened house.",1244246400,7,2714,4.53469387755102

298080,4,6300268683,"Based on the play by Frederick Knott, 1967's WAIT UNTIL DARK was very much ""the"" thriller of the era, a shocker that set audiences screaming--particularly in the film's final ten minutes, when cinema lights were lowered to the legal limit, placing both characters and audiences in near total blackout for the the movie's climax.  The whole thing was a huge success, and it copped Audrey Hepburn still another Academy Award nomination as best actress.

Hepburn plays Susy Hendrix, a blind woman living with husband Sam in a New York apartment.  Sam has recently come into possession of a doll which he later mislays--but unbeknownst to Sam and Susy the doll contains heroin, and three criminals set out to recover it.  With Sam lured away for the night, the three attempt to con Susy into finding the doll and turning it over to them.  But Susy is swifter on the uptake than they anticipate, and she uses her blindness as a weapon against her tormentors in an effort to escape them.

The stage play presents Susy as a strong, sexy, and clever woman who fights like hell; the film, however, presents her as somewhat timid and vulnerable.  The result is very much a star-vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, who delivers a powerhouse performance--but the change in the character has the effect of rendering the center hour of the film a bit slow.  Still, WAIT UNTIL DARK has a truly memorable first and last half hour and a truly disturbing performance by Alan Arkin, who creates one the most truly evil characters ever seen on screen.  The supporting cast is also quite fine, featuring Richard Crenna, Jack Weston, and (the only cast member to repeat her stage role for the film) Julie Herrod.

Seen today, the performances sometimes seem a bit over the top and the film has moments of accidental camp--but it remains an effective thriller, and Audrey Hepburn fans will enjoying seeing her in this somewhat unlikely role.  The DVD includes a short documentary that features producer Mel Ferrer and actor Alan Arkin.  The print is very good, indeed borderline pristine.  And yes--you really should watch this one in the dark.  Recommended.

298081,5,6300268683,"While there are many excellent reviews for ""Wait Until Dark,"" now that I own the DVD, I feel compelled to reiterate for others my deep appreciation and ""thrill"" for this absolutely wonderful film.

As a teenager I was never a fan of Audrey Hepburn--until I saw ""Wait Until Dark!""  Like many teenagers of the time, one of my favorite genres was ""horror/thriller"" movies like ""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Birds"" (1963), ""Comedy of Terror"" (1964), and ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968).  While ""Jaws"" (1975), ""Alien"" (1979), ""The Shining"" (1980), and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) would follow as audience favorites, for my money ""Wait Until Dark"" is the zenith of this genre.  While I can remember other films, I will never forget ""Wait Until Dark.""  It is literally  the only film that I have ever ""jumped"" in surprise while watching it.  I will never forget the ""darkness"" of the theater, the tension of the crowd, the sounds and screams, the audience on the edge of their seats--many ducking down or closing their eyes in fear--and the shear excitement of the experience of ""waiting"" and watching ""Wait Until Dark.""

While watching ""Wait Until Dark"" on a television set is nothing like experiencing it at the theater, making the room as dark as possible and using headphones can make a close approximation.  I have sworn for 41 years that I would never watch ""Wait Until Dark"" again because I thought I could only truly experience it one time; but when the DVD went on sale I could not resist the temptation--and I am glad I did.  I was totally wrong.  It still thrills me, even though I know what is going to happen.  The only complaints I have are that the DVD ""extras"" are lacking, and the old cardboard storage box is a disgrace.

""Wait Until Dark,"" for those who don't know, was originally a Broadway production, directed by Arthur Penn, which opened on February 2, 1966.  Warner Brothers-Seven Arts purchased the rights shortly after, and quickly brought the production to the ""big screen.""  The script was adapted by Robert Howard-Carrington and Terence Young directed the film. Warner Brothers assembled an incredible cast that included outstanding performances by Audrey Hepburn, Richard Crenna, Alan Arkin, and Jack Weston.  Most theaters went along with the productions intriguing concept: ""In an effort to duplicate the suspense on screen, movie theaters dimmed their lights to their legal limits, then turned off one by one until each light on-screen was shattered, resulting in the theater being plunged into complete darkness.""  And it worked like a charm!

Of interest to me, from the ""extras"" was learning that a Broadway revival directed by Leonard Foglia, which opened on April 5, 1998 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, amassed a nearly equally amazing cast that included Marisa Tomei, Quentin Tarantino, and Stephen Lang in the lead roles.  I have never really been one for stage productions, but this certainly would have been once I would have liked to have seen.

Starring Audrey Hepburn as the sweet, blind but intelligent and crafty Suzie Hendrix; Richard Crenna as the reluctant con artist/thief; and Alan Arkin as the sinister master of disguise Harry Roate.

The progression of the film reminds me of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film ROPE (starring Jimmy Stewart).  The climactic plot twist reminded me most of M. Night Shyamalan's first three popular films (back when he made good movies).  The acting is pretty good, but not what I would call Oscar-worthy (with sincere apologies to Audrey Hepburn fans).  But you forget about all that when you get caught up, and eventually, totally lost in the characters and the inevitable problematic scenarios in which they find themselves.

We heartily enjoyed it and would watch it again.",1216425600,,936,5.078431372549019
298084,4,6300268683,"The thrills of ""Wait Until Dark"" have diminished somewhat through the years. The thriller, released in late 1967, is still impressive for Audrey Hepburn's Oscar nominated performance as Suzy Hendricks, a blind woman terrorized in her apartment by a trio of thugs searching for a child's doll stuffed with heroin, as well as for Alan Arkin's snake-like Mr. Roat, the leader of the termites. But the nightmare she experiences could have been avoided if she had simply locked the door and called the police. When watching it recently, I kept asking myself, ""Why doesn't she lock the door and call the police?""

Did Frederick Knott, the author of the play on which the film was based, ask that question when writing it?

Did Fred Coe, who staged the original Broadway production, ask that question before or during the show's run?

Did Mel Ferrer, who optioned the film rights when the play was still in galley form, question the character's lack of common sense in this matter while showing such courage and intelligence otherwise?

Did Audrey Hepburn, then married to Ferrer, wonder why her character never simply bolted the door to prevent the intrusion?

When viewing the film at a private screening, did Jack L. Warner ever question the implausible scenario?

Somehow or other, it still works, though less effectively than it did when I was an 11-year-old watching the creepy goings on while munching popcorn, licking my buttered fingers, and sipping a then reasonably priced Coca-Cola.

Despite the claustrophobic setting, the film avoids appearing like a filmed play. Much of the credit for that probably belongs to Terence Young, whose greatest claim to fame was, and remains, as director of three of the first four James Bond movies (""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia With Love,"" and ""Thunderball""). Accustomed to, and proficient at, action and adventure, he keeps the film moving.

298155,5,6300268683,"Wait Until Dark is hands down one of my very favorite thrillers of all time, while not a horror movie the final act plays out in horror movie fashion and it's quite obvious many horror filmmakers were inspired by it. If I were to rate my favorite horror movies Wait Until Dark would appear even if not a true horror movie. This is one of those movies that once the suspense and tension kicks in it never let's up. Wait Until Dark has this great eerie and dreadful feeling and the fact almost the whole movie is set in a house it can possibly get boring due to that. One primary setting is very tough, and the makers of Wait Until Dark pull it off to near perfection.

The screenplay written by Robert & Jane-Howard Carrington was excellent one of the finest screenplays for any suspense/thriller. They take their time and develop the character of Susy Hendrix played by Audrey Hepburn. The rest of the characters are excellent as well. All the characters are develop well you get a feel of what they are like, but a little more could have been done with a couple. The one complaint I normally hear is why the villains didn't just rip the place a part for the doll. Granted that would possibly make more sense since Susy is blind not much she could do.

But where would the fun be in that? Either they find the doll or they don't find the doll. When dealing with movies like this you must suspend your disbelief some what. Actually that goes for almost any movie. If everyone did what they are supposed to it wouldn't nearly be as much fun. Bottom line is certain things happen and while they might lack some logic or happen to easy it doesn't hurt the movie one bit. When dealing with this type of flick you have to overlook certain things.

The only other complaint is why Roat played brilliantly by Alan Arkin always come back to the house in a disguise; since Susy is blind she wouldn't be able to tell what he looked like. Well common sense; he does that so nobody in the neighborhood would recognize him. I always thought it was fairly obvious why he would do that. The mental torture Susy is put through was well done and you can really feel for her. Wait Until Dark does move slightly slow, but not in a bad way. The writers take their time and develop the characters mostly Susy, so by the time the plot starts to go full force we have come to know Susy and that makes everything the more traumatic.

Director Terence Young does an amazing job; his scenes are all well paced and always moves the movie forward either in plot or character and once the suspense really starts to kick in it's actually one of the best I have ever seen. Several times while watching the movie I was on the edge of my seat. Even on multiple viewings it still holds up well. The final act is quite scary and horrific, which I'll touch upon later. This is very Hitchcock like, but dare I say better? The suspense is some of the best you'll find and Terence Young delivers big time. He had a clear vision and it works brilliantly.

Audrey Hepburn is one of my very favorite actresses; while I have seen a whole lot of her work I have seen enough to like her. Even before I saw any of her movies I was a fan. She was so beautiful and this charisma and charm that she has draws you to her and that's what makes what Susy goes through even worse. Seeing poor Audrey Hepburn terrorized makes it even more suspenseful. Audrey Hepburn was actually nominated for an Oscar for this movie. How she didn't win is beyond me. Her performance rates as one of my all time favorites.

The cast was top notch; Jack Weston as Sgt. Carlino and Richard Crenna as Mike Talman both provide excellent performances. I'm a big fan of both actors and they were a joy to watch. Hepburn may be the star, but Alan Arkin is simply amazing. He's calm and cool, but a total psychopath and plays 3 roles and it's quite clear he was having a blast doing it. Some people complain about Sam Hendrix played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. saying that he was too cold. I totally disagree; after an accident left her blind, all Sam is doing is trying to teach her how to be dependent. Instead of doing everything for her he wants her to learn. And by him doing that in the end that is what saved Susy's life by not depending on other people to take care of her despite being blind.

What I love so much about this movie is Susy who hasn't been blind very long and has to adjust to a new life. The villains think it's gonna be an easy task, but what she lacks in sight she makes up for in hearing and she's able to realize something isn't right. My only slight complaint is she's too trusting of Mike. Some people are very trusting and at first she has no reason to suspect him, but when she realizes something isn't quite right with Roat and Carlino she really should have suspected Mike, but it's an easy flaw to overlook.

The final act to this movie is actually quite terrifying, like I said this isn't a horror movie, but does have horror movie elements or what would later be horror movie elements. It comes down to Roat and Susy and the showdown is quite chilling. By this time we have come too really like Susy and the fact it's Audrey Hepburn I suppose even if she wasn't developed we would still feel for her. What I love is how she takes out all the lights and its total darkness. Roat is now in a sense blind as are we the viewer. The final act Susy is pretty much the final girl, which horror movie fans should know that term.

The showdown is downright chilling even though I already knew the outcome I was still on the edge of my seat. I kept moving around I couldn't sit still due to the suspense. Wait Until Dark also features one of the greatest jump scenes ever. I don't care how many horror movies or thrillers you have seen; even the most hardcore of fans are bound to jump. I won't give it away, but when it happens you'll know it. Even having seen the movie before I always jump at that, the first time I saw it I nearly had a heart attack. You know it's coming, but it still gets you.

In all the reviews I have read I very rarely hear anyone mention the score by Henry Mancini; the score is one of my favorites actually and really adds to the suspense and tension and in many ways helps elevate the movie to an even higher rate of suspense. The score is very chilling.

Wait Until Dark is one of the all time great chillers and still holds up well. Sure there might be a silly moment or two, but this movie is downright creepy and very suspenseful. It starts off a bit slow, but never boring as the characters are developed and once Wait Until Dark forges ahead the suspense never lacks and builds to a very chilling finale. This is a must see for fans of suspense/thrillers and horror flicks. Wait Until Dark truly is one of a kind. This movie has everything going for it, an excellent score, script and directing and some truly great actors.

As well as the usual trailers, the DVD has an interesting short extra called 'A Look in the Dark' in which Alan Arkin and the Producer Mel Ferrer (who was married to Audrey Hepburn) look back at the film. This is only about 10 minutes but its quite informative.

However the main reason to buy the DVD is the film, and once it starts you will be hooked.",1198195200,,791,4.410958904109589
298159,4,6300268683,"I've loved this movie since I was a kid and I'm a huge Audrey Hepburn fan in general, but I had forgotten that she won an Oscar for her performance in this film.  A thriller about a blind person, it's bound to be slightly less-action oriented than most scary movies--and there are a few slow moments, especially at the beginning.  But the plot still builds a lot of tension as a gang of criminals try to manipulate poor, naive Audrey into giving up a heroine-filled doll.

It's easy to see why Audrey won an Oscar--she's completely believable as a blind woman, and once she realizes that this gang of con-artist criminals will kill her for the doll, she takes the acting to a whole new level.  Even if you don't like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, which is similarly set in one apartment for the majority of the film, I think this movie is more nerve-wracking.  Above all, Audrey's acting is definitely Oscar-worthy, so it's a must-see for fans.",1197331200,,946,4.607142857142857

The film's use of light and shadow is amazing. The timing of the characters exits and entrances is like watching a finely tuned play.  ( this was a play actually.)

298217,4,6300268683,"To be blind, deprived of the power even to see the danger that threatens you, is a frightening experience... It also, obviously, gave director Terence Young the opportunity to carry out one of the most important rules of suspense: let the audience discover more than the principal character...

When we can see imminent danger which the victim, by definition, cannot see, the emotional impact is increased on the viewer... We desire earnestly to cry out in warning, but we cannot... We can only sit helplessly, and wait to see what become apparent... And when the sightless is a young and lovely woman, there are many twists and turns, disturbing moments, claustrophobic atmosphere, great suspense...

Most of the drama is played out in Hepburn's apartment in NewYork's Greenwich Village, and there is an outstanding development when Susy Hendrix, alone with her telephone cord cut and awaiting the return of the gang, decides to use her disadvantage as a defensive weapon... Her one advantage in being blind was that she required no light--and she methodically destroyed all the light-bulbs except one...

After some destructive murdering, only the master-criminal, a merciless villain of many voices (Alan Arkin) was left to confront her, and he selected a particularly diabolical way of terrorizing her...

Audrey Hepburn earned her 5th and final Academy Award nomination among competition that included Anne Bancroft, Faye Dunaway, Edith Evans and Katharine Hepburn...",1168905600,2,1472,5.331896551724138

298293,4,6300268683,Wait until Dark is a unique thriller that takes place mainly in a darkened room.  Audrey Hepburn is moving as a newly blind woman dealing with her handicap.  She is sympathetic in a challenging role that makes real a blind woman's struggle against an unseen danger.  Her performance is believable and the story is riveting.  It takes some skill to make a room come alive in all its darkness and danger.  The climax is satisfying and redeeming as a blind woman uses her other keen senses to outwit her dangerous adversary.  Audrey Hepburn was a skilled actress that never failed to move.  The cinema misses the likes of her and the traditional actress that she never failed to be.  You root for her character and don't question for an instant her handicap or her integrity.  Wait until Dark was an original drama that stands the test of time.,1163376000,,841,4.628378378378378

298297,4,6300268683,"The sense of something dangerous lurking in darkness is a common fear. This fright over something unseen can be apparent or not known. In the case of ""Wait Until Dark,"" the audience but not the main character knows this threat. This puzzle-raveling technique sometimes creates frissons in the audiences' spine, when a blind woman, Susy (Audrey Hepburn,) gets into an all-night battle of wits with three men looking for a drug-stuffed doll in her home. Not knowing where the doll is, and what it contains, she has to find a way to survive the night.

The plot could be tepid home-invasion formalism, but instead it is mostly played as a high-concept plot piece. In this film, the bad guys (led by the Roat, played by the methodical thug, Alan Arkin) do not try to use force to get the doll from her, but use their smooth-talking wits, instead. These men pose as old friends of her husband, burglars, and later as police officers taking the report for the burglary, trying to make her break and tell where the doll is hidden. Yet, since Susy is not sure where it is, they become increasingly annoyed, and more prone to violence.

The cat-and-mouse tactics that the villains impose on the impaired Hepburn character make the movie a much better than average shocker, especially in the famous way that Susy makes the odds more even in the climax-- a showdown that is one of the best cinematic conclusions in terror film history, and will make the audience root for an end to the antagonists' terror.

Hepburn gives a believable performance in a flawed character role. Susy is angry about her recent blindness, while some of her small tantrums, and glimmers of hostility make her seem like a real person-- and this is what makes her character likable--believability. Yet, she is still sympathetically attached to the audiences` emotions.

For instance, in a scene in which she gets in an argument with her errand girl, her character quickly apologizes, and through this sincerity in her acting that shows that only an actress of Hepburn's girl-next-door demeanor, that can encapsulate the sweetness, vulnerability, and nobleness of a woman that many girls aspire to could pull of such a role, and Hepburn does it in valor.

The spotlight is also on scene-stealer, Alan Arkin, who is as menacing as he is a smooth talking, leather jacket, and sunglass wearing in daylight, devilish cat. In what has been called his best role, he gives a memorable performance for his one-dimensional character. Arkin is simply spine-tingling to watch, and you cannot take your eyes off him for a second.

The acting and drama is mostly good all around, yet sometimes the film gives way to both awkward moments of over-acting (you know the ones in the old movies with cheesy music in the background,) and a sense of palatable suspense/terror is not really achieved until the climax.

Because, as good as the final 15-20 minutes are, it also feels a bit of a let down in the way that the audience may feel they wanted Wait Until Dark to scare the bejesus out of you all along. Instead, audience members are treated to something that, despite how intriguing it is, is a bit too overly-talky since it does not at first generate these emotional frissons.

Yet, in the end,  Wait Until Dark features classy acting, and a grand ending that is punctuated by one of the best off-screen jump scares in the history of cinema. The film is a sophisticated thinking-(wo)man's thriller.

298298,5,6300268683,Audrey Hepburn was never better in this tight thriller. The surprise is just as dramatic now as it was on the big screen. good film!,1156723200,,132,4.32
298299,4,6300268683,"Watching Alan Arkin play the curmudgeonly grandfather in this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine"", one tends to forget what an exciting and versatile actor he was back in the mid-1960's. Here he has a field day playing Harry Roat, a coolly intelligent psycho intent on taking a doll filled with heroin from a blind woman, whose husband inadvertently left it in their apartment. This sharply effective 1967 thriller was the last movie Audrey Hepburn made before her nearly decade-long, self-imposed retirement. She ended fifteen years of transcendent performances with her superb portrayal of Susy Hendrix, a photographer's recently blinded wife just getting used to living with her new limitations. Her gradual evolution from seemingly helpless to surprisingly resourceful is what grounds the terror-ridden film in humanity.

The plot begins at the airport where a mysterious young woman asks Susy's unsuspecting husband Sam to keep the doll for her. He takes it back to their Greenwich Village basement apartment where the rest of the vice-gripping plot  takes place. Sam leaves Susy alone, and three men insinuate themselves into the place, one posing as Sam's old college friend to gain her trust. Roat plays three different people in his sadistic attempt to get Susy to hand over the doll. You can take it from there, but it does lead to a corking, no-holds-barred finale between Roat and Susy brilliantly executed. Without mentioning any particulars, the heart-stopping lunge (described colorfully in the DVD featurette) is a memorable piece of fright cinema.

Credit needs to go to director Terence Young who sets the wheels of the rope-tightening plot with precision, and the economic screenplay by Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington based on the Frederick Knott play. Granted there are some contrived elements but you can figure them out yourself. There are solid contributions from Richard Crenna and Jack Weston as Roat's cohorts, Julie Herrod as the petulant teenaged neighbor and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Sam. Henry Mancini composed the cocktail lounge-style 1960's title song, but he also wrote the tense, strings-squealing music score. The 2003 DVD contains one worthwhile extra, an eight-minute, looking-back featurette containing interviews with Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (just ending his marriage to Hepburn at the time of filming). There are also two theatrical trailers, the original and a cheesier one where the audience is told the lights will be completely darkened for the film's last eight minutes.",1156032000,2,2518,5.353535353535354

Sam has misplaced the doll. So, Harry Roat, jr. (Alan Arkin), has been ""asked"" by Lisa to collect the doll with the help of her expartners Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston).  But when Talmund finds a dead Lisa in the closet, Harry's real scheme comes to light.

Harry's plan begins by sending Sam out to Scarsdale for a bogus photo assignment leaving his blind wife Susy (Audrey Hepburn) alone in the apartment.  Next Mike arrives at the apartment and tells Susy that he is Sam's old Marine buddy.  Roat breaks in as an old man claiming Sam is having an affair with his daughter in law.  Mike ""calls"" the police and Carlino arrives.  Carlino lets drop that there was a doll associated with a dead woman.  Roat comes back as himself and explains that his father thinks his wife Lisa is having an affair with a photographer that she met in Quebec.  The photographer gave her a doll (the missing doll).  Susy starts to suspect that the police think that Sam is involved in Lisa's murder.

But what the gang don't take into consideration is that Susy's heightened other senses.  Susy quickly puts things together. When Roat realizes she is ahead of him he increase the heat which becomes a game of cat and mouse in which the mouse becomes the cat.

This is a great thriller.  The direction is fast paced and doesn't try to keep the audience one step behind.  Audrey Hepburn give what will be one of her last great performances.  Alan Arkin is truly menacing as Harry Roat.

298460,5,6300268683,"That's what Audrey Hepburn plays in Wait Until Dark, based on the play by Frederick Knott, the genius behind Dial M For Murder.  Her role as Suzy Hendrix is one of the most challenging, as she played a physically handicapped person.  She prepared by going to the Lighthouse for the Blind academy in Manhattan, and spent time with a student, who showed how she found her way around a room.  Audrey also took Braille lessons, covering her eyes with black shields, walking with a stick, and applying makeup without a mirror.  Then there were the contact lens, used to simulate the blank look conveyed by blind people.  Given the calibre of this movie, Ms. Hepburn passes with flying colours.

Now, for the World's Champion Blind Lady's Story.  Suzy, who lost her sight in an accident, becomes the unwitting pawn by three crooks desperate to regain a doll her husband was given for safekeeping by a blonde at an airport.  Seems that Lisa, the blonde, was smuggling heroin in the doll, trying to double cross Roat, the ringleader of the crooks, and was murdered for her duplicity. Roat blackmails his reluctant cohorts, Mike Talman and Carlino, into helping him, but offers them $2,000 each to help him search for the doll.

Mike passes himself as a Marine buddy of her husband Sam and wins her confidence.  All the while, a large VW van parked across the street by the phone booth serves as their center of operations.  Roat-played to slimy perfection by Alan Arkin, whose favourite toy is a knife named Geraldine, is quite the mastermind.  He arranges things so Sam has to go to Asbury Park for an all-day photo job so that he and his cohorts can come and go to the Hendrix's flat under various pretences to search for the doll, and gain information from our heroine.  At one point, he disguises himself as his own father, breaks into Suzy's house on the pretence of thinking his daughter-in-law is having an affair with a photographer named Sam Hunt.  That leads to Talman, a convenient witness, calling for the police, actually Carlino at the phone booth, posing as a police sergeant.  Roat himself gives Suzy a half-truth of the story, mentioning a doll.  Suzy does remember Sam bringing home a doll he was looking after, but the doll has mysteriously vanished.

The crooks are thus desperate to find the doll and Suzy is desperate to clear her husband.  It doesn't take her long to figure out that a missing woman found murdered was the same woman who passed the doll to Sam, and that Sam will be implicated unless the doll is found.  This challenge exemplifies Sam's pushing Suzy to be the world's champion blind lady, trying to be more self-reliant, and as much of her former self while she still had her sight.

That leads to a scene where she drops a salt shaker and uses her hand in a circular sweeping motion to find it.  All the while, she tells Sam she doesn't like Gloria, a pouty bespectacled teenager named Gloria, whose family life is less than stable.  She says she prefers a dog, but as Sam says, dogs can't go shopping.

At one point, Suzy muses that there are some things she wants to do, such as pick out wallpaper or colours for the house, something she can never do with this dark brown she constantly sees.  Yet her sense of hearing has improved.  She notes that Mr. Roat and his father's shoes had the same new shoe squeak.  She also remarks to Gloria that Carlino and Roat were playing with the blinds.

Most of the film takes place in Suzy's apartment, remaining true to its stage origins.  And Wait Until Dark is a well-paced thriller that comes alive when Suzy finally figures things out, highlighted by a climactic gripping scene in the near dark of the flat, with Suzy being terrorized by the odious Roat.

""She is really something,"" Mike says of her at one point, and Suzy is a heroine to root for.

298461,5,6300268683,"Based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit, Wait Until Dark is a chilling film, even by today's standards. This is a masterfully crafted thriller about three deranged crooks who manipulate a blind woman to recover their lost smuggled goods.
Audrey Hepburn is fantastic as Suzy, in her Oscar nominated role, showing us a fairly realistic portrait of a fragile woman coping with her dark new world. She manages to garner our sympathy, especially with Efrem Zimbalist Jr's demanding husband watching her every move.
Alan Arkin is equally terrific, making a terrifying villain.
Wait Until Dark manages to create a paranoid environment devoid of any human life. The apartment building Suzy lives in is perpetually empty; Suzy's husband, Sam, leaves her on her own for most of the day, and the dorky young girl upstairs is apparently motherless most of the time. The cave-like arches of the apartment has an unsettling effect of positioning Hepburn in a nondescript underground (the windows only look out on the feet of passersby, emphasizing Suzy's disconnect from her neighborhood). It all creeps up on the audience, making for a suspenseful, claustrophobic and effective shocker. I literally could not breathe during the film's final ten minutes.
Definitely wait until dark and watch it with someone who likes to scream. This is a true nail-biter if there ever was one.",1087603200,6,1363,5.1441441441441444
298462,5,6300268683,"...and then the knife whistling past her ear. . . ""
At the ripe old age of 38, Audrey Hepburn proved that she had aged like fine wine in Terrence Young's ""Wait Until Dark"", for which she earned her fifth, and last, Oscar nomination.  Despite obviously being based on the long-running Broadway play; as the majority of the story takes place in an apartment and there are few characters; it translates surprisingly well onto screen and is remarkably intriguing and suspenseful.  Alan Arkin, who plays one of the vilest villains of 60's cinema, Richard Crenna, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. make up the stellar supporting cast and all turn in excellent performances.
The sheer terror ""Wait Until Dark"" inflicts upon its audience comes from the filmmakers ability to place us in Suzy's shoes.  The very idea of being blind and trapped in an apartment and horribly alone even though you are in one of the most densely populated areas of the world, just plains scares me.  The nail-biting climax has some truly classic moments in it (who knew Alan Arkin was such a gymnast?) and will stick with you long after the film is over.
As always, Audrey is simply perfection.  Charming and beautiful even in the most unflattering situations, she yet again proves her star power.  The constant distress and anguish Audrey portrays onscreen is achingly real, and unfortunately, not very far from the truth.  She was suffering from anorexia and marriage troubles with the producer of the film, Mel Ferrer, throughout the entire shoot.  One can only imagine how draining it must have been for her to be required to be screaming and crying the whole shoot while dealing with these problems.  Her Oscar nomination was most certainly deserved!",1087516800,4,1716,4.889655172413793
298463,5,6300268683,"Few actresses have lit up the screen in the same fashion as the late Audrey Hepburn.  In this 1967 thriller (her last Oscar nomination), she plays a blind woman who finds herself terrorized by a trio of men looking for a heroin-stuffed doll.
Relying on pure psychological suspense as opposed to gore and violence, WAIT UNTIL DARK is still a powerful movie.  Miss Hepburn is perfect for the role---she seems so frail, and yet there is an inner strength that comes to her aid in the final moments of the film.  She lost the Oscar that year to another Hepburn (Katherine in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""), and it just goes to show how Oscar at times relies more on sentimentality than the actual power of a performance.
Richard Crenna eschewed his good guy roles by playing Mike Talman, one of the cons who does appreciate Suzie's intelligence.  Jack Weston, a great comic actor, also goes for more visceral drama, and his performance as the buffoon is right on target.  And what about Mr. Alan Arkin?  His cold, insensitive evil is just right!!!  Little Julie Herrod as Gloria also does a credible job.
Terence Young's direction is tight and Henry Mancini's impeccable music also heightens the suspense.
WAIT UNTIL DARK is a classic thriller, and one of Miss Hepburn's finest moments.",1086307200,4,1283,4.778280542986425
298464,5,6300268683,"I love classic thrillers, and this is definitely one of my favorites. Audrey Hepburn convincingly portrays a blind woman who, unbeknownst to her, has a heroin-filled doll in her apartment. Two recently parolled con-men and one coolly sinister killer will stop at nothing to find that doll.
Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and Jack Weston all perform wonderfully in their roles. Especially Arkin; his Harry Roat character is one of the best villains in cinema history. The only qualm I had with characterization was Hepburn's husband, played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. His character seemed too callous, and his reaction at the end of the film was terribly written, acted, and directed. But he plays a minor role in the film, so it doesn't affect the overall quality of the picture.
Although nearly every scene takes place in Hepburn's apartment, that does not diminish the film's suspense or terror. In fact, this increases the effectiveness of the climax. To reveal any more details about this film would be criminal, though. Stay ""in the dark"" about the details of this film until you see it, then watch it in the dark.

298465,5,6300268683,"I was extremely impressed with this movie. As I am a blind individual myself, I truly appreciated that this was not one of those ridiculous movies which dealt specifically with how blind people function in the world, but instead presented a realistic portrait of a woman fighting to survive.
Audrey Hepburn realistically portrays Susie Hendrix, a woman who has recently lost her sight due to a car accident. She still struggles to adjust to her new lifestyle with the help of her husband Sam. My only complaint  of the movie is Sam's often harsh treatment of his wife. I realize that it necessary, but considering that this was a recent loss of eyesight, he possibly could have been more patient.
The main premise of this film concerns a villainous drug dealer, Harry Rote (portrayed by Alan Arkin.)
Alan Arkin is superb in his role. He is the most effective villain I have ever seen portrayed. Rote enlists the help of two recently released conmen to retrieve a heroin-filled doll from Susie's home, where it accidentially was taken by Sam. The ensuing struggle is between Susie and the three men, who attempt to deceive her in to handing over the doll. The climax of this film is extremely suspenseful and scary. Another quick note: Julie Herrod, who portrays Gloria, a young girl who assists Susie is extremely good.
This film is truly worth your time, not only because it is suspenseful, but because it tells of the importance of overcoming obstacles in order to help yourself and others around you.",1082419200,,1503,4.803088803088803
298466,3,6300268683,"Beautiful inspiring movie.  It shows how strong love can be. Sam loves Susy so much.
Pure love is not weak. It makes a person stronger. Sam supports Susy, encourages her and helps her in learning all the essential things of life.
Love is patience. Sam is calm. He never looses his temper while helping Susy and patience pays.
Love is to respect. Sam never insults or hurt Susy because she is blind. He treats her like a normal person and Susy complements Sam
completely.
Sam and Susy are made for each other. Totally,the movie shows wahat a true love should be.
It is very difficult to survive in this  world with bad people trying to ruin our lives. Life for Sucy was not easy being blind and trying to adjust to the new blind world. Bad guys come looking for a doll stuffed with drugs when Sam was away at work. She fights back so hard. She uses her inner sense. The way she remembers the foot steps,switching off all the lights and smelling gasolene and scaring the villain by lighting the matchbox is thrilling.
Story ends with a happy note and lots of inspiration.",1081900800,,1069,4.476923076923077
298525,3,6300268683,"Wait Until Dark is another old movie that has sadly lost something as the years go by.  I think the whole style of film making has changed, and as such my generation has grown up with a different idea of what can be done within the realm of celluloid.  This movie is really all build up.  Not to take anything away from the script or the brilliantly put together plot, but it reads like a play adapted for cinema.  The scenes are slow and stay in one location and the movie keeps building to one large climax at the end.  I feel a modern movie would mix it up more, with several denouements and a few more settings.
However my main beef with this movie is the overall absurdity, or perhaps naivete of the plot.  3 bad guys want to get a heroin filled-doll off a blind chick.  So they concoct this overly elaborate scenario whereby they trick poor Audrey into thinking her husband killed some broad he had an affair with and this doll could be the only evidence tying him to the crime.
I sat there for an hour thinking - is this plausible, or wouldn't thugs like these really have just held her down and beaten her until she told them?
So this story creeps on for an hour, brilliant acting, good pacing, but in the end (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) what happens?
The baddest bad guy holds her down and beats it out of her!!!  Great. Couldn't you just have done that in the first place.
The other weird thing is the relationship between Hepburn and her husband - it think it's supposed to be strong and encouraging, yet through my eyes it appears abusive and derogatory - even when he first sees her after her ordeal he doesn't run to her, he make her (blind, terrified, beaten up, shaking) come to him!!!  Craziness.
Audrey deserves better than him and this movie.  File for divorce, spousal abuse, and get your name taken off the credits while you're at it honey.
P.S. The baddest bad guy was last spotted playing a psychiatrist in ""Gross Point Blank""... He's going up in the world.",1079308800,7,1978,4.40934065934066
298526,4,6300268683,"Wait Until Dark (1967) is based on a popular play by Frederick Knott and directed by Terrance Young who also did the 007 classic Thunderball (1965).  The lovely Audrey Hepburn plays Susy Hendrix, a woman left recently blind by a car accident, who is learning to adjust and cope with her new perspective on life.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is Sam Hendrix, Susy's photographer husband, with whom she shares a basement apartment in New York.  Also starring is Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and character actor Jack Weston.

The story involves illegal substances being smuggled into the United States within a doll, and then the doll being passed along to Susy's husband at the airport under curious but strictly coincidental circumstances.  Alan Arkin plays Roat, a seedy character who was supposed to be the intended recipient of the doll/drugs, and Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are two thuggish types who get roped into helping Roat try to retrieve the doll.

Hepburn plays her role wonderfully, never once giving the viewer the impression that she isn't blind.  A number of subtle points are made to allude to the strengthening of her other senses, hearing, smell, etc., that one finds common with the loss of sight.  As the criminals construct their elaborate plans to liberate their illicit merchandise, Hepburn's character, being somewhat naive in the beginning, soon realizes the true sense of the danger she's in, and reacts perfectly within the nature of her character.  Arkin plays his character(s) with the smooth cunning of a predator hunting its' prey, maliciously savoring the moments before the figurative kill.  His beatnik appearance and demeanor mask his true form, which is revealed later on within the unfolding of the plot.  This film is very suspenseful for those with the patience to follow it through to the end.  It may not have the out and out scares the title might imply, but the gradual building of tension and suspense is delicious as the viewer is 'in the know' while the main character is left to struggle with the situations.  Although an exceptionally strong supporting cast helps, Hepburn really makes this film, and was awarded with an Oscar nomination for her performance.  She even went so far as to attend a school for the visually impaired and learn to read Braille to better understand her character.

The print on this disc looks very nice and is in wide screen anamorphic format.  Special features include a featurette on the film, an essay about transferring the play to the silver screen, and trailers for the movie.  This is truly a taut thriller worthy being released on DVD, and I am appreciative of Warner Brothers for putting it out, even if I find their plastic and cardboard packaging to be cheap and annoying.

Audrey Hepburn is very credible as the lovely Susie Hendrix, a feminine and insightful lady who has recently lost her eyesight in an accident. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. plays her rigid but compassionate husband; one of his emotional reactions is my only problem with the movie, and even that can be overlooked. Julie Herrod is the bratty but fairly well drawn Gloria, and Richard Crenna and Jack Weston play the two conmen. Jack Weston's character is the simpler of the two, and Richard Crenna is the dishonest but convincingly charming. The intelligent Harry Roat (or however you spell it) is played by Alan Arkin. Roat is just creepy. He gives bad vibes.

Yet Susie begins to rely on what she already had---her wits and her senses---to survive at the hands of Arkin, the sickest and deadlier of the trio of thugs. ""Wait Until Dark"" is a fine, gripping thriller that builds slowly and surely to it's terrifying climax as Susie and Roat, Jr. (Arkin) are left to square off. Arkin does some neat turns in disguises in his efforts to trick Susie. Crenna is almost likeable as the coolest of the trio while Weston is sweaty and nervous.

298533,3,6300268683,"I remember this movie differently to what I saw the other night. It didn't have the same impact that it once did.  Nonetheless, the film remains a classic cemeted by Audrey Hepburn's fine performance as a blind woman who is been harrassed over a doll containing drugs.  It doesn't have as much scare value as one would hope, but worth seeing for the fact that is was a very successful play for a number of years.  The biggest let-down is the slowness of the film.  It seems to take ages for anything exciting to really happen, and when it does, it disappoints in a way. Perhaps that is contributable to it been made in 1966 - shock values were different then.  I still think the best scene is when Suzi returns home and the three crooks are in the apartment.  She can feel a presence but is not sure.
DVD SUMMARY:
Warner Bros have cleaned up the film, although a level of grain seems persistent throughout the entire film.  The extras include a 8 minute (whoopee) featurette which mainly talks with Audrey's then husband Mel Ferrer and Alan Arkin (the main crook).

Alan Arkin's sinister character, and Audrey Hepburn's unbreakably fragile blind woman, are two of the best performances in cinematic history.  The script is marvellously devoid of tawdriness, of slackness, of shabbiness, and of gratuitous violence (though violence, implicit and explicit, does exist).

The action occurs in a Greenwich Village apartment, for the most part.  Three men, led by the bullying Arkin, are convinced that the Hendrixes (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Audrey Hepburn) have come into possession of a doll that has been stuffed with narcotics.  These men (Richard Crenna pretending to be a friend of Audrey's absent husband, Jack Weston impersonating a police sergeant) orchestrate an elaborate charade to distract, and to menace, Suzy Hendrix into revealing the whereabouts of the doll.

Crucial to the plot is a young neighbour of the Hendrixes named Gloria (played by Julie Herron, with sufficient skill as to make us wonder about her other work in films).

Are there flaws?  Very few indeed.  The streets of Greenwich Village are curiously unpopulous at all hours of the day, and Arkin's disguises are superfluous (Audrey's character being blind), except inasmuch as they entertain the audience.

Arkin's casual, almost insouciant, sadism is an exquisite piece of acting (somewhat different from the affable Judge Rifkind of A&E's ""100 Centre Street,"" but no less deserving of acclaim!); and Audrey Hepburn's Suzy is so compelling that we begin to perceive a small injustice in the fact that 1967's Best Actress Oscar went to ""the other Hepburn"" (for ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"").

You will literally sit on the edge of your seat until this film is over. The plot plays out perfectly and the mystery and suspense is high! To help create the effect of blindness for this movie, Audrey wore thick contacts that dulled her eyes and vision. She memorized where everything was on the set so that in the dark, she was perfectly comfortable. Alan Arkin makes an incredibly nasty bad guy and Audrey's fear of him is quite catching, even over the screen.

Susie Hendrix, played by the wonderful  Audrey Hepburn, is a blind woman being spied and  terrorized upon in her own apartment. When Susie's  husband Sam is asked to hold an antique doll for a  woman who mysteriously disappears, little does he  know the horror that will unfold. Unknown to Susie,  the drug-filled doll is in their home and a  psychopath, played by Alan Arkin, must retrieve it  by any means necessary.

298674,5,6300268683,"In her last Oscar nominated role, Audrey Hepburn brings her role as Susie Hendrix to life in this thrilling film brought together by Hitchcock influence.
Susie is learning to adapt to her blindness, which resulted from a recent auto accident, she recieves help from Gloria, a girl who lives in the upstairs appartment & her loving photographer husband, Sam. Sam who does a great deal of traveling in his line of business, excepts a doll as a favor to a young woman, on his way home from Canada. He takes it home deciding to give it to a child in the hospital only to have it dissapear.
But what Sam & Susie don't know is that the doll is actually filled with small packets of herion & that a murderous drug dealer (Alan Arkin) will stop at nothing to get his hands on the doll. He inlists two con-men (Richard Crenna & Jack Weston) to help him trick Susie into handing the doll over while posing as policemen & Sam's friends. The plot thickins as Susie begins to realize the truth behind the criminals & turns her weakness into a powerful strength.
Many claim that the movie is a pathetic excuse for a horror & that the movie isn't at all scary but I guess they consider films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, & Halloween scary because of the cheap scares & gore. But if your not hooked on the slasher genre you should watch this classic, & try watching it in the dark, if you don't scare easy.",972432000,10,1399,4.384615384615385

The movie is about recently blinded Susie Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn), Susie lives with her photographer husband in a small apartment, when her husband, Sam returns from a business trip in Canada he brings home a doll. The doll just happens to be filled with herion.

298676,4,6300268683,"As usual, Audrey Hepburn was giggling throughout this entire production, but definitely NOT when the cameras rolled! She turns in a very convincing performance as a terrified (for good reason!) blind woman with class and dignity. Indeed, Hepburn's spirit, and gutsy, determined character carries an otherwise lackluster storyline. Terence Young also helps save the day by directing with a Hitchcockian flare! The remaining cast members contribute solid acting despite pretty much stereotypical characterizations. Besides Hepburn, the little girl next door is undoubtedly the most savvy and memorable. This film features fifteen, count em' 15 of the scariest (consecutive!) minutes ever recorded in cinematic history! It's a thrilling conclusion to a suspenseful movie that (unfortunately) contains its share of lackluster and unsettling moments as well.

298677,5,6300268683,"I first saw this movie in an after-school showing in our junior high school auditorium.  During one scene, every 13-year old girl in the big auditorium screamed at the top of her lungs, and my ears are still ringing  to this day....The movie is an excellent suspense thriller (more suspense  than horror, really).  What I enjoy about it is that the ""victim""  does not just sit helplessly and scream, she fights back.  She is faced  with overwhelming odds, but she fights back against the bad guys, and even  figures out a way to turn her weakness into strength. The only criticism I  have of the movie is that the ""tough guys"" who are supposed to be  so scarey haven't aged well.  Grown men who fight with tv antennas and bike  chains just look silly in the days of gang-bangers with Uzis.  On the other  hand, Alan Arkin is still VERY creepy when he concentrates on being creepy  instead of frightening.  Despite the one aspect of it being a bit dated, I  highly recommend the movie.",963705600,2,984,4.531428571428571

298679,5,6300268683,"This is the kind of thriller I like.  I find the blood and gore slasher films to be boring and unimaginative.  But Wait Until Dark builds up genuine suspense with it's clever plot and psychological tension.  Hepburn  stars as blind woman whose husband has inadvertently taken possession of a  doll with drugs hidden in it.  Alan Arkin stars as a twisted criminal that  wants to get his hands on the doll, and he enlists Richard Crenna and Jack  Weston to join him in fooling the blind woman into handing over the doll.  Hepburn is terrific as the blind woman who proves to be more  self-sufficient than she probably even thought she was, and Arkin is very  scary as the psycho who terrorizes her.  The way that the men go about  getting the doll is fascinating, and the way the film is constructed, the  viewer really feels the suspense from the point of view of someone who is  blind and that much more vulnerable.  This is a suspense film that everyone  should see.",962496000,4,967,4.52906976744186

298739,5,6300268683,"""Wait Until Dark"" is a suspense film in the finest traditions of Alfred Hitchcock.  The direction by Terence Young (""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"") masterfully blends a stellar cast with  mood, music, and atmosphere to create a compelling psychological thriller.  The story involves a blind woman (Audrey Hepburn), who has unknowingly come  into the possession of a child's doll filled with heroin.  Three con men  (Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and Jack Weston) create an elaborate scheme to  locate the doll in her apartment without arousing her suspicions.
Like  Hitchcock, director Young reveals the identity and intent of the con men  right from the beginning of the movie.  He lets the audience in on their  secret.  It is left to the blind and isolated victim to decipher their  intent and her own personal danger over the course of the film.  Hepburn is  engaging in the role of a woman who is at once vulnerable yet possesses  unfolding inner strength.  She knows she is alone and ultimately  responsibility for her own fate. The suspense grows as her suspicions are  slowly aroused until all is revealed to her in one terrifying moment of  confrontation with the cunning and evil Arkin.  The stark confines of the  apartment and the dramatic musical score by Henry Mancini accentuate the  dark and foreboding atmosphere.  This is a film you will not soon forget...",952646400,39,1378,4.942982456140351

A gripping tale of a blind woman being terrorised in her own apartment builds up into a frenzied tale of GENUINE jump-out-your-seat suspence! - this is actually one of the first films of that evasive and unique genre........  As the cat and mouse game gets going, Suzy proves to be an elusive and formidable match for Arkin and company...........

While my aunt will never live that down, my mom is still haunted by this movie, and I can tell why. I saw it on AMC in August at midnight, and that was a mistake. This movie scared me beyond my expectations. Audrey Hepburn was fantastic as Susie Hendrix, the recently blinded woman persued by Alan Arkin, a narcotics dealer who will stop at nothing to get to a stash that is in Susie's apartment.
Many claim this movie isn't scary, but coming from a generation that grew up on Scream, Halloween, Nightmare on Elmstreet and other cheap movie's that use gore and `don't-turn-that-bend' suprises for scares, it doesn't mean much.
`Wait Until Dark' is so much more than the typical slasher flick, it is a psychological thriller that takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride to hell and doesn't stop turning and tossing until the last frame of film fades to black. On second viewing, if you feel the *sparkle* is fading, just position yourself in Susie's shoes, and you're in for a whole new experience.
Praise `Wait Until Dark' - and trust me, if you wait until dark to watch this, you'll be rewarded greatly with a heart-stopping finale!",942624000,65,1451,4.541984732824427
