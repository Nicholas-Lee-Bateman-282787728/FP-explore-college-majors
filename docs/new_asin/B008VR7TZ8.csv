Then the rest of the show is WITHOUT Henny - interviewing 5 guys to trick their ways into getting their pictures taken with celebrities.

8531161,4,B008VR7TZ8,"Those who remember the Golden Age of the TV talk show, fondly remember producer David Susskind, who for nearly 30 years interviewed celebrities - whether entertainment or political - on his weekly show. It began on local New York City television in 1958 on the independent TV station WNTA. (The same station that aired his ""Play of the Week Series"") When WNTA became a public broadcasting station, the show - ""Open End"" went into syndication. It also changed its name sometimes to ""The David Susskind Show""

Unlike the Dick Cavett Show - which I have devoured on DVD - Susskind was more serious in interviewing a guest during his one- hour or two-hour show (less commercials). I'd compare him more with Charlie Rose - but with a decidedly New York accent. And he could be sarcastic.

To my knowledge none of the ""Open End"" shows has been available on home video until last year when S'more Entertainment began releasing them (a two-hour Jerry Lewis interview was the first).

While this 58-minute DVD has ""one-liner"" comedian Henny Youngman's name prominently on the front and back of the package, you should know that Youngman only appears for the first 36 minutes of the program.

The show aired in 1984, two years before the end of Susskind's run. It was filmed in a studio with no audience, which makes Susskind the one only one there to laugh at Youngman's jokes. Youngman has a huge ""joke file"" but certain ones seem to be the most popular and those are the ones repeated here. If you've heard or seen him - and you probably have if you found this DVD - you've heard these jokes again and again, but his timing STILL makes you laugh. And he doers reveal when he first told his ""Take my wife... Please!"" joke. The conversation doesn't get serious very often but, when it does, you realize that Youngman had a long career because he managed his own career and was a good businessman. (He even mentions his investments.)

The remainder of the DVD is a discussion that Susskind has with four ""celebrity chasers"" who crash events (Grammys, Oscars, World Series) just so they can say they did - get photos to prove it. It's okay but not the reason you would want this DVD if they were the only guests.)

The color print is acceptable but grainy, though that really doesn't affect watching it.

I'm giving the DVD a 4 star rating for the total content. I was entertained by Youngman's jokes. But, again be aware that he's only there for that 36 minutes.

Next up for me to watch is a Susskind interview with Milton Berle. I hope that S'more Entertainment will continue to release these Susskind shows, many of which (like this one from New York's WNEW-TV) were only shown in New York area.
