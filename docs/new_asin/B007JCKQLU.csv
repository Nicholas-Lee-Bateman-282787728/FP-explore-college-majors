5090878,5,B007JCKQLU,This documentary is much more than a sports story. Dale Brown is a man of action. He is on a mission to make a difference in this crazy world. His courage inspires us all to speak up!,1397347200,,183,3.972972972972973
5090879,1,B007JCKQLU,This is not the movie 'Man in the Glass' but is instead an idiotic short called 'The Man in the Glass Case'.,1395532800,2,108,3.9545454545454546
5090880,5,B007JCKQLU,"In a day where almost  every coaching  interview is guarded politically correct dribble this is a welcome reminder.

We will probably never see a man this real again on the major sporting stage.",1391990400,,194,4.818181818181818
5090881,1,B007JCKQLU,"THIS WAS TWENTY MINUTES OF .... NOTHING! A MAN STABS ANOTHER FOR NO REASON.  THE END. IT'S NOT A MOVIE OR DOCUMENTARY, VERY CONFUSING.",1389052800,,134,4.583333333333333
5090882,1,B007JCKQLU,a 20-minute short about a guy who cripples an fellow employee?  Is this a mix-up?!?  Someone check this or maybe I have to go get checked up.,1388880000,,141,4.185185185185185
5090883,5,B007JCKQLU,I had the good fortune to hear Dale Brown speak recently and knew that I had to hear about his life.  This DVD is very inspiring.  The Dale Brown Story should inspire each of us to use our God-given talents to help others.  First we need good mentors to learn from and then we can become that good mentor.  I am now in my 70's and realize how most of us are lacking good mentors in our lives.  But it is never too late.,1366848000,2,419,3.9404761904761907
5090884,5,B007JCKQLU,"This was a great movie with a great story about a great man. The movie really gave you a good understanding of Dale from many perspectives. Interviews with people he knew or impacted, like Shaq were great. It kept my attention the whole way. It is well worth seeing. One person can make a difference and congratulations to the people who made this film. I really enjoyed it!",1350950400,2,374,4.514705882352941
5090885,5,B007JCKQLU,Inspiring video.,1442448000,,16,7.5
5090886,5,B007JCKQLU,"Great movie, very inspiring. It was recommended by Darren Hardy in his Success magazine bonus CD where he interviewed Dale Brown. What an inspiring life! There needs to be more people like Dale to make things happen in the world and to fight injustices. Raw, true to himself, dedicated, compassionate, caring - all the virtues that are rare in people now. How one life can impact so many lives?! It was new to me to learn about the Shaq story, about the man who was sentenced to life in prison and was released because of Dale's efforts. Just wow!",1439856000,,547,4.5353535353535355

5090890,4,B007JCKQLU,It was interesting and I'm not even a basketball fan!!,1434412800,,54,4.5
5090891,5,B007JCKQLU,"Wonderful!  I wish all coaches were like this. If you want your coach or player to pay it forward, be ethical, give, and make this world a better place then this is a video to watch. For any reason you will finish it feeling as if it's your turn to pay it forward.",1429401600,,264,3.981132075471698
5090892,2,B007JCKQLU,Boring.  I started watching it because I thought it would be a 'local interest' story as I have ties to Minot and I like pretty much anything Matthew McConaughey is in. This one missed the mark on both counts. I only watched about 15 minutes of it so maybe that wasn't fair.  Moved slow.,1428537600,,287,4.296296296296297
5090893,4,B007JCKQLU,"I learned a lot about the NCAA.  I am not a basketball fan, but I grew up in the '70s.  Somehow Dale Brown's story/life was not familiar to me.  I admire his principles and his continued involvement.",1426809600,,199,4.324324324324325
5090894,1,B007JCKQLU,The 20 minute video that played was not the video advertised and had nothing to do with Dale Brown or any of the featured performers.  Very disappointed that Amazon has not corrected this incorrect link or whatever the issue is.,1399852800,2,228,4.7
8518294,5,B007JCKQLU,"There is no one I respect more than Coach Dale Brown. I met Coach Brown in the 1960s when he took his first assistant basketball coaching at Utah State University. After getting out of school in the afternoon, I would rush to the practice court to watch practice and shag balls. Coach Brown is the ultimate motivator and recruiter. He turns boys into men. He turns negative aspects of life from lemons to lemonade. He's a class act who is always looking to make life better each day.",1478390400,,483,4.5
8518295,5,B007JCKQLU,"Wasn't sure I would like the format of the video, but it was very inspiring.  Highly recommend it. We all need to be a little bit more like Dale Brown.",1470614400,,151,4.033333333333333
8518296,5,B007JCKQLU,Excellent! I really enjoyed watching this documentary... worth watching!!,1463184000,,73,7.222222222222222
8518297,5,B007JCKQLU,"What a great documentary about a man who was more than a coach but a compassionate advocate for people, The men and women he touched seemed endless.",1456617600,,148,4.518518518518518
8518298,4,B007JCKQLU,Good documentary on a good guy. But to list M. McConaughey in the credits is just plain wrong. He was on camera what 1-2 scenes at most.,1456099200,,136,4.074074074074074
8518299,5,B007JCKQLU,Excellent movie of a man with Integerity,1454284800,,40,4.857142857142857

8518301,5,B007JCKQLU,Not to be missed. Nuff said.,1452902400,,28,3.8333333333333335
8518302,5,B007JCKQLU,Fascinating to see someone who has every right to play the victim card not do it and pick up a sword of justice for everyone he can.  Excellent film.,1445212800,,149,4.137931034482759
8518303,5,B007JCKQLU,Very inspiring!,1444176000,,15,7.0
