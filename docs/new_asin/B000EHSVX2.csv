2520877,5,B000EHSVX2,"Gary Cooper is not generally known for his comedic roles, however his straight face as the captain of an experimental sub chaser during WWII adds to the fun this film generates. Ably supported by Eddie Albert, Jack Webb, Harvey Lembeck, Millard Mitchell et al, this is one of my all time favorites. Picked to prove the workability of a new type of steam engine as their propulsion unit, the crew does everything in it's power to make the ""Beast"" work, (by approved (or otherwise) means. While broken down in the middle of Chesapeake Bay in the middle of the night, the crew sights a tanker who they immediately signal for help by lamp.  Their reply is quick in coming, not by signal lamp, but by a round from the tankers deck gun!  The tug that keeps towing them back to base keeps a scorecard on it's deck house showing how many times the ""U.S.S. Teakettle"" has been brought home.  Towards the end of the film, they finally get the ""Beast"" to work only to find that their throttles are frozen and they can't slow down! What follows is hilarious. This is a must see film! It hasn't lost it's punch over the years!",1162684800,20,1113,4.472906403940887
2520878,4,B000EHSVX2,"This little comedy is based upon an actual incident of World War II. In an effort to get more speed out of some of its ships, the Navy tries an experiment using a modernized steam engine. Steam does prove to be capable of giving higher speeds but the problem is with getting enough fresh water to make the steam. A new design is tried to try and solve this problem but there is a war on and not many experience officers are available to conduct the trials.

Enter Gary Cooper. He plays an engineer who has been commissioned as a reserve officer. He has not real experience in ship handling but is assigned to command the experimental ship. He is not too worried at first. He figures he can rely on experience officers and crew and devote himself to the engineering problem. Unfortunately for him, the only experienced sailor is the bosun. All of the rest, officers and crew, are short time reservists. This leads to a slew of comedic situations.

It's a fun and light hearted comedy worth the viewing.",1157587200,13,1001,4.524861878453039

2520918,4,B000EHSVX2,"I liked the movie.  Gary Cooper is one of my favorite star.  That is worth 3 stars any time. Add a very young Lee Marvin & Charles Bronson & I rate the movie 4 to 41/2 stars.  John McIntire played his part well too.  Can't rate it 5 stars because the plot is weak.  For me Cooper, Marvin, Bronson & McIntire are well worth watching  & I will watch it again.",1423180800,,357,3.9577464788732395
2520919,4,B000EHSVX2,"Actually a pretty good movie, A close relative was on that ship when they were making it, and I had never seen it. Quite a few stars in it before they became famous.",1422057600,,165,4.03030303030303

2520921,3,B000EHSVX2,"A WW2 movie with Cooper as a brand new Navy Officer who is assigned as commanding officer of a worn out ship that nobody wants.  The cast is the only thing that keeps the movie alive. It's like a one of those sports movies where the gang are all misfits and then come together to solve all problems and make their ship the best ship around.  The cast is comprised of actors such as Charles Bronson, Jack Webb, Eddy Albert and the usual character actors playing the ships crew.  It a little slow in parts and the plot is thin and well used now days but it still a watchable movie.",1409875200,,579,4.198198198198198

2520924,3,B000EHSVX2,Not one of Coopers better movies. It has its lighter side of naive officer trying to make a project work that haqs more downs than ups,1359849600,,134,4.1923076923076925
2520935,3,B000EHSVX2,"Once again, I'm done in by glowing reviews posted here.  I bought this DVD based on their recommendations.  I should start paying more attention to the negative reviews.
The first rule of comedy....it has to be funny, or, at the very least, amusing.  This was anything but humorous.  This was just a run-of-the-mill pseudo-war movie about supposed hijinks on the high seas.  At its core, it's a lackluster tale of incompetence on every level, as a crew of neophytes struggle to make a steam engine work on a ship.  How anyone thought that had comedy written all over it is beyond me.  I blame the writer on this (the director, Henry Hathaway, has also done better work).  As for the cast, Jack Webb stood out as a sarcastic engineering officer with no training.  Eddie Albert was also enjoyable as a good natured, overly optimistic Lieutenant who looked at everything with unwarranted glee.  It was also great to see Ray Collins (Rear Admiral L.E. Tennant) in something other than Perry Mason.  I don't fault any of the actors here.  This was a story with nowhere to go, utilizing pieces seen in many other films (and a lot better).  I not only didn't laugh, I couldn't even raise a smile as I watched this film.  It was just so ordinary, watchable, but nothing spectacular.  It was nothing I'd ever want to see again, so it wasn't a keeper.",1313280000,2,1341,4.622881355932203
2520936,4,B000EHSVX2,"It's not rolling-on-the-floor funny - but I got some smiles out of it.  To me, it's worth its cost to see the young versions of Jack Webb, Charles Bronson, and Lee Marvin (to name a few).  Also Harry von Zell, from The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.  Anyone remember old Harry?
It's not the star of my WWII movie collection, but I watch it every year or two.  Worth having.",1310083200,,378,4.28169014084507

2520938,4,B000EHSVX2,"I actually saw this at a drive-in movie with my family when I was a child. As I grew into a film aficianado (and an adult) I would remember films I had seen as a child and look to buy them so I could relive the enjoyment they had given me as a child. Unfortunately, I was disappointed many times when watching those movies that had impressed me as a child. This is not one of those movies. I mean we're not talking Academy Awards here but this was a very amusing movie. I've always thought that Gary Cooper was a great comedic actor and he came through here. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to laugh a little and just enjoy a good story.",1251936000,,652,4.141732283464567
2520939,2,B000EHSVX2,I own and enjoy several old comedies based on a similar theme. This one does not measure up. Get Operation Petticoat instead.,1244419200,,125,4.7272727272727275
2520940,3,B000EHSVX2,"Gary Cooper and the rest of the cast do a great job with a less than perfect script, but the film is fun to watch and worth the time.  More for laughs than action",1239580800,,162,3.764705882352941
2520941,5,B000EHSVX2,This is a very entertaining movie and definately not to be used as a real reference for the Navy.  Gary Cooper and Eddie Albert bring laughter back into the military with this old favorite.  Gary Cooper feels he has been let down being given a small vessel but he sure gives it all he has got to get the vessel tested for the Navy.,1216857600,,331,4.15625
