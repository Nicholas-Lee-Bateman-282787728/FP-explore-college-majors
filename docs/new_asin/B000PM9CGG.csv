When they started with the M10000 in the 1930s, among the first people who saw it was President Franklin Roosevelt. According to the narrator, FDR was impressed with the train's design. This is probably the first train DVD where among the railfans would be the president of the United States!",1486166400,,370,4.888888888888889
