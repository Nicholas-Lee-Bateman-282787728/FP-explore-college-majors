8514206,5,B007C3TVCQ,"So, I read other reviews on here, and I guess to most people this movie was a let down. To me, though, low budget movies are fun to watch, pick on, and just have my brother, myself, and his fiance' to have our own little MST 2000. Charles Band has produced, directed, and written better films, but still I look to what kind of production company Full Moon is. I expect the cheesy, funny actors, the low budget quality, the whole shot. I don't watch these movies because they are Hollywood blockbusters, I watch them because of what I just mentioned. The fact that Charles Band grabbed his grapes and went outside of the Hollywood jargon and has made movies the way he wanted to, and loves what he does, what better example could one give about the American dream? I always give five stars to movies from Full Moon, or anything relating to Charles Band, though. Just my personal view.",1449014400,,883,4.490683229813665
8514207,1,B007C3TVCQ,"Had my review of this ""product"" existed, I never would have bought it. I am a huge fan of every Full Moon Feature, but this is just repackaged, HEAVILY-edited nonsense. Presented as a compilation film about evil living dolls, what it actually is is three chopped-beyond-recognition horror movies. The first, thinly veiled as ""Doll Cemetery"" is a thirty minute version of the otherwise excellent Doll Graveyard. The short version presented here makes no sense as more than forty minutes is blindly cut away. Next was a heavily cut-down film I did not recognize as having seen before so I sat through it. Finally a thirty minute version of Demonic Toys began. No thanks, I'd rather just watch the original film not cut down into worthless chunks of celluloid sadness.
This DVD is for literally NO ONE. There is no reason for any human being to ever buy or watch this. Watch the originals, or for that matter any Full Moon Feature, heck, any horror, exploitation, or let's be honest, any film ever made is less of a waste of time than the nicely packaged DevilDolls.",1416960000,3,1063,4.751351351351351
8514208,1,B007C3TVCQ,"This company has been churning out the same evil dolls, puppets and other dead thingys for decades. Using mass production with the same script, props and settings over and over and over. On IMDB check out Full Moon Entertainment (US) or better still producer Charles Band for the full list. Devil Dolls is so cheap it didn't even have a menu other than Play and Previews to see more of the studio's movies. The usual wannabe actors (sorry whomever you were, but true) making dumb decisions; same jocks and party girls house sitting and drinking; same cell phones not working; same no one thinks to walk out the door or totally annihilate the killer dolls. The horror, as usual, consists of a a few splashes of fake colored corn syrup blood and a couple of fake stab-effects prosthetics. Puppets scenes are just a few minutes long and are mostly someone (not in view of the camera) holding the puppet and shaking it a little with the added horror bonus that the puppet sometimes blinks it's eyes. No subtitles and poor audio, but wouldn't make any difference if present.",1334188800,5,1069,4.691489361702128
