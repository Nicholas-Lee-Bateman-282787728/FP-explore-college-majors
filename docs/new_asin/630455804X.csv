899361,2,630455804X,"I recently rented this movie under the assumption (based on what I heard about it) that it was pretty good.  Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to the hype that preceded it.  Basically, the movie's plot is this: the protagonist, Ai, is a young woman who engages in a series of S&M encounters with the upper class that aren't particularly memorable.  Near the end of the movie, she deliriously searches for a guy she met long ago.  The movie isn't clear about the significance of this man, meaning that he could have been anything ranging from a former boyfriend to a past client.  Really, there isn't much to this movie other than the S&M, which is mediocre compared to other films.
However, before I render final judgment, I would like to see either the DVD or VHS version that is dubbed in English.  As a fan of foreign films, I know that when I movie is subtitled, only the essential dialogue is included and oftentimes leave out all of the nuances that make the movie special.  In this case, my review may be premature, and I might have to reassess it after viewing the English version of it.  As it stands, I can only give it two stars, and that's for the beautiful women that were cast in the movie.",1005436800,3,1211,4.472727272727273
899362,3,630455804X,"The film could take place anywhere. While it is Japanese, nearly all the action is inside exchangeable hotel rooms, corridors, malls that could be in any country around the globe. Is this where society is going? Watch the film in your local repertory cinema first to see whether this is for you.
The DVD production is not the best. While the DVD is not region-coded (which is good since you can't get in Europe), it is not the rated version that Amazon claims it is but an unrated one that is missing four minutes. You can't switch of the subtitles, which is very annoying, especially since there is an English dubbed track on the DVD - which doesn't match the subtitles.

899363,5,630455804X,"Anyone who has read even a few chapters of the novels of Murakami Ryu (ALMOST TRANSPARENT BLUE, COIN LOCKER BABIES) knows he can write about sex and decadence in ways that are both compelling and revolting; he seems simultaneously fascinated by and disgusted with the body and its states, and obsessed with degrading and dehumanizing sex, as well as drug use. This film, following an outcall prostitute from client to client, unflinchingly looking at the abuse to which she is subject to, is very much in line with these concerns, and is beautiful, ugly, and by the end, vaguely hysterical, even surreal. It's fascinating to watch and disturbing at the same time. Note, however, that while it does get pretty graphic in depicting some of this kinkiness, Murakami is not interested at all in titillation, and it's REALLY hard to imagine anyone getting turned on by this movie. Which is not to say voyeurs won't enjoy it -- but voyeurs of the more refined variety, please! People with delicate sensibilities should prob'ly stay away, too...",972086400,19,1038,4.937142857142857
899364,5,630455804X,"On the surface, Tokyo Decadence is a film about S&M, prostitution, drug use, and the odd nature of some people in general.  Ai, the lead  character, played by actress Miho Nikaido, is a young prostitute trapped in  a life with no future, hopelessly devoid of spirit or direction.  She  wanders through her life only moment to moment, realizing little about  herself, having only an intuitive sense of her own misery.
Yet  underneath there are other elements at work.  Tokyo Decadence is aptly  titled for it is more about the decadence of material wealth, which Tokyo  represents to many Japanese, and the abusiveness and emptiness such  decadence evokes.  Ai is a victim of those elements, and her lost  innocence, emptiness and directionless wandering are the elements of modern  Japanese tragedy.
Tokyo Decadence has been packaged as a titillating sex  film, exploiting the myth of Asian exoticism, especially since the actors  are not always acting.  But the film is not a documentary and the  characters are not typical of the Japanese sex trade, though Nikaido is  excellent in her portrayal of an S&M call girl.  Underneath the story  is a broader theme that is rather familiar to modern Japanese literature  and cinema; the surface elements, such as S&M, are vehicles to a larger  theme concerning the absence of a soul or inner spirit in contemporary  Japanese society.  Hence, if you are not turned on by the erotic subject  matter, perhaps you were not intended to be.
The thematic elements of  Tokyo Decadence have been recurring in Japanese literature and cinema over  the last century.  From the beginning of Japan's rise to modern power over  a hundred years ago, up through the present, there has been a popular theme  among writers and filmmakers that Japan's soul has become empty or lost in  Japan's quest to become modern, powerful, and imitative of the West.  Tokyo  Decadence is, I believe, another installment in that theme.
Having lived  and worked in Japan, I understand the elements that Tokyo Decadence  presents: feelings of a spiritless wanderer, life lost in anonymity, and of  the desire for anything peculiar or unorthodox just to interrupt the cold  momentum of daily life.  But there is perhaps another theme in the film.  It is interesting, in a society as safe and seemingly drug-free as Japan,  that sex and violence are so popular among the video renting public; themes  such as bondage, S&M and even rape are not unusual for men's magazines;  and alcohol abuse, gambling and the sex trade are somewhat commonplace with  ordinary Japanese businessmen.  Maybe this is not strange to some  Americans, but such things are seldom discussed openly in Japan, and Tokyo  Decadence just may be a discussion of such things.
On a critical note,  the film's final sequences tend to be rather confusing or irrelevant to  many viewers, especially to those wanting to see a sex picture.  Despite  the problems, I still defend the final scenes because they express how  absolutely pathetic and lost the main character really is, not for some  trite reasons of morality, but because she is ultimately void of any sense  of self-worth.  My only real criticism has to do with the DVD itself, which  is a poor transfer of the original film image, though this has nothing to  do with the film's story and shouldn't discourage interested viewers.",965952000,28,3363,4.9585585585585585

899490,4,630455804X,"Tokyo Decadence (Ryu Murakami, 1992)

That author and filmmaker Ryu Murakami is not a household name in the west yet is a crime. Murakami, after all, wrote the novel on which Takashi Miike's classic Audition is based, as well as cult hits Sixty-Nine, Coin Locker Babies, and In the Miso Soup, plus directing the wonderful 2000 film Kyoko (released in America under the title Dance with Me). But even Americans who are unaware of the brilliance of Murakami have a reason to check this one out; Iron Chef fans will be thrilled to catch frequent guest Tenmei Kanoh in one of his rare film roles. Murakami was not nearly as accomplished a filmmaker at the time he made this as he was when he helmed Kyoko, but he's always been a fantastic novelist (he's been at it for more than forty years now), and all of the movies he's directed over the years have been based on his own novels, which are all wonderfully filmable; you do the math.

This one concerns Ai (Miho Nikaido, who has shown up in the west in No Such Thing and Henry Fool), a submissive escort who has broken the one rule of being an escort: never fall in love with a client. The client (Kanoh), however, is getting married (though his soon-to-be wife is into all this as well). When the client runs afoul of the yakuza, Ai starts questioning whether he truly is who she thought he was, and by extension whether she really is who she thinks she is.

You know, the Japanese really know how to do everything up right, and that includes the erotic drama. The watered-down, silly softcore crap we get on Cinemax is nothing compared to this dark, deep, character-driven tale that's still erotic enough that in order to get it released in Italy, distributors had to cut over forty minutes from the original print (and more to the point, to this day the film remains banned in Australia). Needless to say, it's NC-17 in America, and that's with the Japanese aversion to showing pubic hair. That's pretty darned impressive for a movie that contains no fully-exposed (i.e., porn) sex scenes. The one place the film suffers is pace, and I think that may have to do with the cuts that were made to get it the NC-17 rating in America; a full director's cut of the film (which clocks in at over two hours) may well be as good as Kyoko; hopefully one day I'll get a chance to find out. Until then, the cut we get in America can be looked at as a diamond in the rough; well worth checking out, but those unfamiliar with Murakami altogether, or who only know of him through Kyoko, may be surprised at both the darkness and the explicitness here. Still worth your time. *** ",1248739200,2,2615,4.475890985324948
899491,4,630455804X,"Written and directed by Ryu Murakami, who also wrote Takashi Miike's ""Audition"", ""TOKYO DECADENCE"" (aka. ""Topaz"", 1992) is a blistering social commentary about Japanese society. Looking at the Dvd cover, one might just see a truly erotic film but if you look beyond the image of Miho Nikaido in the cover, you will see something beyond Japan's ""pink"" cinema. This image is sexy, voyeuristic and iconic, and portrays the Asian dominatrix in the cold, pretentious world of the business world. Murakami is a critically acclaimed author responsible for ""Almost Transparent Blue"" and ""In the Miso Soup"". If you think this film is just your usual exploitive Japanese pink film, then you have another think coming...

Ai (Miho Nikaido) is a timid Japanese college girl who tries to make ends meet as an S & M girl for hire within a club that caters very wealthy businessmen and lavish hotel rooms. We follow Ai through her exploits as she encounters some odd and bizarre customers; there's a shady yakuza/businessman, one drugged up guy who likes being choked, an older guy with a fetish for necrophilia, a girl named Saki who punishes her subservient client called ""Turtle face"" by making him drink Ai`s urine. All these events are the basic premise, Ai buys a topaz ring as advised by a fortune teller and she gets messed up by a drug given by Saki as she tries to find the man she had an affair with.

Murakami's ""Tokyo Decadence"" is a film with a scathing critical commentary of Japanese society. His compositions have a heavy reliance on symbolism and metaphors. This film was made after Japan's skyrocketing economic bloom between the late 1980's and the early 90's--during a social and economic crisis. Murakami's storytelling is good, but it will alienate a lot of viewers. His reliance to symbolism isn't exactly easy to grasp. Suffice it to say, Murakami is criticizing his native people for the reluctance to question authority, the Japanese people's transient goals and its standardized society. Of course, to get immediate attention, Murakami uses sex as his backdrop, disguising sex and violence as a tool to express his more idealistic goals.

Now there is a good number of kinky scenes and nudity, but if you are expecting a film that is exploitive and totally revolves around its sex scenes then you will be disappointed. Yes, there is girl-on-girl action and the film does have its share of the titillation elements--some are even a bit violent but if you focused on these factors, you will miss exactly what the film is trying to say. As I've mentioned, the film relies heavily on symbolism and metaphors. The topaz ring is a symbol for beauty but it is also meant to dispel sadness, anger and depression. The pill represents Ai's reliance on other people (embodied by Saki) so she can find the courage to find closure in her life; the opposite happens as Ai becomes so drugged out and confused, barely able to stand up. A strong commentary on self reliance is expressed by Murakami.

The film's structure also has its weaknesses, and our main character lacks some development. All we know is that Ai had an affair with a married man, and her lifestyle choice is a little baffling for the inexperienced viewer or to one unfamiliar with the film's style. I suppose Murakami meant Ai to remain an enigma, much as any girl we see one day walking by and not see the next day. I guess it was a means to express the indifference to one another between citizens in modern Japan. Is Ai a little unstable? Who is she? Well, no one does really know anything about the other person they see in the sidewalk do they? Ai is meant more as a symbol of the common Japanese folk, than as an individual character in the film. The writer/director does get his point across so long as you look beyond the nudity and sex.

Ai played by Miho Nikaido is quite enigmatic. She is a woman who looks so simple and never really that sultry until she dons that dominatrix outfit. You might say that Nikaido is a woman with secrets and although she looks very timid and shy, there is more to her than meets the eye. Ai is a woman torn by loneliness and self-loathing, which may have contributed to her choice of lifestyle. If you look into her eyes, this is a woman with a great upbringing, and make one a very good wife. Murakami expresses the unnamed victims of an economic downturn, a time where only the elite may prosper--who indulge themselves relentlessly in Japan's riches.

The director was obviously looking at the dark corners of his native land and I do think he partly succeeds. The film is NOT for everyone and aimed for the esoteric few familiar with this slow-moving metaphorically rich style. This film is a cult classic because of its seriousness, and delivers all its exploitive elements with a straight face. Its scenes of S&M are explicit and kinky, but those scenes aren't really arousing and more disturbing. It's a little too vulgar for the thinking ""art house"" audience and a little too mellow for those looking for truly graphic sex scenes. I guess you have to be in the right mood for this film and expect an offbeat experience--that is both bizarre and weird, worthy of guilty pleasure.

Recommended! [3  Stars]
Note: There is a rumor circulating that the director's cut is over 2 hours long but this version is only circulating in Asia. The dvd says uncut and looks better than an R-rating.
The video is in enhanced anamorphic format but kept quite simple, lacks in contrast and some colors look rather murky. I think this was an intentional trick of the cinematography. The 2.0 Dolby surround Japanese Language track is clear and the English subtitles are good.

But.... rent rather than buy if you can, this is a BAD transfer, the worst video quality I have ever seen on any DVD.  I tried it with two players, with identical results, and I had to try another known-good DVD to make sure my equipment had not gone on the blink.  I am not sure how they could have got it so wrong -- either it is a transfer from bad tape, or a bad job of conversion from PAL format.  It looks like the interlacing is backwards.  I am not sure if previous DVD and VHS editions are as bad as this current one.

This edition is the original uncut version and the overrall film benefits from the roughly 20 minutes of extra footage.  As previously stated the digital transfer is good, however, the colors, I felt were quiet drab and less vibrant than my VHS edition released by Image Entertainment.  The special features added to this version are indeed ""special"" in that many of the actresses in the trailer go unnamed. For example, Kusama Yayoi, the famous deranged artist who plays the fortune teller at the beginning of the film, and the dominatrix character who smokes crack both are left unnamed/translated. The ""interview"" is not an interview persay, it's rather an opening night celebration for the film with dancing, and Murakami saying a few (the emphasis here is few) words. Given the re-issuing of many subversive Japanese films to DVD in the past few years, an actual interview with the director would have benefited this release greatly, something that many companies have included with their releases.",1222646400,3,1208,5.090909090909091
899599,4,630455804X,"A good movie overall. There's two storyline essentially: one is about this young educated girl lost in the world of S&M prostitution in the heart of Tokyo. The other story is derivative or symbolic: the time when the Tokyo Bubble burst and the economic slump affected most of Japan's working society and turned their world upside down. Both the heroine as well as the people of Japan wants to redeem themselves, but the mindset of the majority prevents this from happening. The performances was good. Photography was excellent. Ryuichi Sakamoto provided a tailored score for the film. Director Murakami was in his top form when he did this. The Cinema Epoch edition of this DVD is the best so far compared to previous editions like Image or Triboro which butchered (shortened) this film into 90 or so minutes. The Epoch edition is the uncut version which is 112 minutes. Forget about the mythical 135 minutes version as IMDB has touted, for that one doesn't really exist. The transfer was good although there was a slight saturation of colors: you'll notice this in the red lips of the heroine smeared on your monitor.
