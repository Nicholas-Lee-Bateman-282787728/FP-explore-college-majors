8332060,4,B001P4Q4NM,"Mysteries do not need the detailed ""blood and guts"" that we get from so many authors these days. Gail Bowen's writing style lets you be part of the scene . Well written, as are all of her books. If you want more than just pulp fiction, read her series.",1250899200,4,252,4.163265306122449
