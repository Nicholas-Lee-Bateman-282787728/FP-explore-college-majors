8393325,3,B003AZC0DC,"First off, this movie is not a comedy. It is a documentary. So if you're looking at the DVD cover and thinking it's going to be primarily comedy, you'll be disappointed. While much of the material is indeed funny, it's unintentionally so, and I'm sure many will find it more tedious and ridiculous than entertaining. There are moments of genuine insight for the parties involved, and moments of real humour, but overall I felt that the majority of the movie was just plain weird and boring.
If you're the kind of person that finds humour in people that think, look and act differently from the norm, then this documentary might have some entertainment value for you. I was left feeling pretty indifferent to the people involved, and somewhat disappointed that we saw a pretty shallow view of each of the individuals featured in this festival of new-age behaviour.
All in all, a pretty mediocre film, hence the 3 stars.",1326585600,4,918,4.779874213836478
