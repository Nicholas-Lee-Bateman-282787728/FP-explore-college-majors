3616916,5,B001GN3ZJI,"The lesbian scene between stewardesses Jo and Kathy was incredibly hot, and the high-point of this film, which I think has aged incredibly well four decades after its initial release!

Modern-day girl/girl scenes could learn a lot from watching this one!  Instead of simply showing two women going at it for no reason, this one includes an actual seduction, with lesbian Jo actually seducing her tipsy, beautiful, non-lesbian friend!  It was an incredibly hot girl/girl encounter!  Highly recommended!",1242172800,4,501,5.384615384615385
3616917,2,B001GN3ZJI,"I had a girlfriend that booked movies in San Francisco, and I got to see this movie when it first came out. The 3D was amazing for 1969!! However, when I got the movie - with the red and blue glasses - one of the early scenes where legs go flying past your head was just not the same. The original movie used Polaroid glasses, like Disneylands Michael Jackson movie. So the 3D is just so so, and the plot is fair. Lots of female nudity, so not for the young ones.",1235952000,11,463,4.043478260869565
3616918,4,B001GN3ZJI,"Wasn't around when this came out but glad I am here to see the new release. This was honestly a horrible film but being that most of the scenes were ad-libbed was honestly funny. Verry funny indeed. It just works. The 3-d in anagliph doesn't work very well but for depth-of-field works. Out of screen effects don't really work but are noticed. Still, for a bad movie, this one is just a ride at the funpark you have to take. Bad but good in every sense.",1233878400,6,453,4.27906976744186
3616919,4,B001GN3ZJI,"I thought that the 3-D worked quite well, given the limits of DVD.  The disc provides three different versions of the film: color 3-D, black-and-white 3-D, and a really good color print in 2-D.  There are also interviews with cast and crew members, and a nice documentary about 3-D that even provides a 3-D trailer preview of THE MAZE!

The film itself is a typical softcore flick from the late 1960s.  Some of the actresses include Christina Hart (who is interviewed in the accompanying featurette), cult fave Monica Gayle, and Nancy ""CINDY AND DONNA"" Ison.  THE STEWARDESSES was perhaps the first American film of its kind that played mainstream theaters.  Because of that, I consider it to be the first film in the ""porno chic"" movement, although many film historians award that distinction to DEEP THROAT (1972).",1233792000,29,816,4.91970802919708
3616920,4,B001GN3ZJI,"I bought this because I saw the original MANY years ago. Nostalgia! Truly a ""soft porn"" movie. The trip was good but the 3D was weak. At the price thogh, I'd buy again.",1233532800,7,168,4.121212121212121
3616921,4,B001GN3ZJI,"It was the first movie shot in side by side stereovision & the first independent movie to cross the $30Mil mark. It has a number of attractive actresses in an equal number of simulated sex scenes, a rather sick plot ....not to mention some incredibly sloppy camerawork and cheesy audio..but fhe film was intended to be a turn on & it was in 1970 & to a certain extent still is to this day....the restoration is bright & mostly colorful and with all of that I give it 4 stars for what it is. The. not quite sexually explicit 3D short with it was filmed with the same process & looks better & originally played with the hardcore 3D film The Starlets. In the day..both were x-rated.",1492905600,6,679,4.354330708661418

3616923,5,B001GN3ZJI,"Got to see this at the cinema back when, the 3d projection was poor but my goodness how perfect this is now and on 3D Blu-Ray.

I remember seeing the film poster back the and it looked a little saucy a bit like a Carry on flick so ventured into the flicks to see it at 1.75 I seem to remember. Its a fun film made for the 3D side of things and unique really as its longer than the version I got to see all those years ago.

If you are into 3D history very much worth adding to your collection and fairly innocent stuff.

Also included is Experiments in Love 1977 3D.  Much saucier so wear a disguise when you watch it and the 3D effect is very good indeed WOW!

A great 3D title to have in your collection.

Any more please KINO?",1492646400,,729,3.958904109589041

3616926,3,B001GN3ZJI,"Not  rating it high for the movie itself.  The actual movie is very slow and not much of a plot.  If it was just the movie, I'd give it 2 stars.  The 3D though is very well done.  Not a movie I'd recommend to a lot of people but those that don't mind some, what I would consider R rated nudity, and of course has to like 3D.  The bonus feature which is 30 minutes long is funny, has some enjoyable nudity and really plays up the 3D aspects.  That feature was more fun to watch.  I'd recommend spending a few bucks and get this just to watch that bonus feature.",1491696000,2,560,3.981981981981982
3616927,3,B001GN3ZJI,"Bought this as a novelty since the price was right and have to agree with others - the main feature can seem sexy/quaint now, but the short makes this a disc to own.  Thanks for the restoration and allowing us to see something that might have been lost, even if it's not the greatest.  Just be sure to check out the extras!",1489536000,5,323,4.193548387096774
3616928,4,B001GN3ZJI,"Not really a 4-star movie, but the Blu-ray 3D edition is pretty cool.  It includes a lengthy 'short film' in 3D that is also on the soft-core wavelength as as The Stewardesses.  Both films on this disc look GREAT in 3D, but I can't imagine wanting to watch either one in 2D...the 3D is the only reason I grabbed this.  I didn't notice much eyestrain, so they must have done a good job of right/left alignment.  Made for a very groovy retro Saturday night.  Glad I own it and I don't even pitch for the team this is aimed at ;)",1489104000,3,526,4.1683168316831685
3616929,5,B001GN3ZJI,"This isn't the best movie. But it was a good 3d experience. The bonus film is very good though.  This is worth owning because the 3d is so good.  The movie was a big hit at the time and it's not risque by todays standards. At the time , it was trying to be, but that was the age of censorship.  3d collectors must have this one for sure. Trashy film collectors should get this one too.  The picture looks good too.  Buy it!  Support 3d releases!.",1488672000,12,446,4.068965517241379
3616930,3,B001GN3ZJI,"3 stars because that's striking a balance between the movie itself which deserves less than 1 star (it's really BAD), and the 30-minute ""Experiments in Love 3D"", which is just a bonus short feature but is AWESOME and well-worth 5 stars on its own.  For fans of 3D who also like erotica and have a sense of humor, this is a gem!",1488240000,2,327,4.274193548387097
3616931,4,B001GN3ZJI,"Just a fun film throwback to the late 60's/early 70's when adult entertainment was in full swing.  A well mastered disc with nice 3D reproduction.  Disc includes a bonus short from around 1977, also in 3D.",1486771200,,205,4.666666666666667
3616932,3,B001GN3ZJI,"Well despite being a terrible movie but absolutely impressive for the fact that it was made for 100Gs and EARNED 25 MILLION DOLLARS (!!!) making it one of the most, if not the MOST financially successful against budget movies ever made!!!

It is terrible but fun because the 3D is very good, though some of the framing is incredibly lousy. Some impressive Twin Peaks are to be seen liberally throughout.

The accompanying 3D short, ""Experiments In Love"" is better made, with the absolutely inspirational idea of the amply built female scientist and her female assistant wearing nothing but tiny little briefs, sometimes, under their always open lab coats.

All in all though a real throw back to the type of ""soft core"" movies of the late 60s, early 70s and only worth while for the 3D.",1485820800,2,786,4.764705882352941

3616936,2,B001GN3ZJI,"Bought the 3-D Blu-ray due to nostalgia for back when I saw it as a young frisky lad---In hindsight it wasn't really worth the purchase---Even factoring in the charmingly cheesy' 60's vibe going on there's no getting around that this is a really BAD movie (and not in a ""so bad it's good"" sort of way; it's just plain excruciatingly BAD-----Like a  previous  reviewer said I felt the discomfort of the hapless actors which made ME feel uncomfortable watching it)  However I did give it 2 stars for the 3-D which looks pretty good-----the  print the people behind this used is in pretty bad shape  (although the ""grindhouse""-type scratches & damage to the film could be seen as having its charm I suppose) but the 3-D REALLY helps---In any event the DVD caught my attention because of the amusing (even ""fond""?) memory of leaving the theater after seeing  it as a young 'un & spotting my 70-something  GRANDFATHER  in the audience-----we both pretended not to have seen each other & nary a word was ever said about  it----",1483142400,6,1021,4.691011235955056

3616940,5,B001GN3ZJI,"Forget the blurry 3D version and watch the 2D disc, which is well photographed.  Beautiful girls and lots of nudity, and the kind of insubtantial plot you would expect. The last sequence was rather depressing, but I understand that the makers had to put that in to establish ""social relevance"" and keep from having the movie labeled as porn by the standards of the time.",1448064000,2,370,4.6923076923076925

3616946,2,B001GN3ZJI,"The Stewardesses 3-D(1969) is a sexy comedy/drama starring Christina Hart and directed by Alf Silliman Jr. It's packed with sexy women, nudity and 3-D effects. Then again, it has almost no plot or story. The budget for the film was $100,000 and it grossed more than $25 million at the box office. There are several alternate versions of the film. The film is a part of pop culture. It was spoofed on SCTV. The Stewardesses was one of the first movies filmed in Stereophonic 3-D. Many Hollywood 3-D movies were filmed in Anaglyph 3-D. This Shout Factory DVD does deliver in quality. The film claims that it was based on a novel, but that is not true! The film has many filler scenes. People play pool or have fun at a carnival. A stewardess gets high on LSD and tries to make love to a lamp! This film is for adults only. The Stewardesses 3-D is so bad, it's good.",1339372800,5,863,4.4

What I remember most was that the audience was screaming with laughter at this movie. This movie is the perfect talk back to the screen movie. This is a cheesy soft porn skin flick in 3d, and I loved every minute. I just got the dvd yesterday and watched it again for the first time in years, and it has not changed a bit. I remember the scene the audience went wild over. It was right at the beginning when this girl and guy are making love in a motel room, and the girls feet and legs are going back and forth at the screen. Restoration is good. 3D is fair. It works well in somes parts, but not in others. Take this movie for exactly what it is, a look back at the very early stages of what would become the golden age of porn.
