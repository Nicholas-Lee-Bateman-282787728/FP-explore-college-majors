7965579,3,B000069HZG,"I originally saw this years & years ago on a late night TV airing. This film is a stinky mess but that's half the charm. I did not remember the name of the movie and only vaguely recalled the plot (such as it is) but mostly it stuck with me due to the inclusion of ""Hollywood Squares"" veteran celebrity member George Gobel, in a small but memorable role as a professor. This film looks pretty amazing considering it's obscurity and age. As these things go, this one was pretty bad, but fun in a goofy sort of way. 5 STARS for the effort, minus 2 STARS for how poopy the actual film itself is = 3 STARS.

Can't believe I somehow missed this title, as I have most of the great old sci-fi films that have been released as part of the Wade Willliams Collection. The films he's put out have most often been previously available only in faded, damaged & highly compressed (= grainy & pixelated) Public Domain versions that look & sound just awful. It's only through his love of these old classics (and some not so classic) that we are finally able to see them presented in decent shape. I for one am so glad someone out there with the resources to do so has taken the time to give these lesser known 'B' and 'C'-level films the proper care & treatment they truly deserve, even if some of them probably don't deserve it! LOL. As for this turkey,",1419638400,2,1338,4.309523809523809

7965581,2,B000069HZG,for some reason people don't check these discs out.  it was loose in the case and being jostled around.  I found 2 bad scratches.  I am disappointed.,1366156800,,149,4.444444444444445
7965582,3,B000069HZG,"or 2.8 stars. needs more action & more use of this funny, goofy ""done in"" gangster zombie. the box shows more action-(glowing zombie f/x)-in the girl in car scene than it did in the movie-thats sales marketing again for yur $ fer ya. its good george gobel is in the movie. its strange how the meteor & the zombie go off together into unknown oblivian @ the end or will it come back again, if so, for what?",1316563200,,405,4.205128205128205
7965583,5,B000069HZG,"This movie should have won an Oscar!  By far the greatest sci-fi film in the history of mankind.  I must praise the stunning performance by the great Ed Love as the monster.  I do not believe I have ever seen a better disgruntled alien zombie!  If you have not seen this movie, buy it.  Now.  Buy copies for your friends.  Buy copies for decoration.  Buy the poster.  Spend money.
Have you ever seen the musical Cats?  This is better!  It has no Cats, but people scream a lot.  Neato!  The spectacular special features on this DVD should not be missed!  I even sold my kidney to buy an extra copy for my neighbor.  He loved Cats.  He was in Cats.  But he had to quit because he was allergic to the makeup.  I told him, ""this is the movie for YOU.""  And so I sold my kidney and he was so happy.
Be sure to watch the feet in the swimming scene and the car.  What a snazzy car!  This is my favorite movie of all time.  I cry.  Buy it.",1183766400,9,931,4.0220994475138125
7965584,2,B000069HZG,"The Day It Came To Earth has to be seen to be believed.  There are movies that are bad, but fun (such as Killer Klowns)--but this one is so mind-blowingly bad, you will be slack-jawed before it is half over.  The basic plot is that a meteor crashes to earth just after a witness to testify against the mob is bumped off and dumped into a lake.  Said witness is reanimated by the meteor and for some odd reason begins to walk.  After the meteor is discovered by our two heroes and taken to the resident geology professor (George Goebel!) to sort out, the reanimated corpse for yet another odd reason begins trekking all over hell's half-acre to recover it.  The police detective is the typical skeptic who makes this astounding leap in logic and concludes the true nature of the meteor and is able to deduce the classification of the corpse:  geological gaseous goon===his words, not mine!  Perhaps the scene that says it all for this movie is when one of our heroes, Eddie, is making out with this totally hot blonde in his car, and she pants that she is ready for him to take her right here and now...and he decides to go ""to the bathroom"" into the bushes-and then that walking corpse appears and literally catches him pants down.  Don't worry, this isn't giving anything away in the movie.  The sound quality is decent, and the transfer is presentable.  If this movie has any strengths, it is in the squareness of both the male and female lead characters.  Oh, to actually meet someone like them in real life!",1151452800,12,1511,4.518382352941177
7965585,2,B000069HZG,"Universal heart-throb and international mega-star, Wink Roberts headlines this gripping tale of alien vengeance. Gangsters gun down an informant and dump his body in a nearby swamp (the world's cleanest). A meteorite splashes into the same swamp, causing the dead guy to rise from his watery grave, right next to the local college! Sounds like a murder rampage movie, right? Wrong! Although the zombified stooly has opportunities aplenty, he only kills the two rats who offed him. The college kids, hideously annoying as they are, are quite safe. George Goebel plays the college professor w/ near-lifelike precision. Watch for a very young, very cute Rita Wilson as Debbie. And don't forget Wink Roberts, in the days before his inate talents were fully recognised...",1134864000,,766,5.235772357723577
