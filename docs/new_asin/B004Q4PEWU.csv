4444979,5,B004Q4PEWU,"If you are an independent or moderate, consider watching this film. There are plenty of recent films that attack capitalism and the libertarian viewpoint (Moore, Gore, et al). This film does attempt to persuade you to embrace the Reagan/Republican/Libertarian viewpoint. So it could indeed be considered ""propaganda;"" however, maybe it's time for such a film to be presented stating this point of view's case.

I suggest that you, the independent or moderate, watch the progressive films and this film (along with the recent Atlas Shrugged). Then you, the jury, after considering both sides, can make your decision at the election both in 2012.

I give this film an A+ for its presentation and its humor (that not only pokes at Dems but also several Reps.",1306972800,11,755,5.032

My 10 and 12 year old children accompanied their father and I for a fun time seeing this movie! When we came out, our 12 year old son said, with great relief, ""Now I understand what socialism is!"" That alone was worth the price of the tickets! Since then, he has asked, on more than one occasion, ""When is I Want Your Money coming out on DVD?"" This is a greatly amusing movie, with political satire, economics lessons and great spoofs of the characters.

Roll back the Reagan tax he sold out the USA he was a myth brought about by the rich who control this country (secret shadow govt.).
Americans are ... I hate to say it...are stupid.  Some do not learn from the past (1920s 1930s here we come).  Americans are glued to the tv and entertainment celebrities.  We are being brainwashed.  Say goodbye to Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare say goodbye to your rights.

4444985,1,B004Q4PEWU,"I'm sure most people who watch this film already agree with what this film is set out to do. It only takes somebody aware of actual facts to immediately see that this film is a propaganda piece. An exaggerated one sided view which is extremely selective with what it allows in it. Don't expect opposing viewpoints. Don't expect any questioning of what is said.  This film will most likely work well on converting Americans who are easily manipulated, can't catch hypocrisy, and have limited knowledge of how events actually went down over the course of history.  For those who DO have that ability, you will find yourself wanting to scream at your TV and tell these people how things really are. I could sit here and pick apart many things in this film and try to do my best and let people have a better grasp on reality, but why would I?  The facts are already out there.  All they have to do is search with an open mind.  I'm not saying voting democrat is the answer. They have their own issues as well.  I've seen many propaganda films in my time, but this one will get any knowledgeable person really frustrated to know there are people out there eating this stuff up.",1305676800,19,1172,4.47887323943662
4444986,5,B004Q4PEWU,"To let you know a little bit about my worldview...I'm a high school history and while I am a Conservative, I am not a die hard republican.

This movie triumphs the policies of Ronald Reagan and of course takes aim at the socialistic approaches of U.S. Presidents, FDR, Carter & Obama.  But the film also points out the financial mistakes that were also made by republicans and George Bush.

Although I am biased towards the ""Right"", I would say this is a fair argument and would welcome a cleaver rebuttal.  Not a mean-spirited and dishonest production from the likes of Bill Maher or Michael Moore though...I'd really like to have an honest debate on the issues.

Like any documentary, it has a few dry moments, but not many and not any for very long.  It moves at a decent clip, and has several really funny little cartoons throughout the production.  I laughed out loud at some of the jokes and jabs made at not only Obama & Clinton, but also of Bush, Sarah Palin, and Richard Nixon.

If you're not really into the news programs, this movie explains things very clearly and would be excellent for high school students.",1305676800,8,1121,4.597989949748744
4444987,1,B004Q4PEWU,"This movie, like so much put out by the right wing today, is a what is known as a false flag. It tries to change how history really went down to something they find more palatable. If you look at Federal Economic Policy since the time before the Great Depression through today's Great Recession you will see that times of economic growth are triggered by Policies put forth under Democratic Presidents and the bubbles inflate and crash during the times of Republican Presidents.

You should never believe anything that Andrew Breitbart says or releases. He edits away anything that does not support his vision and the vision of his masters, the Koch Brothers. Every one of his gotcha videos has been proven to be not based in what we call reality.",1301443200,22,747,4.702290076335878

4444990,5,B004Q4PEWU,"Highly recommended! This dvd, based on historical facts and truth, will open your eyes, entertain and make you laugh all at the same time, with animated, 3-D figures from America's present and past government, while educating us on America's greatness and sadly, her present declining economy. In a lively format (relative to a serious subject), this covers everything you NEED to know about where we have been and to what depths we are heading. It is pro-Reagan era conservative, but speaks loudly of Truth and the American way and what we as Americans must do to save our country, before it's too late. Highly recommended viewing! Enlightening! A film for all Americans. Easy to understand and funny to boot, ironically. The humor lifts a sad, almost graven subject. Suitable for all ages.",1406246400,2,791,5.0
4444991,5,B004Q4PEWU,"This is  a  well written documentary that summarizes the current state of affairs by use of analogies and animations.  It goes straight to the heart of the problem and makes no apologies as to how our economic affairs have come to this state.  Though the economic and constitutional situation maybe dire today, it discusses solutions to how we can get overcome our problems.  The topic maybe quite heavy, but the treatment is done in somewhat of a light hearted but effective manner, and it does not seek to proselytize but opens questions for people to search the truth out for themselves.  I recommend this documentary.",1404086400,2,621,4.866666666666666
4444992,1,B004Q4PEWU,"Really this is the best the Neo Right Corporate can come up with. Reagan portrayed as if No taxes and no government existed under him then all the sudden a black democrat takes office and Big government and thieving taxes are invented.  This film calls liberals hypocrites for using capitalism yet I see Tea party/Republicans using government to pass laws that prohibit people from making their own choices about having children or who they marry this is the same government that they claim is a problem. The same government they used to pass citizens united which gives Corporations rights like people. The same Goverment they use to start wars. The same government they use to give subsidies from tax payer money to Big Oil. At least Micheal Moore gives the other side a chance to answer. This film is a big bold face lie to America, and just another chance to try to blame one side and one black president. FYI taxes were higher under Reagan and Reagan destroyed small businesses in his terms. I found it funny how Reagan was portrayed as a hero heck they even included Pailin and Arnold as if they are great political figures I felt as if they were suggesting Pailin is or will be Vp or president one day.",1389398400,2,1209,4.597222222222222
4444993,5,B004Q4PEWU,"I'm not terribly politically minded.  I think both parties have merit when it comes to their approach to governing.  But this video really opened my mind and my eyes to the problems of over doing social programs that make people dependent on government.  It perfectly illustrates why socialist programs don't really work in a society that tells us that if we work hard enough, we can achieve anything.  At the same time, it is easy and entertaining to watch.",1387929600,,458,4.7594936708860756
4444994,1,B004Q4PEWU,"Another cheesy documentary, that ignores all the damage that the Republicans have done to the country. Democrats are not without their foibles but to say that this is a socialist country is just stupid. A bunch of failed right wing politicians and media hacks who are still selling redistribution of wealth as the answer to all our prayers. Obama is about as socialist as Goldman Sachs. The redistribution of wealth started with Reagan and became further codified under Bush 1 and 2. 89% of the countries wealth is controlled by the wealthy. The rest of the country is left to live on 11%. The poor are so poor now that they don't even register.

This stupid documentary skips lightly over any real facts and ignores the fact that the wealthy are abandoning the country. Offshoring American jobs, their own money and using the same old ""rising tide"", trickle down politics, flat taxes and a bunch of other phony programs designed to keep people wealthy that have wealth. This ridiculous documentary doesn't even acknowledge the Bush tax cuts being made permanent.

The Post Office is broke? Well perhaps if they hadn't had Congress make them pay their health care and pension programs 75 years into the future, they wouldn't be broke. The documentary also glosses over the financial meltdown, bank bailout and two unfunded wars. All this silly film does is trivialize our real and serious problems. This silly film has shown that guessing about the future doesn't solve the problem.",1384128000,2,1482,4.924

4444998,5,B004Q4PEWU,"This is a brilliant film! It is funny, meaningful, and educational. This is why the extreme Leftists on here have rated it with a 1 star, because they are absolutely afraid of this film and any film that actually tells the truth about American history and politics. The film does a good job blowing holes in the complete lies and propaganda of the Left. For instance, ""The New Deal!"" Success? Or Disaster? Well, it was a diaster because it didn't work and kept the country in a depression for eight long years! Of course, the Liberals will say it was a complete success.

Anyone who trashes Reagan is a person of the extreme far Left. I'm telling this to those people who don't realize that they are actually Communists. That's what you are if you truly believe the crap that Democrats are trying to smear Reagan with. Oh, and you're also an idiot as well! This film could actually help you learn the truth, but, I get it you're so far gone in your delusion you don't want the TRUTH.

For the rest of us, this film is informative and amusing. It could actually help some low information voters understand the philosophies of men like Reagan and losers like Jimmy Carter and Barry Obama. Through interviews and animation we are clearly shown the problems with the Left's love of taking our money and squandering it.

The film doesn't just trash all Democrats like Michael Moore does with Republicans, however. It reviews how President Kennedy lowered taxes across the board and helped the economy and in the animations it even makes some light hearted fun of some of our own Republicans.

Younger people should watch this film because it might help them to understand politics and to clarify what the real differences are between the two major parties. Good film.",1366848000,3,1762,4.692556634304207
4444999,5,B004Q4PEWU,"It's a wonderful documentary that- like ALL documentaries is trying to convince you something. There isn't a single documentary in America that isn't trying to make an argument, or have an agenda.

This one isn't a big secret, it's a conservative documentary that helps to push back the demagoguery of the Democratic party.

4445001,1,B004Q4PEWU,"As an European who traveled the world (and quite a lot around USA), I've seen all kind of things, but blindness of Americans toward their own decline is nothing short of amazing. This movie illustrates it quite profoundly - Obama is the one of rare people who wanted to do something positive for Americans and he is being treated as Satan himself.

This movie is based on distorted facts and outright lies. The only function it serves is to keep the sheep docile.

4445004,2,B004Q4PEWU,"The core argument at the heart of this film, which is that government works best, and freedom for the individual citizen is maximized when government is limited to its role in protecting our rights, instead of sticking its nose into running the economy and sticking its hand into our taxpayer pockets, would've been far made far more effectively, clearly and fairly if it didn't spend so much time on the pro-Reagan and anti-Obama theatrics. The truth is, EVERY administration since the end of World War II, Republican AND Democrat (which right now, is an even 6 and 6), has increased taxes and expanded the size of government, in one way or another, but the film cherry picks facts in order to pretend that Obama is somehow the only President who has ever advocated greater government intervention into our lives. It doesn't mention that Republicans do this too, as it tends to focus its ire on ECONOMIC intervention (stereotypically the domain of liberals and Democrats), but ignores PERSONAL incursions into people's bedrooms and other personal habits, which is has been a problem for the Republicans, in particular the right wing. It gives some lip service to the fact that George W. Bush (the caricature of which is oddly depicted in a green suit, for some reason) departed from economic conservatives, but for the most part, it tries to paint Reagan as a saint and Obama as a misguided would-be dictator. It even tries to credit the dot com boom and 1990s prosperity to *Reagan*, while denying Clinton any credit for balancing the budget or producing a surplus, or anything aside from being a philanderer. The animated sequences are cute, but too much time is given to them, bringing the film closer to the realm of parody than polemical. The film could've benefited from a more even-handed approach that was driven by consistent adherence to small-government principles (what John Stossel, one of the interview subjects, practices on his show) instead of the typical partisan hypocrisy and pro-Reagan hagiography.",1355443200,5,2020,5.0148809523809526
4445005,1,B004Q4PEWU,"Anyone who is familiar with the corporate tea party, will see this dvd immediately for what it is....a corporate propaganda film to make simple-minded people think that small government and low taxes for the rich will benefit the every man. They like to throw around the words socialism and communism to distract you, while they push for crony capitalism behind your back. What these corporate front men really want is to put an end to social security and medicare, repeal all legislation that protects people or the environment, and big tax breaks for corporations and the very very rich.  In short, they want our country to revert to how it was in the late 1800s and early 1900s when they could loot and pillage at will without any regard to labor, health, or environmental laws.  The same corporations fronting these messages are the ones screwing the country through the backdoor.  Free trade was another corporate invention, and we can all see the results of allowing corporations to go overseas for cheap poor labor and to avoid our health and environmental standards. Clinton deregulated the corporate banks just like they wanted, and look how that turned out.  You want an economic boom in this country?...It's time to legislate the nuts off these corporations, and abolish free trade while we're at it. We buy the products and services and we should be deciding every single detail of how these corporations operate and provide those products and services.  If it ain't made here in the US by our citizens, to our standards, and in compliance with our laws, then it doesn't get sold here.  The constitution reads ""We the people""....NOT ""We the corporations"".  Anybody notice all the reply comments when anyone leaves a negative review for a corporate propaganda piece like this?....Its funny how they leave so many reply comments isn't it?  It's almost as if these people are getting paid to leave positive reviews and harass anyone leaving negative ones, isn't it?

But from watching the clips that I saw on YouTube, and from seeing how people are either rating it 5 stars, or 1 star, I can tell it must make conservatives ecstatic and liberals really upset. I just wish we could finally have a conversation about ideas without such partisan delirium, where people freak out and try to shout down the other side's point of view.

This movie looks entertaining, and it's not ""propaganda"" as some have said in other reviews, because all this movie does is present a view of the world according to the writers, directors, producers, etc. and I happen to agree with a lot of the ideas presented in this film. Maybe I'm uneducated about some of the issues, maybe I'll change my mind some day, but every American has some flaws in their logic and point of view (yes, even the policy makers and experts). Sometimes the policy makers and experts have the most flaws in their views, because they are inflexible and ideological.

It's time for people to open their minds, and more than that, OPEN THEIR HEARTS to other's experiences of the world and beliefs and have an open discussion. And the government definitely needs less power, because all the partisan fury exists in America right now because it's a struggle for such an epic amount of power in Washington. Remove the power (through voting and legislation) and you remove the partisan struggle to a large extent. Liberals would hate that freedom, conservatives and libertarians would love it.

4445020,1,B004Q4PEWU,"I just want to say how utterly disgusted I am with this documentary. Like others have commented before, it is very one-sided and there is a lot of mud-slinging going on. The one story that ""Reagan"" tells called the forgotten man is ridiculous. The gist of it is the faithful small business owner who has always paid his taxes is run out of business from paying taxes because the government takes that money to help students like ""George"" go to college. I don't have to use a time machine to know that in the past it was once affordable to go to college or if you couldn't afford it there were other routes (such as getting a job straight out of high school) that you could take and be alright. That is FAR from the truth now. A college education is not only necessary but at times demanded in the workforce and the paradox is HARDLY ANYONE CAN AFFORD IT. I am an american citizen and I have a RIGHT to an education. If it was not for the pell grant and student loans that I receive from the government, I would not be able to go to college. If it wasn't for the so called ""useless taxes"" that right wingers proclaim, I would not have a chance at a better life and neither would my children or grandchildren.",1309219200,9,1207,4.275109170305677
4445021,1,B004Q4PEWU,"Basically, the idea of this documentary is this: higher taxes = worse economy, lower taxes = better economy.  Oh, also, higher taxes = socialism.  The world economy is no way effects ours.  Environmental issues in no way affect our economy.  Oh, and don't forget, the president, not congress, is the only one who has anything to do with passing bills (congress does not even read the bills, apparently).  So that means that the president is the only one to blame.  So it's all Obama's fault that our economy is bad.

The sad thing is that he may very well be.  I am not well enough informed to know how politics and the economy work.  That is actually why I watched this documentary. Sadly, because of the film's EXTREMELY one-sided point of view (carefully selected clips from some of Obama's speeches do not constitute a real counterpoint to the unending string of conservative interviewees), which leaves too many unanswered questions, I was unable to take its message seriously.  Also, I did find it a little frustrating that one of the arguments was that liberal spending is not the Christian thing to do (at another point it says that it is immoral).",1309046400,10,1156,4.735

And too many more have no idea where we are headed. This movie is both educational and informative to all.",1308873600,5,274,4.188679245283019
4445023,5,B004Q4PEWU,"I watched this documentary thinking it would be a one-sided argument and was pleased to see it was NOT. Both parties are blamed and what was truly refreshing is that the subject matter remained focused on the topic at hand.

What I found most important is that the blame game takes a back seat to the factual evidence presented here. After this I watched FOOD INC. and was equally impressed. I am buying both of these documentaries after watching them on NetFlix.

4445026,3,B004Q4PEWU,its almost ridiculous how reagan is demi-god to these folks.he gave reagan credit for almost all economic growth up till the second bush. its completely adversarial. it oversimplified the democratic argument and found no flaw in republican philosophy. he attributed the stimulus bill to obama but none to bush. and didn't reagan practice and perfect deficit spending. im all for resetting and cleaning up gov and its spending but as i have always said it needs balance taxes have been reduced over the history of america and yet we still haven't reached the state of economic nirvana the cons say will happen.reagan raised and cut taxes at appropriate times. end of story,1307836800,,671,5.0

Folks who buy this thinking Andrew Breitbart is a main player will either be disappointed he isn't or not check it out if they aren't a fan.  While this movie is now a general election cycle behind in 2016 most , if not all , of the points it makes are still gold.  I really love that the instructional element of this program is done with not with truth and reason but with a delicious sense of humor.  I recommend this to families who want to show their children in a very calm way the differences between Free Market Capitalism and Socialism.  The film maker smartly even finds a classic snippet of Milton Friedman (the greatest of all Freedom and Capitalism proponents).
This is certainly a fun and excellent movie and antidote to the left wing media and Marxist and Alinsky loving professors.",1484265600,,869,4.509554140127388
