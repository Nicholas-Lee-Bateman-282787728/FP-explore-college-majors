7600209,3,B01AH3QRGK,"""Lost In The White City tells the story of an emotionally charged love triangle set in the hot political climate of modern Tel Aviv.""

If that's a way to say its a movie about obsession, voyeurism, and lack of consent then sure alright. This movie wasn't awful, but it wasn't good. It made me uncomfortable and I'm not usually the type. I loved Bob Morley's performance and Thomas Dekker did a pretty decent job of freaking me out. There was little to no conclusion, no explanation, nothing to justify the fact that he was just generally creepy (besides art- because art is always the answer for inappropriate topics). I wasn't sure if the creepiness was the point, but the movie neither condoned nor disapproved of his actions because there was no development, no conclusion. No one reacted to it either, not even the man who was the victim of said voyeurism. It ended on a cliff hanger that would never be answered. I'm tired of people saying things like this are master pieces when in reality they condone and allow inappropriate topics without actually stating a point to it all or a reaction or an explanation, beyond justifying it with his video (which still made no sense). Instead they dress it up as some sexual exploration and emotionally charged romance or whatever, now that's what makes this movie disturbing.",1461542400,,1322,4.77292576419214

The movie follows Kyle (Thomas Dekker), an aspiring filmmaker, and his maybe-girlfriend, Eva (Haley Bennett), an aspiring poet, when they travel to Tel Aviv during a rocky period in their relationship. They soon meet Avi (Bob Morley), an unemployed former Israeli soldier, and conflict ensues.

The movie is the equivalent of a literary novel. Its a slow-moving character study, and most of the conflict is sexual tension. Eva is unhappy with the status of her relationship with Kyle and briefly pursues an intellectual relationship with a local writer. She struggles, perhaps because of the tumultuous state of her relationship with Kyle, to write what she considers good poetry. Kyle, although trying clumsily to make it work with Eva, is apparently bisexual and strongly attracted to Avi immediately after meeting him at a party. Avi is straight but casual in his sexual encounters, particularly when high or drunk, and he has no qualms about kissing Kyle as a joke while tripping on something. For Kyle, that kiss pushes his obsession with Avi into overdrive.

I liked Eva and Avi. Eva is trying to do something about her unhappiness. Its not necessarily working, but at least she is making the effort. Avi is drifting, but doesnt appear to be that unhappy with his current situation. He enjoys life as it comes. I didn't care for Kyle. He struck me as a self-absorbed, rather mopey person, who was losing himself in drinking and drugs as a way to avoid the conflicts of life and his feelings for Avi, which are not reciprocated. He's a voyeur. He films Avi while he (Avi) is sleeping nude and later feels Avi up while he is passed out drunk. Neither of these are acceptable actions. Period.

Overall, though, sex is treated quite casually in this movie. For example, when Kyle walks in on Eva and Avi having sex, he quickly forgives Eva when she tells him that she doesnt love Avi. Too quickly, in my opinion. Kyle has treated Eva rather poorly up until this point, which is partly why she turned to Avi, but Kyle seems more upset that Avi is having sex with Eva than Eva is having sex with Avi (if that makes sense).

Despite my dislike of Kyle, I will say the acting here is great from all three of the main actors. Bob Morley is the only one whom I have seen in other films/TV. He is Australian and does a good job with the Israeli accent.

The cinematography is also well done. Settings are lushly rendered, and scenes are close and claustrophobic when necessary and expansive and sun-drenched other times. Some of the party scenes almost had an 80s vibe, which probably dates me.

After all the good stuff, I found the ending infuriating. It feels like the screenwriter couldn't think of a good way to wrap up the arc of the individual characters and just punted. I really don't see the narrative value in the ending. Argh. [Heres a hint to the ending: Theres a line in a song that goes, A gun in the first act always goes off in the third.] If the film had had any sort of resolution, I would have given it five stars.

Overall, though, I recommend the movie.",1458172800,8,3144,4.631956912028725
8747370,2,B01AH3QRGK,"The only part of this movie that I enjoyed was Bob Morleys character, Avi. I could not stand Thomas Dekkers character, Kyle, at all. He was pretentious and creepy. The girl who played Eva was alright. Her scenes with Bob were good. My biggest issue with this movie was the lack of consent in regards to Kyles actions towards Avi (I.e. filming him asleep while hes nude and then later fondling his junk while intoxicated AND sleeping). Avi is a precious character and Bobs acting can really do no wrong, but this movie deserves to be in a dumpster fire.",1519862400,,552,4.53

8747378,4,B01AH3QRGK,"Well, this was an experience.  I'm not quite sure what to think about it.  I expected a weird, acid trip of a movie, and that's pretty much what I got.  I like weird movies, though, so in that regard, this worked for me.

If you're looking for fast-moving action, then this film is not for you.  If you know nothing about the situation in Israel/Palestine, some of what's going on here might be lost on you.  If you're looking for a light-hearted movie where everything is resolved happily at the end, skip this.

If you're looking for Bob Morley, as I was, then watch this.  The man is a truly fantastic actor and shines the whole movie through. He's Australian but pulls off an Israeli accent flawlessly.  As gorgeous as he is to look at on screen, his talent is even more remarkable.  He's the kind of actor who makes you forget that you're watching a movie; rather, he makes you feel like his character is a real man and that the camera is simply filming his everyday life, no script or directing required.  There are so many subtle nuances to his acting that can't be taught, and it's a joy to watch.

The female actress also does a nice job, but the male lead's performance is inconsistent and off-putting.  I find his character to be pretty insufferable, and the female lead is . . . not exactly the easiest to root for, either, although she and Bob Morley have very good chemistry.  All in all, though, Bob's character is really the only truly likeable one.

The sexuality in play is pretty unabashed and crude, and several scenes might make viewers uncomfortable because of issues of consent, but all in all, I'm glad I watched this movie, and truth be told, I would watch it again, mostly to bask in Bob Morley's fantastic performance.",1465084800,,1745,4.512738853503185
