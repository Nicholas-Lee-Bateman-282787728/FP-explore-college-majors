6486299,4,B00LGQVFKQ,"This is the sequel to ""Daddy, I'm a Zombie"" which I did not see. They spend the first three minutes of this film to explain the first feature. Dixie has new found popularity and it hosting a Halloween party while running for student council. Her new friends are
""mean girls"" and try to keep her away from people who are not cool.

Meanwhile Dixie reunites with Isis and the pirate Gonner to restore the power to her gem Azoth  to keep the evil Nebulosa in check.

The film has some cute moments but is not particularly clever. It is basically inoffensive and something kids should like. Lacks any scare factor.

I now know what happened to my cat.  4 Stars is generous.",1412380800,,669,4.450819672131147
6486300,3,B00LGQVFKQ,"I liked the original movie overall. I would have given it three stars too. The sequel is cute enough. The story was a lot more coherent this time around and we saw a little more character development. Don't let the box art confuse you though. This movie is not set in Ancient Egypt, but in the same world as the first one. The only mummy is Isis from the first film. All the best characters from the first film are back. I would watch a third movie if they decided to turn this story into a trilogy.",1411948800,,499,4.154639175257732
