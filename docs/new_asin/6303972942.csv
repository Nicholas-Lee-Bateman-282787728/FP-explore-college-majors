7858844,5,6303972942,"The self-effacing Duchovny and winsome Anderson demonstrate conclusively the exceeding importance of performer chemistry in the motion picture and television arts and preserve for the ages a fictionalized roadmap to the 20th Century broadcasting milieu of metadramatic telecom romance.

The X-Files pilot deserves to be highlighted and framed with its own annotated digital edition.",1322697600,,382,6.074074074074074
7858845,5,6303972942,"Check out the pilot that started it all. Jerry Hardin, as the enigmatic ""Deep Throat"" is so good that one can believe that he was involved in a little thing called ""Watergate.""
An ""X-Files"" fan can relish in the look of a much younger, and slightly pudgier Anderson, while Duchovny's infancy as an actor is intriguing alone. Just to see how he ""grew"" as a performer is a revelation.",1016236800,2,382,4.550724637681159
7858846,5,6303972942,"The pilot episode of the X Files and the second episode DEEP THROAT are the reasons why the first season of the show was the best.  A true aura of  mystery surrounded the episodes, nor would all the parts to the puzzle be  filled in at the end and the foreshadowing was very high.
In PILOT, FBI  instructer Dr. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is brought to her superiors  with a new assignment.  She is to be the partner of loose cannon agent Fox  Mulder (David Duchovny) a brilliant agent whose theroies on the paranormal  and mythology in his cases have alienated him from his fellow  investagaters.  It is Scully's job to find validity and scientific proof to  Mulder's claims of alien involvment in his cases.
Their first adventure  takes them to Oregon where strange occurances are affecting the young  members of a small town.  The towns people know what is going on, and don't  want it spreading around or being discovered.
A good start for the  show, characters are being introduced and we see development too.  Most  importantly we learn why Mulder is determined to find what is ""out  there"" which will become a staple of plots in many episodes.  Not to  mention a particular scene where we see how much trust Mulder and Scully  can show for each other.
DEEP THROAT is even better.  Mulder is warned by  a mysterious old man not to pursue interest in a case involving an Airforce  base in Idaho where it's members are being affected by something strange.  Despite this warning, Mulder and Scully go anyway to investigate the matter  and end up in a desperate fight for the truth and probably their  life.
This tape is great for the person who wants to get into the show.  Because there is no better place to start then the begining, especially  with this particular show and this particular season of episodes.",966470400,19,1818,4.643533123028392
