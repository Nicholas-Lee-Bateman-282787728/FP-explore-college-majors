8611051,5,B00F07PTDG,"The title of this review is the one commercial I'd like to see the most. Unfortunately it's not on the DVD. But other than that this is one of the funniest and weirdest collections of commercials you'll ever see from the late 60's and 70's. If you're old enough to remember them, you will not be able to believe what you were watching then,  some products diappeared without a trace, while others, like Halo Shamoo, which were so big back then--what the hell happened to them? But mainly it's the snapshots in time. Beautiful young girls walking wistfully thrugh glades and forests or on the shores of beautiful lakes, with flowing hair, and thin, wispy, flowing clothes, wistfully holding a flower and sighing. They did that a lot. It didn't matter whether they were selling hair-dryers or scourng pads--this was the age of Aquarius--and every product wanted to be associated with these beautiful, wistful, young girls. If you're too young too have seen these commercials you'll probably wonder what your parents were really doing back then and did they ever actually own any of these products. However, I can tell you the actual Flower Children and/or Hippies were not watching much TV and if they were they were laughing their heads off at these commercials. One of my favorites is for a gas station. A seated giant Noah--with long hair and huge beard looking like an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi is telling you kids to collect all the animals that were on the ark. Apparently every time you stop into some gas company's gas station--you get another animal. And if you collect all 6 gazillion pairs you then get the Ark itself. Now the animals must be about 1/3"" high(well the giraffes may 5/12 "" high) and the Ark, much bigger, probably about 3 by 3 (inches?, cubits?) It doesn't matter, they just want the kids to pester their parents to go to that gas station all the time. Then there's the really inappropriate ones.  A male voice-over is showing 3 girl dolls--kind of rag-like--not Barbies. They've all got names. One of them is named ""Tart"". At the end the voice-guy says, ""And remember, kids, two of the dolls clothes can come off"". Makes you wonder if it's ""Tart"" that is the shy one. Then there are the celebrities like Los Bravos band members (I guess about 14 years old then) running around being crazy sitting on merry-go-roung horses, and generally ripping off the Beatles ""Help"" though not well enough that anyone should care. Della Reese shows up on a PSA warning about windows and doors that are too  clear and you could walk thru them accidentally and kill yourself.  She didn't say if this was a leading cause of death among idiots.  If you watch closely you'll also see Diane Keaton, Morgan Freeman, James Garner and a bunch more including the Jackson 5 with Michael still looking like he was black. There's a singular lack of hi-tech commercials--it's as if one were seeing stuff from a millenium ago at times, though remember most of these commercials were made AFTER man walked on the moon, yet about the highest tech products you'll see is an electric toothbrush. Weird, funny, and at times, disturbing--it's a great collection. I can't wait till they do one from the fifties and early sixties where Jack Webb, Bette Davis, and 9 our of 10 doctors will reccomend Chesterfields or Benson and Hedges cigarettes for  your health. Don't miss this. A good idea is to watch it at least twice, once straight, and once stoned.",1397260800,3,3437,4.739130434782608
