8067997,4,B0009WFEN2,"This series was recommended to me because I am learning about video games and this was given as an example of how even cartoons can be amusing without having detailed plots or voice-acting.  Frankly, I feel I learned alot from those shorts and recommend them to anyone who needs an example of such cartoons.  In regards to the figure, it does not move but looks wicked cool and is very detailed.  Considering the price I paid for it, I don't feel ripped off.",1268265600,,458,4.493975903614458
8067998,1,B0009WFEN2,"This looks like it should be cute and wonderful,but the episodes are way too short and disjointed. The worst part though is the soundtrack the intro song is so horrible that I can't stand to watch this dvd ever again!!! not too mention the fact that you have to hear it again every few minutes due to the short length of the episodes. Very Bad series!!!!",1202256000,,354,4.378787878787879
8067999,5,B0009WFEN2,"""Panda-Z"" is a clever parody of ""Mazinger Z,"" one of the classic Japanese Giant Robot anime. If pandas made giant robots, well, they'd look like pandas, right? And so they do, and have Pantaron Panda wearing a dashing red bandana controlling his giant fighting device from the open cockpit in Panda_Z's head.

The only problem is that Panda-Z is utterly useless and all the Pandas and their robots are hopeless incompetents. In each 5-minute episode, things never work out right, not for the Pandas or their even dumber enemies... In one episode, Panda-Z launches a one-two ""ROCKET PUNCH!"" against the enemy, and his two arms fly off like missiles, effectively putting the enemy out of commission. Then Panda-Z walks over to his two hands lying on the ground, but now he can't pick them up. Slowly the sun sets and the shadows get longer, and Panda-Z just stands looking at his hands on the ground as the episode ends.

All the episodes are like that. They open with a bizarre premise treated as completely normal, and then things run totally out of control. Satire? Well, yes, of course - though it'll help if you're familiar with the cliches of Giant Robot and Mecha anime. The animation is very simple, and Panda-Z proves that one can do some very clever things with minimalist animation techniques.

Kids will probably love Panda-Z, but serious-minded grown-ups might grumble about it being so silly. But that's the whole point: real life is also pretty silly. So it gets five stars because it does what it's supposed to do perfectly.",1140825600,4,1538,4.818181818181818
8068000,5,B0009WFEN2,"The other reviews make fair comments to an extent. I will admit that there is a very short amount of animation for your money.

But this product is fantastic.

Yes, you do need to know the background of the show (if you really knew your Japanese/anime culture then you would be off to a good start) to really appreciate it properly, but if you can't see the fun in this cartoon then you are probably just too old/slow and your cultural codes are out of date.

This package includes a seriously cool and collectable free toy. The design is very clean-looking, very cute and post-modern in a good way. I want more.",1129507200,3,612,4.446428571428571
8068001,2,B0009WFEN2,"Panda-Z, Japanese toy collectors have been waiting for nearly a year to discover the anime behind the impressive toys, some made in 1970's die-cast, Popy-like form.  It was already obvious that the series would be a hybrid of cute animals and the ever popular Mazinger-Z.  Anime Magazine hyped the DVD to death, so I didn't hesitate pre-ordering this long, long, loooooong ago.  Too bad.  If I had read the review now offered by Amazon  (as opposed to Coming Soon!), I would have at least been prepared for the brevity of the DVD.  Five episodes, only a few minutes each.  Cute, I suppose, but certainly not worth the money.  Perhaps if it had contained a season of these shorts (much like Cartoon Networks ""Clone Wars"" micro-cartoon compilation), or even some sort of introduction and cohesion, it might be worth it.  In the end you are left feeling, ""That's it?  That's all?  What a load of...!""

Thank God for the collectable figure contained in this limited edition.  I most certainly would not buy a sequel, if such a pathetic possibility exists in marketing.",1128988800,,1064,4.8121546961325965
