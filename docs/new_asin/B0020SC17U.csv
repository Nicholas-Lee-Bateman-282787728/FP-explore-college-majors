8348646,5,B0020SC17U,"Simoun is regarded as a Yuri classic and it is easily my favorite series of all time. It is an incredibly character driven story so the sub plot is kept sort of a mystery to us as it is to our main cast. We experience the war through them, not from all angles. This is what I believe makes this a masterpiece because it tells the story in a way that makes it flow together and we know as much as the main cast knows. The OST is possibly one of the greatest of all time and has some of the most beautiful music I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. 12/10. The animation was great the way it incorporated still images was extremely powerful and filled the viewer with emotions. I honestly can't praise the series enough.",1421107200,4,719,4.217391304347826
8348647,4,B0020SC17U,It was interesting ... The story is obviously a fantasy one it was kinda odd for my liking but it was really cute there was some tears at the end lol,1394064000,,149,3.838709677419355
8348648,1,B0020SC17U,"Unfortunately... I don't enjoy watching subtitled anime... I like the ""whole"" experience including soaking in the graphics.  With that said, I have no idea if this is great anime.  The product description species ""Dubbed: English""  IT IS NOT.",1386547200,,242,5.315789473684211
8348649,3,B0020SC17U,"If you are looking for an English dubbed version of this anime, this is not it! It only has the English subtitles option available even though the description by Amazon clearly intimates that both options are included.
That being said... this is a good anime, with a very interesting plot that will pull you in. Just make sure you put your reading glasses on if you don't know Japanese!
I hope Amazon will correct their error in the product description as I would most likely not had made the purchase otherwise. Not that I did not enjoy the anime, but I just don't like being mislead.",1371945600,,585,4.528301886792453
8348650,5,B0020SC17U,"Disregard the picture of the cover shown above as neither character,hair style nor apparent ""yuri""(lesbian)scene appear anywhere in the series. If you are looking for a lesbian series,this isn't it. What you will find is a rather deep and serious series depicting the misuse and abuse of young and devoted girls for govermental,adult,political and ""religious"" reasons,enough to make your stomach churn;you probably will not like the ending very much,if at all.
While there is one or more depictions of yuri,they are side ""arcs"" and not the purpose of the series. Those that pay attention will note the ""female"" mechanic putting presure on Nevell,the very attactive and central figure of this series,has already been to the springs and chose to be a male and is slowly changing into a male. But,you have to pay attention for these details.
The aircraft and other mechanical artwork is splended,the character designs of the girls is very good but the adults males and females, are plain and boring and, while the landscaping is minimal to a fault,it enhances the mechanical art.
Just how well the subtitling is,I haven't a clue as I have gone through three different releases of this series and only one made any sense at all.
This is an intelligent and worthwhile series,without the slightest hint of sex,nudity or fan service and is most highly recommended for those mature to 16 years or better.",1338595200,23,1396,5.021551724137931
8348651,5,B0020SC17U,"This was much different from any anime I've seen; gender, spirituality, relationships, war, politics. The characters are a diverse cast of girls and women of different ages and personalities. I highly recommend it.",1315353600,5,214,5.515151515151516
8348652,5,B0020SC17U,"This story is placed on a planet where all people are born and spend their childhood as a girl. At the age of 17, the child chooses their sex by entering a holy stream, and crosses it while thinking about the sex they have chosen. The crossing of the stream becomes a rite of passage between a child and an adult.

A Simoun is an airship, with a pair of Ancient Helical Coils as its base. Spinning a coil provides power, which can be used to fly. The coils also react to the pure soul of a child before she chooses her place as a man or woman in this society, and can alter the space around it, by tracing through certain patterns.

Children of noble decent are chosen to act as priestesses. They perform these acts to bless the land, fight disease, improve crops, and other tasks that will better the community. Priestesses that excel can delay their trip to the stream to enter adulthood. It is a wonderful system, that is, until war breaks out.

The priestesses are now asked to save their country, by tracing out patterns of destruction. The burden of war is placed on little girls. Some of them die, and some that are over 17 choose to escape the horrors of war by crossing the stream.

With the desperate need to replace priestesses, trainers, younger girls, and children of non-noble rank are added into save their country.

Simoun does have battle scenes, but the main emphasis is on the maturation of the priestesses through difficult events. The horror of war, the loss of a soul mate, class differences, choosing a life partner, and honor, are what Simoun is about.",1269820800,21,1576,4.515789473684211
8348653,5,B0020SC17U,"The cover shown does NOT reflect the contents in any manner. This is not a yuri series and the two girls shown are not in the cast. I do not know why there is a great urge to brand this a lesbian series. There are no teen aged boys in this convoluted society and all the emotionality between the players is therefore,quite normal. You just have to watch it a little more carefully to see what is really going on. No sex,no fan service,no nudity. Until they go through the Springs and choose a sex,all are girls. This series is quite powerful in its messages as anti-war and the distain for unfeeling adults,government officials and religious leaders that pervert the religion to suit ""unholy"" needs while convincing the little girls they are just offering prayers to the diety when in fact they are killing people. The art used for the Simoun flying machines and that used for the girls is very good to most excellent. The difference in artist styles and qualities is the tip-off of what the authors of this series is trying to do,in my opinion. If they were trying to create a ""yuri-fest"",they failed. No girls gone wild,just a few that had enough of the crap. No toplessness.",1257897600,7,1177,4.5829383886255926
8348654,3,B0020SC17U,"I bought this with my cousin just yesterday since I got money for my graduation that same day, now I bought this at Best Buy not Amazon because of the price tag, (it was $10 dollars cheaper).
I am enjoying it so far because it is nicely drawn with a good pull in.
What would you pick to be when your 17 years old, male or female?
I picked it up just for the story and so far it is very good.
If you want a compelling story that would make YOU even think if you would like to stay female or become a male during a war, than go with this anime! Its a very different take on war and how war effects innocent people.
If you can stand the yuri content than I would say get it, besides who doesn't like yuri?:P",1245196800,3,704,3.8958333333333335
8348655,5,B0020SC17U,"Simoun is a series that I've run across reviews on and either the people love the series or hate it.

I personally love the series and when media blasters/anime works finally put out a box set of the 5 disk series here in the US I snapped it up eagerly.

This story is about war and the affects of war on the innocent people drug into it. It's a story about growing up in the chaos that is war and a story about figuring out what you want to do, or be, and taking the first steps into that direction of your life. I personally love the series completely and it is one of my all time favorites.

Now this boxset format disappointed me a little bit. I love simoun and did buy this set as soon as it was offered but they stuck all 5 disks into a single normal dvd case. I understand that media blasters like everyone else has to cut costs somewhere but there is just something nice about holding a nice box with slimpacks of your favorite series (with the cover art they released the single editions of) in your hand instead of one dvd case.

Overall if you don't mind the yuri content(everyone in this world is born female till 17 when they choose their gender) it is an awesome series and this boxset is a cheap way to get the complete collection.",1243900800,26,1246,4.200836820083682
