8682963,5,B00OAI2X0S,I like this movie very much. I wish it was restored and released on blu-ray disc along with other James Cagney's early films.,1472860800,,125,4.478260869565218
8682964,5,B00OAI2X0S,I like early James Cagney(1934) and this film features Him and Allen Jekins as truck drivers caught between striking farmers and the dairy business. A very entertaing mixture of comedy and drama.,1430265600,4,195,5.125
