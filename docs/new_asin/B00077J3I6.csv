8045558,2,B00077J3I6,"If you're looking for a decently informative film about John of God, then you'll have to live with this one. The quality is poor, and as the person below me mentioned, it feels like a home movie. The audio quality throughout the movie can be frustrating as you miss bits and pieces and cut off mid sentence.

This is no where near anything that you would expect from national geographic or any upscale producer, but if you're really curious, you should still give it a shot.",1198627200,2,474,4.511627906976744

Though the video is the first produced and is rough, it speaks truth about a very pious and simple man.",1188345600,,273,4.230769230769231

There is so much information out there that alot of people don't know about. Thank you John of God for your giving ways.

Peace and Love,

8045561,3,B00077J3I6,"A low budget attempt to showcase John of God and the Casa.

I've been searching for an informative film/DVD regarding the Brazilian healer for several months. This movie walks the viewer through the Casa, introducing you to John of God, the staff and the volunteers.

Unfortunately the quality is similar to a home movie, don't expect much. The orientation by Robert Pellegrino-Estrich is informative, but the audio quality is very poor. The microphone was clearly in the back of the room, not near the speaker.

After viewing the DVD you will feel like you have walked through the Casa, rubbed shoulders with the hundreds of hopefuls lined up for healing.

Until a professional film with a large budget is produced- this will have to suffice.",1124064000,7,743,4.92
