It's a good primer, but it lacks a full examination of the Nazis' manipulation of the sciences, history, youth culture, state education, the arts, etc. A fuller examination would reveal how sophisticated the Nazis were in their methods of social and cultural manipulation. Their methods were so perfected, they are still used to this day - frighting stuff.",1393200000,,530,4.966292134831461
7796844,5,1568124805,"We all know the usual war stories, but this ""behind the scenes"" look informs us of what drives madman such as Hilter and his elite SS.  A must have for anyone who believes that past history is important to the future.  The movie was well done and actual footage is not as grainy as most history movies.  This movie showed on the Military and Discovery channel, but was unavailable from their website. A very chilling and accurate account of Hilter's rise to power and subsequent decisions made during the war that were based on occult, mystic beliefs and astrology.  It also shows the influence and power that Hilter's top military cronies had on Hilter.  I highly recommend this movie.",1197676800,4,686,4.73109243697479
