8436914,5,B004O0FGAG,"LOVE COMES SOFTLY is now a series of 10 movies, and there is now a 10th Anniversary Collection available at a special anniversary price (I paid less than $10 for all 10 movies in one collection).

So, as strange as it might sound, I recommend that you do not pay an arm and a leg to buy these 3-dvd sets, but instead, look for:

. . . . . . LOVE COMES SOFTLY - 10th ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION
. . . . . . (see picture)

I highly recommend these movies to you. They are well worth the bargain price that Amazon has currently set for the brand new, PRIME collection.

I enjoyed the movies so much that I bought another two volume set for my granddaughter as a gift this Christmas.  She will love watching them again and again as I will.  These volume sets are real keepers.  When less than wholesome movies are placed on the market, it's so refreshing to see great stories with no vulgarity and each story has moral structure.

The western setting includes meandering dirt roads and cabin dwellings with a lovely scenic valley.  I haven't been disappointed with any of the character's acting abilities.  They look and act the part throughout the stories as they resemble the character portrayed.  If you want a movie with well known actors and actresses like Jimmy Stewart or Maureen O'Hara, you won't find it in any of these movies, but you will get quality acting nonetheless.",1322956800,,995,4.880952380952381
