6199415,3,B00HR340JA,"Neverending Story is a good movie, especially for a child.  However, Where the Wild Things Are was awful and seemed to teach all the wrong lessons to a spoiled child.  I recommend the Neverending Story be purchased by itself.",1446940800,2,225,4.743589743589744

8634653,5,B00HR340JA,"imagination and fantasy. 2 qualities i feel is lost in ""todays"" generation.  i grew up on never ending story since it came out in 1984. i have always updated it as needed from taped on HBO to an official VHS copy to DVD and now blu ray. its one of those movies i plan on showing to my kids.

Where the wild things are followed the books fairly accurately. good acting. did everything right.",1490054400,,390,4.256756756756757
8634654,1,B00HR340JA,Carefully read the product description. This is not a paperback of the movie of the same name.  It is only a short story and all I would pay for it would be a dollar.,1484697600,,166,3.8823529411764706

8634657,5,B00HR340JA,"A classic with a modern gem as a bonus.

Ever since renting Neverending Story for my daughter she has been obsessed with seeing it again.  (This makes me smile since it's on of my favorites from childhood).

Where the Wild Things Are, I had never seen before this arrived.  It's a little bit slow, and dare I say maybe too depressing for the youngest of viewers but the imagery/setting is original and captivating and the characters emotions are pretty powerful.  My daughter didn't care for this one as much, but my son liked it.  Perfect.

Neverending story is worth $8 on blu-ray by itself.  Enough said.",1476921600,,607,4.660377358490566
8634658,5,B00HR340JA,"One of the best children's fantasy movies from the 1980s and one from the 2000s are put in the same package together. Both of them are based on children's fantasy books and both of them are well-made, even if the Neverending Story does show its age for being a 1980s production.",1475884800,,278,4.470588235294118
