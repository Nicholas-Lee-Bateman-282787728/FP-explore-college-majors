8351236,1,B0025X4PJC,"If you wanna get 'technical', Alpha Video is a ""public domain"" releasing company. These films are NOT under copyright. So, save for the funky, professionally done (photoshop) DVD cover sleeves, this company is pretty much a DVD-R company.
I also can't stand them because, as much as we all like to save a buck here and there, these Alpha Video prices are ridiculous. They may as well just give the movies away for free.
As a fellow entrepreneur video retailer, THANKS Alpha Video, for making people CHEAP!! But no one has a problem dropping $60+ for PS4 and XBox games. Unreal.",1485302400,,577,4.7227722772277225
