7862497,4,6304128614,"This is a review of  the new A Touch of Frost: Collection 2, the second  of a new four set Collection of one of Britain's most acclaimed detective series based on the R.D. Wingfield novels.  It is  being  compiled, and  issued by MPI Home Video [...]  publishers.

The series A Touch of Frost, stars Sir David Jason, as a very human English Detective Inspector Jack Frost of the fictional drab community of Denton, England. As a senior policeman Frost may have some issues with his  long term supervisor  [played by Bruce Alexander] who may not always appreciate his methods, or his demeanor except for his success record.

Frost  may sometimes have a  gruff exterior and is rather dogged in the pursuit of his cases, but he can have a pleasant manner, with a  certain dry wit, along with a certain sense of moral justice in the pursuit to his profession. There is a certain interplay as the supporting cast changes over the seasons, and  dealing with a terminally ill Mrs. Frost.

I was not personally familiar with  the series Touch of Frost until getting Collection 4. I had seen the occasional DVD reference on-line, or at my local Book store, and had read a little about the series. Since my retirement, I have begun to acquire my favorite PBS, Masterpiece Mystery series to enjoy at home, as I wish. This  new A Touch of Frost: Collection 1-4  has  now been added to that collection.

If you enjoy good British Detective genre, don't we all,  i.e. Inspector Morse, or  Inspector  Lewis, you may probably also enjoy  this series, A Touch of Frost.  The new Collection series is also an inexpensive way to introduce yourself to Inspector Jack Frost, Sir David Jacob, is an excellent and award winning actor, who recently ended one of the most popular, and longest running detective series on British TV (1993-2010).

I would recommend the new A Touch of Frost Collection series for your your possible  consideration. I purchased Collection No. 4, and returned to purchase Collection No. 1-3. But you will need to understand that this is not a re-issue of the original Seasons No. 1-15 (1993-2010).

Rather what you will be purchasing is a collection of selected episodes taken from each of the  Season 1-15  starting with Collection 1, [Season 1-2 ].  There is no stated rationale given for what is included, and what is not.  Might  these be  considered as sort of  ""best of of each Season"" at a certain criteria level? I will need to check that out for  a later review.

Starting with Collection 1 (Season 1-2), each will probably be a set of three DVD's in jewel cases in a paper case. Each new  Collection will contains  three new DVD's  of  selected episodes taken from two or more seasons after Collection 1. One may  assume that the new Collection series will span the complete Seasons 1-15 is the same  similar manner over time.

REVIEW: Collection Collection 2  [DVD7007]

Each  DVD's jewel case  has  brief notes on the back. DVD's are in Color, Not Rated, a Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, 4.3 aspect ratio. DVD Video,  NTSC, with approximately 5 hours  total viewing time per collection

Collection 2 includes three separate DVD, with the following episodes:

Season 3: Appropriate Adults

Season 3: Quarry

Season 4:  Paying the Price

There is a good deal of action here with a  case of a missing  8 year old girl  case. There is murder with an animals rights group. Frost burns his home down, and another desperate high stakes kidnapping situation.

You can check out  a full description of the above individual episodes at [...] website, or on the Internet.

I found the quality of all three DVD's to be very good in  picture quality, and in audio quality on my Panasonic HD TV. I would have appreciated a larger picture format 1:77:1  of the later seasons, and a Dolby Digital 5.o  sound. I can only assume that the current Collection 1-4 have not been re-mastered from their original formats, maybe the later seasons will.

If you enjoy good modern British Detective genre, i.e. Inspector Morse, or Inspector  Lewis, you may  also enjoy A Touch of Frost.  The new Collection series is also an inexpensive way to collect Inspector Jack Frost, Sir David Jacob, an excellent actor, who ended one of the most popular, and longest running detective series on British TV.

In addition to the aforementioned Collection Nos. 1-4, those that might be interested in the entire Seasons 1-15 (1993-2010) are now available for your viewing pleasure.  If you are interesting in discovering more about the A Touch of Frost series, the new A Touch of Frost: Collection, might be a less expensive ride without all the bells and whistles. I doubt that anyone will be disappointed with the latter alternative with its five hours of viewing per collection.
