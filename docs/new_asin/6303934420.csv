743343,4,6303934420,"""Stage Door Canteen"" comes up with a wartime romance to showcase the talented stars who served food to the troops and provided entertainment at the Stage Door Canteen. There are about five dozen stars in this film, from Judith Anderson to Ed Wynn, with Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy, Helen Hayes and Gypsy Rose Lee, Count Basie and Benny Goodman, Harpo Marx and Johnny Weissmuller in between. At one point Katharine Cornell does the balcony scene with young Lon McCallister while standing in the serving line. For some reason most of the songs are written by Al Dubin and James Monaco, including ""She's a Bombshell from Brooklyn,"" We Musn't Say Goodbye,"" and ""Sleep Baby Sleep (in Your Jeep).""  There is also the Rodgers & Hart song, ""The Girl I Love To Leave Behind,"" a rather appropriate title given the situation.

The romantic plot of the film has Eileen (Cheryl Walker), a junior hostess at the New York City Canteen, meeting Private Ed ""Dakota"" Smith (William Terry). Despite her best intentions, she falls in love with Dakota, even though this means loses her pass at the Canteen because she has broken the rule about dating service men. Katharine Hepburn, serving as the Officer of the Day, allows Eileen to wait inside for her fiance, but then word comes that the boys sailed that morning and Dakota is already gone. Hepburn then consoles Eileen and gives an inspirational speech on the importance of the Canteen's work. It is certainly interesting to have this dramatic moment pop up at the end of this film, but the cause was certainly worthwhile.

Eighty percent of the profits from this 1943 film directed by Frank Borzage went to the Canteens operated by the American Theater Wing across the country. ""Stage Door Canteen"" is a fun little film to watch, especially if you remember who Xavier Cugat and Paul Muni were way back when.  Be sure that you get the 132-minute version of the film and not the shorter 93-minute version that cuts out a lot of the performances.  If you are looking for a double bill, then the obvious choice is ""Hollywood Canteen,"" which is basically the same deal but set in Los Angeles rather than New York and offers the Andrews Sisters, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Roy Rogers and Trigger, Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra and much, much more.",994204800,39,2282,4.781725888324873

The 4 stars is really for the great cast of Studio Actors doing cameos throughout the film.  I took away one star because a couple of the main characters were not well cast.  All in all, it does give the feel of the golden age of Hollywood.  **Spoiler Alert** One of the memorable scenes is when one of the Canteen hosts asks the audience of servicewomen:""If you could be any woman in the world, who would it be"".

I saw this movie when I was 11 years old and living in a small town so this was not a lifestyle that I lived but I loved the idea someone else was having all these wonderful encounters with the New York theatrical folks. I've remembered it all these years and to share it was heaven sent.

The actual story isn't too engaging, but it works as a way to tie all the acts/performances together. Basically, a GI and girl keep up a tit-a-tat at each other till her roommates shame her into being nice to him because of his coming contribution to the war effort. She repents and decides to marry him. The end. Cough. Like I said, the story isn't the most interesting, but it is SOOOOO worth watching for the other acts :)",1457481600,,530,4.257425742574258

743662,5,6303934420,"When I was growing up during the fifties, I started hearing stories from those who lived during WWIIstories that had to do with valor and chivalry and sacrifice and self-denial and, above all, strict morals and a respect for authority from the President down to the head of the family and your older brothers and sisters. And they won the war against all odds. Any wonder they are called The Greatest Generation? One example: the soldiers at the Canteen rise as one when Yehudi Menuhin starts to play Ave Maria. Nowadays contemporary audiences would probably react with cynical snickers. Why? Because the postwar Boom-Boom-Baby Generation might best be called The Pampered, Wimpey Generation best represented by James Dean, wallowing in self-pity and confusion in the movie Rebel Without a Cause (the title says it all) as well as in real life. Those Canteen actors and actresses and Big Band leaders, on the other hand, contributed their time and talents for the war effort free of charge and were accorded great respect and appreciation by the soldiers. Did any rock group visit Vietnam during the war to entertain the soldiers? No, they were getting stoned in Woodstock. In the movie Sunset Boulevard, Gloria Swansons character says: In my days, we had faces. Not only faces but faces with telling expressions unlike the blank, expressionless faces of contemporary movies.

The music at the Canteen? Heavenly, and yes, escapist. Freddy Martins Dont Worry Island is one example. It serves to uplift me during my down moods. Some might call it corny because it does not sound like the wailing dirges of contemporary pop. Those were innocent days to be sure. The movie does not feature sexnviolence but innocent love--another reason for some to stick the corny label on it. So give me naked bodies and explicit sex scenes abetted by grunts and heavy breathing cause I aint corny, just horney.

Other reviewers have listed the great performers in the movie, so Ill just paraphrase another reviewer who said that any movie with Benny Goodman is a favorite, by adding my 2 cents: any movie with Xavier Cugat and Lena Romay is a favorite too.",1454976000,,2138,4.919667590027701

This is like looking into another world and it gives one a sense of what it must have been like to watch the young men go off to the last war that was fought for a just cause.  This movie was made 3 years before I was born and I remember a few of the stars who were still famous during my childhood.  Many of them were before my time.  How nice it is to watch and experience the sense of patriotism and mutual support and encouragement they had then.  There are so many famous entertainers in this that they couldn't all be listed.  Very poignant and great fun, too.  All of these famous entertainers and the less famous ones really did volunteer their time to entertain the troops and try to make their transition from home to going off to war, easier.  And they were there to welcome them home.  Was this the last time a whole nation pulled together?  It seems like it.  Anyway, it is well worth watching.

743738,5,6303934420,"This is a difficult film to rate. It is not a great movie so much as a major time capsule and cultural artifact of the early years of the U.S. entry into World War II, a not very bright time. Like the film Hollywood Canteen an incredible number of major entertainers were packed into a two hour special to boost morale. By the way, both ""Canteens"" were real places servicemen could go and eat, be entertained and even meet some famous performers. The Stage Door Canteen was in New York and sponsored by the American Theater Wing. That's what makes this entry extra special; the famous names are from the theater and though most had appeared on film they were a bit more rarefied than the all movie crowd. Beside the big names, and there are plenty of those, you get glimpses of Helen Hayes, Katherine Cornell, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Elsa Maxwell, Arlene Francis and Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontaine.

Most of the actors get little bits or walk-ons (Talullah Bankhead is surprisingly listed as the ""name"" beneath the DVD cover here but blink twice and you'll miss her) and singers and musicians get spotlight performances. Some of the highlights include a lively Ethel Waters, Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy,  Kenny Baker with his clear tenor voice, and Gracie Fields singing about shooting down ""Jap planes"" (not ""Jet Planes"" as the
closed captioning says. Jets in 1943?). Big Bands include Basie, Cugat, Kyser, Lombardo andBenny Goodman with a 23 year old Peggy Lee lighting up the screen and so new as to be uncredited. Ray Bolger dances and Yehudi Menhuin plays violin and the list goes on and on. There are even moments featuring allies from the Russian Navy and Chinese Air Force lending a real authenticity to it all.

This is not presented as a ""Cavalcade of Stars"" kind of thing, a Goldwyn Follies or Paramount On Parade, but is formed around a plot of a small group of servicemen being given a few days leave before setting off to Europe for the war. And remember, things weren't going very well so far. Though they have names, they having probably just met recently, go by the names of the places they hail from. There's big Tex, little California, Jersey and Dakota who gets the main romance. There are girls for each of them and while down home Dakota has initial trouble with career girl-actress Eileen, Tex and Ella Sue hit it off from the get go and  California finally gets to kiss a girl. California is easily the most memorable of these minor characters whose stories happen in minutes between big acts on stage. He is played by Lon McCallister who had an all-American boyish charm that gave him a small film career till the early fifties when it became apparent that he would always be short.

It's sentimental, it's sweet, it promotes the war effort but never is hateful or jingoistic and is a most unique and entertaining moment in Hollywood's war effort. Katherine Hepburn ends it all with a sincere and heartfelt speech.",1430611200,4,2941,4.691860465116279

Keep in mind only a few percent of American prisoners survived the war if they were Japanese prisoners the Germans were only a little better.
And until the last year of the war it was not a sure thing that we were going to win. If you watch this film and listen to old news reports on radio recordings  and listen to  the ads on radio asking 16 year olds to volunteer to sail on ships going world wide and in many cases never coming back. Or a carrier being sunk with only a brief notice. And there was a draft not a volunteer war, almost every one was going one way or the other.

I didn't know that in 1943 there was a Stage Door Canteen (original club located NYC and the Hollywood Canteen in LA) where our service men were entertained by the top movie stars who donated their time. The format for the club was to have girls paired with service men to share the evening together under strict rules and be entertained by the movie stars of musicals, dance bands and the like.  What a great concept!  For details check it out on Wikipedia. I associated this with the movie ""The Harvey Girls"" (1946) with Judy Garland where girls met the trains and served the passengers meals at many train depots (1878-1965). See if you can name the actors and actresses as you watch this movie. We had first watched ""This is the Army"" with Ronald Reagan (remember him?) and Joan Leslie.  In this film (also 1943) you see the actors in a couple of scenes entering the Stage Door Canteen as part of the musical. We did not realize the importance of the canteen during the war years.

Stage and screen stars of the era came into the Hollywood Canteen on the west coast, and the Stage Door Canteen on the east coast, to entertain the troops who were getting ready to be shipped overseas.

744298,3,6303934420,"First off, this is an OLD black and white film and the sound quality is less than great sometimes - but don't let that stop you.

Personally, I'm not all that fond of most of the songs in this film - but yet I can truly appreciate the overall strength of support for all our service men/women and alies, where the whole country did whatever they could to help - even if that was just briefly meeting trains at 3am as they passed through with service men to hand them apples or sandwiches or whatever they could and collect the letters they want to post and warm them with a smile... in that aspect, this film will both warm and break your hearts as you empathasize. It was great to know that so much food talent, time and labor was gladly donated to feed and cheer/entertain the troops and help them enjoy what they were fighting for. Women around the country spent hours baking and supplies were rationed and every penny you had counted - but they gave even when it hurt, when it wasn't convenient, when it was uncomfortable...they went way out of their way to be ready to do whatever little they could when a group of our armed forces was going to be coming through their area. Did their best to be pretty for them, make them feel welcome and cared for. And our fighting forces dug deep and gave their best.  ---- All those feelings and memories are right here to be experienced/remembered.

And in places like NY and Calif there were plenty of famous stars to help entertain like this - but many many troops never got this kind of entertainment so this film was also intended to give that to them as well so they packed in a lot of star spots.

In this movie, 3 servicemen are followed and they will likely remind you of friends, family or just the best of us in general in those times.  Maybe you'll be able to glimpse how it might have been for your father or grandfather or other relatives - or the women you know from those times.

If you watch this with emotional detachment and criticism, you're missing the experience and the whole point of watching.  It's not the best film you'll ever see, but that's not why you watch it.

Watch this for the pride, the emotions, the memories and a PEEK at our past.  I teared up with pride and compassion many times watching this.",1345680000,,2277,4.364066193853428
744299,5,6303934420,"I needn't repeat what all the other five-star reviews have said. I share their opinions, and the five stars are for the movie. This review, however, includes specific information about the disc.

Since Amazon continues to lump all reviews of a particular movie together, it becomes impossible for a potential buyer to figure out what purchasers are referring to when they complain about the awful DVD quality or rave about the same unless the reviewer specifically states exactly what edition he's talking about. In this case, as with so many old movies, there are several to choose from. I chose the Critics' Choice version because a reviewer spoke highly of it. However, I have not seen any of the others, so I can't compare.

As for this particular edition, it's really pretty good, considering that the movie was treated poorly for decades. However, it is not -- as the case states -- ""restored"". It may very well be -- and I suspect it is -- remastered from fair to good prints, but that's not restoration. There are the usual light ""ticks"", dirt specks, scratches and so on that one nearly always finds on old films that have not been restored (and even some that have not had a complete restoration), but they are no more distracting than they would be on any old movie that you watch on late night television.

There's nothing on the disc except for the movie itself: no chapter selection, no subtitles, zip. But this is not, after all, Criterion.

And don't freak when the movie opens and you see how bad the titles are. As with ""And Then There Were None"", they put their time and effort into bringing the movie back from the brink and left the title sequence as it was. The movie is in considerably better condition than the title sequence.",1341964800,,1750,4.6537216828478964

744441,4,6303934420,"""Stage Door Canteen,"" like its companion, ""Hollywood Canteen,"" are two examples of a very big part of World War Two culture. Canteens gave service people a comfortable place to just be and make some good memories before going off to do what was extremely unpleasant but necessary. There are so many cameos that I won't list them all, but it's fun to see people like Ray Bolger and Lynn Fontanne kibitzing with the servicepeople. The plot is incidental, but quite honestly, I think they only meant it to be window dressing anyway.

The film reminded me that there are vast differences between the War on Terror and World War Two. For one thing, it's pretty easy today to go through an entire day without thinking that there are men and women fighting to protect this nation. Civilians aren't asked to contribute all that much--no rationing, no war jobs, no posters everywhere reminding us to zip our lips and buy War Bonds. That's why movies such as ""Stage Door Canteen"" are so interesting and valuable, because they were not only morale-builders for audiences of their day, but they can help viewers today to be grateful for what the Armed Forces do for us, and maybe get us thinking of ways we can show our appreciation.",1292544000,,1221,4.705607476635514

744445,5,6303934420,"This review is going to be very critical of and take a lot of the previous reviews of this movie to task.  I evidently am way older (74) than most of the reviewers, but if the comments most of the previous reviewers made are any example of the difference between the understanding of what it meant in those WWII days to have patriotism, appreciation of the simpler times during which this WWII and many other similar WWII movies were made, the obvious difficulties in striking a balance between presenting the story of the Canteens back during WWII and still having a semblence of drama and quality, it is no wonder we have such disagreements on current war time problems in the year 2008.  Don't the public schools teach anything about what conditions were like in the U.S. during those days?  If they did, some of the really ignorant comments would not have been made.  Do the persons who wrote these snide cricitisms about the naivete of the soldiers, how the girls were too straightlaced, etc., have any appreciation of the narrow and innocent social times present back in the WWII years?  One critic said all the soldiers in the movie were white.  That is a racist comment.  Did that person have any knowledge or understanding of the long and bitter difficulties between races in those days?  The Armed Forces were segregated, is that so hard to understand?  In those days, the U.S. in many ways was a very racist country, didn't you understand that was the way things were back then?  During WWII, in the movies, as in many other areas of social interaction, society was admittedly, and the U.S. Armed forces as well as the population in general were guilty of sometimes overt  and sometimes quiet racial discrimination.  Are the reviewers making comments ridiculing this movie aware at all about how times were then and how they have improved now?  Or does it make you a better reviewer if you simply put down the movie?  I am shocked at the snide remarks made about the movie, the actors, and yes, back in those days, we did refer to our enemies in words that were as hateful as possible, and these words were used in all segments of society, this because our enemies were at that time as close to being deserving of our hatred as is possible to be in wartime.  Is this the first movie from the 1940's you reviewers have ever seen?  Are you not aware that much of the arts, the books, the movies, etc, reflected the times and these were times, as we look back, that in many ways we were not proud of our society.  I just have to say that most of the reviews I read were somewhat ignorant and unnecessarily vicious in their ridicule of what were vastly different times reflected in movies of that day.  This movie was a fine example of gathering together many stars and musicians of the day, into a coherent and beautiful rendition of what it was like for soldiers to be leaving their country and maybe know they wouldn't return or for the home folks to have to put up with the rationing, and other privations at home and having their sons and husbands and boyfriends leaving, maybe never to be seen again.  I hope my strong words will resonate with some of the unthinking criticisms of this movie and of the people from those long ago times.",1217635200,8,3249,4.551546391752577

744447,2,6303934420,"War propaganda comes in all forms, from harsh gung-ho chauvinist to the melodramatic. This film is in the melodramatic form of a patriotic homage to what is now called in the mass media, at least, the ""greatest generation"", my parents generation during World War II. Here we have a thin story line about three GI's landing at New York's famous Stage Door Canteen to be feted, wined and dined by the toast of the international entertainment world, including Benny Goodman, Peggy Lee, Ray Bolger (doing a great dance routine), Gypsy Rose Lee, etc. Plus there is a little off-hand romance between the boys and the off-limits hostesses. But love will out in the end.

The dialogue, is to say the least to the modern ear, stilted. I assume, however, that it got its job done by boosting morale on the home front letting one shed a little tear for the boys going off to fight the enemies of the day. If you wanted to know what moved you in your youth or your parents or grandparents- what made you or them laugh, cry, sing and dance- then here is a slice of that for you.

Most noted among the performances were The Lord's Prayer (Gracie Fields), Ave Maria and The Flight of Bumble Bee (Yehudi Menuhin)on violin and piano accompaniment, Good night Sweetheart (Kenny Baker) as well as the puppet performances. The beautiful music elicited undivided attention and respect from the soldiers, the mood infectious across the screen. A young soldier lining up for food recognized the orange lady as the famous lady playing Juliet. Thus began the recital of the lines of Romeo and Juliet the play.

The version (not this one) I watched was not digitally restored. Yet it somehow delivered a powerful message. Emotional support from the young waitresses, dish washing and cooking by the show people, food donation from everywhere offered a unified and unreserved support for the young soldiers who were known as Dakota, Jersey, California (named after the places they come from). Simple rules that the waitresses could not meet soldiers outside the canteen and staff could not taste the leftover (such as rationed coffee) were enforced effectively.

744596,4,6303934420,"In the 1940's there were two Canteens...the Hollywood Canteen in California and the STage Door Canteen in New York, set-up to entertain serviceman who were getting ready to go to war or who were on leave.  The big attraction was that many Hollywood stars would work at the two establishments doing everything from bussing tables to dancing with the servicemen.  Stage Door Canteen does a pretty good job of capturing the feel of the real establishment.  One can only guess at the wide-eyed wonder these young men had when people like Bette DAvis and John Garfield waited on them.

The thin plot follows a group of serviceman who are about to be shipped off to fight.  And that's really about it.  They were not setting out to make a dramatic classic.  This was strictly a morale booster film, loaded with celebrities.  Among the guest stars are:  Ralph Bellamy, Edgar Bergen, Helen Hayes, katherine Hepburn, Harpo Marx, George Raft, and Johnny Weissmuller as well as the orchestras of Count Basie, Benny Goodman, and Kay Kyser.  It's sort of like a 1940's version of ""We are the World"" with all these celebs joining together for a great cause.

I finally watched it the other day and was very impressed with this story of how patriotic people were during WW2 and how the Stage Door Canteen made all service men feel welcome.  A cavalcade of stars and top notch big bands appear to make the boys feel at home and have a chance to enjoy their free time before eventually being shipped off to either Europe or the Pacific. Back in the day, many Hollywood stars donated their time to the Stage Door Canteen, providing entertainment as well as helping serve food and doing the cleanup afterward.  I enjoyed the budding romance between hostess Eileen and totally smitten soldier Dakota.  At first Eileen is more hung up on getting a role in a Broadway show than anything else, but later in the film she realizes that she'd been acting like a heel and really does have feelings for Dakota.  There are plenty of good performances as well, particularly by Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy; Ray Bolger(clowning around in the uniform jacket of the marine who kept asking him if he was Ray Bolger); and especially the music of the orchestras of Kay Kyser, Freddie Martin, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Guy Lombardo.

It was fascinating for me to glimpse so many of the stars from this era, since I don't know most of them. Yet even in their brief cameos you can feel some of the charisma that made them stars. For example, Tallulah Bankhead (who I had never seen before) has maybe ten seconds of screen time, but she leaves one of the biggest impressions. Oh and in contrast to what someone else wrote, I thought the Romeo and Juliet scene (with the line ""parting is such sweet sorrow"") was rather lovely and well done (by a stage actress I had never heard of).

I could go on and one about various moments by various performers, because there are almost 50 cameos, and lots of them are really funny and/or moving (Katherine Hepburn's climactic pep talk, for instance, demands mention). The framing narrative is a little corny, sure, but it's just innocent fun (and c'mon, it's based on an Irving Berlin song).

I live in New York, and my grandfather once mentioned going to a place like the canteen (maybe even this exact one!) when he was in the navy stationed here in WWII, but I had never really understood what he was talking about before I saw this movie.

I stumbled on this one boring Saturday night on PBS and highly recommend it to anyone of any age. I hate using such an old-fashioned word as delightful, but it fits. Stage Door Canteen really puts a smile on your face.",1114300800,13,1636,4.535593220338983
744601,4,6303934420,"""Stage Door Canteen"" comes up with a wartime romance to showcase the talented stars who served food to the troops and provided entertainment at the Stage Door Canteen. There are about five dozen stars in this film, from Judith Anderson to Ed Wynn, with Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy, Helen Hayes and Gypsy Rose Lee, Count Basie and Benny Goodman, Harpo Marx and Johnny Weissmuller in between. At one point Katharine Cornell does the balcony scene with young Lon McCallister while standing in the serving line. For some reason most of the songs are written by Al Dubin and James Monaco, including ""She's a Bombshell from Brooklyn,"" We Musn't Say Goodbye,"" and ""Sleep Baby Sleep (in Your Jeep).""  There is also the Rodgers & Hart song, ""The Girl I Love To Leave Behind,"" a rather appropriate title given the situation.

The romantic plot of the film has Eileen (Cheryl Walker), a junior hostess at the New York City Canteen, meeting Private Ed ""Dakota"" Smith (William Terry). Despite her best intentions, she falls in love with Dakota, even though this means loses her pass at the Canteen because she has broken the rule about dating service men. Katharine Hepburn, serving as the Officer of the Day, allows Eileen to wait inside for her fiance, but then word comes that the boys sailed that morning and Dakota is already gone. Hepburn then consoles Eileen and gives an inspirational speech on the importance of the Canteen's work. It is certainly interesting to have this dramatic moment pop up at the end of this film, but the cause was certainly worthwhile.

Eighty percent of the profits from this 1943 film directed by Frank Borzage went to the Canteens operated by the American Theater Wing across the country. ""Stage Door Canteen"" is a fun little film to watch, especially if you remember who Xavier Cugat and Paul Muni were way back when.  Be sure that you get the 132-minute version of the film and not the shorter 93-minute version that cuts out a lot of the performances.  If you are looking for a double bill, then the obvious choice is ""Hollywood Canteen,"" which is basically the same deal but set in Los Angeles rather than New York and offers the Andrews Sisters, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Roy Rogers and Trigger, Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra and much, much more.",1105747200,23,2282,4.781725888324873

Review the movie and keep your politics to yourself......this movie is an all star review of Hollywood in the 40's. Lot's of stars putting on great cameo performances. Taken in context and bearing in mind America was at war, the dialog reflects the feelings in America about the times. With young men going off to war Hollywood tried it's best to keep up morale of the troops and the folks on the homefront. Some dated dialog but an enjoyable movie.",1099699200,8,571,4.607843137254902

7857449,3,6303934420,"Stage Door Canteen, 1943 film

It begins on a train that carries Army soldiers to their unknown destination. They talk about their concerns. Outside a girl hands out packages of cigarettes to them. They sleep in their seats. They are given 24 hour leave to visit New York city. The price of a steak is $2! They won't need American money where they're going. Will they meet pretty girls? The Stage Door Canteen opens at 5 pm. The girls are not allowed to date soldiers, there are strict rules. The accents tell of their region. Ed Wynn was a comic, George Raft was an actor. The food is free. A British sailor gets an orange from Katharine Cornell. Bill Demarest is a waiter. The food was donated for soldiers only. Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen put on their ventriloquism act. Mortimer Snerd is there. Note the seams on the nylons. A woman sings The Lords Prayer. God Bless You. A band plays while singers sing. Some soldiers jitterbug, the latest dance fad. Some sailors waltz. One soldier asks an officer about permission to marry.

What if they run out of food? George Jessel does his comic act. Xavier Cugats band plays music, a girl sings about A Bombshell from Brooklyn. Some of the jokes are still funny. Then some Marines are recalled immediately. Guy Lombardos band plays. Extended leave allows one soldier to get married. Miss Ethel Waters sings while Count Basies orchestra plays. Some Russian sailors are introduced. Gypsy Rose Lee talks about a fan-dancer and removes her hat. There is another song with music. They thank the Chinese for their support. Benny Goodman plays the clarinet, a woman sings while the band plays. A couple dances. Harpo Marx does his act. A concert violinist plays Schuberts Ave Maria, next The Flight of the Bumblebee. Then the night is over. One hostess meets a soldier at her lodgings (this is forbidden and will be reported). They talk about the future. [Does a quick wedding insure future happiness?] They learn soldiers shipped out but left messages for the hostesses.

This movie shows what entertained America in 1943. It is about average today. How does it compare to other movies from that era?",1524873600,,2147,4.766129032258065
7857450,4,6303934420,"Good insight into the WWII mentality with zillions of Entertainment Legends. Saw this when it was originally released and remembered the massive number of stars & bands it contained. This is a pretty good B&W transfer with OK mono sound. Probably shows up better now than it did on the small town screen where I first saw it circa 1944. The celebrities are more obscure than those in the Hollywood Canteen, but, for those interested in Broadway, much more interesting.",1521244800,,468,4.8625
