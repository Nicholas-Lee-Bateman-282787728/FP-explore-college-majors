7943467,4,B00005KHJ5,"Yushiro tries desperately to rescue Miharu. Meanwhile, the free Japan is about to collapse. The US and Japan are at the brink of war. We all know that when America goes to war the world trembles, and we all know who wins. The ruler of the Gowa clan fancies himself a god, and has Yushiro in a position where he almost certainly has to fight. The war that may come to pass could devastate both sides. With the power of the Kai, and America's giant war machine, things are about to get very ugly. It seems now that nothing can be done to avoid this catastrophe.

This anime is very tedious. It is focused solely on the story, which is very good, and leaves the characters hanging out to dry. The best characters are Yuhiro's sister, who is barely a supporting character, and Yushiro's brother, who is the mastermind of this revolution. I have said before in my reviews of the other DVD volumes that the story is 5 stars, and the character development is 1 star. It takes a solid story and solid characters to make a great anime. This series is only mediocre. I'm giving this volume 4 stars b/c the suspense and anticipation of the coming battle is great. But I find myself glad to be nearing the end of this tedious and terribly balanced anime series.",1355443200,,1249,4.430434782608696
7943468,5,B00005KHJ5,This DVD is definitively the best I have ever bought. This movie is a whole experience. I have watched it over and over and every time I enjoy it even more.,1016236800,,156,4.064516129032258
7943469,5,B00005KHJ5,"There aren't enough stars in all of Amazon to let me describe how much I liked these episodes.  A fight of political powers to determine the shape of the world, in the setting of a disaster so believable and well presented it felt like it was ripped from tomorrow's headlines.  The only problem I can think of is that sometimes there are so many subtitles you can't possibly read them in one watching - but this one DVD (and one series) that certainly need multiple watchings to fully appreciate.",1010620800,,496,4.561797752808989
7943470,3,B00005KHJ5,"I have bought every single Gasaraki movie as it came out, feeling lucky to get 3 episodes per DVD and enjoying the mix of mech fighting and story.  But lately Gasaraki hasn't been as much about Mech fighting, its been more about the story.  Don't get me wrong, the Gasaraki storyline is awesome. I look forward to seeing what happens in the next episode every time.  But as my friend put it, the story could all be put in one episode.  There is really no reason for it to be extended to 10.  If you've been following this series and this is just the latest installment, then buy it and love it.  But if you have seen one or two of the DVD's and you want to see this one just cause, then rent or borrow it.  There isn't anything on this DVD that you can't memorize from one sitting.  If your looking for some real mech action, buy Macross Plus or Appleseed.  And of course Neon Genesis Evangelion.",1007942400,,896,4.254437869822485
7943471,5,B00005KHJ5,"You will be glued to your seat for this latest installment of Gasaraki.  True to standard anime form, everything big and epic happens right at the end of the series.  Gasaraki has been builing momentum right from the start and with disc 7 it is speeding along at full bore.",1007510400,,273,4.44
