8275157,4,B0019SVU7O,"The reviews for this short have nothing to do with the movie but really only with the crappy recommendation system Amazon has going for it, which sucks really because it deters from the film itself. I saw this movie, in a very raw state and felt it was amazing. Ashkin is a very talented filmmaker and a great story teller. If you are into movies like Wings of Desire, this is your cup of tea. The little girl is amazing and from what I gathered, she had never done a film in her life. I'm not a friend of Ashkin's, I simply met him at a screening of his film at his film school. Please do not judge the movie based on the comments listed... it does not do it justice... [...]",1227052800,,676,4.128787878787879
8275158,1,B0019SVU7O,"I bought God's and Generals and they suggested this. Are suggestions based only on titles? G&G is about the CIVIL WAR! What would this ?movie? have to do with the Civil War? NADA!

This may even be a good short movie, who knows, but Amazon is KILLING IT by SPAMMING people about it.

Amazon...
STOP IT!",1211760000,,302,4.375
8275159,1,B0019SVU7O,"This is so stupid. I got Troy in a box set and am I getting recommended a short film that appears to be about... what's this about?
How can they afford to pay Amazon for placement when they can't afford a DVD pressing? For Amazon's sake, I hope this is spoof.",1211673600,3,259,4.098039215686274
8275160,1,B0019SVU7O,I bought Gladiator 2 years ago and I was linked to this? Amazon is also into spamming now?,1211673600,2,90,4.055555555555555
8275161,1,B0019SVU7O,"Obviously something that is escaping the rest of us.  12 minute short, $15.00; ""on-demand"" recording on DVD-R when ordered; amateurish ""teaser"" description that tells us nothing...I imagine the title will be handwritten with a Sharpie on the DVD.  And yet, Amazon is actively promoting this?  My email said they were telling me about this because I own ""Last of the Mohicans"" on DVD; somehow equating the two escapes me.
Try an IMDB search for anyone associated with this...nothing.  Google...YouTube and blog entries.  Ridiculous!
I hope you're listening Amazon!",1211673600,12,563,5.3522727272727275
8275162,1,B0019SVU7O,"Because I bought a blockbuster movie about Jesus two years ago, Amazon invites me to buy a 12 minute short made in the garage of some obscure filmmaker?  You've got to be kidding me.  Well, at least it's only $15.00.",1211587200,17,216,4.375
