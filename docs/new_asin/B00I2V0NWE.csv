8638400,1,B00I2V0NWE,"This version has a few minutes more of footage but is not as good than its English counterpart.  Two things make this version a duller film than the English version.  First, the dialog has been dubbed in Italian.  The dubbers' voices are very subdued and lack the emotional lift and lilt in the original.  Second, the musical score by Riz Ortalini is orchestrally lush but he uses a lot of muted chords which also contributes to the feeling of ennui.  Donovan's melodic version of the score with its many folksy songs and lullabies lift the film to another level.

What Brother Sun needs after all these 40+ years is a good digital remastering to restore the image as well as its aspect ratio.  Also its about time the Donovan soundtrack make it on to CD.  A lot of fans of this film would be grateful.",1488758400,,802,4.482758620689655
8638401,1,B00I2V0NWE,A great version of the movie. It is quite different to the English one. It has a different music score on the sound track and many different scenes or slightly different. The English version has a few nice touches that this Italian one doesn't. Some scene/chapter changes are a bit abrupt. Great to have both versions.,1487203200,,318,4.696428571428571
