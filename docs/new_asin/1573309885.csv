191865,5,1573309885,"This video is great for beginners and intermediates. The poses are designed for novices to learn, and later alter when they reach the next level. Good explanations are given and, as always, Kathy Smith puts the  viewer's safety first.",947548800,34,234,5.0
191866,4,1573309885,"I found this work-out very invigorating.  Kathy was very informative about correct postures and stances, which other tapes may lack.  She held poses for an appropriate amount of time to create a challenge and work up a  little sweat. I found the second part of the tape a little disappointing in  its intensity. But overall, a wonderful tape for beginners.",946339200,27,356,4.883333333333334
191867,5,1573309885,"After exhausting many other relaxation efforts, I bought this video on a fluke. My daily life is extremely busy and stressful. By the end of my average day, my muscles and joints are sore, and very stiff.  My head is  full of worry and I generally feel lousy.  However, that's all changed now.  After only a few attempts at ""Kathy Smith's New Yoga"" program, I  felt tremendous stress relief.  I found myself breathing deeper, more  fully, and with sound ryhthm. My muscles are growing more limber and I feel  more at ease in my mind. Yoga does clear out the clutter in your head and  body, using a series of deep breathing techniques combined with stretching  and standing poses. It may seem challenging at first, but each and every  time you complete the program you will find your muscles growing more  limber and your breathing more relaxed and controlled. I recommend  ""Kathy Smith's New Yoga"" for both the beginner (like myself) or  someone more experienced.  The tape flows very smoothly and is broken into  two parts, so beginners are not overwhelmed.  There are people showing both  beginner and intermediate poses throughout the video, which cuts down on  injury potential.  Excellent video, you'll get your money's worth with  this one!",945820800,116,1246,4.866028708133971
191868,4,1573309885,"I have used Kathy Smith Videos for years and have always liked them, however I have to admit I was skeptical about her Yoga videos - but seriously if you like Kathy Smith you will like this video.  It is a quality, total yoga workout (60 min) and takes you through a lot of different poses.  My only real complaint is that it does not seem to flow real well from one pose to the next.  Instead of linking the poses, she stops to explain each pose - which is great for someone new to Yoga, but tends to get old for someone who is more intermediate or advanced.",1074470400,6,559,4.110091743119266
191869,5,1573309885,"I have about 100 yoga programs these days and have been practicing Yoga on a daily basis for almost 10 years. I also have the good fortune to study with a wonderful and gifted teacher so I have quite a bit of experience both with Yoga and Yoga Video/DVD programs.

 While I was probably the most skeptical person in the world about ""fitness queen"" Kathy Smith doing yoga and thought it was probably a ""Get on the Yoga Bandwagon"" phase for her, I have to admit that I think this and her other Yoga videos are very well done.

 First I think it's important to clarify something, Rod Stryker is the one who put together this and her other programs and Rod is as knowledgable and reputable a Yoga teacher out there. Kathy has also been doing Yoga for over 20 years and is extremely adept at demonstrating the poses, plus she's a very experienced teacher who is very easy to understand.

 I also like the fact that this video isn't rushed (it's about 55 minutes long) and so you aren't rushing through the postures, something that you don't always find. Many videos that are shorter are fine (such as the Yoga Zone shorter routines) but I find I have to actually do about 15 minutes of warm ups before doing them, with this video you don't need to do that.

 Regarding some complaints that it's repetitive, I would highly disagree. Of course you are going to do many repititions of Sun Salutations (that's standard in many forms of Yoga from Sivananda to Ashtanga and many other schools as well). These repetitions are a sound way of warming up your body. The heat that is created in the body prepare you to safely do the poses that are held for longer periods of time. So while there are many ""repetitions"", it's not ""repetitive"" because of a lack of creativity or for the sake of filling up time

 In fact, I like to start the Sun Salutes with modifications and gradually work up to the more ""full expression"" of the various postures with each repetition of the sequence. This way of working really keeps things especially interesting and makes you really internalize your practice (since you need to really feel what your body is ready for during each repetition).

 I also like that this program uses ""Lunge Salutes""  which are excellent hip openers and leg strengthers as well. What's also nice is that these are different Sun Salutes from Kathy's advanced program which use the Sun Salutes A and B. This makes for nice variety if you have the whole set of tapes/DVD's and allows you to work your body differently.

 The poses are shown with modifications so you can adapt your practice to your ability and or energy level.

 I would highly recommend this program (or the whole set) to those folks who want a well rounded and easy to follow yoga practice.

 Also, while I am very much into the spiritual aspects of Yoga, I understand that many folks are not. These programs definitely focus on the physical aspects of the practice so those who only want that aspect of Yoga will be pleased. Those who want to go into the more internal aspects can do so on their own if they like.

 Of course there are many wonderful Yoga programs for sale and depending on your personal preferences you may like some more than others, but as someone who has a large collection of programs I think this and Kathy's other Yoga programs are as good as any out there and believe me I was VERY skeptical.

 In fact I highly recommend this and her other Yoga programs.

 Another outstanding intermediate Yoga program is Sherri Baptise Freeman's ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga"" (available on amazon). This is one of the best Yoga programs available by one of the best teachers around!

 Namaste",1069459200,26,3664,4.571209800918836
191870,3,1573309885,"I like all of Kathy's videos but I'm dissappointed about this one because it's very similar to her Mind Wellness and Body but just a little longer.  Other than that, this is a good tape for beginners, it's pretty basic.",1065225600,2,219,4.475
191871,2,1573309885,"Normally I like Kathy Smith - okay, she's not my favorite and can be kind of annoying sometimes, but to her credit her videos always include clear, concise instruction. While this video does that, there are a few problems with it. First of all(and yes this makes a difference), the set is way too flashy. Also, the constantly changing camera angles look a little too much like an MTV video. Alternate angles are nice to furthur understanding of the poses, but in this case there are so many changes that it will probably just cause confusion - especially if you are a beginner.
As far as the actual vinyasa(series of poses), there is not a very good flow to it. It seems choppy and is lacking the fluidity that is so essential to yoga. Some of the asanas(poses) also may be a little advanced if you are a beginner. It would also be nice if she bothered to tell you the name of each pose - this is helpful after you get to know the poses, so you don't have to try to stare at the TV to see what to be doing. There is not enough emphasis on the importance of proper breathing - her explanation in the beginning of the video is pretty poor. It's more important to have a fundamental understaning of how to breathe properly rather than having someone just telling you to inhale or exhale. She also needs to shut the heck up during the corpse pose - the idea is to lose all thought and concerns(w/out falling asleep!) - not listen to your instructor.
Additionally, alternate poses are not covered nearly enough. Everyone has different physical abilities, and while she may mention alternatives for a couple of the poses, this is not done nearly enough or emphasized enough.
I could continue, but I think you get my point. Ultimately, there are many videos out there that are much worse - so while this isn't so bad, it's certainly not what I would recommend to friends. I would strongly suggest something from the Living Arts yoga series - especially one of the ""Total Yoga"" videos from Tracy Rich and Ganga White. The have been practicing and teaching for decades, as opposed to Kathy who is a fitness guru who puts out a new video for every hot trend that comes up. If you are worried about the Living Arts videos being too ""new-agey"", you will probably find that Kathy's video is more guilty of this than the Total Yoga videos.",1045612800,8,2325,4.472941176470588
191872,4,1573309885,"With my first attempt at yoga, I chose a well-respected leader in exercise, Kathy Smith.  In this 60 minute production for beginners and intermediate levels, Kathy Smith has selected some poses that are doable for the novice, by that I mean that she isn't asking you to bend over backward and touch the floor.
With instructor, Rod Stryker, Kathy guides you through some basic poses, and most being workable for the beginners.  What gets confusing here is her vocal lead, telling us to move the right leg up while she moves her left one up.  This happens periodically and if you happen to have your face in the floor and not on the screen, you will get confused while striving to perfect the form.
The best approach to new yoga is to watch it a couple of times, especially on the more challenging poses because you need to exact your pose in order to do the correct form, which is essential.  You can follow another instructor who does a less challenging form, but you may not always get a view of that person you need to watch.
The video is divided into two sections, 30 minutes of standing and 30 minutes of floor and finishing postures.
The sets are attractive, music is pleasing to the ear.  Give it a try!....MzRizz",1043539200,3,1219,4.5227272727272725
191873,4,1573309885,"Kathy Smith is not usually known for a spiritual side, so don't expect one here, just expect a very well done tape that will be easily split into one routine or two for maximum results.",1028505600,3,185,4.314285714285714
191874,5,1573309885,"I watched a yoga program on television & it looked like something I might want to try.  I have a herniated disc in my lower back and this particular program was too advanced for me.  However, it spurred me into going to the video store to see what else was out there.  Years ago, I bought one of Kathy's fitness tapes, so when I saw that she had a yoga tape, I knew that I would like it.  She knows how to make a video that is easy for people to use.  After ""working out"" with Kathy, I saw that a problem between my shoulder blades (that can only be corrected by a chiropractor), was corrected.  I found that I couldn't do the ""upward dog"", because of my herniated disc, so I just skip that exercise.  I still have a great workout & I start breaking into a sweat when I don't feel that I've done anything.  After working out to this tape, I feel good & I can see that it is what I need to ""stretch out my body"".",1017878400,9,911,3.994475138121547
191875,5,1573309885,"I just began doing yoga and this is my favourite tape. I do it just about every day and I improve everytime I do the tape. I began to feel better almost immediately and see physical improvement in 2 weeks. The pace is good. The instructions are clear. Variations for different levels are demonstrated. This has allowed me to ""grow"" with the tape by doing more challenging variations with my ""strong"" muscle groups while still working lower levels on ""weaker"" areas. I recommend using the ""New Yoga for Beginners"" first, to get the most from this tape but it is definately a purchase I am glad I've made.",995760000,6,603,4.592592592592593
191876,4,1573309885,"This was the first yoga tape I bought, and I have enjoyed it immensely.  Even though I've had it for almost a year and a half and consider this my 'easy tape,' I still find the sun salutations series challenging and it always gets my heart rate up.
Smith does a good job of explaining the moves, poses and technique so you know what you're doing.  I've loaned it to several people who have expressed an interest in Yoga but didn't know where to start.  If you're new to Yoga or want a good basic workout to perfect your form and moves, this is a great tape!",984355200,4,557,4.186915887850467
191877,4,1573309885,"If you find the concept of yoga interesting, but you aren't sure about the spiritual aspects, or if you are just confused by the different types, then New Yoga is for you!  I have several yoga tapes, but I constantly come back to this one because it is a nice balance of styles and difficulty, It doesn't delve deeply into the spiritual aspects of yoga, which are important but often scare away the beginner.  A good video for a first look at yoga.  Try it, you'll like it!",969580800,17,473,4.3522727272727275

7798170,5,1573309885,"I rate anything by Kathy Smith as excellent.  Her work out audio and video
tapes are easy to understand and easy to use.  She takes quite a bit of
care in everything of hers I've used to make sure the client does NOT
hurt him/herself.  This is important in any sport, but especially so in Yoga,
in which serious damage can be done by over exertion.  I appreciate the
time she spends making sure everyone is clear verbally and physically by using
demonstrations by students of different levels.  I really like this tape.",1360108800,,519,4.537634408602151
7798171,2,1573309885,I returned it.  I found her instructions hard to follow while exercising.  Didn't have very good  flow from one part to another.,1354406400,,128,4.7272727272727275
7798172,2,1573309885,"This DVD is labeled ""intermediate"", HOWEVER the most challenging pose on the disc is the Eagle. No arm balances, inversions, or anything beyond the most basic back bend/bridge.

Other things I do not like about this DVD:
-Throughout the practice the camera light filters change so it goes from color to b/w to black and yellow/orange and other shades of colors. This I find distracting, visually unappealing, and pointless. The camera is also repeatedly tilted at odd angles.
-Not all the names of the poses are specified.
-Switches between Kathy's live voice instruction and a voice over. When the voice over is on it switches between Kathy's and Rod's voices. This is confusing.
-In several shots views of Kathy and company are partially obstructed by set pieces.
-One of the sun salutations is shown in slow motion for no apparent reason.
-In one scene we see only Kathy's head as she explains and demonstrates a pose.
-The set is ugly. It is indoors but pretends to be outdoors. It's supposed to look like a beach or something on a clear day, however the set is rather dim and much in shadow with what looks like a spotlight moving around randomly.

This being said, it's not a bad DVD for beginners. There is a long introduction which talks about basic yoga safety and how to protect the spine in both forward and back bends. The instruction throughout the DVD is fairly detailed. There are three other people besides Kathy demonstrating modified versions of poses.

I do not recommend this DVD for intermediate yogis as you will most likely be bored and disappointed.",1333065600,,1573,4.797047970479705
7798173,5,1573309885,"Years ago I bought a yoga video tape by Kathy Smith and loved it.  When I decided to get back into practicing yoga, I went on-line to order DVDs and saw this one by Kathy Smith.  Once it arrived, I realized it was the exact same one as my old video tape.  That's ok.  I like it, and now I don't have to rewind the tape in the VCR.  :)",1328400000,,334,3.7142857142857144
7798174,5,1573309885,"In spite of the New Age-y production (which seems like a requirement - don't know why) this program is well presented and Kathy does a good job offering adjustments for students at different stages of their practice. It can be a tough workout... or a good relaxer at the end of the day, depending on your needs.",1313625600,,311,4.473684210526316
7798175,5,1573309885,"Kathy Smith does a great job of combining easier poses with more challenging ones. I've had ""New Yoga"" for many years, but I never tire of it. I think it is a beneficial workout for novice, intermediate, and advanced students of yoga.",1122768000,4,234,4.595238095238095
7798176,4,1573309885,"This was my first yoga tape, and I still pull it out on occasion.  It is challenging for beginners and provides a nice balanced sequence of postures for more mid-range practitioners when feeling less motivated.  Although it's clear that Kathy Smith isn't exactly a yoga guru, she does a good job of ensuring there is a focus on breathing and body awareness.  There are three other yoginis in the background doing the postures with various degrees of difficulty.  Of interest, Charlotte from Sex & the City is one of them.  But there is also a man and an older, grey-haired woman!  Way to go for addressing age and gender, Kathy!",1095120000,7,628,4.663636363636364
