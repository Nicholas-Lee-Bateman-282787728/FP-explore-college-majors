8135126,4,B000GYI27S,"This is not what I'd consider an ""educational"" video - Master West doesn't spend a lot of time discussing the principles or fine details of the techniques and generally shows each one only two or three times with no different angles or close ups. That's not necessarily a bad thing though.

In general, I don't think there are a lot of videos out there that people can really ""learn"" an art from - they can, of course, get new ideas, reinforce existing concepts, or use them as a reference for material covered in classes. Students with a decent background in the art can pick up supplemental ideas and variations from videos.

This video is, however, a good technique ""catalog"". The first part covers a selection of different locking techniques (about 7 or 8 different ones) and then shows them in different situations (grabs, punches, etc). The second part shows defenses against attacks using a rope (belt) and cane. Master West shows the techniques fairly slowly and clearly. Compared to other styles of Hapkido, there were very few distracting strikes, not a great degree of unbalancing shown, and the footwork was fairly static (not a lot of circular footwork shown).

As mentioned before, the techniques are shown quickly, with little supporting dialogue or camera angles. It really seems to be a quickly made video designed to provide a quick-and-easy reference for techniques that Master West teaches - not an all-encompassing educational video with every nuance shown and described. As such, for students who have a background in Hapkido, there shouldn't be any real surprises and this will probably be very useful for review. For a fairly short video (30 minutes), there is a lot of material on here that is clear and precise - this is a very worthy addition to any Hapkido library.",1342569600,,1793,4.910891089108911
8135127,5,B000GYI27S,"The overall quality of instruction on this DVD is very good. I'm very happy with the inclusion of rope/belt techniques, as it is not easy to find good material covering this aspect of HKD.

The techniques are clearly demonstrated and described, and repeated several times for the benefit of the viewer. The audio and video quality could at times be better, but the instruction does not suffer under it.

There are no freeze-frames, CGI, or slo-mo effects in the DVD, and very few camera zooms. Everything is filmed from one camera angle, with emphasis on illustrating the whole body movement. Individual technical detail is explained rather than filmed - this may work better for people with MA experience than for complete beginners.",1197504000,3,734,5.008196721311475
8135128,5,B000GYI27S,"First of all, I'm not a student of Grand Master JR West.  I recommend that you buy all 3 volumes of this series.  GM West is an excellent teacher. He demonstrates how to perform the techniques in different angles, speeds and occasional close ups when it's needed.  He shows you different ways to perform the techniques.  GM West expands on each one of the Techniques.  For every technique he shows you, he gives you additional pearls on how not to perform them, which pressure points or vital points to apply, how to pivot correctly, and follow through on each technique.  He's a very good teacher and it shows in his students both in this series and in the 2005 North Austin Hapkido seminar DVD.  Finally, I hope there's more DVDs in the works.

Volume One has 30 Joint Locking techniques, 11 Rope techniques, and 11 Cane Techniques.

Volume Two has 10 Military techniques, 8 Ki Strikes, and 9 Speed Takedown techniques.

Volume Three has 12 Carrying techniques, 12 Chokes, 15 Kick Defense techniques.",1163289600,5,1002,4.7398843930635834
