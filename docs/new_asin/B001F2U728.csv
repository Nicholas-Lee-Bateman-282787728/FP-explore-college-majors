It strays a bit from stereotypical anime and has you rooting for a killer. The music and animation are phenomenal.",1228435200,2,287,4.76
3563713,5,B001F2U728,"This is a superb story. The characters are incredible, the animation top quality and the development of all the characters is phenomenal. They even poke fun of the more fringe elements of their own genre.",1518912000,,204,4.857142857142857
3563714,5,B001F2U728,"This is a great series. it leaves of lots questions unanswered, but it is entertaining all the way through. if you like action, hints of romance  and the blurring lines of right and wrong with a touch of esoteric topics, you'll like it.",1518739200,,236,4.488372093023256

3563716,4,B001F2U728,"Cool name, cool song (for awhile), cool show, it's a winner.

I find anime can get way too weird way too fast for me to enjoy a lot of it. Darker Than Black did well to stay ""grounded"" in intrigue and drama despite there being super powers and metaphysical nonsense to contend with.

This was more like a crime and spy thriller than the predictable fantasy formula I've seen before. I liked this, even if some of the plots are obvious knock-offs of other stories, (Heroes, Firestarter, etc) and campy elements still find places to shine (or not).

Wish there was more anime like this.",1517961600,,584,4.542857142857143

3563722,4,B001F2U728,"I love this series, so I was going to be happy with this regardless. Blu-ray quality was great, and the book provided inside was a wonderful addition for a fan.

I saw another reviewer mention the weak quality of the dossier type package. Sadly, I'd have to agree. The case closes by wrapping a string around an anchor on the back. After wrapping it twice, the little anchor just fell off :(",1515456000,,391,4.430555555555555
3563733,5,B001F2U728,"If you are a big fan of DTB, don't forget to find short DTB manga series (drawing style is slightly different from the anime though) that explains STORIES BETWEEN season1 and season2.",1515456000,,183,4.75
3563734,4,B001F2U728,"I really liked this anime and was super stoked that I could get access to it via a trial Anime Strike subscription. Loved the main character, Hei (or BK-201). As many other reviewers, I quickly found drawn to his persona wanting to unravel his story as the larger encompassing storyline unfolded.

Just to give the gyst of things - The show takes place a decade after an astrological anomaly called Hells Gate appeared completely altering the sky and land. In its wake, two categories of people with special powers emerged- contractors and dolls. Hei is part of a team that works under the Syndicate. Various countries and organizations use contractors and dolls in for different purposes, such as spying and assassinations, which certainly contributes to the intrigue of the show.

Hei is a mystery as far as contractors go. Unlike most contractors who are shrewd and coldly rational, Hei maintains a piece of his humanity. This is evidenced by his behaviors towards his teammates and his longing for his sister.

A lot happens throughout Season 1. I don't want to give anything away. If you're into multifaceted anime shows, which included a combo of genres such as Sci-fi, Mystery, and Action all wrapped into one, then I strongly suggest checking this gem out.",1511654400,3,1264,4.924882629107981

3563736,3,B001F2U728,"Honestly I fell asleep watching this . The action is spare, andthe characters not that interesting. Too many scenes are dominated by the sound of footsteps.  Clip clop.  Has some good points, but, the director of this series has some impressive movies on his list, not sure what I'm missing here.  I guess it's for the character development, but I like humor and action.  To each their own.",1499212800,,390,4.6911764705882355

3563741,5,B001F2U728,"Just to note, for anyone who says the series doesn't take enough time for character development, I recommend this to you: continue watching all the way through. The one way I like that this series handles things as it has a good balance of moving along the story and building your understanding of characters as you go along. Action, plot, good story, all main good elements mixed in perfectly.

This has been one of my most favorite series I have seen out of the different anime out there. I wish Amazon had the series to purchase, I have it offline already but this series is totally worth it to buy if you want to download it direct from Amazon instead of looking for it. I haven't viewed this version on Amazon yet though so not sure if it has subtitles during the theme music or not. I'm honestly not sure if a versions out there with subtitles for the theme music but no worries either way, the musics awesome!

You won't get all the background story for the side characters but you will get a bunch for the main characters. Amazon is missing one middle season for this series containing episodes in between season 1 and season 2 where Hei (I'm not for sure how to spell his name) and Yin run off together. I initially watched season 2 without watching this in between season but honestly you can watch season 1 and go straight into season 2 without watching the in between but it will make more sense entering season two after watching it. I don't know the english name for the middle series honestly, only the Japanese name which I don't remember at the moment. I'd recommend if you want to watch this series trying an anime site outside of Amazon to track down all the side episodes you may have missed out on.

All in all, very well done series, excellent all the way through : )",1474934400,,1789,4.415151515151515

3563753,3,B001F2U728,"Having the entire first season (the only season, let's be honest) on blu ray is certainly nice. The quality is there for the video aspect and its subbed and dubbed for both parties. My only problem is the packaging: it's set up like a manila envelope and feels a bit flimsy. The worst part is the fact that it doesn't fit in with the rest of your blu ray collection since it's rather large. Don't get me wrong, the envelope and setup is neat, but I would have appreciated a steelbook case much more.",1470787200,2,499,4.319148936170213

3563762,5,B001F2U728,"A wonder full series complemented by a wonderful Limited editions. Funimation Still needs to work on the quality of their limited editions, as this is the second limited edition that i have had that arrived damaged... granted i am not to entirely sure that Funi is responsible for the damage that may have resulted from Amazon shipping it with 3 other products 1 of which was over 20 pounds. However they are responsible for the fact that there is too much space that is unused in the envelope that it comes in. the book is supposed to go into the paper Blu-Ray Sleeve and that leaves a ton of room in the envelope. I fixed this issue by throwing an MaximumPC mag into the envelope to fill it out. works great and reduces the stress on the edges. another thing is that the string tie came off, my fault... though i thought the thing would hold up better. needless to say ONLY wrap the string around the string tie once to prevent this. either way wonderful limited edition new we need an Limited edition of season 2 and the OVAs",1453161600,,1028,4.41578947368421

3563774,3,B001F2U728,"A very good series for its time, but certainly flawed. The distinction here is that the only way to get HD video in this region is to pay-up and toss a ton of packaging.  Years ago I ripped every CD I own to .wav files, and crated off every shiny disc to a deep spot in the basement, where it will stay if my IP rights are ever questioned.  I've struggled to do the same with Anime, but WHY the need for garbage when downloading or streaming is so viable.  In this series of two seasons, the second can be purchased in iTunes; why the need for plastic that's on its way out as we speak?",1449360000,,586,4.0344827586206895

- Amazing anime
- Beautiful crisp and vibrant HD transition from DVD.
- Nice, full page - glossy page art book

- Impractical packaging design that's a bit awkward to display.
- Redudant art cards (they're nice but thin)
- Cheap Packaging.",1445731200,,250,4.659090909090909

3563778,2,B001F2U728,"The series is very interesting. Quite in the ""Stein's Gate"" style but with magic and much more battles, and you won't understand anything (it's not like that, but it's too many ""why""s) until the middle of the season (it keeps you intrigued though).
So one thing about packaging (I don't mean amazon's packaging or delivery, it's about the way the ""premium edition"" book/diskholder itself is composed). People say it's a joke. Well, it's not a joke, it's a disaster. They literally glued disks themselves to the package (and that's not that i'm very unlucky, the package designed the way that it's extremely easy to stain a disk with glue inside the book). When I opened the box I wasn't able to move 2nd disk at all. When I finally got it it was all in glue. It seems that it's working after cleaning but the quality of all these ""premium edition"" perks is questionable (yeah, you could easily tear picture cards when you try to get them, cards holder is very unpractical too).",1442793600,21,977,4.6531791907514455

3563780,2,B001F2U728,"I hope there will be standard version of this set out soon.  The series is wonderful, but Funimation has really screwed up big time with the packaging.  It comes in a thin paperboard envelope that is way to big to fit on any shelf, and a stupid ""easel"" to display it on- who in the world stores their anime on an easel?  Seriously, who has space for that?  I store mine in a shelf, and this is a big, flat, awkward size for that.  I like the artbook, but the cover is very thin and flimsy and I would rather buy it separately with a sturdy cover than this way.  Also, the discs themselves fit into cutouts in the paperboard ""folder"", why couldn't there be a decent hard plastic case?  With a nice, thicker artbox?  This packaging is horribly cheap and will never hold up to repeated opening and closing, and the discs will probably scratch if stored this way.  For something labeled as ""premium"" I expect a lot better quality than this, especially at this price.  I hope Funimation is coming out with a standard BD set that comes in an actual case, so people who love this series won't have to buy it at this price with such crappy materials.  There are plenty of other ""premium"" sets that actually LOOK premium, and while they can be expensive at least you know where your money went.  Calling this set ""premium"" is a joke, and this great series deserves so much better than this.  Come on, Funimation, you can do better than this!",1441411200,8,1432,4.399239543726236
3563781,5,B001F2U728,"Not only is this a great anime but the packaging was awesome. This edition included an art work book, some post card art, and the dvds all inside a black envelope like the ones the characters are given for missions in the anime. For a fan of the series its pretty cool to have or a great gift idea. The story for season one is a good one with a complete plot and lots of action. There is a season two but its just a continuation storyline so don't feel like you're missing out by not getting season two. There is no cliffhanger ending here. I personally didn't care for season two as much but season one is a must watch. The dub work is good as well as the artwork. The story deals with some paranormal powers and assassins, has action/humor parts to lighten the serious nature of the story. Nothing romantic happens, no fan service stuff.",1439942400,,839,4.3164556962025316

3563783,5,B001F2U728,I had already previously written a review for Darker Than Black S1 in the Classics Line because I loved it so much. Phenomenal anime series.

3563787,5,B001F2U728,"Seriously can't believe no one's buying this Anime. Darker Than Black is most definitely one of the greatest, underrated animes of this time. Each character has great depth to them, the story is great, and if you don't like reading subtitles, the dub is MUCH better than most Anime. I won't say too much about what goes on in the show, because I feel most have already elaborated on that more than I can. What I will talk a little bit about is the product itself: the casing is good. I really like the folder that it came in, and all of the extra content such as the cards (though pretty fragile), and art book. The only problem I have with this release is the fact that it didn't come with a separate, smaller blu-ray casing, so you wouldn't have to keep the discs in the folder. It's not THAT big, but it might cause a slight inconvenience when it comes to you placing it in that perfect spot. Other than that, not much more to complain about. I'm sure most people will be able to find an alternative to that issue. Anyways, great Anime for a GREAT price considering all the extras that come with it.",1432944000,2,1102,4.328502415458937
3563788,3,B001F2U728,"Quality of the blu-rays is fantastic but the packaging is a joke. The folio the package comes in is 8.5x11 so it is not going to be fitting on any of your anime shelves. The 3 discs are held in by only paper sleeves and were loose when I opened mine. I would recommend waiting until the non-premium version releases, or stare at this oversized eyesore in your collection",1432684800,50,370,4.3768115942028984
3563789,5,B001F2U728,"Wow, was all I can say when I popped this blu ray into my player. I immediately took it out and put the DVD version in just to see the difference. There's really not much I can say about this wonderful series that hasn't already been said other than how gorgeous it is in blu ray. If you're a fan of Darker than Black, don't hesitate and just buy it. Oh, like most recent releases, you'll have to select the audio in the menu screen as it won't let you change it once it's playing. Also, the subtitles are hard not soft.

It does come with a very nice art book and 4 pretty cheap postcards. By cheap, it's very flimsy and can easily get bent if not too careful.

Extras included are episode commentaries for 2, 9, 13, 16, 22, 26, cast auditions, production artwork - characters and settings, U.S. trailer, trailers and textless songs for both openings and ending songs.

I did take 2 pictures just to show how big this box is, which is nice for the art book but hard to put next to your blu ray / DVD collection. The thickness of the box is about the same as a DVD. As it is, I took out the 3 blu ray discs and put it with my season 2 collection. Now all 5 blu ray discs is in one place while the 3 dvds from season 2 is now housed in the oversized box.",1431907200,10,1253,4.024096385542169

3563793,4,B001F2U728,"Darker than Black season 1 can stand alone, however season 2 adds some back story and more in depth information on the contractors as well as other secret organizations. The series is geared towards a more mature audience with dark imagery, blood, mystery and intriguing characters. If you are looking for an original story with paranormal elements Darker than Black is an excellent fit. The story follows a group of characters with paranormal powers that work for a secret organization who's real objective is not what it appears to be. The show moves along at a nice pace, with few areas that seem to drag, but in return provides needed information pertaining to the story arcs. here is a hint of romance, some comedy that is not over the top goofy, and some tragedy that leaves some impression. Darker than Black is an entertaining show with some foul language, minor risque imagery, some blood and gore and a story line structured around adult themes of politics, crime, secrets and the mysterious of Hell's Gate that are hidden from the public.
Characters develop well especially the ""dolls"" which their evolution is essential to the overall story. Contractors each have special abilities that differ from other contractors, and those abilities have a price which often has something to do with a habit or bad habit the contractor had while human. The show leaves a few questions unanswered, but wraps things up nicely in the end.",1426118400,3,1435,4.909465020576132

DTB Season One is a great addition to any anime collection with it's intense fights, great character and engaging plot that keeps your mind working throughout every episode as you try to keep up.

The fact that the lead character has his own theme music, gets me every time. I love that something will be happening, and you wonder if he is ever going to come,and then BAM! that theme music starts and its so COOOL!!

Before I watched this season I watched the second season, which I do not recommend for most people because I don't think that it is worth the money. But for those who do you will not be spoiled from it.
First off I have to say the characters are great. Especially the main protagonist, Hei (I hope this is how its spelt), or BK-201. What makes him so good is the show never gives you a straight explanation of him until the end, and its cool to see him manipulate every one around him with his good guy cover, and then turn back to the assassin. I want go into the rest of the cast but there are many other great characters. There was a character in the show that I did find annoying a few times but I also enjoyed this character in many moments of the show.
Another great thing about this show is how the episodes are layout. They are pretty episodic but at the same time they all lead to the end.
If I have one complaint about the show it is that I wished they made the end longer then two episodes. It felt rushed, and I fill that if they just took out two of the body episodes made the end span between four episodes instead of two it could have been just a bit more epic. also there was a slight dues ex machana in the end but it wasn't bad and was satisfying.",1400716800,,1541,4.072368421052632

Even some of the least likable characters allow you to see some good in them--ironic, because most of the characters are contractors, who are supposed to have suppressed emotions and only fend for themselves. The blend of humor with serious drama (and action) is well-played. I enjoyed every episode in this first season, including the bonus episode made for the DVD.

The series is stretched out to a full 25 episodes which lets them really craft the story. Aside from some of the characters having ""magical"" powers, the storyline and the situations are more realistic than most other anime. The character arcs are believable and well thought out. Also, this anime was a completely solo series as it was not based off of any manga. This makes for a refreshing change of pace. Instead of being rushed through the series, only to be greeted by confusing new characters or  plot twists towards the end, DTB walks you through with a steady pace.  There is a slight twist at the end, but it's believable and easy to understand if you pay attention to the details. All in all, a great show.

3563867,5,B001F2U728,"Darker Than Black was not an anime I'd ever watched up until recently. It just didn't sound interesting so I never really went out of my way to watch it. I can admit I was wrong. I'm not going to address anything plot specific, because this is an excellent series (specifically this season, although the second is still good but can be confusing without viewing the OVA's to bridge the gap).

The animation is top notch, and there are many excellent action scenes. I'd recommend this series on style alone. Every character is unique within this world, even those with short lived parts to play. The characters change throughout, some subtly and some in more pronounced ways. The dynamic between Huang, Hei and Yin is interesting to watch develop. Hei himself, specifically in this season, has probably become one of my favorite characters. His reactions to the situations he finds himself in, death, and his goals and how other affect them is never overstated. This anime doesn't spend a lot of time in exposition, important things are often expressed in fleeting looks.

The story is way out there in a sci-fi kind of way. It is strange, but somehow they manage to make it seem normal within the confines of the story. I honestly can say I'm not a huge fan of that sort of sci-fi, but this series may have changed that.

It all builds to a head, and culminates in an ending that really stuck with me. I really wish I could get into why, but I'd rather not give anything away.

As for season 2, go read the reviews, they are all pretty spot on. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did.",1349913600,,1585,4.512195121951219

I'll rate the show out of 50 points on 5 categories: Plot, Animation, Characters, Cohesion, Basic Rating

Plot: 9.5/10
I really like the plot of this show.  It's dark, gritty, and makes you think about human society and its ideals.  It has all the basic points for a great plot.  Drama, action, love/friendship, great character development, controversy, and a whole heap of angst (in a good way).  I really don't want to give away too much, so suffice to say, if you're into magic/demon powers, good fight scenes, drama, and great story, you'll LOVE this.  I'd give it  a 9.8 out of 10 if it weren't so darn confusing for the first disc (it's not bad, but a lot of things happen pretty quickly, and you'll have to remember stuff they tie in from previous episodes to connect things).

Animation: 10/10
This anime really blew me out of the water.  The motion is so smooth and pretty.  It almost makes me a little sad that it's so dark, because the attention to detail is amazing.  The subtle shifts in expressions, the shadows, smoke, play of light and dark... everything is exquisitely played out to perfection.  I can't praise it enough for just how beautiful everything is.

Characters: 10/10
You'll grow to like a lot of the characters in the show.  They have a great diversity and display of characters, and though some are a little cliche, they all play a part to bring the world some color.  Hei, Mao and Yin will become characters that make you smile when you see them (well, maybe Yin will make you sad at first...).  Mao has to be my favorite character.  He's a black cat, and he has some of the best lines in the show.

Cohesion: 9/10
Each episode is a 2 parter (and generally has a theme), so the continuity between them is always perfect.  Between the doubles is still good, but they don't really have much to do with each other.  So if you jump in to it (after leaving it for a while) without starting from the previous episode, you'll be confused as heck.  Other than that, the episodes play very well into the next.

Basic Rating: 10/10
This is a catch all for the other things that aren't mentioned in the other categories.  I have nothing to add to this, but I really like the show a lot!

I was quite literally in love by the second episode and at least captivated after the first. The animation itself if very clean and detailed, and the episodic nature of the anime is really well done. In fact it probably makes it better as you never get bored with all the new missions that they receive. There are about 2 episodes dedicated to each little story piece, with everything culminating into one final story at the end of the show over the last several episodes that really pulls it altogether. That being said, this is the kind of anime that at the end leaves you with quite a few questions. Thankfully several of these are answered to an extent in the OVAs and Season 2 leaving only a handful left after all is said and done. I have my fingers crossed that one day they'll make at least one last season to tie all the loose ends, but all in all Darker Than Black is fantastic and will most likely remain my favorite.

All in all, it's presentation lends itself nicely to some themes such as change or evolution. The fight scenes are thrilling and the main character is a likable anti-hero.

3563904,5,B001F2U728,"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ The Huge Anime Fan blog: http://wp.me/p4tvXf-x ~

Darker Than Black was one of the anime watches you sometimes stumble on and don't realize until later is pretty fantastic. Going in there were no expectations since there wasn't anything to go by. It was completely new. From our introduction to the world of Darker Than Black. Soon, you are brought up to speed on what's going on. In what's considered the world everyone lives in a few years back The Gates started to appear turning groups of regular everyday people into something other than human. They became either contractors, medatoriums, and or dolls. All of which, who aren't exactly entirely human.  It's a really intriguing premise which delivers finely throughout the series.

All the plethora of contractors, medatoriums, and dolls can be highly pinpointed by regular people by how they act in a complete rational plain of thought which alters their view of the world. Afterwards, in these various groups there are even more various differences. Contractors being at the top of the hierarchy have different range of powers that they can access after completing unique obsessive tasks.  The cost of using your contractor abilities is your obsessive task that is different for every contractor. Varying from smoking a cigarette to undressing in public.

The contractors are always coming across in various situations because of their connection to The Gates. They are set apart from human society even though they are human. Well sometimes. It's complicated but it's what is so fascinating. Contractors come off as dangerous for their abilities which they are but also hilarious in their rational way of interacting with their surroundings. Also on various occasions well aware of their powers they will allow themselves to be hired to be assassins for wealthy governments or organizations. Only making them seem cruel killers to society at large.

There is widespread gossip about a contractor that is something of an enigma to even regular contractors. The Black Reaper who's real name is really Hei.

Moving into the characters, Hei, is the main character that has a lot to do with the story. We are first introduced to him through a plethora of events that seem random but are, in fact, part of bigger plot in how The Gates exist and conspiracy. Yes, Hei is basically a contractor but as it turns out he's unique. He doesn't act at all like other contractors most of the time. This surprises most other contractors. Throughout the events in Darker Than Black he is after the truth of what really happened in his past during a war involving contractors. His sister died during this war. Leaving him resenful and enraged. As he searches he finds a bigger hidden conspiracy connected to The Gates that include The Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate that will affect everyone.

Now, for those of you interested in some romance in your anime there are instances of romance but they are subtle. Hei cares for a doll named Yin. She has an appearance of a petite skinny girl that is almost catatonic but don't let that fool you she's something else. She almost always helps Hei on his assignments that turn out to be dangerous. The romance in Darker Than Black isn't huge in this anime but it is there. The sequel to Darker Than Black: Ryusei no Gemini  (English Translation: The Twins of the Meteor) continues the story of Hei and Yin's romance a little and brings in a new cast of characters with a new adventure. Further events are mentioned in Darker Than Black: Gaiden which is Season 3 of Darker Than Black. It's an in-between of events that transpired during Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Twins of the Meteor.

It's important to note that this anime is very dark. While things have a tiny sense of hope there is a very tragic or more dystopian tone.

You can read other reviews, and by scrolling up you can read the plot and storyline of this anime, Im just here to tell you why you should buy this series.
Darker than Black has a perfect blend of action, mystery/suspense, and alittle bit of love/romance mixed in. **SPOILER**  The only thing I did not like was the ending to this anime. Im a closure kind of girl, so I like all the loose ends to a story tied up with a bow on top. Darker than black was deff. an open ended ending. It had you guessing what would happen next, and to bad for you because you were never going to find out.. Well of course now there is season 2 that will be released in October of 2011, so I guess I don't mind so much now. I look forward to seeing season 2 and hopefully having all my questions answered and all the ends tied up.
Other than a open ended ending, the animation, fights, voice actors, music, everything about this anime is close to perfection. I would recommend it for anyone who liked/loved FMA, D. Grayman and Blue Exorcist. I would suggest it to ages 15+ due to some of the killings are gruesome, and what some of the characters have to do as a ""payment"" may not be the best for the little ones to see.

3563922,4,B001F2U728,"With stimulating action and well-developed characters, I would like to rate the first season of Darker than Black higher.  Out of the two installments it is the best, but The Black Contractor suffers early on from its lack of explanation and episodic structure.  While a series like Bebop gets away with self-contained episodes, DtB is less successful due to essential questions being unaddressed, and a lack of a strong central antagonist.

 As we watch the first few episodes, a few queries raise their mysterious heads: what exactly ""are"" contractors?  Why do they exist? What's all this talk about ""old stars?"" Where did the Gates come from?  What is Hei's price?  Why is Kirihara so useless?  Some of these questions are answered, but others are just shunted aside to no effect but to confuse the viewer.

 The Black Contractor's 26 episodes  build characters slowly, but effectively, in a revelatory fashion via flashbacks.  Characters who are initially neutral and even antagonistic (Huang, for instance) become sympathetic in time.  Perhaps one of the largest early pitfalls is the lack of a recurring antagonist.  An action anime needs a strong enemy to maintain structure and sense of direction, and all of the early contractors are killed by Hei at the end of each episode.  This gives each episode a sense of self-containment which runs against the feeling that a larger story is being unveiled, and did not encourage me to continue watching.  Furthermore, many of the new supporting characters are also similarly neutralized, leaving the core four: Hei, Mao, Yin, and Huang, with Kirihara dancing in the background.  With the entrance of November 11, July, and others, The Black Contractor picks up steam and purpose, but the series lacks a charismatic villain throughout, and consequently suffers.

 However, I'm glad I stuck with it; The Black Contractor is a good watch, and one that will stand up to a second viewing.  If you're looking for smooth, dynamic action scenes, strong characters, and an overall intriguing plot, give The Black Contractor a shot.",1309651200,,2073,5.094955489614243

Except it's about something falling from the sky that caused some humans to obtain a certain power, but with each power, there is a price that needs to be paid each time it is used.  There is a total of 3 seasons (from what I've been told), but so far, I've only seen two.  Season 2 is ok.  It's not bad, but it could've been better...and longer.

3563925,5,B001F2U728,"It seems lately there are fewer and fewer anime series being brought to the US.  Part of this is due to ADV closing their doors.  Funimation seems to be the last company consistently bringing over anime (Bandai having issues too).

So while there are several good quality series around, there have not been many 'blockbuster' series like Fullmetal ALchemist (I don't count Brotherhood since it is not a 'new' series).  So imagine my surprise and delight when I dove into this series!

I won't give out any plot, let's just say that the story is intriguing.  The characters are complex and the main character a guy neither good nor bad.  If you like semi-sci-fi storylines, than this is going to appeal to you.  The series progresses very much like Cowboy Bebop or Witch Hunter Robin: stand alone episodes (or two part episodes) that are not really building off one another, but generally building towards a final conclusion (unlike a series like Gundam or DragonBall Z which each episode is a continuation of the last).

Overall the animation quality is good, but not as good as series have been in the past (budgets and all).  Some scenes feature top quality animation and shading whereas others appear to be produced by third parties (as is often done toady - many studios hire Korean animation firms to produce many scenes - at lower quality than more expensive Japanese animators).

I still give it five stars because despite the few minor issues it is a brilliant, somewhat original series that will keep the viewer well engaged.  Highly recommended!

3563928,5,B001F2U728,"This series can be enjoyed on 2 different levels which is necessary for most shows and animes especially so they can move beyond a single category. Darker than Black follows a group of people working for ""The Syndicate"" completing various missions.

Your main characters are Hei, Yin, Mao, and Huang. Each one of them has special powers except for Huang their supervisor. The character development is done through stories about each characters life and past. And the missions gradually began to reveal the true mystery of the series and what exactly the syndicate wants to accomplish.

Okay so now time to discuss the packaging and product itself. This comes packaged in a single dvd case that contains 25 episodes on 4 dvds. This is different from the volume release of Darker Than Black that had 6 single volume releases. The artwork for the dvds in my opinion was great and that would be my only complaint about this release, maybe better artwork on the cover or inside the case.

What is the Syndicate and what is Hei's real motivation?

The first time I started watching this series was on the computer when I was really tired. I thought it was kind of interesting, but when I stopped watching, I forgot to go back and finish it. A few years later I found it had been released on DVD, so I thought it was time to check it out again. I was completely blown away. I was hooked from the first episode and every episode after. Every time I had to stop watching it to go to bed, I would be disappointed. I spent the day eager to get home and watch some more. I was worried at one point that when the secrets were starting to be revealed, I might be disappointed and not enjoy the show as much. But I worried in vain, 'cause it stayed good all the way through the end.

The thing that makes this series awesome is the way the mystery is handled. The many mysteries I should say, are woven perfectly into the plot of each episode. The episodes start out separate, but connected, and become more and more connected as the series progresses. The excellent story is supported by interesting characters and concepts - I really love how the Contractors were dubbed Contractors because they contract for their power. So every time they use their power, they must pay a price after. The prices don't make much sense, such as the guy who needed to smoke a cigarette after using his freezing power. Hei is a very competent and cool character, one of my favorite anime characters yet (and I've watched lots of anime).

Darker Than Black is a puzzle. You spend the series putting each piece into place, and when you finish, you find that while you have solved the puzzle, it is but part of a larger puzzle that you don't get to see completed. I liked it that way, but if you are the sort of person who wants the story to finish with all of the questions answered and all of the loosed ends tied up, then prepare for disappointment. And if you think that the second season will give you satisfaction, think again.

If you enjoy sci-fi/fantasy stories with great suspense, solid characters, action, and thrills, then give Darker Than Black a try - you won't be disappointed!

Review of the packaging 4/19/11:
I just received my copy of this set today. It is a single case with a cardboard sleeve cover and contains four discs on two of those detached disc holders thingys (you know what I mean - those plastic circular pieces in the center of a case that you can flip back and forth). This makes the case a little heavier and less balanced (not sure if the case is cheap or what, but my set arrived cracked at the spine of the case). I am not particularly fond of this style, I really prefer the two slim cased cases with two discs each and a box.

One thing I learned from my introduction into Japanese Animation is this: without a compelling story, no one will want to know more. After watching Volume 1 of Darker Than Black, it looks like I've found another story that piqued my interest.

Darker Than Black takes place in the not-too-distant future of Japan, where an area simply known as ""Hell's Gate"" is shrouded in secrecy. Once Hell's Gate appeared, the Contractors showed up soon after.

A Contractor is a person with a unique superpower such as levitation, electroshock or teleportation, among others. Each time their superpower is used, the Contractor must ""pay their price"" and complete an obsessive/compulsive action afterward such as eating a plant, dog-earing book pages, eating, smoking, or even breaking one's own fingers. Since they feel no guilt, Contractors are the perfect tools for spying and assassination.

Over the course of 5 episodes on this disc, we follow the adventures of a Contractor known as BK-201/Hei, living a double life as an exchange student called Li. He comes into contact with other Contractors, Dolls, government agencies, and much more. Japanese Animation usually leaps right into the storyline and explanations are revealed further down the road, and Darker Than Black is no exception. While nothing about Hei or his companions is fully explained, we are given just enough information to pique our curiosity and watch the next episode.

The animation was quite good - I included a few screen captures. There wasn't a lot of foul language (which I've come to expect in this genre of TV) but there are a few scenes of violence that are definitely not for young children - so the M.A. rating is appropriate here. Most of the translated dialogue flows well, but a few scenes didn't quite mesh. One example was the following:

(1) Spoken English: ""So you just moved to the city huh? Guess that explains the way you dress.""
(2) Subtitled English: ""Li-San, you're from China? Your Japanese is great.""

Now how about those DVD extras?

Within each episode, we can choose the scenes we want to watch, but for some reason there are two menus:

(1) The first menu allows us to choose between 4 chapters of the story.
(2) The second menu lets us choose the prologue, the opening song, the closing song, or the preview to the next episode.

Audio - choice of English or Japanese.

So what's the verdict?

I did enjoy my introduction to this series - it left me with a cliffhanger that begs to be followed up on. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any extra features for the Japanese actors/actresses or the series creators, I would have enjoyed hearing their thoughts.

As I mentioned previously, without a compelling story, no one will want to know more. After watching Darker Than Black, I definitely want to know more about what lies beyond the Gate. If you like Japanese Animation with plots that take a little while to play out, this is the show for you.",1250899200,9,3983,5.117103235747304
3563947,5,B001F2U728,"Some of my friends still haven't heard of this awesome shonen anime, ""Darker Than Black,"" which may be one of the best damn anime series I've ever seen.

Admittedly, it starts very mysteriously. A man is chased on the rooftops by some cops. Then the man makes the cops fly in the air. The man then disappears to another spot in the city, breaking his fingers. Then the man meets the hero of this anime, Hei, who kills the man.

It's a disconcerting opening to say the least. However, the anime gets better as it goes along. It turns out that Hei is a contractor, who bears the psychic powers to throw electric wires at his enemies.

He's a member of a syndicate of contractors. By day, however, he is a college student named Liu Xiansheng. In the first two story arcs on this DVD, he helps out two female contractors who are unaware of their powers.

The second story arc, ""The New Star Twinkles in the Dawn Sky,"" is really the spotlight of this series. Liu investigates the activities of Tahara, the sole survivor of the Hell's Gate incident, where the contractors obtained their abilities. Liu is also interested in Tahara's middle school daughter, Mai. She also has a mysterious thing inside her wrist...

This is an awesome anime, with some of the best choreographed fight sequences since ""Cowboy Bebop."" There's plenty of fast scenes with quite a bit of gore, but tons of excitement. And with Yoko Kanno behind the soundtrack, there's plenty of (surprise, surprise) fast jazz in the background, just like Bebop.

To say the least, ""Darker Than Black"" is one hell of a sleeper hit. I'm definitely keeping an eye out for this series.",1233446400,4,1636,4.643598615916955
3563948,4,B001F2U728,"I enjoyed ""Darker Than Black"" more than it likely deserves. Being that this only contains one disc, with only 5 episodes, it is hard to fully judge the series.

No spoilers from me, but the storyline is set in the near future, the Hell's Gate has opened and all of the stars in the sky have been replaced by fake stars that are representations of ""Contractors"". The episodes on the disc somewhat slowly bring us up to speed on the back story of beings with special abilities, like ""Contractors"" (remorseless assassins with special powers that come with a price), ""Dolls"" (basically blank humans who can be implanted with temporary memories/personalities or who can perform specific functions like remote sensing and observation), and some hybrids thrown into the mix as well.

There are several groups of players interacting, including a special police unit that tracks ""Contractors"", The Syndicate (including the main ""Contractor"" Hei/Bk201), various governments (references to French, Americans, and British spy agencies), and other criminal groups (all employing ""Contractors"").

As the storyline unfolds it becomes apparent that not all ""Contractors"" follow the stereotype and in the cliffhanger final episode, we learn something about Hei's motivation (again, no spoilers). It was enough of a hook that I will likely buy the next volume:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Vol-2/dp/B001K98M5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black, Vol. 2</a>

The animation was passable overall. It has some truly beautiful artwork in some scenes and some of the flattest animation in others. There was anime style blood and gore, but far less than I have come to expect.

Overall this is an interesting series, recommended for fans of the genre.",1231718400,6,1800,5.676579925650557
3563949,4,B001F2U728,"An area of paranormal space called Hell's Gate formed near Tokyo, around the time people with mysterious powers -- called ""contractors"" -- started appearing.

That's the concept behind the anime series ""Darker than Black."" While the concept -- mysterious people with dangerous psychic powers and a powerful young man hunting them -- doesn't sound terribly interesting on its own, the way it's handled makes it a truly memorable experience. Countless mysteries, solid writing and a bloodspattered noir atmosphere boost ""Darker than Black Volume 1"" above the norm.

Not many anime start with the anti-hero brutally killing someone -- Hei, a mysterious young man in a black coat and mask, hunts down and kills a blond man on a rooftop. Meanwhile, a young woman with a tragic past is being pursued by the police and a band of contractors, and her new neighbor Li -- who is pretty obviously Hei -- is her only hope for escaping them. Their goal seems to be a mysterious item that her boyfriend left with her, but is it their real objective... or are they really after Hei?

When Hei gets to his new job, he encounters a broken, reclusive scientist who once actually went into the Gate -- and the man's daughter, who seems to have fires pop up randomly around her. Hei befriends the girl as he tries to figure out if she's a contractor or a moratorium -- a contractor with uncontrollable powers. The answer to this puzzle lies inside her father's experiences inside the Gate....

And MI6 brings a mysterious woman -- a ""regressor"" named Havoc, who has lost her powers -- into Tokyo for research, along with a charming, brutal MI6 contractor named November 11. The police inspector Misaki Kirihara becoms embroiled with the struggle to get Havoc back, but the Syndicate have their own plans for her -- and Hei has information that he desperately wants from her.

""Darker than Black"" doesn't exactly spoil you with information -- in the first five episodes, it raises countless mysteries and bizarre questions while rarely answering them. We don't know who the evil contractors work for, what the Syndicate is, what phenomenon the Hell's Gate is, the nature of various governments' involvement, what those blue blobs on the power lines are, and where contractors come from, what they are, or even what will happen if they don't fulfill their compulsions.

Heck, we don't even know why one of Hei's buddies appears to be a talking cat. Just try to guess what's happening there.

So ""Darker than Black"" is a bit difficult to get into at first. Fortunately when taken alone, the episodes are brilliant -- murky storylines, unexpected twists and complications, and some bittersweet, poignant moments such as Mai and Hei's brief moments at a light-filled amusement park. But the superpowers also provide plenty of gore and horror -- peoples are sliced apart, burned up instantly, explode and are frozen solid -- and there's some delving into how people regard contractors.

Hei is as enigmatic as the backstory of this series -- on one hand, he's a ruthless ""black reaper"" who electrocutes and garrotes contractors, and seems to be a contractor himself. But he also shows compassion and sorrow for the non-contractors that he comes into contact with, and the fifth episode reveals a teeny tiny shred of backstory for our mysterious anti-hero. As for his pals in the Syndicate, we have yet to see much about them -- although the cool-headed policewoman is a cool, unusual character.

""Darker than Black"" is incredibly confusing at times, with lots of answers yet to be revealed. But the brilliant individual plots make this a pretty memorable experience.",1230508800,4,3640,4.924959216965743
3563950,3,B001F2U728,"THE STORY: ""Darker than Black"" is a dark science fiction tale that had the potential to be great.  However, instead of focusing on character, they use the characters as machines for exposition.  Instead of slowly developing the mythology or the characters, they'll have a character give a five minute long, awkward speech on their history or what it means to be a Contractor.  The mythology of the show is interesting, albeit a bit confusing from the way it's introduced.  It's a bit like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>, in that it's about characters with superpowers being pursued... but the lines between the Contractors (superpowers), the public, the FBI, and the random companies and groups that are introduced throughout the series are never really drawn, making a lot of the conflict a confusing mess.  It's not all bad, because out of the five episodes, I enjoyed the third and fourth ones, and found the character of  Yin to be fairly fascinating, both from her demeanor and from her power.  But this, I'm afraid, is a series that failed to hook me.  And one more thing... I'm not sure if this should go in the ""story section, because I don't know if the English dub used the original music... but what the heck?  The violent, dark, supposed-to-be-creepy sequences have jazz and the blues playing in the background, totally ruining the entire effect.  From the opening scene to a pretty cool showdown at the beginning of Episode Five, the music totally ruins all the tension.

THE ANIMATION: It ranges from great to awful.  There are some stunning images, but they are pretty spread out throughout the set.  There is a lot of lazy animation here, from the awkward way that characters walk, to the way that no one really moves in the background when a character walks into a store.  At the expense of making the animated world of ""Darker than Black"" a convincing one, the animators cut away the details.

THE DVD: With the animation and the story, at least there were a few things that I enjoyed.  The actual set-up of the DVD is by far the worst I've ever seen on any show.  I have no idea what Funimation was thinking when they made this disc, but it's horribly done.  They have individual episodes here, but instead of having a PLAY ALL function, all the episodes instead bleed into each other.  And with the format of a ""Darker than Black"" episode already being complex (Prologue - Opening - Story - Closing - Preview), it is very disarming when you first watch the episode and wonder what to do when it keeps going on and on through seemingly random things.  I've never had a DVD that has ever done that before.

OVERALL: I didn't hate the story, and I thought that episodes three and four were actually fairly entertaining... but I also wasn't impressed with the overall product.  There might be others who this would appeal to, but I will not be following this series.

3563951,4,B001F2U728,"Working with a better than average storyline, ""Darker Than Black"" is a cool science-fiction anime that pits Dolls against Contractors while both are pursued by the Police. Li Shengshun is the main Contractor, a college student kind of guy who is also a conscious less killer...or is he?

Li operates with a high-level group of assassins inside a future Tokyo. There was some sort of cataclysmic event that forced the city to be walled off, and the stars and planets replaced by false ones. When the false stars appear or disappear, it's the sign of birth or passing of a Contractor. No-one can come in or out, and the civilians are kept in the dark about Doll/Contractor existence by the Police.

For an Anime, this is pretty ambitious. There are no fairies or sword-warriors running about and no cutesie mascots (save for a Black Cat agent named Mao). ""Darker Than Blake"" is adult anime (but not [...]) with a decent backstory (the second episode toys with an explorer who survived an expedition - I think - beyond the gate). This is good stuff...and it has a kickin' theme song.",1230076800,2,1080,4.708994708994709

DTB is an action-packed, sci-fi, thriller that features thought-provoking dialogue about morality, destiny, and humanity. It mixes the bleak and gory with the light-hearted and funny. It begs the question of what it means to be human and the rights we have as such. And let's not forget the characters! I love how each of the characters developed throughout the story. I loved how human and relatable they felt and at times I was surprised at how attached I had become towards them. I totally recommend this anime!",1526428800,,629,4.7272727272727275
8300843,5,B001F2U728,"Darker than Black (DTB) seems to be a bit of an anime classic. Having watched all 26 episodes of Season 1 I would have to agree.
In the near future two gates appear. One in Japan and one in Brazil. Along with the gates two evolved tyoes of human have also arisen. Contractors who gain supernatural abilities and Dolls who can sense/seek items or people. Contractors have to pay a price for using their powers and are resolutely logical. Dolls seem to have all emotions removed and to be borderline apathetic. One of the gates, Heaven's Gate in Brazil. was destroyed in a mysterious series of events. The other gate, Hell's Gate, is being studied in Japan by an organisation called Pandora.
This is a story without heroes. The principal character goes by a number of names depending upon which side you're on. He is Messier Code BK201, or Hei, or Li, or the Dark Reaper. He is a contractor who doesn't pay a price and who works for a mysterious organization called the ""Syndicate"" and acts as an assassin/secret agent. He is supported by a team consisting of a doll, Yin, another contractor in the form of a talking cat (yes really) and Huang who is the conduit to the organisation. They are opposed by various contractors, the police and various secret services. The stories are broken up into small chapters which gradually build into an overall story arc. This approach is very effective and allows revealing various plot twists to be paced throughout the story and bringing about a thrilling climax to the story.
The characters are well considered and convincing. This could have become a mess with a cast of thousands but the characters are limited to those with the most impact. Character development is limited to explanation of character histories but  the characters and their motives are sensibly introduced and you can develop considerable empathy for them.
I watched this on Amazon Prime as a streamed video and so I can't comment upon the quality of the DVD/Blu-Ray. The Amazon version was the English version by Funimation. Normally I would avoid this but in this case the English version was excellent. The voices fitted the characters perfectly, had good emotional range and the age of the voice actors agreed with the ages of the characters. I very much doubt if the Japanes version would have done as good a job.
The theme music is also great especially ""Howling"" and ""The Hero with no name"".
