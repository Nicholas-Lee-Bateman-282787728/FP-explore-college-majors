2262679,1,B00094ARPA,"I remembered this movie from when I was a kid and figured I'd give it a shot, since it was so cheap; I shouldn't have.

This movie is slow, boring, and has nothing going for it other than some attractive women in various states of undress.  The producers/directors of this movie apparently knew that the movie wasn't any good, so they decided to put a lot of nudity in it.  This was a good plan, as it got a sale from me and it was apparently why I remembered liking it when I was a kid.

The first segment of the movie didn't include even one funny moment and you will suffer your way through it to see the woman who was in ""The Toy"" naked.  Other than the scene with her, there is absolutely nothing worth seeing in the short.

The second segment only had one mildly amusing part, and that was when the older dairy guys said ""butter bang"" and started the segment.  Beyond that, the episode was stupid and there was nothing funny, once again seeing the director rely on overt sexuality and mild nudity to keep people watching.

The third segment was a tiny bit better, but it was still not any good.  They went for a kind of slapstick thing with the young cop getting shot a lot and falling down frequently, but it just didn't work.  The lack of nudity brought this one down to the level of the first two episodes, so it is three strikes for this movie.

Other than the nudity, this movie is not worth watching.  There are exactly no laughs in the whole movie and there is not enough nudity to make it worth watching.  In short, National Lampoon is hit-or-miss with a heavy emphasis on miss.

Bottom line: Do not buy this movie, even for under $4.",1285200000,6,1648,4.29126213592233
2262680,2,B00094ARPA,"Movie Madness (originally known as Goes To The Movies, still plastered on top of the film's opening still-animation) was the third film National Lampoon put it's name on, and it's first bomb after the successful Animal House and somewhat Class Reunion. Unlike those first two, MM parodies three film and TV genres within one movie in three separate segments. In ""Growing Yourself"", a Kramer vs. Kramer-like story, Peter ""Animal House"" Riegert leaves his wife and job to make himself a better man for him and him alone. ""Success Wanters"", a soap opera story, has a young woman who goes from victim to multi-millionheiress in a short three days and how she slept her way to the top. However, even by late 70's/early 80's standards, both segments are only moderately funny bordering on lame.

It's not till we get to the third segment ""Municipalians"" that things get rolling. Robby Benson plays up his ""Oh Golly Gee"" reputation to the hilt as a newbie rookie cop partnered with weathered Richard Widmark in a Los Angeles that's gone straight to Hell. Christopher Lloyd, taking a break in between Taxi seasons (and it shows) plays the serial murderer that Benson tries to reason with to no avail. It even has a great who's who cast featuring Rhea Perlman, Henny Youngman, and a pre-Simpsons Julie Kavner. However this segment, while still nowhere near previous Lampoon greatness, is what saves this film from complete failure.

For me personally, this was one of the films played constantly on cable every day when I'd come home from school (usually exactly where I left it last time) as a kid, but it hasn't aged very well. For fans of 70's/80's entertainment, a quaint way to see what passed for satire in those days, but to others, I'd suggest looking for it On-Demand, in the Free Movies section.

2262681,1,B00094ARPA,"On the DVD case for National Lampoon's Movie Madness (1983) aka National Lampoon Goes to the Movies it states `The Film That Hollywood Doesn't Want You To See.'...and after watching it last night, I understood why...because it was truly awful...89 minutes of pure, cinematic Hell, following on the heels of their first, and most successful, film, Animal House (1978)...talk about the sophomore jinx.  The film is made of a trio of stories, and features two directors, one in Bob Giraldi, whose main body of work following this film consists of Pat Benatar music videos, and Henry Jaglom (Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?).  The cast features a whole bum load of actors I doubt would count this film among the highlights of their careers including Peter Riegert (Animal House), Candy Clark (American Graffiti), Diane Lane (Streets of Fire), Teresa Ganzel (The Toy), Ann Dusenberry (Jaws 2), Robert Culp (""The Greatest American Hero""), Joe Spinell (Losin' It), Fred Willard (Best in Show), Olympia Dukakis (Mr. Holland's Opus), Mary Woronov (Motorama), Dick Miller (Demon Knight), Elisha Cook Jr. (Salem's Lot), Henny Youngman (Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood), Julie Kavner (Radio Days), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Robby Benson (MXP: Most Xtreme Primate), and legendary actor Richard Widmark (Panic in the Streets, Warlock), whom I have a lot of respect for, and still do, but I couldn't help feel a little of it may have died last night...

As I mentioned earlier, the film is comprised of three parts, all supposedly spoofs on popular films or genres at the time.  The first bit is titled `Growing Yourself', and features Peter Riegert as corporate lawyer who chucks his wife (Clark) out on the street, and then quits his job in order to `find' himself.  In the process of doing so he opens a plant orphanage, dates a 14 year old model (Lane), loses a couple of his kids (I mean they actually wander off, never to be seen again), and so on...the only worthwhile aspect of this piece is when bosomy blonde Teresa Ganzel pops her top...the second bit is titled `Success Wanters' and features Ann Dusenberry as recent college graduate Dominique Corsaire, struggling to get a job, finally accepting a position as a stripper.  After being victimized during a national butter council convention (she got butter banged), Dominique vows revenge, and does so by climbing the corporate ladder of a margarine company (eventually becoming president and CEO and crushing the butter industry), marries a wealthy Greek tycoon, and then becomes involved with the president of the United States (Willard), attaining the status of the most powerful woman in the world...all in the course of three days...this is intended to be a spoof of those films where a woman is wronged somehow, and carefully plots her revenge by spending years climbing and clawing her way to the top, strategically using , and then destroying those who done her wrong...the only worthy aspect of this piece is the numerous scenes of nekkidness featuring Ms. Dusenberry.  The third and final bit is titled `Municipalians' and features Benson as an idealistic, naive rookie cop named Brent Falcone, partnered with the jaded, crusty veteran Stan Nagurski, played by Widmark, and tries to spoof the film The New Centurions (1972).  While trying to track down a psycho killer (Lloyd), the rough and unforgiving streets transform Falcone into a hard and uncaring figure, much like his partner...there are no worthy aspects of this last piece, at least in the form of any nekkidness...

It's pretty rare I give out one or five star ratings as I like to reserve those for items truly deserving, and this is definitely one of those situations as this has to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, coupled with the fact that whoever was responsible for this dreck wasted a really strong cast of actors (with, perhaps, the exception being Robbie Benson, whom I've never really cared much for).  That, in and of itself, is something I find offensive in the wasting of talent that could have been somewhere else, doing something much, much better.  I was astounded that an organization like the National Lampoon, which prided itself on its ability to distill usually tasteless humor with regards to pop culture and politics in general, could spew forth something so awful in the wake of what would be its greatest achievement to date in that of Animal House.  Seriously, the so-called comedy here is truly abysmal.  There was a sense that the writers were trying to be smartly clever, cerebral and topical, but then this was contradicted by various scenes of nekkidness as if to say, `Look, we're smart, but we've haven't lost our sense of tackiness'.  Universal Studios, sensing how truly awful the film was, actually shelved the film here in the states.  It did get released in the UK (hey, it's not good enough for us, but those limeys will eat it up), possibly in an insidious effort to undermine American/British relations.  You know, I can sit through almost any cinematic stink bomb and, at the very least, entertain myself with the sheer audaciousness of the levels of awfulness displayed, but here I just couldn't wait for the movie to end...are there worse things than an unfunny comedy?  Sure, I suppose (being drawn and quartered seems like something I'd not want to have done to me) but really, there wasn't anything even mildly humorous about this movie...it stunk, it stunk on ice...

The picture on this DVD, provided both in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs, along with the pan and scan fullscreen format, looks clean and clear, and I had no complaints.  The mono audio provided for the film wasn't as good, as some of the audio, specifically the dialog, felt very soft, compared to the musical score which came through much louder.  The only extra on this DVD is an original theatrical trailer.  You see, now this is a film where one might want to hear a commentary track only to learn what someone was thinking when they made the film...but that would mean having to watch the film for a second time, and once was more than enough for me...
