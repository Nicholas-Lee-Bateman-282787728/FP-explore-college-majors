8226277,5,B000WZPFBC,"This DVD is a must see, for Jews and non-Jews alike! Moving, gripping, and thought -provoking, this exceptional film spans history in a successful attempt to explain our survival as a people against all odds, and our purpose in the world. It puts the role of the land of Israel as a refuge and Jewish state in a context that sheds light on the current political situation. WIth original footage from the early 20th century and moved along with brilliant and heartful narrative, it's gripping throughout, and richly informative. Please buy it, have home and synagogue showings, share with youth groups, and with Christians, Muslims-- in fact, with all religions and nationalities.",1288137600,,679,5.071428571428571
