8358845,1,B002A2B3FC,"First of all, this is advertised as a 2 DVD set, mine came with only 1 DVD.  Second of all, the overall quality of the disk is terrible!  It seems that this disk was a homemade video converted to DVD, then illegally sold.  I watched 30 seconds of it and stuck it back in the case to be sent back to Amazon.  If you're interested in Area 51 documentaries, buy ""Area 51: Beyond Top Secret"", ""Dreamland"", ""Area 51 Base"", or "" Area 51: Secrets of the Black World"".  Any ameteur could have made such a recording like this.  Third of all, STAY AWAY and save your money.",1249948800,8,563,4.214953271028038
