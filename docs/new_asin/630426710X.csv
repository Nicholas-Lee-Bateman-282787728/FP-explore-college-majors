I also saw Panzram the documentary after seeing this movie they complement each other perfectly.",1381104000,,267,4.254901960784314
830534,5,630426710X,"James Woods crawls into the mind of Carl Panzram; in fact, James Woods gives such a dark performance that I could not imagine the man in another way. Themes of isolation are poignantly displayed through contrasting characters. Carl Panzram and Henry Lesser come from very different backgrounds, yet it becomes clear to the audience that both men are similarly alone. Lesser is fascinated by prisoners, choosing to be a prison guard when, in fact, he is well educated and a ""tailor by trade."" He feels disconnected from his family and the bulk of society, bored and searching for the darker side of life behind prison walls. In the prison, it becomes clear that he is disconnected from this world of people as well. He is not like the other prison guards, and easily spotted as an outcast amongst these devilish men. Both guards and prisoners candidly ask Lesser what he is doing there. When Lesser is at home, his family urges him to quit his job as a prison guard and earn a livelihood more suitable to the way he was raised. However, he ignores his family and shuts himself in his office with the smuggled, horrific stories penned by Carl Panzram. Stunned by Panzram's confession, Lesser bewilderingly asks Carl if the story he tells is true. He is shocked by the evil born into man, and morbidly loses himself further in his attempt to discover another side of life amidst  abusive guards and murderous prisoners. In fact, it becomes clear to the audience that Lesser is more confused about his social role than Carl Panzram.
  On the other hand, Carl Panzram is disconnected from man as a result of the evil done unto him, and it is his sole endeavor to return the favor to whomever will satisfy his urge for vengeance. He says, ""I don't believe in man, God nor Devil. I hate the whole damned human race including myself."" Panzram makes it clear that he is an evil machine created by the system, and accepts his role as a reckless beast. Fully aware of the man he was born to be, Panzram embraces his life as a murderer and does not claim to be innocent on any account. He is confused and suspicious of kindness, interrogating Lesser as to the motive behind giving him a single dollar. James Woods displays this state of confusion so well that it is easy to believe Panzram can not recall a single act of kindness being done to him in his entire life.
  Lesser is fascinated by Panzram and Panzram is astonished by the actions of Lesser. It is respect that brings these two men together; and, by reaching out to Panzram, Lesser discovers more than what he is looking for when he initially takes the job as prison guard. It becomes clear to the audience that if one is to embark on the journey through the rabbit hole, you will be shocked by what you find under the slimy rocks of other men.
  On any account, the movie is a solid display of story telling. The director utilizes elements of shock and horror quite well, and the narrative spoken by James Woods is poetic and chilling to the bone. This feature is more than a movie describing the life of a serial killer. It is a journey through the prison system, characterized to be equally reckless and evil as the men it holds. Displaying the limitless acts of malevolence and kindness that reside in the hearts of men, this film is a timeless jewel amongst the archives of cinema.",1377216000,5,3336,4.559265442404007
830535,5,630426710X,"Though DVDs are still very popular, I still love watching VHS movies. This movie was one I preferred to watch on VHS. James Woods never ceases to amaze me when I watched his wonderful acting. His character is so flawed and yet so pitiful, it's a very emotional movie. It arrived in mint condition, the case and all. I didn't have to rewind it either, and there was nothing wrong with the picture or film itself. I will continue to buy movies from Amazon.com. :)",1343347200,,461,4.435294117647059
830536,4,630426710X,"Carl Panzram (the talented James Woods) is arrested and jailed for theft, but while in prison confesses to killing 21 men (while being beaten by the prison guards).  Newly appointed prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) feels sorry for Carl after seeing how badly he's been beaten, and gives the prisoner a dollar (a lot of money back in the 1920's).  Thus starts up a very strange friendship.

Lesser, against the rules, provides Carl with pencil and paper for Carl to write down his life story.  We're taken back through Carl's life, mostly with flashbacks, to the mayhem his life had been.  It seems the only time he attempted normal behavior was under a warden named Casey who actually trusted Carl until Carl, while out on one of his daytime trips, rapes an innocent librarian (played by Ellen Greene - Little Shop Of Horrors).

While 'Killer' isn't a fast paced movie, it's nonetheless a very good movie.  James Woods plays his role as a sociopath to perfection.  The use of occasional black-and-white photography, the costume design, the props, and the old stills really create the atmosphere of the era.  The dialogue is sharp and realistic.  (Carl: ""I do not intend to plead for pity or sympathy or mercy.  What I demand is justice.  You created me.  Now you kill me."")  The scene where the preacher comes to Carl's cell is priceless.

Overall, if you liked 'The Green Mile' or just like James Woods' work, you should pick up or rent a copy of this film.  Though obviously low budget, it works very well.  Enjoy!",1176854400,8,1531,4.716981132075472
830537,4,630426710X,"Based upon a true story by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, this film stars James Woods (Citizen Cohn, Ghosts of Mississippi) as Carl Panzram, a convict who admits to multiple murders. The film opens with a narration by Henry Lesser (Harold Gould, best known as a television actor on shows including Rhoda and The Golden Girls), recounting the Panzram's story. We then see the young Lesser (is that lesser Lesser?), played by Robert Sean Leonard (Swing Kids), about to start his new job as a prison guard at Leavenworth -- it is the late 1920's. Panzram has been incarcerated at Leavenworth for burglary. He is a wise-ass and the more he mouths off the more the guards beat on him, and the more they beat on him the more he mouths off, and the more he...well, you get the picture.
After one particularly brutal beating that leaves Panzram's face a bloody pulp, Lesser -- the guard with a heart -- encounters him and takes an interest in him. He wants to know more about him -- what has brought him here, why is he being beat upon by the other guards, etc. Lesser even breaks the rules and gives him a dollar, enough to buy him a hefty supply of cigarettes and candy bars. Panzram tells Lesser that he is in fact a brutal killer, and wants to document his life and turn it over to him. Problem is that pencils and paper are also forbidden. Fear not, for Mr. Lesser comes through again, after some initial trepidation.
What Lesser reads is horrifying. Panzram admits to killing 21 men, which we see flashed in kind of a newsreel fashion. He recounts a time when he was incarcerated under a Warden Charles Casey (Steve Forrest) who tried to rehabilitate him and the system. He allowed him to go on unsupervised furloughs, so long as he returned that night, which he always does. It blows up when he rapes a woman (Ellen Greene, Little Shop Of Horrors) he befriends from the local library and Casey is fired.
Finally Panzram tires of the beatings being inflicted upon him by the guards and kills one of them in a disturbingly violent scene. Panzram is sentenced to death for his crime, as is his wish.
The film is a study of the curious (to me anyway) relationship between a kind-hearted, religious prison guard and a brutal monster of an inmate. What drew Lesser to this man? Granted he is a highly intelligent individual, but he displays little redeeming qualities. His kindness to Lesser consists merely of not filling him.
In the movie it only says Panzram killed 21 men, but gives no other details of his crimes. By doing a little searching, I was able to find a more specific account as follows:
His criminal career started early enough -- he was eight when first convicted (drunk & disorderly conduct). Three years later, a string of burglaries landed him in reform school. During his stint there, he torched a building. He would leave the institution at age thirteen, filled with the knowledge that last him a lifetime -- ""how to steal, lie, hate, burn and kill"". Paroled into the gentle arms of his mother, he promptly ran away to pursue a hobo's life. In a boxcar, he was gang-raped by four ""burly bums"", who taught him another valuable lesson -- ""force and might make right"".
Following a stint in the army (which culminated in a court-martial and three years at Leavenworth) he embarked on a career of spectacular brutality. Traveling around the globe -- South America, Europe, Africa and back to the US -- he left a wake of corpses. With proceeds from a heist, he bought a ship and lured ten sailors aboard with the promise of free bootleg liquor. After the seamen drank themselves into a stupor, Panzram raped them, shot each one in the head and dumped them in the briny blue. Later, in West Africa, he hired eight native guides to help him hunt crocodiles. Once again, he raped and murdered them all -- then fed their bodies to the crocs for sport.
James Woods is fantastic as the brutal Carl Panzram. Anyone who has seen him in The Onion Field or Citizen Cohn knows this guy can act with the best, particularly is the ""bad guy"" role (I also hear he's wonderful in Ghosts Of Mississippi). He displays both the intelligence and the brutality of his character. His performance alone is worth your $3.25.
Panzram pens his journal with the idea of showing how his life of crime and murder is a result of society. He is a product of the system -- of the people he has encountered and the prisons he is incarcerated in. Able to take it no more, he lobbies for his own execution. So the ""purpose"" of the film seems to be an effort to back the ""environmental"" theory of criminality as well as a call for prison reform.
It should also be noted that the movie was filmed in Connecticut and Rhode Island and produced by Oliver Stone.
Until next time, the Cheese reminds you, ""that ain't butter!""",1010016000,14,4797,4.540415704387991
830538,3,630426710X,"""Killer: A Journal Of Murder"" is not as deep as itpretends to be. It doesn't really dwelve into the mind of a killerlike other movies.  But it's still pretty interesting and the viewer never really wants to stop watching it. The heart of the film is intriguing: A young gaurd is fascinated by the perverse and dark life of the most dangerous man in the prison. The screenplay is vicious and gritty (even a nice librarian gets raped) and the characters though not perfect, are still well-written to a certain extent. I wasn't riveted, but I was interested and it did make me think for a while. This is more about the lure of evil and it's mechanics and maybe even redemption. Not a masterpiece, but still a good film.",942710400,3,716,4.507692307692308
830539,5,630426710X,"I for one fail to understand why James Woods did not get an Oscar for this fine performance except possibly for the fact that this movie is too powerful for most stomachs.  As someone who works in the Juvenile prison  system,  and as a Jew, a relate so strongly to the feelings of helpless  outrage felt by the guard.  I feel this movie should be required in all  temples, synagogues, criminal justice programs, social work programs,  psychology programs and recommend it for anyone who wants to see the depths  and heights and realites of living in this world.  It is so finely tuned, I  fail to see the flaw referred to to in the review.",936576000,8,639,4.478260869565218
830610,4,630426710X,"I have read the book that this is based upon.  The movie does a good job of portraying the relationship that developed between Carl and Mr. Lesser.  I did find it odd that it showed the rape of the librarian but left out completely the fact that Carl had raped ""a 1000 men"", as he himself put it.  He had been raped in a juvenile facility and then again while traveling in a boxcar on a train.  After that, he raped men.  That wasn't even touched on in the movie, although it was a large part of his criminal life.  I guess that that would have been too controversial for the time.  Still, it was a vital part of his story that was hidden away in the film.  Overall, though, a good film.  I had seen it before (when it was released originally) and will probably watch it again in the future.",1446336000,,791,4.151315789473684
830611,5,630426710X,"Carl Panzram was a rage-filled psychopath who knew what he was. James Woods did an excellent job in this chilling story. It also presented us with disturbing questions about the treatment of prisoners...have we been guilty of making them worse? Panzram blamed his behavior on his childhood experiences, and the treatment he received in public institutions, beginning with his time in a reform school. The institutions use the ""documentation"" of treatment to defend any accusation of blame. Hey, like they would admit to beatings and confinement designed to break and terrorize boys in an effort to control them.
I wish there had been more details about his experiences but that is a minor point. Panzram's fragile bond with probably the only person who ever showed him kindness and personal interest as a human being led him to write his story. I think the guard who befriended him finally figured out that he could never ""help"" Panzram, that this was a human being so damaged he would never be able to live outside an institution. Panzram simply wanted it to end, Excellent acting, dialogue, staging all around. Recommend it for anyone interested in dark psychology.",1446249600,,1167,5.020618556701031
830612,2,630426710X,"Very poorly done - though I like James Woods' previous work, he was totally miscast in this role if you know anything about Panzaran.  The character development (or detail of his formative years) is totally missing.  This script doesn't tell a very exciting story of either Panzaran's journey or his relationship with Lesser, which seems to be the writers semi-focus.  So much more could have been done in either case.  Completely disappointed and lost some respect for James Woods.  Any documentary is more complete and actually more interesting.",1444521600,,547,5.170454545454546

830669,4,630426710X,"While I wasn't expecting an awful movie, by any means, I really didn't expect this film to be as good as it was. It's really a compelling piece.

I've been reading true crime books for over ten years now and have always been curious about Carl Panzram. While this film does not explore his early life and crimes in great detail, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at not only his final years, but also crime and punishment (and, more specifically, the American criminal justice system) in the twentieth century.

For those serial killer buffs looking for a cheesy gorefest filled with torture and nudity, you will be very disappointed in Killer: A Journal of Murder. However, for those who are truly interested in the deeper, more intriguing aspects of Carl Panzram, this film is right up your alley.

The script, which is based on the book of the same name, is simply amazing. The dialogue, particularly between Lesser and Panzram (the two main characters) is nothing short of poetry. The rights words and acting is what makes this film work. Why, you ask? Because the driving force of this film is the complex and fascinating relationship between Lesser and Panzram. Sure, there are other things that make this story worth telling, but without the odd friendship between prisoner and guard, this film would not be as unique or interesting.

Legendary actor James Woods and Robert Sean Leonard, who is now well known for his role on Fox's House MD, both give great performances worthy of praise. At times (mainly in the beginning of the film), Woods seems to oversell it, but for the most part, he is perfect. Leonard's ability to play a decent, honest man who finds himself befriending and assisting a multiple rapist/thief/murderer, while battling his inner morals that are pulling him in both directions and, to boot, putting his marriage and job on the line, is just incredible. The inner tension, humanity, and humility in his character is easy to see, thanks to Leonard. While there are no performances worth complaining about, perhaps the stand-out actor in this film would have to be John Bedford Lloyd, who is magnificent as Dr. Karl Menninger. While only in front of the camera for a few minutes, this underrated and relatively unknown veteran actor proves that stars aren't always the ones that steal the show.

In all, this is a great film. Even if you're not a true crime buff, the dynamic and dramatic relationship between Panzram and Lesser is something that the best screenwriters on earth would kill for. Sometimes, a good work of non-fiction is just what you need to create a piece of cinematic art.",1387152000,,2630,4.835555555555556

I saw where this Wood's film is leaving prime so I gave it another watch and I'm glad I did. It's a better film for not being historically accurate. The beatings at the hands of guards and solitary confinement was only a part of what was done to the real Panzram. In the film his own child rape is only implied.
