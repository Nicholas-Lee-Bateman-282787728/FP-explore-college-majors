8002477,1,B0000TAZQ0,"Think After School Special spoof. It's that bad. The only reason I can imagine anybody buying this is the same reason I did - for Lana Parrilla. It's pretty obvious after watching why she's the only one who has actually gone on to have a decent career. This is the only movie credit for the writer/director (David-Matthew Barnes) and a couple of the actors as well.

Storyline: Three friends at the end of their senior year, looking to the future. Lisa (Parrilla) is possibly going to be the first in her family to go to college - Harvard, to be precise. She has a chance to 'get out' of town and change the path of her life and her family (older drug dealing brother who is always in jail; mother cleans houses and married the father because she got pregnant). Manny (Eddie Rivera) is gay, but the bigger problem is his semi-crazy sister who isn't dealing well with the fact that their parents left them 3 years ago and obviously aren't coming back. Patti (Charlotte Nielsen) likes to write poetry about a guy she's too nervous to talk to. The three of them work at a movie theater that never seems to have any customers.

The main story is Lisa's and whether she will go to Harvard or end up knocked up and spending the rest of her life right there (apparently an LA suburb) with Eddie (Juan Monsalvez). He would be happy to marry her and run his dad's restaurant, but her parents are pressuring her to go to college and have a better life than they do. The scene where Lisa has to tell Eddie she's been accepted to Harvard is probably the best in the movie. There's great emotion from both actors, enough to even forgive the dialogue.

And the dialogue is painfully bad...the writing as well as most of the delivery. It does not often feel natural and these are supposed to be best friends and romantic interests. Many scenes are two actors face-to-face and shot from the side, just saying their lines like a middle school play rehearsal with little emotion.

It's probably best that the movie didn't spend more time on the stories for Patti and Manny (although we see more of him than her without Lisa) because their performances are lackluster. At least Parrilla isn't quite as stony - she does what she can with bad material, and many of her scenes are very emotional, but unless you're a super die hard fan, you aren't missing anything if you skip this one.",1352419200,6,2364,4.503496503496503
