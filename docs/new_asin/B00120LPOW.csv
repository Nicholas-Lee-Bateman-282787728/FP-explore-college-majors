3071342,4,B00120LPOW,"The Hardy Boyz are without a doubt one of the most popular tag teams amongst this generation of wrestling fans.  They've had a lot of ups & downs throughout both in the ring with their tag & solo careers along with out of the ring in their personal lives.  Most of this is story is now told in this two disc set with each disc dedicated to each brother & telling their own story.  Now keep in mind that I haven't seen the ""Leap Of Faith"" DVD that WWF released in 2001 along with their ""Ultimate Insiders"" shoot interviews as well so I'm just making my review off of what I saw here.

Matt's documentry stars off with the story behing their mother dying when him & Jeff were young before leading into how WrestleMania IV effected their feelings towards wrestilng.  The story of them wanting a trampoline, starting their own backyard promotion as kids in the TWF, and how that evolved into the ECWF is up next with Matt talking about all the jobs he did such as promoting, creating ring outfits, and getting sponsors.  The OMEGA promotion is talked about next with how that founded such talent as Gregory Helms, Shannon Moore, and Joey Matthews a.k.a. Mercury from MNM.  The story behind their move onto WWE has jobbers & how that lead into a fulltime contract is profiled next before moving onto the impact Michael Hayes had in establishing the Hardy Boyz team & their eventual tag team title victory.  Their famous No Mercy ladder match is discussed next along with the impact it had on their careers & evolution into the Tables & Ladders & Chairs matches.  Lita's involvement into Team Xtreme is touched upon before talking about the reasons behind breaking up the team, going solo with the Mattitude/Version 1 character, and the comedic involvement of his ""MF'er"" Shannon Moore.  The story behind Lita's return to the ring & Matt moving over to RAW before starting the Kane feud & Matt getting injured is talked about next before the selling point of this DVD (at least according to the commercials) is talked about.  The story behind how Matt found out about Lita cheating him with Edge along with Matt getting released is talked about next with highlights of the Byte This episode with Lita in the studio & Matt on the phone being shown while Edge gives his thoughts.  How Matt got rehired along with the feud they had together is shown via highlights from their RAW street fight & Unforgiven cage match featuring that legdrop Matt gave off the top of the cage.  The reunion of the Hardy Boyz & winning the tag team titles once again is talked about before closing the documentry out on the story behind the feud with M.V.P. & all the entertaining challenges they did for weeks on SmackDown.

Jeff's documentry kicks off by talking about how his mother died from cancer before moving on to Jeff's involvement in the TWF & all his various characters he used.  How the Hardy's would train themselves by studing the moves they saw on TV & how he got his foot in the door at WWE at the age of 16 was brought up next with highlights of his debut match against Razor Ramon.  The odd jobs Matt & Jeff did such as be the door openers for the King Of The Ring PPV & carrying King Mabel on his thrown to the ring is talked about next.  Jeff's ""Imag-I-Nation"" playground is talked about next highlighted by his motocross track and various artwork such as alumnimummy structures, paintings, tattoo's, and his body paintings followed by Jeff's high risk/daredevil style of wrestling being talked about next with Jeff admitting that he's never needed surgery for anything he's done in the ring over all these years.  His single's run & winning the Intercontinental Title from Triple H (the youngest I.C. champion by the way) is talked about & with later talking about the story behind his Ladder Match with Undertaker on RAW.  Jeff Hardy's music & how he came up with the name of his band Peroxywhy?gen (that's not a typo) is talked about next before moving on to his burnout from the wrestling business, his involvement with drugs, and being eventually released was talked about.  His time away, getting the wrestling itch again, and the road back to the WWE (including mentioning TNA by name), and coming back to WWE & getting involved with Edge on his first night close out this documentry.

Extras include Matt Hardy's WCW Amature Challenge contest video along with a story of the effect his video had on a WCW tag team, a tour of Matt's house, a story of Matt starting a fire in the woods as a kid, the Hardy's talking about their pet dogs, and a music video to Jeff Hardy's own song ""Old Grow.""  Hidden extras include Matt Hardy talking about his short SmackDown feud against Undertaker, Jeff's ultimate goal for his alumnimummy creations, a story behind how Jeff wrecked his studio, and a toast with the ""Core Group.""

Matches Include:
No DQ/No Count Out Match vs. Kane - This started out with a brawl on the floor with even the TV monitors getting involved in the first few minutes.  Eventhough Matt got a few punches in here & there, it was mostly about Kane just overpowering Hardy before pregnant Lita came out & caused a distraction for Matt to get the upset.
Vengeance '04

Steel Cage Match vs. Edge - This was without a doubt the best match in this feud that was without a doubt one of the top news stories of the year.  This was mostly just a brawl between both men with some crazy spots like Edge's powerbomb off the ropes, when the crowd erupted when Edge got tired into ropes, Matt finally getting his hands on Lita, and the highlight reel of Hardy's legrop from the top of the cage before getting the victory.
Unforgiven '05

Tables Match: Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz - This was the first tables match in WWF history. Man, did these two put on a show here as both teams did a great showing & with the way these teams were put through those tables...it was something to see at the time.  Look out for Jeff Hardy, as usual, being a daredevil at the end.
Royal Rumble '00

Jeff Hardy vs. Intercontinental Champion Triple H - The match went non-stop as Hardy was just using his quick ""daredevil"" offense in the opening minutes while Triple H was real intense throughout the match as well with the suprize being that Jeff Hardy winning the Intercontinental Title.
SmackDown! Apr. 01
(Also available on the ""WWF Action"" DVD)

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro - This cage match was similar to the Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart match in which they didn't turn it into a bloody massacre but did good wrestling inside the cage. If you've seen their previous matches, you know this will not disappoint but the ending was something unique for a cage match.
New Years Revolution '07

World Tag Team Champions The Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch - A rematch from the previous month at Backlash with J.B.L. & Michael Cole calling the match for some reason (since Matt's the only one on SmackDown). This tag match & storyline itself was very similar ot the Eddie Guerrero/Batista one from back in 2005 where the heels were trying to play by the rules & not cheat. It was a good tag team match but to me, was a step down from their Backlash match the previous month. Besides seeing Trevor Murdock pull off the Canadian Destroyer, there really wasn't anything memorable here eventhough it was a solid contest. This was the match of the night for that PPV.
Judgment Day '07

Winner gets WWE Championship Title Shot At Royal Rumble: Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H - This was all about Triple H making Jeff Hardy step his game up as the beginning had Hardy hold back a punch before Triple H slapped him & yelled for Hardy to ""FIGHT ME!"" before Hardy returned the slap to Triple H. From here, they went back & forth with each other with Triple H getting more aggressive every time it looked like Hardy would make a comeback. Great match that served it's purpose in elevating Hardy to the main event.
Armageddon '07

Other matches include two matches with Matt Hardy vs. Joey Mercury & Mr. Kennedy, two matches with Jeff Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin & a steel cage match vs. Umaga, and a match from the OMEGA promotion with Matt & Jeff vs. Gregory Helms' team of the Serial Thrillaz with alternative commentary.

In the end, I'll give WWE credit for making both documentries somewhat different in how they didn't repeat a bunch of information in regards to both men.  I heavily enjoyed Matt's documentry & it made me gain respect for him even more as far as how much he loves the wrestling business & has taken on so many task in & out the ring along with his heavy dedication to the sport that I agree with, is always overlooked by Jeff's more ""colorful"" personality & daredevil ring style plus I like that they didn't make the whole Edge/Matt/Lita thing such a huge detail as that isn't the only important thing that's happened in Matt's career.  The only things I can say on Matt's documentry that's a negative is that Lita should have been interviewed as well since he was an important part of some of the subjects involved (she said her on MySpace that she wasn't asked to be interviewed).  Jeff's documentry (which was under an hour) however I felt was just there & didn't really do anything for me as it focused more on his life outside of wrestling than anything else.  They could have at least talked about the feud with Nitro that led to a feud between MNM & the Hardys that spread across all three brands for months.  And I also felt that eventhough some of these matches are good on here, for this being the first Hardy Boyz DVD in 7 years, and now in retrospect with Jeff Hardy already striking out twice on the Wellness Policy, unless WWE plans on pushing Matt Hardy to the moon (which I don't see) then this could be the last Hardy Boyz DVD we ever see so I felt that a bunch of rare matches could have been put on here instead of some of the random ""nothing special"" matches put on here that would have been more bang for the buck.  Matches like either the steel cage or ladder matche from RAW against Edge & Christian, the I.C./European Unification Ladder Match between Jeff & RVD, a match from the Matt Hardy/Gregory Helms feud, or the Hardyz vs. MNM match from the ECW PPV which I concider a modern day ""classic.""  In the end, what was lacking in matches on Matt's disc was made up by the good documentry & extras while what Jeff's lacked in the documentry was made up for by the matches on his disc so I recommend.",1211068800,2,10454,4.524668435013263
3071343,4,B00120LPOW,"I was hesitant to buy thi set. I don't know why, considering I own over 85% of the other WWE/WWF dvds. I really enjoyed Hardy Boyz Leap of Faith dvd but that contained all of the greatest matches and did not contain blurred WWF logos. Back to this dvd though. A commerical of this set looked cool so I bought it the next day.

Matt Hardy dvd is good. A one hour story of Matt has some good moments and is overall well done. I bought it for the Edge, Lita, and Matt saga; You get one side of the story (Matt's of course), if Edge's dvd has a bio i'm sure you'll hear his side. I enjoy the footage of there early days. I wish thy put some early talent enchancement matches on this dvd but the matches are good overall. Some shocking moments are they mention ROH and have a second clip of Beniot.

Jeff Hardy is pretty much the same as the Matt dvd. It shows some of the stuff he does outside the ring which is neat. Only shocking moment is he mentions TNA.

Overall, im surprised they mentioned both ROH and TNA on the same WWE dvd. Its weird too hear WWE acknowledge two current companys that alot of people think are better then WWE at this point. Overall, if your a Hardy's fan-you already own it. I enjoyed the dvd for the biographies and early footage of there careers. The matches are good but Leap of Faith dvd had the earlier and slightly better matches. A good companion piece to Leap of Faith. Worth it.",1210118400,7,1411,4.199261992619927

3071345,5,B00120LPOW,"My favorite kind of wrestling DVDs are the ones that are out of character and done in a documentary style.

The main discs of each brother are documentaries about real life problems.  I've always been a big fan of the Hardy Boyz, if you are, you should absolutely pick this up.",1209600000,,475,4.488372093023256
3071346,4,B00120LPOW,"I am looking forward to this DVD but I worry it may now be delayed as Jeff has been suspended for failing a drug test. I know it sounds petty as I do hope he recovers but be a shame if a promising set is pushed back because of his mistakes.

For the set, it does look good but wish someone would put the Wrestlemania 2000 ladder match on for once.",1205193600,,347,3.887323943661972

3071359,5,B00120LPOW,"TWIST OF FATE is music to my ears.  It celebrates the Cameron, NC brothers as individuals, as well as their tag team run that catapulted them to stardom.  It addresses the negative aspects and criticisms that both men have endured.  It even goes so far as to acknowledge that there is another wrestling promotion out there (well...TNA really only gets mentioned for a few moments).

I hate to review TWIST OF FATE as a single DVD set, because part of the point is to reveal Matt & Jeff as separate people.  However, my praise and criticisms for both stories are the same.

Both documentaries (Matt's is 59 minutes, Jeff's is 47 minutes) tell compelling stories of the brothers' upbringing, early wrestling exposure, bumps in their personal lives, and plans for the future.  My greatest fears were twofold: I was concerned that the documentaries would be underdeveloped, and that it was too soon to a biography DVD on wrestlers whose careers are likely far from over.

TWIST OF FATE subverts both of those concerns very quickly.  There is plenty of detail given to Matt and Jeff, in their singles and tag team careers.  We get to see Matt book his OMEGA league in the early 90s, his rise with Jeff in the tag division, his breakoff into ""Version 1.0"", and the heartbraking split from Amy Dumas that everybody knows.  We get to see not only Jeff's role with Matt in the early years through the Attitude Era, but also get a glance at Jeff's passion for being an artist (he paints and records music).

For some reason, the WWE's coverage of Jeff's reported substance abuse issues from around 2003 seems to have barely scratched the surface.  I don't want to see Jeff get buried on DVD, but the gossip and rumors surrounding this issue are much more grim than either Jeff or WWE admit in the program.  Given the Wellness Policy violation around the time this DVD came out, my concerns haven't been relieved very much.

My other initial concern was that this was too soon to do a biography on Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy.  While it might've been too soon (Matt's ECW Title and Jeff's new WWE Title push happened when TWIST OF FATE came out), I think this allows the WWE to celebrate the careers of the two brothers while they're on a hot streak.  Despite the occasional roadblock the two men have encountered, the TWIST OF FATE documentaries reveal both Matt and Jeff to be loyal and passionate wrestlers whose enthusiasm has rarely been down.  They're so enamored to be involved with the WWE product that there's no reason for either of them to be bitter about their careers.  Hopefully, it will stay that way.  Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy have little controversy in their lives, and frankly have very little to complain about in terms of their careers.

The last issue I want to address about TWIST OF FATE is the Extras.  There's been a lot of negativity thrown around that the 2-disc set is lacking in this department.  While it's not stacked, I don't think there's a whole lot to complain about.
_______________________________________________

Many WWE fans seem to forget that almost every single Hardyz Ladder Match is on the LADDER MATCH DVD.  The same people who complain that WWE keeps releasing the same matches on more than one DVD are the same people who're upset a Ladder Match isn't on this TWIST OF FATE set.  Get Over It!

Instead, the WWE has treated us to a solid (if unusual) bunch of matches.  In my opinion, the two discs' extra matches are about equal:

Disc #1 - Matt Hardy
* The Tag Team Match from OMEGA shows what talent the Hardy Boyz had before entering the WWF. (7.0 / 10)

* I have no idea why the VENGEANCE 2004 match against Kane is on here, other than for historical purposes.  This was when Kane was after Lita.  Sorry to say, I don't think it's very good.  (5.5 / 10)

* The Steel Cage Match against Edge from 2005 is my personal favorite of all of their matches.  That top-of-the-Cage legdrop is still amazing.  (8.0 / 10)

* There's a SMACKDOWN Match from 2007 against Joey Mercury.  While this is a decent match, I would've loved to see the match Matt had against King Booker one week later.  That was a real Match-of-the-Year candidate.  (7.0 / 10)

*  I'm ecstatic that WWE remembered the great one-on-one match with Matt & Mr. Kennedy in May 2007.  I had the privilege of seeing it when it was first broadcast, and can now give my DVR some extra recording space.  (8.0 / 10)
_______________________________________________

Disc #2 - Jeff Hardy
* I don't recall the ROYAL RUMBLE 2000 Table Match being released on DVD anywhere before.  Even if it has, this was still the best Table Match until SURVIVOR SERIES 2002.  How ironic, both were in Madison Square Garden. (9.0 / 10)

* Big props to the WWE for acknowleding that the IC Title victory from Triple H even existed!  For years, this has been a forgotten match that only the most loyal WWE fan has remembered.  And guess what: it's still a very good one. (7.5 / 10)

* Although I preferred their RAW Ladder Match, the Steel Cage Match against Johnny Nitro is a good one.  Plus, the Ladder Match is on WWE's LADDER MATCH 3-disc set. (7.0 / 10)

* The RAW match against Shelton Benjamin is decent.  Never boring, but my fondest memories of Shelton Benjamin are more exciting than this particular match. (7.0 / 10)

* The World Tag Team Titles Match included against Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch is the best between these two teams, and remains a Match-of-the-Year candidate in my eyes.  Finally, I can stop considering buying the subpar JUDGMENT DAY 2007 DVD.  (8.0 / 10)

* The ARMAGEDDON 2007 matchup between Triple H and Jeff Hardy hasn't improved or diminished since I first saw it.  As I said in my review of this PPV, a good match, but most of it consists of signature spots you've seen both men do for years.  (7.0 / 10)

* Lastly, there's a Steel Cage Match against Umaga that occurred in earlier this year.  While I can't understand how the Samoan Bulldozer actually lost to a man half his size, this is pretty entertaining for TV standards.  (6.5 / 10)

They have won the intercontinental title, european, hardcore, and of course the tag team titles in their own separate rights. This two disc documentary is a good way to see how the Hardys became superstars of today.

Disc 1
Disc one is only about Matt's story but others speak on matters such as Jeff and Edge. It starts with Matt telling how him and Jeff lost their mother at early ages and how their father took care of them. Matt then moves to how he became a promoter early in his career & then coming to the WWE with Jeff. He talks about his struggles early in his WWE career and then expresses how the ladder match and the tables match launched his and Jeff's tag team success. Also how Lita came to be a part of the Hardys and then the relationship her and Matt had together. Jeff and Matt being split up and becoming individual stars. The matter of the whole Edge and Lita thing is touched on and how Matt and Edge formed a rivalry based on that as well.

This is a good documentary and match selection on the Hardys. Pretty good buy.",1219363200,4,2350,4.457943925233645
3071363,4,B00120LPOW,"2008 has been a banner year for WWE DVD releases. With match anthologies already releases this year for Steve Austin, Triple H, & The Rock. As good as reliving those classic matches again and again are, I have been longing for some of the WWE's superbly produced documentaries instead. Some prime past examples includes documentaries on Bret Hart, Jake Roberts, ECW, and the AWA. Now we get not one, but two of them in the two disc release of Twist of Fate: The Matt and Jeff Hardy Story.

WWE already released a Hardy Boyz documentary on the tag team itself several years ago, so this time each disc is dedicated to each Hardy. Of the two features, I found Matt's to cover more ground. Both documentaries spend a good deal of time showcasing the Hardyz breaking into the WWE scene as opening card contenders who almost always lost. This footage shows how far these two have come in the WWE, rarely do wrestlers nowadays break in as the Hardyz did, and it was intriguing to see these two modern superstars get tossed around by the likes of Kama and Nikolai Volkoff in the mid-90s.

Matt's feature also covers a bit more of the Hardyz tag team history, with their rise through the then-amazing tag team ranks of the late 1990s/early 2000s. Those moments brought back many fond memories when WWE actually cared about their tag team division. Aside from the tag team background, Matt's feature clocks in with a wealthy amount of content on his first singles run on Smackdown in 2002-2003 with a helping of ""Mattitude"" highlights at its side. Of course, there is the whole behind-the-scenes Matt/Edge/Lita love triangle covered in-depth. Matt appears to have mellowed down from the drama that took place three years ago, but still he and Edge provide some interesting insight on the fiasco that led to Matt's firing and prompt rehiring, where the WWE brought the love triangle to their television storylines and brought out some memorable matches between Edge & Matt.

If you were going in to Jeff's disc expecting an intense look at his wrestling career, than you may find Jeff's documentary a little underwhelming. Since Matt's disc devotes more time to the tag team era, Jeff's story focuses more on his unorthodox lifestyle. This feature gives a taste what a day of the extraordinary life of Jeff Hardy is like. Jeff shows off a lot of his unique art work, mummified sculptures, original compositions and his custom dirt bike track. Interesting indeed, but given the fact that Jeff's feature is about a good 15 minutes shorter than Matt's, it is surprising to see about half of Jeff's documentary dedicated to it.

Jeff does reflect on his big 2002 singles run which saw a WWE Title main event against Undertaker on RAW. Unfortunately his big run got cut off as how Jeff admits he got wrapped up in the world of drugs, which culminated in his release in 2003. I would have preferred more insight on what transpired behind the scenes here, but Jeff mostly dodges around the facts and gives the basics and sums up that he got back into ring shape by taking a year off and spending time at home. He briefly touches on his TNA run, which then landed him a job back in WWE in 2006. Interesting to hear how Jeff got back into the WWE, but again, Jeff seemed limited in what he was allowed to say here, as they rushed through covering how we was working in a different promotion. It is worth noting that the shooting for this DVD wrapped up shortly before Jeff got suspending for failing a drug test this year, which followed coincidentally with his home burning down a few days later, so don't be surprised to see that none of that is covered here.

Since this is a WWE video release, both discs feature several bonus matches in their entirety. These mostly consist of single matches, but there are a couple tag team matches thrown in (including one from the old Hardy-run indy promotion, OMEGA) for good measure. Some notable single matches are Matt's cage match against Edge from Unforgiven 2005, Jeff's cage match with Umaga from earlier this year, Matt's grudge match against Kane from Vengeance 2004, and Jeff's bout with Triple H from Armageddon 2007. Most of the other matches aren't as spectacular, but should still provide plenty of thrills for any Hardy fan.

Even though Jeff's feature is a mild letdown (yet still worth a viewing), both documentaries combine to form a nice package. Throw in the bonus matches and you got one heck of a DVD set that every Hardy fan must see.

3305839,4,B00120LPOW,"The Hardy Boyz are without a doubt one of the most popular tag teams amongst this generation of wrestling fans.  They've had a lot of ups & downs throughout both in the ring with their tag & solo careers along with out of the ring in their personal lives.  Most of this is story is now told in this two disc set with each disc dedicated to each brother & telling their own story.  Now keep in mind that I haven't seen the ""Leap Of Faith"" DVD that WWF released in 2001 along with their ""Ultimate Insiders"" shoot interviews as well so I'm just making my review off of what I saw here.

Matt's documentry stars off with the story behing their mother dying when him & Jeff were young before leading into how WrestleMania IV effected their feelings towards wrestilng.  The story of them wanting a trampoline, starting their own backyard promotion as kids in the TWF, and how that evolved into the ECWF is up next with Matt talking about all the jobs he did such as promoting, creating ring outfits, and getting sponsors.  The OMEGA promotion is talked about next with how that founded such talent as Gregory Helms, Shannon Moore, and Joey Matthews a.k.a. Mercury from MNM.  The story behind their move onto WWE has jobbers & how that lead into a fulltime contract is profiled next before moving onto the impact Michael Hayes had in establishing the Hardy Boyz team & their eventual tag team title victory.  Their famous No Mercy ladder match is discussed next along with the impact it had on their careers & evolution into the Tables & Ladders & Chairs matches.  Lita's involvement into Team Xtreme is touched upon before talking about the reasons behind breaking up the team, going solo with the Mattitude/Version 1 character, and the comedic involvement of his ""MF'er"" Shannon Moore.  The story behind Lita's return to the ring & Matt moving over to RAW before starting the Kane feud & Matt getting injured is talked about next before the selling point of this DVD (at least according to the commercials) is talked about.  The story behind how Matt found out about Lita cheating him with Edge along with Matt getting released is talked about next with highlights of the Byte This episode with Lita in the studio & Matt on the phone being shown while Edge gives his thoughts.  How Matt got rehired along with the feud they had together is shown via highlights from their RAW street fight & Unforgiven cage match featuring that legdrop Matt gave off the top of the cage.  The reunion of the Hardy Boyz & winning the tag team titles once again is talked about before closing the documentry out on the story behind the feud with M.V.P. & all the entertaining challenges they did for weeks on SmackDown.

Jeff's documentry kicks off by talking about how his mother died from cancer before moving on to Jeff's involvement in the TWF & all his various characters he used.  How the Hardy's would train themselves by studing the moves they saw on TV & how he got his foot in the door at WWE at the age of 16 was brought up next with highlights of his debut match against Razor Ramon.  The odd jobs Matt & Jeff did such as be the door openers for the King Of The Ring PPV & carrying King Mabel on his thrown to the ring is talked about next.  Jeff's ""Imag-I-Nation"" playground is talked about next highlighted by his motocross track and various artwork such as alumnimummy structures, paintings, tattoo's, and his body paintings followed by Jeff's high risk/daredevil style of wrestling being talked about next with Jeff admitting that he's never needed surgery for anything he's done in the ring over all these years.  His single's run & winning the Intercontinental Title from Triple H (the youngest I.C. champion by the way) is talked about & with later talking about the story behind his Ladder Match with Undertaker on RAW.  Jeff Hardy's music & how he came up with the name of his band Peroxywhy?gen (that's not a typo) is talked about next before moving on to his burnout from the wrestling business, his involvement with drugs, and being eventually released was talked about.  His time away, getting the wrestling itch again, and the road back to the WWE (including mentioning TNA by name), and coming back to WWE & getting involved with Edge on his first night close out this documentry.

Extras include Matt Hardy's WCW Amature Challenge contest video along with a story of the effect his video had on a WCW tag team, a tour of Matt's house, a story of Matt starting a fire in the woods as a kid, the Hardy's talking about their pet dogs, and a music video to Jeff Hardy's own song ""Old Grow.""  Hidden extras include Matt Hardy talking about his short SmackDown feud against Undertaker, Jeff's ultimate goal for his alumnimummy creations, a story behind how Jeff wrecked his studio, and a toast with the ""Core Group.""

Matches Include:
No DQ/No Count Out Match vs. Kane - This started out with a brawl on the floor with even the TV monitors getting involved in the first few minutes.  Eventhough Matt got a few punches in here & there, it was mostly about Kane just overpowering Hardy before pregnant Lita came out & caused a distraction for Matt to get the upset.
Vengeance '04

Steel Cage Match vs. Edge - This was without a doubt the best match in this feud that was without a doubt one of the top news stories of the year.  This was mostly just a brawl between both men with some crazy spots like Edge's powerbomb off the ropes, when the crowd erupted when Edge got tired into ropes, Matt finally getting his hands on Lita, and the highlight reel of Hardy's legrop from the top of the cage before getting the victory.
Unforgiven '05

Tables Match: Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz - This was the first tables match in WWF history. Man, did these two put on a show here as both teams did a great showing & with the way these teams were put through those tables...it was something to see at the time.  Look out for Jeff Hardy, as usual, being a daredevil at the end.
Royal Rumble '00

Jeff Hardy vs. Intercontinental Champion Triple H - The match went non-stop as Hardy was just using his quick ""daredevil"" offense in the opening minutes while Triple H was real intense throughout the match as well with the suprize being that Jeff Hardy winning the Intercontinental Title.
SmackDown! Apr. 01
(Also available on the ""WWF Action"" DVD)

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro - This cage match was similar to the Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart match in which they didn't turn it into a bloody massacre but did good wrestling inside the cage. If you've seen their previous matches, you know this will not disappoint but the ending was something unique for a cage match.
New Years Revolution '07

World Tag Team Champions The Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch - A rematch from the previous month at Backlash with J.B.L. & Michael Cole calling the match for some reason (since Matt's the only one on SmackDown). This tag match & storyline itself was very similar ot the Eddie Guerrero/Batista one from back in 2005 where the heels were trying to play by the rules & not cheat. It was a good tag team match but to me, was a step down from their Backlash match the previous month. Besides seeing Trevor Murdock pull off the Canadian Destroyer, there really wasn't anything memorable here eventhough it was a solid contest. This was the match of the night for that PPV.
Judgment Day '07

Winner gets WWE Championship Title Shot At Royal Rumble: Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H - This was all about Triple H making Jeff Hardy step his game up as the beginning had Hardy hold back a punch before Triple H slapped him & yelled for Hardy to ""FIGHT ME!"" before Hardy returned the slap to Triple H. From here, they went back & forth with each other with Triple H getting more aggressive every time it looked like Hardy would make a comeback. Great match that served it's purpose in elevating Hardy to the main event.
Armageddon '07

Other matches include two matches with Matt Hardy vs. Joey Mercury & Mr. Kennedy, two matches with Jeff Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin & a steel cage match vs. Umaga, and a match from the OMEGA promotion with Matt & Jeff vs. Gregory Helms' team of the Serial Thrillaz with alternative commentary.

In the end, I'll give WWE credit for making both documentries somewhat different in how they didn't repeat a bunch of information in regards to both men.  I heavily enjoyed Matt's documentry & it made me gain respect for him even more as far as how much he loves the wrestling business & has taken on so many task in & out the ring along with his heavy dedication to the sport that I agree with, is always overlooked by Jeff's more ""colorful"" personality & daredevil ring style plus I like that they didn't make the whole Edge/Matt/Lita thing such a huge detail as that isn't the only important thing that's happened in Matt's career.  The only things I can say on Matt's documentry that's a negative is that Lita should have been interviewed as well since he was an important part of some of the subjects involved (she said her on MySpace that she wasn't asked to be interviewed).  Jeff's documentry (which was under an hour) however I felt was just there & didn't really do anything for me as it focused more on his life outside of wrestling than anything else.  They could have at least talked about the feud with Nitro that led to a feud between MNM & the Hardys that spread across all three brands for months.  And I also felt that eventhough some of these matches are good on here, for this being the first Hardy Boyz DVD in 7 years, and now in retrospect with Jeff Hardy already striking out twice on the Wellness Policy, unless WWE plans on pushing Matt Hardy to the moon (which I don't see) then this could be the last Hardy Boyz DVD we ever see so I felt that a bunch of rare matches could have been put on here instead of some of the random ""nothing special"" matches put on here that would have been more bang for the buck.  Matches like either the steel cage or ladder matche from RAW against Edge & Christian, the I.C./European Unification Ladder Match between Jeff & RVD, a match from the Matt Hardy/Gregory Helms feud, or the Hardyz vs. MNM match from the ECW PPV which I concider a modern day ""classic.""  In the end, what was lacking in matches on Matt's disc was made up by the good documentry & extras while what Jeff's lacked in the documentry was made up for by the matches on his disc so I recommend.",1211068800,2,10454,4.524668435013263
3305840,4,B00120LPOW,"I was hesitant to buy thi set. I don't know why, considering I own over 85% of the other WWE/WWF dvds. I really enjoyed Hardy Boyz Leap of Faith dvd but that contained all of the greatest matches and did not contain blurred WWF logos. Back to this dvd though. A commerical of this set looked cool so I bought it the next day.

Matt Hardy dvd is good. A one hour story of Matt has some good moments and is overall well done. I bought it for the Edge, Lita, and Matt saga; You get one side of the story (Matt's of course), if Edge's dvd has a bio i'm sure you'll hear his side. I enjoy the footage of there early days. I wish thy put some early talent enchancement matches on this dvd but the matches are good overall. Some shocking moments are they mention ROH and have a second clip of Beniot.

Jeff Hardy is pretty much the same as the Matt dvd. It shows some of the stuff he does outside the ring which is neat. Only shocking moment is he mentions TNA.

Overall, im surprised they mentioned both ROH and TNA on the same WWE dvd. Its weird too hear WWE acknowledge two current companys that alot of people think are better then WWE at this point. Overall, if your a Hardy's fan-you already own it. I enjoyed the dvd for the biographies and early footage of there careers. The matches are good but Leap of Faith dvd had the earlier and slightly better matches. A good companion piece to Leap of Faith. Worth it.",1210118400,7,1411,4.199261992619927

The main discs of each brother are documentaries about real life problems.

3305856,5,B00120LPOW,"TWIST OF FATE is music to my ears.  It celebrates the Cameron, NC brothers as individuals, as well as their tag team run that catapulted them to stardom.  It addresses the negative aspects and criticisms that both men have endured.  It even goes so far as to acknowledge that there is another wrestling promotion out there (well...TNA really only gets mentioned for a few moments).

I hate to review TWIST OF FATE as a single DVD set, because part of the point is to reveal Matt & Jeff as separate people.  However, my praise and criticisms for both stories are the same.

Both documentaries (Matt's is 59 minutes, Jeff's is 47 minutes) tell compelling stories of the brothers' upbringing, early wrestling exposure, bumps in their personal lives, and plans for the future.  My greatest fears were twofold: I was concerned that the documentaries would be underdeveloped, and that it was too soon to a biography DVD on wrestlers whose careers are likely far from over.

TWIST OF FATE subverts both of those concerns very quickly.  There is plenty of detail given to Matt and Jeff, in their singles and tag team careers.  We get to see Matt book his OMEGA league in the early 90s, his rise with Jeff in the tag division, his breakoff into ""Version 1.0"", and the heartbraking split from Amy Dumas that everybody knows.  We get to see not only Jeff's role with Matt in the early years through the Attitude Era, but also get a glance at Jeff's passion for being an artist (he paints and records music).

For some reason, the WWE's coverage of Jeff's reported substance abuse issues from around 2003 seems to have barely scratched the surface.  I don't want to see Jeff get buried on DVD, but the gossip and rumors surrounding this issue are much more grim than either Jeff or WWE admit in the program.  Given the Wellness Policy violation around the time this DVD came out, my concerns haven't been relieved very much.

My other initial concern was that this was too soon to do a biography on Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy.  While it might've been too soon (Matt's ECW Title and Jeff's new WWE Title push happened when TWIST OF FATE came out), I think this allows the WWE to celebrate the careers of the two brothers while they're on a hot streak.  Despite the occasional roadblock the two men have encountered, the TWIST OF FATE documentaries reveal both Matt and Jeff to be loyal and passionate wrestlers whose enthusiasm has rarely been down.  They're so enamored to be involved with the WWE product that there's no reason for either of them to be bitter about their careers.  Hopefully, it will stay that way.  Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy have little controversy in their lives, and frankly have very little to complain about in terms of their careers.

The last issue I want to address about TWIST OF FATE is the Extras.  There's been a lot of negativity thrown around that the 2-disc set is lacking in this department.  While it's not stacked, I don't think there's a whole lot to complain about.
_______________________________________________

Many WWE fans seem to forget that almost every single Hardyz Ladder Match is on the LADDER MATCH DVD.  The same people who complain that WWE keeps releasing the same matches on more than one DVD are the same people who're upset a Ladder Match isn't on this TWIST OF FATE set.  Get Over It!

Instead, the WWE has treated us to a solid (if unusual) bunch of matches.  In my opinion, the two discs' extra matches are about equal:

Disc #1 - Matt Hardy
* The Tag Team Match from OMEGA shows what talent the Hardy Boyz had before entering the WWF. (7.0 / 10)

* I have no idea why the VENGEANCE 2004 match against Kane is on here, other than for historical purposes.  This was when Kane was after Lita.  Sorry to say, I don't think it's very good.  (5.5 / 10)

* The Steel Cage Match against Edge from 2005 is my personal favorite of all of their matches.  That top-of-the-Cage legdrop is still amazing.  (8.0 / 10)

* There's a SMACKDOWN Match from 2007 against Joey Mercury.  While this is a decent match, I would've loved to see the match Matt had against King Booker one week later.  That was a real Match-of-the-Year candidate.  (7.0 / 10)

*  I'm ecstatic that WWE remembered the great one-on-one match with Matt & Mr. Kennedy in May 2007.  I had the privilege of seeing it when it was first broadcast, and can now give my DVR some extra recording space.  (8.0 / 10)
_______________________________________________

Disc #2 - Jeff Hardy
* I don't recall the ROYAL RUMBLE 2000 Table Match being released on DVD anywhere before.  Even if it has, this was still the best Table Match until SURVIVOR SERIES 2002.  How ironic, both were in Madison Square Garden. (9.0 / 10)

* Big props to the WWE for acknowleding that the IC Title victory from Triple H even existed!  For years, this has been a forgotten match that only the most loyal WWE fan has remembered.  And guess what: it's still a very good one. (7.5 / 10)

* Although I preferred their RAW Ladder Match, the Steel Cage Match against Johnny Nitro is a good one.  Plus, the Ladder Match is on WWE's LADDER MATCH 3-disc set. (7.0 / 10)

* The RAW match against Shelton Benjamin is decent.  Never boring, but my fondest memories of Shelton Benjamin are more exciting than this particular match. (7.0 / 10)

* The World Tag Team Titles Match included against Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch is the best between these two teams, and remains a Match-of-the-Year candidate in my eyes.  Finally, I can stop considering buying the subpar JUDGMENT DAY 2007 DVD.  (8.0 / 10)

* The ARMAGEDDON 2007 matchup between Triple H and Jeff Hardy hasn't improved or diminished since I first saw it.  As I said in my review of this PPV, a good match, but most of it consists of signature spots you've seen both men do for years.  (7.0 / 10)

* Lastly, there's a Steel Cage Match against Umaga that occurred in earlier this year.  While I can't understand how the Samoan Bulldozer actually lost to a man half his size, this is pretty entertaining for TV standards.  (6.5 / 10)

TWIST OF FATE: THE MATT AND JEFF HARDY STORY is a terrific DVD.  It might not be the definitive set that fans would expect to see years down the road.  But I liked how this DVD set is a current prespective, and not a reflection of the past.

3305859,4,B00120LPOW,"The Hardy brothers are one of the most talented teams out there today. They have won the intercontinental title, european, hardcore, and of course the tag team titles in their own separate rights. This two disc documentary is a good way to see how the Hardys became superstars of today.

Disc 1
Disc one is only about Matt's story but others speak on matters such as Jeff and Edge. It starts with Matt telling how him and Jeff lost their mother at early ages and how their father took care of them. Matt then moves to how he became a promoter early in his career & then coming to the WWE with Jeff. He talks about his struggles early in his WWE career and then expresses how the ladder match and the tables match launched his and Jeff's tag team success. Also how Lita came to be a part of the Hardys and then the relationship her and Matt had together. Jeff and Matt being split up and becoming individual stars. The matter of the whole Edge and Lita thing is touched on and how Matt and Edge formed a rivalry based on that as well.

3305860,4,B00120LPOW,"2008 has been a banner year for WWE DVD releases. With match anthologies already releases this year for Steve Austin, Triple H, & The Rock. As good as reliving those classic matches again and again are, I have been longing for some of the WWE's superbly produced documentaries instead. Some prime past examples includes documentaries on Bret Hart, Jake Roberts, ECW, and the AWA. Now we get not one, but two of them in the two disc release of Twist of Fate: The Matt and Jeff Hardy Story.

WWE already released a Hardy Boyz documentary on the tag team itself several years ago, so this time each disc is dedicated to each Hardy. Of the two features, I found Matt's to cover more ground. Both documentaries spend a good deal of time showcasing the Hardyz breaking into the WWE scene as opening card contenders who almost always lost. This footage shows how far these two have come in the WWE, rarely do wrestlers nowadays break in as the Hardyz did, and it was intriguing to see these two modern superstars get tossed around by the likes of Kama and Nikolai Volkoff in the mid-90s.

Matt's feature also covers a bit more of the Hardyz tag team history, with their rise through the then-amazing tag team ranks of the late 1990s/early 2000s. Those moments brought back many fond memories when WWE actually cared about their tag team division. Aside from the tag team background, Matt's feature clocks in with a wealthy amount of content on his first singles run on Smackdown in 2002-2003 with a helping of ""Mattitude"" highlights at its side. Of course, there is the whole behind-the-scenes Matt/Edge/Lita love triangle covered in-depth. Matt appears to have mellowed down from the drama that took place three years ago, but still he and Edge provide some interesting insight on the fiasco that led to Matt's firing and prompt rehiring, where the WWE brought the love triangle to their television storylines and brought out some memorable matches between Edge & Matt.

If you were going in to Jeff's disc expecting an intense look at his wrestling career, than you may find Jeff's documentary a little underwhelming. Since Matt's disc devotes more time to the tag team era, Jeff's story focuses more on his unorthodox lifestyle. This feature gives a taste what a day of the extraordinary life of Jeff Hardy is like. Jeff shows off a lot of his unique art work, mummified sculptures, original compositions and his custom dirt bike track. Interesting indeed, but given the fact that Jeff's feature is about a good 15 minutes shorter than Matt's, it is surprising to see about half of Jeff's documentary dedicated to it.

Jeff does reflect on his big 2002 singles run which saw a WWE Title main event against Undertaker on RAW. Unfortunately his big run got cut off as how Jeff admits he got wrapped up in the world of drugs, which culminated in his release in 2003. I would have preferred more insight on what transpired behind the scenes here, but Jeff mostly dodges around the facts and gives the basics and sums up that he got back into ring shape by taking a year off and spending time at home. He briefly touches on his TNA run, which then landed him a job back in WWE in 2006. Interesting to hear how Jeff got back into the WWE, but again, Jeff seemed limited in what he was allowed to say here, as they rushed through covering how we was working in a different promotion. It is worth noting that the shooting for this DVD wrapped up shortly before Jeff got suspending for failing a drug test this year, which followed coincidentally with his home burning down a few days later, so don't be surprised to see that none of that is covered here.

Since this is a WWE video release, both discs feature several bonus matches in their entirety. These mostly consist of single matches, but there are a couple tag team matches thrown in (including one from the old Hardy-run indy promotion, OMEGA) for good measure. Some notable single matches are Matt's cage match against Edge from Unforgiven 2005, Jeff's cage match with Umaga from earlier this year, Matt's grudge match against Kane from Vengeance 2004, and Jeff's bout with Triple H from Armageddon 2007. Most of the other matches aren't as spectacular, but should still provide plenty of thrills for any Hardy fan.

Even though Jeff's feature is a mild letdown (yet still worth a viewing), both documentaries combine to form a nice package. Throw in the bonus matches and you got one heck of a DVD set that every Hardy fan must see.

8243429,5,B00120LPOW,"Ever since i was a kid and grew up through the ""Attitude Era"" my favorite high flying superstars have always been the Hardys & RVD. But this dvd right here is a 2disc set,each disc devoted to 1 of the Hardy brothers. Disc 1 is all about Matt Hardy & it is shot like documentary style,with interviews & never before seen interviews involving OMEGA promotion company(Matt's brilliant idea,pretty much what got em going into the business) The documentary also gets into the issues with Amy Dumas(Lita) and Adam Copeland(Edge) which i thought was very informative seeins' how i stopped watching wrestling after Wrestlemania 20. But this documentary about Matt & his home & personal family issues(losing their mother,when Matt was 12 & Jeff was 9)
It also goes into showing home videos from when the Hardys were youngsters and made their own ring out of a trampoline & ropes out of garden hoses. There are also 5 matches as bonus features(in full) and they include OMEGA Wrestling,the Hardys vs The Serial Thrillaz(Hurricane Helms & Shannon Moore) and that's a solid oldschool match. Match #2 No DQ Matt vs Kane,that's an excellent match and i don't want to give away who wins,but if you already know that's cool i just don't want to ruin it for people. Match #3 Cage Match-Matt vs Edge,another excellent match with Matt doing a monster leg-drop off the top of the cage. Lots and lots of blood,violence and brutal wrestling,that cage is relentless. Match #4 Money in the Bank Qualifying match-Matt vs Joey Mercury,this is pretty sick because they are both high flyers. It isn't as brutal as the previous matches but it's still great. Match #5-Matt vs Mr. Kennedy,nothing too great except for the last couple minutes that's where it gets crazy.
Disc 2 is all the same style as disc 1 with Matt,only Jeff's interviews and documentary footage is 48 minutes as too Matt's 1 hour documentary,that is the only difference. However i find myself more satisfied learning more about Jeff & seeing his personal life,like his alumini-mummies,his artwork and paintings,his music & writings and even his dogs. There are some really deep personal things they reveal,but they don't really get into his issues with the law & personal demons(and that's ok because the dvd isn't supposed to crumb anr bash Jeff) there are lots of interviews with their personal friends and opponents. Hurricane Helms,Shannon Moore & Jim Ross all voice their opinions. I found Jeffs disc to be more interesting because Jeff's matches on disc 2 are just insane. Now to the special bonus stuff(7 matches as to Matt's 5) but Match #1 Hardys vs Dudleys-I can't even stress how sweet this is,both teams are known for being innovative. Match #2 Intercontinental title match HHH vs Jeff Hardy-This is brutal man,what an amazing display of both athletes but in the end Jeff takes the win becaus the insane ending. Match #3 Cage match for Intercontinental championship Jeff Hardy vs Johnny Nitro-this is a sick high-flying match where Jeff really shines and does insane maneuvers to keep the title.
Match #4 Money in the Bank qualifying match Jeff vs Shelton Benjamin-this is a really quick match but good nonetheless because Jeff & Shelton do some intense top rope tricks but Jeff dominates and advances to the Money in the Bank match.
Match #5 World Tagteam Title match Hardys vs Cade & Murdoch-this was another really crazy match that went back & forth but it shows how the Hardy boys work so well on their own,but even more in sync together & the Hardys pick up the win.
Match #6 HHH vs Jeff Hardy(Winner gets a title shot at Royal Rumble) at first the match starts slow with Jeff holding his hand out in sportsmanship & HHH just take a cheap shot,eventually smacking Jeff telling him to fight him...well Jeff does & he does a damn good job keeping up with HHH & he gets the win after 1 of the most insane roll up/reversals ever. Jeff advances to Royal Rumble & in the end Hunter claps in amazement.
Match #7 Cage Match Umaga vs Jeff Hardy-wow man all i can say is wow,Jeff takes out Umaga with a monsterous whisper in the wind off the top of the cage,Orton tries to distract Jeff by standing outside and slamming the cage onto Jeff. Orton throws 3 chairs in the ring and Jeff damn near breaks em all on Umaga,Jeff picks up the win. All in all this is a great dvd set for fans of the Hardys,like Leap of Faith it has great matches but more informative here on this 2disc set. If you want more Hardy action pick up Jeffs My Life My Rules or even the Hardy Boys show or even the Ladder Match dvd sets because they have every ladder or TLC match with the Hardys. All in all this was very informative dvd rhat Hardy fans should not pass up. 5 stars for sure.",1433721600,,4707,4.651860744297719
