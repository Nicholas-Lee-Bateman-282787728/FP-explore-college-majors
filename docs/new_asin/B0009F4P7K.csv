8060001,5,B0009F4P7K,Our entire family enjoyed this video.  It was very funny and we all enjoyed the clean humor.,1258848000,,92,4.411764705882353
8060002,5,B0009F4P7K,"Wonderful, hilarious, soooo funny! Thor Ramsey is one of the funniest comedians I have ever heard. He is a christian, and VERY clean! My family laughed for over an hour and it was worth every minute.",1219363200,2,199,4.555555555555555
8060003,4,B0009F4P7K,Thor is hilarious!  His routine about his mom's behavior and the cheerleading affect is worth the price alone.,1199318400,,110,5.111111111111111
8060004,5,B0009F4P7K,"Thor Ramsey is one of the funniest guys out there today. The beauty of this DVD is that it includes both the televised version of ""Bananas"", and the entire uncut routine guest hosted by Chonda Pierce. Just skip to the uncut, longer routine and get ready to laugh. If you've seen ""Thou Shalt Laugh"", you'll recognize a few jokes, but not a lot. This is one of my family's favorite ""Bananas"" shows (Taylor Mason wins top honors with the puppets) and if you give it a chance you'll understand why.",1176768000,4,494,4.5
