1201504,4,B00000F3JB,"While this film may be based on true events, I saw The Final Option as a satire.  If you watch this movie and take it all for face value then its terrible.  When you think of it as a satirical look at foreign affairs and anti terrorism, its brilliant.  Well done!  Enjoy!",1103760000,,271,4.153846153846154
1201505,5,B00000F3JB,"This movie, loosely based on how the SAS rescued the hostages in the Iranian Embassy in 1980, is believable and not so believable.
The action is believable; the demands of the terrorists(that the UK nuke Scotland) I did not find terribly believable.
However, there are two parts in this action-packed movie that are truly food for thought. The first is the conversation between the British Foreign Secretary and the terrorist leader.  He asks her if she thinks she can achieve a peaceful or even a better world by murdering all the hostages.  In other words, aren't her means also her ends?  She tries to argue that but in the end concedes his point to a fellow terrorist.
And the other part was the very end.  That's when the people who orchestrated the whole thing, who paid for all those deaths, cheerfully went off to dinner at some ritzy London restaurant assuring each other that there is always a next time.
Indeed there is.",1062979200,9,931,4.693251533742331
1201506,4,B00000F3JB,"From the deserts of Africa to Iraq, the Special Air Service Regiment of the Brish Army is renowned for their derring-do and never say die attitude. This movie is a dramatization and tribute to the courageous men of the SAS and was probably motivated by the public interest after the real life Iranian Embassy seige in London. Lewis Collins who plays Capt Peter Skellern SAS goes undercover for MI5 the Security Service to infiltrate a violent anti-war ""ban the bomb"" group planning a big terrorist operation. He becomes intimate with the group's highly sexed but really ugly looking leader. In the final climatic scene, you go into the skin of an SAS Counter Revolutionary Warfare black clad trooper as he takes out the terrorists in the US Ambassador's residence. The action sequences are authentic especially as the technical advisors were serving members of the ultra secretive SAS. The speed of the action sequences are breathtaking especially the ""double taps"" or 2 shots to the brain technique used by the SAS CRW troopers. Note too the quick entry techniques used like the shooting out of the door hinges by 12 gauge combat shotguns. The techno music is very excitiing and inspiring too. The action movie buff will definitely enjoy this movie. When I first saw this movie in 1982 in England, the Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament supporters actually protested outside the cinema!

1201507,5,B00000F3JB,"The Final Option is an action movie cult classic that features the most accurate breaching and close quarters combat sequences ever to be captured on film. Peter Skellen, played by Lewis Collins, is fantastically ruthless and calculating. Happily, British filmakers don't feel a need to portray all ""good"" guys as angelic heroes. The movie has a couple dated (early 80s) scenes, but its plot is almost too relevant for today. After having watched this movie annually for 20 years, I can assure you that it is neither overacted nor poorly contrived. The movie is simply unaffected and professional, just like the SAS.",1037145600,5,616,5.049019607843137
1201508,4,B00000F3JB,"I really enjoyed this movie. This movie features infiltration to gather human intellegence. But the true star of this movie is (for the most part) the very realistic depictation of how the British SAS (Special Air Service) operate. The SAS is the UK's version of the USA's Delta Force. It should be remembered that SAS predates our Delta Force by a bunch of years, and that most objective observers would say that the SAS is the anti-terrorist force against which others are measured. As Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan said in ""Patriot Games"" ""SAS: When you care enough to send the very best."" The movie is a fictional account of SAS's operation against Iranian captors who took over the Iranian counsulate in Great Britain. A definite and enthusiastic ""thumbs up.""",1034035200,,757,4.875968992248062
1201509,4,B00000F3JB,"Great movie. Released in the U.K. under ""Who Dares,Wins"". Good action with a decent, believable plot. The only hokey parts of the movie were when two S.A.S. troopers were helicoptered in dangling by ropes and were ""placed"" exactly into two different windows.....yeah right. Maybe if the Helo driver had about 5 gazillion hours on that aircraft. The other was when the evil, female terrorist leader was zapped by an S.A.S trooper and flew back about 20 feet. Unless the MP-5 has changed from 9MM to a 50 cal. slug, I just don't think it's possible. Even though I slammed the movie a little, it is still my favorite flick and if you don't have this movie, GET A COPY.

1201761,3,B00000F3JB,"A handsome SAS warrior goes undercover (literally) and uses his irresistible charm to get inside (literally) a hot looking but kooky female terrorist leader's band of terrorists. The terrorists' plan: Stage a raid on the London residence of the US Ambassador who is hosting a dinner party for the visiting US Secretary of State and other dignitaries, and hold them all hostage. The terrorists waylay a busload of American Air Force band members who're on their way to provide musical entertainment at the Ambassador's place. The guerrillas then don the band uniforms which allows them to pass unchallenged into the dinner party. The raid goes smoothly at first, but realizing that the demands the bad guys are making are quite impossible to meet, the authorities decide to stage a raid of their own using the highly trained SAS anti-terrorism unit. Not a great movie, but not bad either, and it has some thought provoking moments when an argument takes place between the US Ambassador and the hot-babe chief terrorist. Hot Babe Terrorist: Judy Davis. US Ambassador: Richard Widmark.  Handsome SAS Warrior: Lewis Davis. Even though it was an early 80's movie, it has more of a Swingin' Sixties feel to it.

1201812,1,B00000F3JB,"An SAS propaganda piece aimed at smearing the reputation of ""peaceniks"" or those in favor of nuclear disarmament. To set them up as villains, the ""peaceniks' were shown to commit murder in order to promote the greater good. Their very plan was to evacuate civilians over a large portion of Scotland in order to drop a nuclear missile there for the purpose of reminding the population of the devastation brought by nuclear armaments. The nuclear missile was to be received by the ""peaceniks"" by threatening to kill high ranking officials and their wives in the American embassy in Britain occupied by them.( How they expected anyone in their right mind to agree to relinquish control of a nuclear missile to save a few lives is another question).
No wonder Ronald Reagan loved this fantastical movie that portrays members of the peace movement as stupid terrorists ready to cause bloody mayhem on a grand scale in order to promote their nave agenda.

Not for nothing did the officer responsible for what would become the formation, selection, and training procedures for SFOD-D spend a lot of time with the SAS.  Yes, there's Hollywood stuff in there, but when this film was made, it reflected some of the real world goings-on of the time:  political fights over nuclear weapons in NATO and elsewhere, violent revolutionary groups with their mixtures of hard core terrorists and useful idiots of good intention, and radical priests who knowingly or unknowingly provided aid and comfort to terrorists.

Seems like movie makers are producing their 'products' by formulating from a audience demographics construction kit.  Find a tried and tired plot and some cheap or out of work actors.  Now dust off the demographics templates and fill them in with tried and tired formulae.  You know, like the action piece, maybe some effects, the romantic interest (for the girls), bad sex (for the guys), blood and cruelty (for the kids) and a large slather of sanctioned sociopathy laced with betrayals, multiple personalities and 'deemed insignificant' collateral victims.  Oh and who cares about plot?

Why would his contact in downtown London be a street seller? If he was working in a foreign country I would believe it, but not in his own country. He needed this guy for money  and instructions, come on. Why would the terrorists really believe that military helicopters landing was bring dignitaries to the site. Why wouldn't they have a TV on to see if their first demand was met? Why would they allow live TV coverage of the event, especially with SAS deploying. There is not a terrorist in the world that is so stupid as to believe the (movie) demands would be met.

In the United States we don't quite have the same fear of annihalation as do we.  During the Cold War the average missile from East Germany could reach the UK.  The rest of Western Europe was an easy target.

Various radical groups throughout Europe and the UK attempted to thwart US, UK, FRG (W. Germany) and NATO efforts.  This movie does an outstanding job conveying both the feel of the time and the problem.

There is some very exciting action and great acting.  Yes, it does seem dated, because it is.  But don't let the ""bitchen music"" and haircuts, especially for the supposed U.S. Air Force personnel fool you.  That was sort of real for the times.  (Not the Marines, though.  They missed that one.)  However, I am impressed that they fit the ribbons right.

This is an interesting movie.  A radical group breaks in and holds the American ambassador residence hostage demanding the military fires a missile at Holy Loch, a Naval base known for housing U.S. submarines.  The group wants to do that ""in the name of peace"".  Richard Widmark's portrayal of the U.S. Secretary of State is brilliant.",1437523200,,1236,4.626728110599078

1202260,4,B00000F3JB,"I only rented and watched Final Option because it is referred to in a 1990s book about Tony Tait, the notorious informant who snitched on the Hells Angels, and Lavigne wrote a pretty good book about it.  Tait's wife Brenda Fowler told the FBI that Tony woke up every morning and watched selected scenes from Final Option. Okay, fine -- I dropped whatever I was doing and screened Final Option.  I think Tait was enthralled by the last action where the SAS = British Special Forces drops in on the hostage/terrorist situation and straightens out those terrorists but good.  It's straight ahead; predictable, you might say.  If you were raised on James Bond ever since the early Sixties, you know just where this is going.  But that's okay.  It's good.  Like, I wonder what Sean Connery would say?  If Sean Connery would give this five stars, I'd give it five stars too.  Right now, because some of the characters are cardboard-y, that's the four stars; but if it turns out that you have to do it that way -- have predictable characters as a backdrop for the enigmatic characters of Skellen (the SAS faked-dropout) and Frankie Leith (the woman chief terrorist).  See what you think of Skellen's facial gesture(s) after the big shootout at the end with Frankie dead on the floor from a commando's carbine.  If that had been acted with just a little wistfulness, theyd'a got the whole five stars for sure.  ONe thing you can safely pay not much attention to is the dialog back and forth about politics, and nuclear destruction; it's all clear and correct but movies arent' about talk.  For any number of reasons, Final Option is worth your time to watch.
BTW one thing I still wonder about is Skellen's motorcycle ride back home to see his wife and kid.  I think we're supposed to get some information about him from his extremely nattily appointed bike and leathers and helmet with the matching pinstripe motif.

Anyhow, I always liked this film. It was something of a sleeper back when it came out in 1982, and its politics won't be much to the liking of many folks. But it is based on an actual incident, and certainly the depictions of intelligence, counter-intelligence, terrorism, and anti-terrorism activities seem quite authentic.

Also, unlike many similar movies of the modern age, it allows you time to breathe between action sequences, and--most important, at least to me--the opportunity to explore the motives and claims of the various factions. In particular, the dialogue between Judy Davis (as the leader of the hostage-taking terrorists) and Richard Widmark (as the United States Secretary of State) is worth the price of admission alone.

Richard Widmark's role is small but excellent, and--as always--he delivers. Judy Davis as the terrorist leader and (sort of) love interest is also excellent: she was at the peak of her bankability in this movie. Lewis Collins, to me an illustrious unknown, was evidently a highly-respected TV actor in Britain, and it shows: the friend with whom I saw the movie always thought he should have been given a crack at the James Bond franchise.

Everyone is believable, everyone is working their heart out. The movie doesn't suffer from the Bruckheimer Syndrome (you don't get an explosion every twenty seconds), nor is it overwhelmed by special effects. It's tense and thrilling right up to the moment they roll credits.

Highly recommended if you are a thinking man who likes action movies.",1362441600,,1757,5.0034246575342465

I saw this movie when it came out in 1982 and when I played it a few years later for an ex special forces buddy of mine, he got that weird look on his face about the helicopter flying the two SAS team members into the upper level windows at the American Ambassador's residence. He pronounced they use to practice that at Bragg!
I do agree the story in the middle was a little weak, but the action was fantastic, believable. It was the first movie that was reviewed by Soldier of Fortune Magazine who devoted the front cover of their magazine to the SAS troops repelling down the front of the building.
I also knew it was a good movie because every liberal reviewer in this country hated it!
Lewis Collins ( the man who could have been Bond ) was superb and I was sorry that he never did anything else significant for the US market after that.
The movie contains what is in my opinion one of Richard Widmark's finest performances.
It is now the 30th anniversary of the production, we have nearly two generations of kids in this country who have never seen it. It is long past due for this movie to be released in this country and I think age will be kind to it.
Sir. Euan Loydd used annoymous technical advisers and I have read the guys in the production who never take their gas masks off were real SAS.
Incidently in the SOF magazine, the author pointed out that Collins who was part of the British reserves at the time and had previously gone through the full entrance course to join the SAS. Upon completing, he was told that his face was too well known and he would not be allowed. Imaging going through what the SEALS refer to as hell week, pass and find out that because you are known publically, you can't be one?
The late Ingrid Pitt will always be beautiful.
No other counter terorrism movie has ever come close to the level of technical detail that this one offers. If I were training special forces anywhere, I would have a copy and viewing at a minimum the hostage rescue would be a manditory part of the course.",1354492800,,2174,4.330882352941177

I was so excited to finally see this great movie get released on a region free blu ray! This title has never been released here in the states on laserdisc, DVD, or blu ray. And thankfully I was able to purchase this import from Arrow for under $15 used and in great condition! The video on this disc is not the greatest, but it is the best I have seen it. For some reason, films from the '80s don't transfer well onto hi def medium. I don't know if it's the film stock used back then or what. Most movies have this softness to them that curses all the future transfers. That is why people are giving this a lower score for that. We must realize this is not a major big budget film in the first place, so I am forgiving of the lack of ""knock my socks off"" with this amazing picture! For what print Arrow had, this will be the best this movie can look (unless there is another prestine print out there), so I will take it and enjoy this classic all over again!
Also, Arrow is re-releasing this blu ray with newer packaging. Arrow informed me that it is the same print, but will not be region free. The new blu ray, they stated, will be region B locked. Why now would they lock this title when this region free version is floating around (it is out of print, of course) is beyond me. But Arrow has always impressed me with their blu ray releases from Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci among others. And this particular release of Who Dares Wins is another winner from their vaults. Thanks Arrow for giving us fans of this film a chance to appreciate this classic in hi def.

Of course it is quite understandable that a film like this, with perhaps a very small following of fans, would not have a total supreme transfer, but I do have to say the picture quality is pretty decent especially on a 52"" LCD Tv. Please, anyone who is a big fan of this movie, keep an open mind, it does look as though it was transferred from a standard DVD but that seems better than a VHS transfer.

1202295,3,B00000F3JB,"The Final Option, 1981 film

The story begins with a peaceful march in a street by Anti-Nuclear protesters. A marcher in the street is shot down by a bolt from a crossbow (no noise). Elsewhere an SAS officer is driven out of his regiment for an offense. (This provides an excuse for his anti-government sentiments when he joins the ""People's Lobby"".) A foreigner in a bank donates a large sum to the ""People's Lobby"". The purpose seems to be to create some crime that will destroy the leadership of the PL (who managed to acquire US-made Ingram machine pistols in ""gun-free"" Britain). Skellen joins the PL and reports to his contact. Later Helga poisons this contact on a bus with a spray, but no one else suffers. [This are very bad people.] As part of their plot they hijack a bus with Air Force musicians. ""There's no turning back now."" What do these terrorists plan to do? Skellen will find out.

The military know something is going to happen, but don't know where. The terrorists plan well, they attack the Skellen family. Their plan is to hijack the American Embassy to force them to do some thing. [But are these officials expendable?] Their plan seems to be working. An alert Marine guard challenges them and upsets their plan. The terrorists burst into the dining room. ""It's a bit complicated."" They want a nuclear explosion in the name of peace. [Unconscious humor?] The servants are separated from the officials and their wives. Will their actions create a better world? The US Ambassador speaks to Frankie about terrorism. What will one bomb do? [This discussion seems well-scripted.] Skellen tells Frankie what they will do next. The servants will be released but not the officials. Television carries the news. Frankie tells the authorities of the consequences if they fail to follow directions: all will be killed.

The police monitor Skellen's family. Since the terrorists aren't masked they must not plan to escape. One hostage is killed. [Did his talk give a hint?] The Special Air Services is called in to neutralize the terrorists. Does the bargaining chip held by the terrorists have any value compared to a nuclear explosion? [Are they suicidal?] The SAS blow a hole through a brick wall and kill the terrorists in Skellen's home. Next the SAS helicopters arrive at the roof of the American Embassy. The SAS break into the building and neutralize the terrorists. Then they leave as quickly as they arrived. Back in London a Minister meets with the courier who brought the cash for the PL. They have all the time in the world.

This dramatic message movie was based on true events, like an Embassy invasion and the success of the SAS in their mission to kill or capture the invaders. It is fiction to portray anti-nuclear protesters as terrorists who are paid by a foreign government. Who really wants a nuclear war with a following nuclear winter that will kill the survivors? The story does not tell who shot that crossbow, and why. Was this movie designed publicize the activities of the SAS? One value of this story is telling how an agent provocateur acts so they can be identified. [I wonder how much Maggie had to spend to produce this horror film?] Its like a war propaganda film from the 1940s or 1950s, viewable even if it is now humorous at times for a serious movie.
[I wonder if the actor who played ""Skellen"" was ever considered as ""the next James Bond""?]

This movie, titled ""The Final Option"" here in the United States, is inspired by the SAS rescue of hostages at the Iranian Embassy in London when the British elite paratroopers stormed the building before the world's television camera's in the early 1980s. It is said that producer Euan Lloyd (who also produced classics such as ""The Wild Geese"" and ""The Sea Wolves"") registered every title he could think of after the incident, determined that the event would serve as a dramatic movie.
In the UK the movie goes under the title ""Who Dares Wins"" (which is the motto of the SAS). The action is switched from the Iranian Embassy to the U.S. ambassadors residence (evidently to make it more marketable to a U.S. audience) and the terrorists become nuclear disarmament militants.
In his first major leading role was Lewis Collins who was most familiar to British audiences for his role in the television series ""The Professionals"" and was among the public's favorite choices to take on the role of James Bond. Here he plays an SAS officer who is assigned to infilitrate the militants group and foil whatever mission they have planned.
The movie is a particular favorite of mine and on this imported British Blu-ray whereas the main feature plays on North American blu-ray players, the special features do not. The commentary however is playable on American Blu-ray players since it is an audio track and is quite engaging and interesting with the director phoning in his comments from New Zealand and producer Euan Lloyd in London.",1274313600,17,1843,4.79874213836478

The film does drag in some parts.
The US Army Ranger and the German GSG-9 characters were poorly portrayed - no Ranger would have that sort of long hair or be that unprofessional. But, hey, the film is about the SAS, not anybody else. Those two could have been left out.

Overall, pretty good action flick that reminds of earlier times, earlier terrorism, etc....Worth watching...",1189382400,,624,4.522123893805309
1202306,5,B00000F3JB,"Based on the book THE TIPTOE BOYS by James Follett(under the pseudonym George Markstein), this movie adaptation works on many levels. If you like movies chock full of military action and anti-terror ops done realistically without Jerry Bruckheimer-style slowmo and weepie music when some terrorist gets creamed, this is for you - straight and to the point! Even 25 years on, this movie is still as thrilling, heart pounding and relevant as ever.

In the movie, SAS officer Peter Skellern goes undercover into the People's Lobby, a far-left wing peacenik anti-nuclear organisation to investigate possible terrorist infiltration - and gets close to the group's leader Frankie Leith(well played by Judy Davis) to gather intel. Trouble is, insiders are watching him and when the group launch their attack on the US Ambassador's Residence and threaten to detonate a nuke in Scotland in the name of peace(!!??!! shows how hypocritical such radical organisations are at times when they let themselves get manipulated by extremists!!) and  as if that wasn't bad enough, his wife and child are taken hostage. Watch out for Ingrid Pitt(WHERE EAGLES DARE) here, playing a cold-blooded terrorist with plenty of energy! The fight between her and Skellern's wife in front of her baby is just priceless, adding to the tension.

This movie would never be shot today - if it was, by the likes of Bruckheimer or Tamahori, the politically-correct radicals would be the good guys, the Brits the bad guys and the Americans would be the heroes - and you'd get a Nashville-written corporate cheese country ballad by the likes of Martina McBride or Faith Hill at the end credits as opposed to Roy Budd's pulse-pounding action soundtrack here! Watch out as well for the scene where the American military officers are discussing tactics for world peace with Frankie and generally telling her that terrorism on behalf of the 'common people' is unjustified, almost reducing the scumbag to a wreck! Genius!",1187913600,3,1977,5.114551083591332
1202317,5,B00000F3JB,This is one of the better movies made regarding the take down of a building in a hostage situation.  The last twenty minutes are worth the price of the movie.  Super job of showing what highly trained Soldiers can do.  Highly encourage others to see this movie.,1187740800,,261,4.51063829787234
1202318,2,B00000F3JB,"This was Lewis Collins first major film role after TV parts in ""The Cuckoo Waltz"" and ""The Professionals"". The whole film seems to run as a feature-length version of the latter about the adventures of the CI5 operatives Bodie; maybe Doyle was on holiday? It is overly long and drawn out, and thus very slow in the middle section; 30mins could easily have been removed by moderate rewriting and judicious editing to no serious detriment of the plot.

However, the climatic siege sequence (based on the real-life events in the Iranian Embassy) is very good, as are some of early scenes showing the SAS basic training methods. The plot basically concerns Collins as an undercover SAS operative who infiltrates a subversive terrorist group (disguised as a `peace lobby') before they attack and hold hostage some highly important political figures for a ransom.

Their demands are totally ludicrous, i.e., the dropping of a nuclear bomb on the Scottish submarine base in the name of `peace'! Naturally enough the shooting of one uppity hostage leads to the sending in of the SAS, who kill every terrorist in sight (very efficiently). The film looks exactly what it is, a hurried attempt by the producers to cash-in on the sudden blaze of popularity of the SAS who had, hitherto, been relatively unknown. In fact, this public fascination with a secretive and highly deadly military group continues to this day in the form of books, films, TV shows, etc.

Ingrid Pitt has her first co-starring role in 9 years (last seen in the ""Wicker Man"" in `73) as Helga, a German terrorist leader and trainer - a role that would typecast her for a while (""Wild Geese II""), perhaps because of her slight accent. She leads the assault on Collins' house, holding his wife, child, and a policeman hostage to ensure his cooperation. She is ultimately shot dead by a special squad of the SAS who blow a hole in the wall from the next house in order to catch the terrorists by surprise. This is a gripping action scene, possibly one of the best in the film, as tension builds when Ingrid tries to shut the crying child up and is attacked by its mother; will she be killed before the SAS can get to her? No, of course not, but its fun waiting and watching to see exactly what and how it will happen.

Overall, as I said, the film is too slow and talky, with the above-mentioned exceptions, in particular the final 10-15 mins, and so only gets a 3 star rating. However, the video can be recommended for fans of the older TV shows, such as ""The Sweeney"", ""The Professionals"", ""target"", etc.

This movie put Collins in the running for the role of Bond, but as it turns out he lost out - pity really, he might have been good with the right script.",1175644800,3,2716,4.614906832298137
1202319,5,B00000F3JB,"Now 25 years since it was filmed in England and Wales, this movie is an as yet ""undiscovered"" classic. The supporting cast of UK and US actors are instantly recognizable. It includes Richard Widmark, Robert Webber, Maurice Roeves, Patrick Allen, Edward Woodward and Tony Doyle, the latter currently famous for his role in Ballykissangel. While the beautiful Ingrid Pitt plays a very convincing ""evil"" terrorist who we, the audience, can love to hate.

Other reviewers on this page have been rather unkind to leading lady, Judy Davis, describing her as ""ugly"". If you click on her credit link at the top of the Amazon page you can see how many movies she's made and how attractive she is, both before and after 1982. Perhaps it is the early 1980s ""big"" hairstyle and makeup that are not found attractive today. Also, in her role here as a baddy, she sneers her way through the whole movie to impress her leading man, while in doing so repelling us, the audience. The leading man in this movie is played by Lewis Collins, who at that time still enjoyed the notoriety garnered from the very successful ""The Professionals"" action series.

What drives this movie is the superbly photographed action sequences, that are earthy, realistic and devoid of the modern ""Hollywood"" treatment where film shots are overly choreographed. The musical score is upbeat and drives most of the action, though the incidental music for a couple of family scenes is a little too syrupy. The tension builds slowly with occasional outbreaks of violence that we see are secretly financed by an organized international group. We see neo-Nazi ""skinheads"" beat up innocent bystanders and a good old British bobby (police officer) being kicked in the face. Later we are endeared to another unarmed bobby who, despite being repeatedly beaten by terrorists, continues to give words of encouragement to a hostage with a small baby. Thus by the time we approach the climactic events at the end of the movie, we are in no doubt who the good guys and the bad guys are. It is because of the time taken to build this tension that when we finally approach the climax, the urgency feels tangible: you really are sitting on the edge of your seat. I regard the scene where Rosalind Lloyd fights with Ingrid Pitt's character to save the life of her 10 month old baby as one of the most nail-biting sequences ever put onto film.

The first hour of the movie may seem somewhat slow to an US audience as the characterizations are established. Also the anti-Americanism portrayed both in opinions expressed and in on-stage ""entertainment"" may seem extreme, yet at that time, parts of European society were expressing these kinds of sentiments, and so these scenes should be viewed as authentic.

By today's movie standards, the SAS tactics used look somewhat pass, until you remember that this is the movie in which these tactics were first seen, and that this is the movie that many other have followed.

Numerous people involved in the making of this movie are still alive, including Phil Meheux, cinematographer, Ian Sharp, director, Chris Chrisafis, executive producer, and many of the cast. I personally would love to see the 35mm print remastered to a new DVD, with commentary and extras added. What better time than the 25th anniversary of its theatre release?",1158364800,14,3319,4.877659574468085
1202320,4,B00000F3JB,"I saw this movie about twenty+ years ago as a teenager and was initially impressed with the cast and the premise. It was my first introduction to the existence of the SAS and I was both impressed and surprised about their existence.  The storyline is quite simple but very well acted out. Lewis Collins was excellent as Peter Skellen and an excellent job was done in support casting. Legends such as Richard Widmark and Edward Woodward very rarely hurt your chances of wonderfully conveying your storyline.

  Although the film is a bit dated, one can still see just how good action films could be with good scripts good actors. I hope it is released on dvd very soon because i believe it to still be great escapist fun and could easily find a new audience.",1157241600,,757,4.5851851851851855
1202321,3,B00000F3JB,"I had fond memories of this movie which I saw as kid. I recently saw it again and as an adult I must confess it doesn't hold up well. Despite Davis, Widmark and Woodwards additions the acting is stiff.. and that's not saying its stiff upper lip English acting that's saying Collins is a stiff and he's not exactly helped by the script. The GSG and Ranger characters are amatuerishly played by people totally unconvincing (although undoubtly this a film met to pat the SAS on the back- the fact that GSG-9 ie Munich Olympics and Rangers-US Iranian Hostage rescue are depicted here as being school boys that seems a little distasteful).

The plot errors have already been mentioned although admittedly one could argue that a radical anti-nuke group would ""think"" their demands were realistic. But Collins character is so out of place as a deep cover agent, it seems unrealistic to believe the deeply professional SAS character (and Collins doesn't shed this throughout the role, you'd think he'd try to ""look the part"") would be so widely accepted in such a radical group.. ""keep the SAS man close"" so what he can screw up their plans?

Lets just summerize the plot by saying the film is horribly slow for its majority. As for the action scenes while they appeared to be based on real-life SAS tactics the scenes would be just so ho-hum for modern action audiences who've feasted on films from The Matrix to Private Ryan. Adding insult to injury the final dramatic Davis-Collins confrontation is played for laughs (think all those mid-80 Bond Movies with Roger Moore and you can come up with a cheeky one-liner as good or better than the one used here)

Obviously the naivete of the 80s doesn't hold up well in post-911/Beslan/Madrid/London world.

That said, if you saw the movie and were a fan it be worth adding to the collection just for some afternoon escapism, Davis despite her lack of beauty gives the best performance despite the ackwardness of the writing, and as somebody else mentioned the original music is pretty good.

If you had to decide between Chuck Norris' Delta Force (a film that can be considered part of the genre') and this film ... I'd give the nod to Chuck.",1149120000,,2182,4.716535433070866
1202322,4,B00000F3JB,"I remember seeing this in the early 80s when I worked at a movie theater, it must have had some influence on me. In 1984 I joined the Air Force and became a Security Forces member and would later find myself at the front lines of anti-terrorism. I was assigned to a U.S. nuclear bomber base in England where at times I guarded nuclear weapons with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND)camped right outside the gates. One thing sticks out in my mind from my training, when it comes to nuclear weapons hostages will be taken into CONSIDERATION, but would not prevent the recovery of a nuclear weapon, or likewise a detonation of one. So in other words the makers of this film should have done their homework a little better as the main plot point is weak. However having a little training in this area I can the action sequences are pretty good. Another failed plot point is when the main character breaks his cover, which would NEVER happen.

With the recent bombings in London and the political unrest in the world  it's theme is still very much in keeping with the times.  In the UK this movie was Titled ""Who Dares Wins"", which is the slogan for the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) of the British Army.  I won't get into the story line as many before me have commented upon this.  About the only thing that softened it's impact was the Terrorist's Demands which where  that the Ministry of Defence Nuke the Royal Navy base in Scotland. Then there is scene which features a couple of soldiers running around outside the one of the main good guys apartment where his wife and child have been taken hostage. That few second scene makes no sence and I have a feeling it was an editing gaf.  Granted the SAS are about to take out these Terrorists but...  Outside of these very minor gripes, it is a VERY GOOD Movie.  Perhaps a little dark and unspectacular for those looking for the more usual Hollywood high gloss action flicks, as most of the actions happens in the last half hour.  Which starts with the take over of the American Ambassadors Residence, and the Main Good guys apartment.  All this of course ends rather abruptly as the SAS go into action.  My favorite lines are those by a constable also being held hostage in the apartment whos says after the terrorists are taken out ""That was a bit fast for me could you do it again?""

My original fascination back then was because what most viewers do not realize (especially the haters) is that in the final raid scene - the technical advisory role of the SAS turned into an actual part.  When the time came to film the raid, actual SAS operatives offered to perform the duties on film, so you don't see many stuntmen at all in the raid - and it's an added level of realism simply not found in any other film of the time.  If I recall correctly - the director not only filmed them doing it, but also took the time to incorporate little details from stories the real SAS Operatives told about things that had happened during their past operations.  Simply put, these are the guys that walked the walk in a different time - before the surety of technology like Plates,  Nomex, and ELINT.  Even with today's tech, doing CQB right still means the real chance of getting shot, and squaring your own plates up against a threat to protect other team members is part of any good indoor gunfight strategy.
