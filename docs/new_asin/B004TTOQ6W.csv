4466006,5,B004TTOQ6W,"Jane Wyman is at her best in this wonderful musical.  I absolutely love this movie with beautiful costumes, dancing, singing and great humor.  The chemistry with Ray Milland who plays her husband is very entertaining.  Jane was an actress that truly had it all......grace, talent, beauty, class, humor and a husband that would be president.  You 'Go Girl' Go!  If you are a fan of the silver screen & Jane Wyman I promise that you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!!!",1316995200,5,463,4.7974683544303796
4466007,5,B004TTOQ6W,"This is a remake of the ""Awful Truth"" of which I also love.  ""Let's Do It Again"" is a very delightful movie with Jane Wyman and Ray Milland; in which Jane Wyman sings and dances delightfully.  When Jane Wyman tries to teach Ray Milland a leasson it backfires and they end up in divorce.  When Jane finds a new love interest Ray finds way to come between them, when Ray finds a new love interest Jane returns the favor. This is a must own movie so you can see it over and over again.",1316822400,3,482,4.1063829787234045

8440890,5,B004TTOQ6W,This is a great movie with both Jane Wyman and Ray Milland. Jane took her acting career to a whole different level. A couple who still love each other though divorce sabatoges each others relationship with their future prospect. Great comedy and if you are a Jane Wyman fan you will love this.,1365465600,,293,4.547169811320755
8440891,3,B004TTOQ6W,"After a marital misunderstanding, a musical comedy composer (Ray Milland) and his wife (Jane Wyman) file for a divorce even though they still love each other. When she gets a new beau (Aldo Ray) and he gets a new girlfriend (Karin Booth), they each try to break up the other's relationship. In the 1950s, Columbia decided to add Technicolor and remake several of their classic screwball comedies into semi-musicals. Thus IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT became YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT, TOO MANY HUSBANDS became THREE FOR THE SHOW and the Oscar winning THE AWFUL TRUTH ended up as LET'S DO IT AGAIN. They needn't have bothered. The songs are a dull lot, the sparkle is gone and while both Milland and Wyman have displayed comedic gifts in the past, they're on auto pilot here. Oddly, some of the best bits from the 1937 film have been eliminated and nothing worthwhile put in their place. The casting of Aldo Ray in the Ralph Bellamy role backfires. Who wouldn't choose Cary Grant over Bellamy but Milland comes off as smarmy next to the Aldo Ray's likable, hunky doofus. Directed by Alexander Hall (MY SISTER EILEEN). With Leon Ames, Tom Helmore, Kathryn Givney and the dancer Valerie Bettis, who has the one good number in the film.

The Sony MOD DVD-r is a bright colorful transfer.",1337644800,,1276,4.696428571428571
8440892,5,B004TTOQ6W,Jane Wyman usually plays a placid role in most movies I own featuring her. But this movie I Found it very exciting to see her in a different role. I enjoyed watching this dvd very much. Any one who likes Jane Wyman should buy this movie.,1321142400,2,237,4.173913043478261
