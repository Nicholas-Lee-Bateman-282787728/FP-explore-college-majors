5723066,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"The DVD of the London December 2012 production has now appeared, and gives more leisured opportunity for experiencing this famous but unknown work. It is so helpful to those who are considering something new in exploring Meyerbeer, whose works are not generally known these days.

The detail of the cover(s) says it all. The disc comes in a slipcase depicting the gaping mouth of Hell from a medieval Miracle Play. The centre piece features the satanic tempter Bertram. But it is in fact a careful cutout, and when the cover is removed, we are presented by a strikingly attractive montage showing the hero flanked his two heroine mentors (Alice and Isabelle), with his demon-father(Bertram) beneath in infernal fire.
This colourful and rather glamorous image effectively reveals the thematic configuration of this operatic parable of the human dilemma and its spiritual dimension.
It should be said right away that this production is bright and absorbing, rich in iconic allusion and consistently making reference to intriguing artistic prototypes and models in presenting the very rich and complex symbolism of the story

The ROH production of `Robert le Diable' nonetheless did leave much to be desired. At least it was not of the same dreadful nature as the `Eurotrash' productions staged in Berlin (2000, set in a cinema) and Erfurt (2011, set in a mental asylum). The producer Laurent Pelly always has his own perspectives and agendas---as is the case in these days of the ""producers' opera"". Some of his ideas nevertheless do have considerable innate interest.

Pelly has used a series of medieval artistic concepts to underpin certain symbolic elements in the scenario/ The reference to the portrait of Michael the Archangel in act 1 is accompanied by a descending chart, depicting the angel as he appears in a Cathedral fresco. The fairground horses and the overbearing iron frame depict the quandary of the misdirected chivalry of the [anti-]hero.
Act 2 is dominated by the memory of the Duc de Berri's `Tres Riches Heures', the famous illuminated prayer book of the 15c. The miniature castle, vivid primary colours of the costumes, and the final tableau of the tournament are all based on pictorialism inspired by this illustrious book.
In act 3 the eschatological scenes of Hell use the motif of the Last Judgment, especially as realized by the late 15c Flemish painter Hans Memling and also in the more surreal elements by Hieronymous Bosch (rather than the more illustrious Michelangelo version for the Sistine Chapel).
The final act, which for many in the audience seemed comical,was modelled on concepts drawn from the medieval Mystery and Miracle Plays. (In that theatre the dramatic action would mix contemporary life with Biblical imagery derived from the ancient stories.) The big cartoon clouds in which Alice appears show her heavenly alignment; and the flaming, gaping Mouth of Hell indicate Bertram's servitude to infernal forces, typical in the exaggeration of this popular type of entertainment in the Middle Ages.

All this was largely lost on the audience who, quite understandably, live for the effectiveness of the immediate drama and its stage realization. Pelly's ideas are often too clever for their intended purposes, and also contain an unquantifiable element of irony and disassociation (derived, like so many modern productions, from Brecht's theatre of alienation). But at least the production has some coherence and symbolic schema, and provides a viable and largely serious attempt at realizing the intentions of the creators Scribe and Meyerbeer.

The most famous scene in the opera---and indeed one of the most famous in the whole history of dramatic music---is the legendary Ballet of the Nuns in the central act 3 Cloister Scene. This is regrettably the weakest element in Pelly's production.
Here the Gothic imagery is brought to its highpoint in one of the most imaginative and daring stage concepts in opera, when the damned souls of fallen nuns are summoned from their graves to affect the key moment of diabolical temptation. The evocative power of this scene was a theatrical, musical, iconographic and balletic sensation in 1831, and was to prove a key moment in musical history, when Romantic Ballet was born.
The ghostly forms of the spectral figures, dancing in the moonlight of the ruined abbey, is the key concept of the `ballet blanc' that would be re-created in almost identical terms in `Giselle' (the Wilis), `Swan Lake' (the Swans) and `La Bayadre' (the Shades), when the spirits of those who have died in grief or disappointment, or are held in magical enthrallment, re-live their vicarious existence in the realm of night and dreams. (These Gothic ideas were of great topicality at the time, when Mary Shelley's prophetic novel of revivification and induced life `Frankenstein' had appeared only ten years earlier.)
The operatic scenario requires both enchantment and menace, beauty and fearfulness, held in a dramatic tension. It must be seductively beautiful and yet disturbing---a very considerable challenge for a producer and a choreographer.
The ROH presentation sees a stage cluttered to the point of claustrophobia, while the spirits of the dead nuns are realized as half-animated zombies, flopping about in grotesque attitudes of increasing intensity. For the emergence from the tombs (to Meyerbeer's sepulchral music, never surpassed in eerie imaginativeness) this is a good idea---but it is the only idea, and is allowed to dominate the whole scene.
The spirits are supposed to assume a beautiful guise to achieve their delusory purpose. But never do we see them as something dangerously attractive (seduction is the last quality they convey!). The scene becomes heavy and prolonged, and the nocturnal mystery of reverie (or nightmare) is lost. All the advantages of modern staging and the possibilities of advanced lighting techniques are neglected.

Brian Hymel sounds young and consistently incisive in the hugely demanding title role, his tone even throughout the extreme tessitura. Even if his timbre is not especially beautiful, he boldly tackles the very high notes, and he he conveys the impulsive but confused young hero with some charm. His sinister mentor Bertram is tackled by John Relyea who has the darkness and depth of hue, but sometimes looking ludicrous in his Victorian frockcoat, does not convey the necessary dominance of presence. In Act 3 (which belongs to Bertram and the interests of Hell), the stage is always too cluttered for free movement. His Evocation of the dead nuns (one of the great bass arias, with the magisterial trombones of the Day of Doom, and the beautiful cantilena of the middle section with its horn fanfares) simply lack in impact dramaturgically. His role in the decisive final trio is further vitiated by the overly intrusive Miracle Play props.

The two heroines are sung with steady dedication: Patrizia Ciofi has become something of a specialist in the role of Princess Isabelle, and despite the medium size of her voice, sings the beautiful melodies with warmth and engagement, especially her great Aria of Grace in act 4. Once again the staging lacks in atmosphere though, and the great moral implications of this existential moment of choice for the wavering hero is not adequately suggested by the mise en scne (evocative lighting is again lacking). Ciofi's control of the coloratura and drama is sure, and she perfectly understands the heady mixture of drama and bel canto that the music requires. The more lyrical role of Alice, undertaken by Alice Marina Poplavskaya, is vocally a little wooden on the whole, but presented with some vulnerability in act 1, suitable anguish in act 3, and in the great act 5 trio finds the with the requisite power and floating vocalism. Jean-Francois Borras captures the diffident comique requirements of the minstrel Raimbaut, especially during the ironic duo bouffe at the beginning of act 3

Musically the performance is held together well by the conductor Daniel Oren. His tempi are more measured than in the recording from Salerno (the act 4 finale, or what is left of it, is not quite so rushed), and we are allowed to hear more of the famous ballet music. He has sanctioned many cuts in the music, in a manner that would just never happen with any other great composer, so it is better to watch and listen rather than follow with a score. The many abridgments and the requisite splicing of the pieces are managed successfully, however, and the performance moves along with great verve. Meyerbeer's famed orchestration exercises its power (the timpani solo representing the dark enchantment at work in the tournament, the solo bassoons for the necromantic nuns, the solo harp and cor anglais in Isabelle's great cavatina, the mysterious otherworldly duo for the trumpets in the act 5 trio). The disappointment in this visual presentation is the lack of atmosphere, of magical transformation, to give these musical effects their appropriate dramatic milieu. The act 2 Tournament, with its colour and stylized movements, presents the most effective tableau.

It is a real pity that such an opportunity at realizing especially the famous act 3 ballet, a key moment in the history of Romanticism, has been miscalculated. But it is nevertheless a real joy to see something of the dramatic possibilities presented by this wonderful opera (so full of beautiful melodies and powerful drama) staged in a viable, sometimes sensitive and largely effective presentation of some panache.

Do not hesitate to try this extraordinary experience!",1375574400,18,9599,5.171171171171171
5723067,4,B00CIWPJ0Y,"The folly and the controversy surrounding the Royal Opera House's production of Meyerbeer's 2012 Robert Le Diable have been extensively reported elsewhere, from the cast changes and departures through to its critical mauling in the press. Those weaknesses are still apparent here, but they can be offset to a large degree in this case just by the rare opportunity to see one of the greatest works of 19th century opera performed on the stage. The challenge that faced director Laurent Pelly to stage this unfashionable monster of the Grand Opera repertoire however was never an enviable one. He may not entirely have succeeded, but in a way Pelly does capture the spirit of Meyerbeer to some extent. Perhaps it's more of a case that audiences still aren't ready for Meyerbeer.

Which is understandable, but a pity nonetheless. If nothing else Robert le Diable is an opera experience like no other. Musically and in terms of plotting it's not the most sophisticated, but Meyerbeer packs the five acts of the opera so full of melodies and dramatic development, underlining it with grand choral refrains, lyrical expression, comic interplay and over-the-top gothic imagery with some ballet sequences thrown in for good measure, that it's never anything less than pure value-for-money entertainment. Pelly's production, unfairly criticised I feel, attempts to put all the colour and the darkness of the work up there on the stage in the sets and costumes, and he does so rather well. It's faithful to the spirit of the work, playing it straight where it ought to be, exaggerating in other places, but never stooping to making fun of the melodramatic developments and wild declarations.

Aiming for the middle ground between period fidelity and modernism, there's a ""cardboard cutout"" feel to the scenery then that is reminiscent in places of David Hockney's designs for the Glyndebourne production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress. It's like an ancient black and white engraving that has been garishly hand-coloured, or even a medieval tapestry that might lack realistic detail and proportion, but nonetheless has the power to evoke the history and the values of another period far from our own. Sometimes this works exceptionally well (Act III's vision of Hell on a mountain pass like something out of the mind of Hieronymus Bosch), at other times the imagery feels a little forced (the ultimate battle between the good of Alice and the evil of Bertram in Act V), and sometimes it's just a little too kitsch and reminiscent of Monty Python and the Holy Grail to take seriously (the colour of the medieval tournament in Act II). I'm in two minds about the zombie sisters of St Rosalie during the opera's most famous/notorious Dance of the Nuns ballet.

Pelly's staging however is sympathetic to the shifts of tone in the work itself and gets fully behind it, never attempting to make it into something else entirely with conceptual cleverness. Daniel Oren too shows great feeling for the work, its rhythms and variations, and - regardless of what you think of the merits or otherwise of Meyerbeer's score - it's simply a delight to see this type of work being put through its paces. What seems to be more of a problem however is that we really don't have the singers for this type of work any longer. As Robert, Bryan Hymel's voice might not be to everyone's taste, and it does start to grate and go a little bit wayward as the opera progresses through to the final acts, but the effort is considerable. No less demanding is the role of Bertram and John Relyea handles it superbly and with great character. Despite her commitment, Marina Poplavskaya however is terribly miscast here, as is Patrizia Ciofi, who really doesn't have a large enough voice for this style of work, a whimper that is lost in the orchestration and big choruses.

For all its flaws however, this is a sincere and a valiant effort to stage one of the great opera masterworks of yesteryear. The recording of the work and its presentation on the Opus Arte Blu-ray (which comes in a die-cut slipcase) is of course of the highest quality in both image and sound. The extra features however are slim, with only a Cast Gallery and a five-minute presentation on the legacy of the work, which does nonetheless give you an idea of the challenges of putting it on. There's an essay and a full synopsis in the enclosed booklet. The disc is BD50, Full-HD, Region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.",1372291200,20,4492,4.891076115485564
5723068,4,B00CIWPJ0Y,"Robert le Diable, gentle reader, is a work I have wanted to experience for years. Like the previous reviewer, I got it from Amazon.com.uk (many discs are realeased earlier in Europe that in the US, with some never making it here). I am very glad to add this performance to the opera shelves, because there is some really fine singing, but like most DVD opera, it has its share of problems for me.

I normally enjoy Laurent Pelly's stagings, even when they are a bit ""over the top"". What he has done with Robert is to treat it as satire. The opera, as originally staged was as serious as fantasy/melodrama can be, but it was not played for laughs in the 19th century. Sets have a sort of Disneyesque aspect to them. It's not as off-putting as Mary Zimmerman's staging efforts to me, and it ""worked"" as far as I am concerned ... sort of. The critics were mixed in their reaction to the performance at the ROH last December.

Another negative of sorts is that there are substantial cuts to the original score. That said, the 2 disc set runs for 211 minutes, with another 10 for the ""making of"" special feature.

All of the above being said, and considering my basic unfamiliarity with Meyerbeer's works, I thoroughly enjoyed the performance. I feel far more comfortable commenting on Italian opera because I have experienced so much of it. Over the last 10 years, I have had to re-adjust some perspectives as Rossini's opera seria were recorded, because such were simply not performed or recorded and I was not familiar with the extended coloratura demands he made an all singers.

Although Meyerbeer wrote Robert during the bel canto period, it is not in the Italian style of that genre. Yes, he makes incredible demands of his singers, justifying, at least in part, the need for cuts, but one looks in vain for the cavatina - cabaletta -- duet -- ensemble approach of the Italians. There are a lot more big choral numbers, and of course the ballet, which was demanded or French opera post Meyerbeer.

All of the singers met the ""Meyerbeer challenge"" successfully. It IS vocally demanding with a lot of extended coloratura athleticism and some stratospheric high notes for the tenor and the ladies. The fact that Bryan Hymel (Robert) did not blow a gasket is amazing. I had not hear him before, but the voice is flexible and wide ranging, if a bit dry on occasion. That may evidence a bit of fatigue, because Robert has a lot of singing to do, frequently over a large chorus. In fact, if memory serves, Juan Diego Florez declined the part, which says something about the role.

Although some British critics were a bit unkind in their views of both Marina Poplavskaya and Patrizia Ciofi, pointing out their unfamiliarity with Meyerbeer's music (but not mentioning who might have done it better), I thought that  both ladies did a great job with  the music. I have hear both before on several occasions, and while Ciofi does quite a bit of bel canto work, I was not aware that Mme Poplavskaya did. Nonetheless, she acquitted herself very well.

I do think that John Relyea as the evil Bertrand nearly stole the show. Vocally and dramatically, when he was onstage, he ruled it.

Disc quality is absolutely fabulous with amazingly detailed sound in the DTS mode.

Meyerbeer was an important composer on the world of opera and I am delighted to begin to make his aquaintance with this disc.",1372118400,30,3384,4.6610738255033555
5723069,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"I purchased this from Amazon UK where it has been on sale for a few weeks already.  Terrific singing and acting from all the main actors, especially John Reylea whom I never heard of.  He plays Bertram, the king of the fallen angels and really looks the part.  He's a sort of Mephistofoles with a family connection to the title character nicely played by Bryan Hymel.  I especially enjoyed the famous ballet of the fallen nuns even though most reviews in the UK didn't seem to.  It is a bit more like the dance of the living dead than the fallen nuns.  Still, it was well done and well integrated into the story.  The staging was gorgeous: colorful, varied and lively. Meyerbeer was renowned for over the top productions and the Royal Opera certainly did their best to live up to that reputation pulling out all the stops down to a man in a bear outfit for no obvious reason that I saw.  The plot is typical Meyerbeer silliness but we Meyerbeer fans know that going in.  It's not really more loosely tied together that most bel canto pieces of that period.

Meyerbeer has never been as neglected in Europe as he has in the US.  There's been a steady stream of Meyerbeer productions there over the years.  Some day hopefully the Met and other US companies will follow.  He does not deserve the neglect he has received in the last 100 years.  I understand that this staging does leave out some of the original score.  Still, you get over 3 hours of beautiful music and with so little Meyerbeer out there I can't complain about that too much.  This is easily the best production of any Meyerbeer opera I'm aware of.  If you enjoy this you should also enjoy L'Africaine with Domingo and Verret, Les Hugeunots with Joan Sutherland, as well as Il Crociato in Egitto - Meyerbeer's last opera written in Italian before he relocated to Paris.  That opera features Patricia Ciofi who appears in this opera as well. Whether you're a confirmed Meyerbeer fan or ignorant of the man and just looking for something different from the era of Rossini/Donizetti/early Verdi don't hesitate to purchase this.  You won't be disappointed.",1372032000,58,2116,4.624664879356568
5723070,4,B00CIWPJ0Y,"I've always enjoyed listening to this opera (Scotto in Italian, Anderson in French), but it was a shock to see this Covent Garden staging.  It is silly, with costumes and cheap cardboard cutout sets like something from Monty Python's ""Spamalot.""  The big plus is the loud secure voice of Bryan Hymel who squeezes out some loud high notes.  If you have a voice this major, it wouldn't have hurt to include the big insert aria that Meyerbeer composed for Mario to sing at the opera's London premiere.  Reylea and Ciofi cannot compare to Ramey and Anderson from the Paris Opera performance.  Although there are the usual cuts, this performance just drags on and on.  Act III is especially boring.  The Ballet of the Debauched Nuns is ludicrous, a bunch of Zombies doing Twyla Tharp moves.  I'm surprised the audience doesn't giggle throughout.

I've never understood why Raimbaut seems to be a major character and then disappears after his filler duet with the bass at the beginning of Act III.  It was odd to see him reappear at the end.  Ciofi looks sickly.  Why didn't they put some glamour makeup on her?  She's a princess!  Her coloratura is good, but her role is cut too much.  Poplavskaya (in a role too similar to Bizet's Micaela) makes the most of her good girl innocence, but it's not a very exciting character.  Reylea hams it up as the devil, but I kept thinking it would be more interesting to be watching Gounod's ""Faust"" or Boito's ""Mefistofele.""

This two-disk dvd set is worth it for the showy performance of Bryan Hymel and for the chance to hear some very hummable tunes.",1398902400,4,1587,4.671480144404332
5723071,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"You really can't believe this opera had it's premire in 1831. In this staging it becomes almost contemporary. The singers are magnificent, and the dcor is just the right thing, it gives  a humorous tone to the performance.",1393977600,3,222,4.842105263157895
5723072,3,B00CIWPJ0Y,I bought this after having read favourable reviews. I was slightly bored as it is very long but not too disappointed. There are some good performances and the production is fun albeit a bit silly at times. It is amusing to see the influence the work clearly had on later operas and ballets. In short worth buying but not probably something you'd want to revisit many times.,1392076800,4,373,4.582089552238806
5723073,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"C'etait magnifique !!  It is wonderful to have some of the rare, unknown Meyerbeer operas available.  One gets tired of the same Faust, Manon, and Carmens.",1390953600,2,155,4.923076923076923
5723074,4,B00CIWPJ0Y,"I gave 4 stars based on the singing and character portrayals of the cast with one star subtracted for the silly production.  The production distracted from the strong performances, but not to the extent that it neutralized the performances, as in many recent modern productions.  Bryan Hymal was exceptional in the title role and Maria Poplavskaya contrasted Hymel's confused quest for satisfaction with moral direction and dedicated commitment to her childhood friend.",1388448000,2,469,5.5
5723075,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"It's a hoot as in dark, evil night and it's a hoot as in great fun. Lauren Pelly masterful recreation of this old klunker breaths life into it -always tongue-in-cheek and makes it a delightful jaunt through Medieval superstition and legendary romance. The whole thing sets, costumes singers, the Royal Opera House orchestra and chorus are top notch and make this old warhorse as viable as possible. This is a ""regieoper"" (directors opera) that works (often they don't) and the whole 3 hours and 42 minutes seem to fly -oh well -  like a bat-out-of-Hell.(sorry!). It is done as an ever so slight parody of what was once a serious religeous myth opera and is not so far overboard as to be a sham of the original. It had as its model the 1991 Deutsche Oper Berlin parody of Les Huguenots rendered in German as Die Huegenotten directed by Stephan Soltesz. The parody there is not so subtle but some of the beautiful music of Meyerbeer comes through as it does in this recording of Robert Le Diable. The star of the show is bass (and I mean BASS ) John Relyea  as Bertam, friend of the Duke of Normandy and later acknowledged as father. He has a bass voice that hits right down to the bottom of the scale and still sounds musical. And he looks like any fiction writers concept of devil, demon or person of evil demeanor. He is tall, sinister and has telegraphic eyes. He often wears a stovepipe hat the adds to his sinister appearance. His acting and singing perfectly convey his character.
Bryan Hymel as the exiled Duke of Normandy does a fine job as the son of an evil father and who is finally ""saved by pure love""  and repents his evil ways. He sings and acts well in a complex and demanding part.
There is not much in the way of female roles here. Alice the faithful servant of the Duke is played by Marina Poplavskaya. She is beautiful, acts well as the dutiful servant and sings superbly. She is in one great recording after another.
The Isabelle of Sicily that is betrothed to Robert is played by Patricia Ciofi. She has had a long career and she wobbled a bit in the high register. But she acted her part well with just a touch of humor here and there and was a good foil for the Robert of Hymel. I know her from some lack-luster recordings of some lack-luster Donizetti operas.
A big cheer for the orchestra and chorus of ROH conducted by Daniel Oren and also a cheer for the eerie ladies in the Dead Nuns ballet. Great job! I loved the story-book sets and props and particularly the cardboard monster that comes out at the end to carry off demon Bertram to his end.
Do I think there will be a revival of interest in Meyerbeer operas? Meyerbeer wrote these long Grand Operas as serious works of art to an audience that believed deeply in religeous subjects and moral and religeous conflicts. These conflicts are the subjects of his operas: Robert le Diable with its morality of life choices, Les Huguenots with the conflict of old faith and new faith, Le Prophete with its conflicts within the faith in rebellion by a leader and L'Africain where the christian faith is in conflict with a native faith.
He himself was born into a wealthy jewish family in Berlin as Jakob Liebmann Meyer Beer (he later combined his his middle name and lastt name). Even though his fame rests on his Christian conflict operas he did not convert to any other religious doctrine. In the mid and late 1800s the audience was generally serious about maters of faith and believed in demons, angels, saints and evil spirits. His operas on these subjects were thus very popular with this audience as was Gounod's Faust among others. Sorry, in this day of science, secular society and enlightenment in western culture the audience for serious faith-based, long winded epic operas just isn't there.  What we do find entertaining is to do what Pelly has done for Robert Le Diable and Soltesz did with the Hugenotten and that is to mildly high camp them but keeping some spirit alive and allowing us to hear  some of the very beautiful music of Meyerbeer.",1385337600,5,4029,4.536451169188446
5723076,1,B00CIWPJ0Y,"Sorry, folks, but I'll be the devil's (or le Diable's) advocate here, but I most vehemently disagree with your sweet-talk on this opera.
It may be a masterpiece (?), but you will never know, if this travesty of a performance  has anything to do with it. And it starts and ends with the music which I haven't really heard properly played. I very much suspect it's the Conductor who is the guilty party. With his stodgy tempi and total lack of command over the score he literally grinds the work into the ground. (He is not alone, I've seen  this happen e.g. when Placido Domingo tried his hand in conducting at the Met and simply ruined Romeo & Juliet, Anna Netrebko notwithstanding).
When I hear you gentlemen raving about this show, but I do detect a note of uncertainty here and there, I really have my doubts on your musical appreciation.
Add to all this a ludicrously stupid story that makes no sense + a staging that makes a joke of the opera. This may be a good idea except we never know if the Composer himself intended it to be a joke or the Director consistent enough to carry it through. The English critics weren't too kind to this show (and they generally know what they are talking about), and the audience apparently left in droves during the first intermission.
This being said I welcome any suggestions for a GOOD recording of this opera. I know Meyerbeer from other works and he is not that bad.",1381795200,11,1412,4.490272373540856
5723077,3,B00CIWPJ0Y,"I hated the cardboard staging, the ridiculous costumes (Poor Isabelle looks like she wandered in from a ""Lucia"", and her crown of star-capped fairy wands is pathetic.

The (in)famous ballet was another disappointment, looked like a Zombiefest.  I actually walked away and listened rather than watch.

The singing is just great throughout and although I am no friend of ""modern"" productions, this one is literally children-book perfect. It must be really hard to stage but the solution found by the director couldn't be more appropriate. And the singers do ""get into the act"", especially Patrizia Ciofi. I never realized that she could be such a wonderful, funny actress as well as a gifted singer. If I single her out that doesn't mean that the others, besides being truly great singers, are not completely perfect for their roles. They are, in every respect.
One more thing that struck me as absolutely remarkable is that, with the possible exception of Maria Poplaskaya, two Americans - Bryan Hymel and John Relya - and one Italian - Patrizia Ciofi - sang in French with practically no trace of an accent. I do speak French and know of what I speak.
The opera is long - roughly four hours - but it goes by so fast and I almost found that I would have loved to start from the beginning once more despite it length.",1378425600,8,1127,4.5024390243902435

8582227,3,B00CIWPJ0Y,"My first thought on watching this bizarre staging was did the producer even bother to read the Libretto. This was hardly the embodiment of Meyerbeer's greatest opera.

I have seen the video of the production from Paris in the 1980's - it was head and shoulder a better production than this one.

Meyerbeer has always required great singers. This was not a cast of great singers. They were all pretty mediocre - they might perhaps do better in less demanding roles but Meyerbeer's demands were too much for their vocal skills. Again the Paris production was full of great singers who were at the top of their ""game"" during this production. If you want to see and listen to Robert Le Diable - Get the Paris Production with June Anderson, Samuel Ramey, Alain Vanzo etc.

I give this 3 stars mostly for effort not for the quality of the staging or singing.",1430611200,2,993,4.511111111111111
8582228,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"As is typical for the rarely performed operas of Meyerbeer, this opera is not only lengthy by modern standards, it is also difficult to cast because of the great demands placed on the soloists. No such demands are placed on the listener however, as this opera is totally enthralling. And this production of this marvellous work held this reviewer totally in thrall. (At that time, essentially new to Meyerbeer, I am now an intense advocate for his works).

The Royal Opera has hand-picked its group of international performers for the lead roles. They both sing and act virtually to perfection, with special note for the tenor, Bryan Hymel, who faces up to the demands of a role that requires him to achieve an extraordinary vocal range. The other soloists also sing the difficult roles to perfection, but are not on stage quite as much as Hymel. And the work is full of not only wonderful arias but with ensembles and a lot of work for the chorus. Couple all of this with the high quality of the Chorus and Orchestra at the Garden, under the baton of French opera specialist, Daniel Oren, along with the visionary direction of Laurent Pelly, and you have a performance that, probably, could not be bettered. Oren conducts at a pace that generally sits well on the music, and also is well-suited to the demands the score places on the singers.

Like some other Meyerbeer reviewers, I have a distaste for some modernized opera staging (witness the German production of Les Huguenots which, is best forgotten on several counts). This production uses what I would describe as a modern abstraction  of traditional staging. It is vibrant, colourful, imaginative, and totally sympathetic to the work at hand. In his day, Meyerbeer was visionary and innovative and this production brings these qualities in a 21st century interpretation (that may not appeal to all). The important thing is that the staging WORKS in every way, and should not upset the traditionalist, nor the modernist (although, sadly, there are some who are unwilling to embrace this visual realization of the work - it is their loss).

Meyerbeer was the world's most famous operatic composer of the mid-nineteenth century. Of German descent, but born in Paris, his musical language is definitely. French. He was coexistent with Donizetti, but the musical language is half a generation later. Anyone who likes opera  of the Romantic era, then have no hesitation to try this composer, and start with this production!. You will be amply rewarded. This is musically a bridge between Bel Canto, and Romantic grand opera at its grandest! It must be stated that there are cuts to the score, but this is common with almost every staging of every opera - even though many people do not realize this, although many cuts may be small. In the case of the longer operas of the past, they will often work better with modern audiences if the opera is ""tightened"".

The (very) melodramatic plot would take up too much space to detail, but involves the temptation of an innocent by the devil (or is it one of Lucifer's minions), and his ultimate redemption to marry his dearest love. The plot, in some places, almost pre-echoes Gounod's Faust, especially in the scene where the devil is vanquished. Here one can almost see the final scene of Faust, and I am certain that Gounod was (perhaps unintentionally) influenced by familiarity with this work (a familiarity which is virtually certain).

What more can I say without getting bogged down with unnecessary detail of the various singers' techniques, voice and dramatic quality etc.? These aspects have already been appropriately reviewed by others, and incorrectly castigated by one or two. All that is needed is to say that all performers are virtually perfectly cast; and the staging is both stunning and very imaginative. A delight that deserves special comment is the performance by members of the Royal Ballet, where the souls of former nuns dance an amazing ballet sequence. A sequence that is surprising, as was this diversion in the original production. I should add that there is an element of humour pervading the earlier parts of the production, and is evident in the concept for the ballet.  The humour gradually fades as the drama intensifies.

Recorded in 16:9 high-definition image, and DTS surround sound (although only on DVD, the quality of both image and sound, are better than many Blu-Ray releases), this is a must for every opera lover.  (Reviewed using state-of-the-art home cinema equipment.) Review slightly amended by the author, June 2015.",1422144000,,4564,4.946475195822455
8582229,5,B00CIWPJ0Y,"This is a smart production.  Since Meyerbeer conceived ""Robert"" as a grand opera, it has many elements and scenes that would make any opera house crazy.  However, the ROH and director Laurent Pelly made very smart choices to make it work.  The end result was an entertaining production -which is needed for such long opera.  All elements came to together in a smart way.  Sets, lighting and costumes made sense and helped merge the real and fantasy worlds.  I specially enjoyed the theatrics of the first act and the symbolism used throughout.

Musically, the opera is exquisite.  Since its premiere in 1831 the opera was successful and well received. The orchestration is dramatic and conductor Daniel Oren was able to bring all the necessary colors out of the brilliant ROH orchestra.  The singing couldn't go wrong with tenor Bryan Hymel.  It seems that everything he sings is sung beautifully and to perfection.  Although there were 2 notes that sounded slightly tight, one must consider that he is on stage for most of the 211 minutes (opera had cuts from its original version) of the opera.  He is no doubt a tenor of magnificent talent and a voice of gold.  The rest of the principals was equally strong.  The production scores high with John Relyea as Bertram (who shows his gifts in sustained very low notes); the sweet Alice of Marina Poplavskaya; and the Isabelle of soprano Patrizia Ciofi, who displays a wide range of colors and beautiful high pianissimi all the way to her aria close to the end of the opera.
Of course everything is completed with the chorus in great form and the amazing ROH ballet.",1408579200,3,1614,4.758992805755396
8582230,3,B00CIWPJ0Y,"Robert le Diable (Robert the Devil)  -  composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer  (1791- 1864), with  libretto  by Eugne Scribe and Germain Delavigne - was  one of the first grand operas performed at the Paris Opra  Theater back in 1831.  It  is a very long work,  consisting  of  five acts developing over a period of  211 minutes, or  three and a half  hours!!!
The plot is loosely based on old legends about William the Conqueror,  officially the son of a duke of Normandy,  but  allegedly fathered by  the devil  himself:  he  was  born in answer to prayers addressed to the  forces of evil.  The time is the Middle Ages, the place  Palermo, Sicily  (in a tavern, at a palace, in the countryside and in a cathedral).  The language is  French, with subtitles available in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.
The story is rather complex.  Main theme  is the  eternal conflict between  good and evil,  developing  in this case through  the  moral redemption of  Robert (no last name),  son of a beautiful and  virtuous princess,  and of the devil himself.  Predictably, given his origins, Robert is pulled in opposite directions  by the devil - disguised as his friend Bertram (in reality  his own  father, although  unbeknownst to him until the very end) - and by an angelic figure named Alice  (his foster sister,  standing in for  his mother who recently passed away).  Both characters  try to secure  Roberts soul for their respective final destinations, hell and heaven.  During the final act, Robert is about to sign the  papers which would officially turn him into a devil.  But, not unexpectedly,  the positive forces  prevail, he is finally free to move in the right direction  and  marries Isabelle,  Princess of Sicily,  another angelic figure, for whom he has been yearning throughout  the opera.
Robert le Diable premiered at the Paris Opra on  November 21 1831,  and was an immediate success.  Frdric Chopin, who was in the audience, is reported to have said:  ""If ever magnificence was seen in the theatre, I doubt that it reached the level of splendour shown in Robert le Diable ...  It is a masterpiece..  Meyerbeer has made himself immortal"".
The opera  remained popular during Mayerbeers  life and - following his death -  until  the end  of the 19th century.
During  the twentieth century, Robert le Diable  - along with the rest of  Meyerbeers work -  was still occasionally performed,  but lost much of its popularity, partly because of the expenses required for  the staging,  partly because of some unfair defamation  by the  Wagner  supporters.
The present production was recorded  at  Covent Garden, in London, on December 15 2012, with the Royal Opera Chorus and Orchestra, under the baton of Daniel Oren.  Unfortunately,  the performance  received a poor review (three stars out of five)  in  the London paper  The Guardian,  following the premiere performance, on December  7  the  2012 .  The entire review, starting with What are we to make of Robert le Diable in the 21st century?  is available through the link:  [...]
I tend to agree with  the Guardian.  Basically, the music is beautiful from beginning to end, no way of denying it.  But the staging, the costumes (some of which are just  plain funny), some of the acting, some of the dance scenes - including the Dance of the Fallen Nuns - lack the creative force that  made the original opera a  great success.
The three stars from The Guardian seem like a fair rating.",1401235200,4,3456,4.801038062283737
