1777716,2,B00006IUO0,"This DVD makes climbing Kili look like a hike in the park, and those who think it is, should try summitting via Arrow Glacier. It does have beautiful scenic shots, though.",1069286400,5,171,4.548387096774194
1777717,4,B00006IUO0,"I climbed Kilimanjaro in November 2002 via the Machame route, which this film depicts.  (One of the other reviewers referes to the Machame route as the ""Coca-Cola"" route, that is the Marangu route.  I think it was an oversight.)

I found the film to bring back a lot of memories and did a good job of capturing the sights of the mountain.  If you are climbing Kilimanjaro, it's a no-brainer.  Buy this movie.

The movie does not do a good job at showing the difficulty of the climb.  But, that's not why you should be buying this movie.  If my memory serves me, it was filmed over 6 weeks and with a support crew of 150 people.  My 82 year old grandmother could climb Kilimanjaro at that pace.

The reason to watch this movie is to learn about the mountain and so see some of the stunning sights.  Breashears does and excellent job capturing the mountain's beauty.",1055116800,12,864,4.439490445859873
1777718,3,B00006IUO0,"I write this review as a recent trekker who successfully reached the top twice while leading groups up the easier Machame or Coca Cola Route.  I saw the film with wonderful anticipation and was struck by the sheer majesty of the mountain, its surroundings and people-all nicely portrayed in the film.  The images brought back wonderful memories of the two climbs and the sheer joy of reaching the top.
The film, however, was most disappointing because it did not convey the magnitude of the support team that went along with us carrying our food, water, cooking utensils and bedding.  Only once or twice in the film did you catch a glimpse of the support team.  We trekked with nearly three support personnel for each trekker.  The accurate portrayal of the support team would have given real meaning to the scope of the climb.
The climbers themselves, for the most part, looked as if they stepped just out of the shower.  This again tended to diminish the seriousness and difficulty of their accomplishment.  At breathtaking altitude ,the pardon the pun, I rarely saw them gasping for air or working hard to reach the top.
Perhaps, I was not in the same shape as these people, but I must confess that after seeing more than 200 trekkers over the two climbs (we shared meals and stories at the base camps and passed each other going up and down the mountain), few if any looked as sparkling as these trekkers.
The story of the climbers appeared contrived and the scenery wondrous.  My hats off to the individuals who made it to the top.",1047168000,17,1536,4.662962962962963
1777719,2,B00006IUO0,"I was expecting a lot more from this film. Besides some spectacular views of the mountain, it left me feeling empty and wanting more. I was hoping for more actual information about climbing Kili and what it was really like and I was disappointed when there was little or none. Despite their words saying how hard it was, the film did not capture the feeling of how challenging it is. I came across as little more than a simple hike. Pretty pictures but lacking substance. Breashears' Everest is significantly better and more interesting.",1041465600,4,537,4.78494623655914

They followed along with certain people, but I wanted to learn more about them. They did not really show the true difficulty of the climb.  How many porters went with them?",1434585600,,337,4.234375

1777794,4,B00006IUO0,I am planning to be in Tanzania at the base of Kilimanjaro. I wanted to see what the country was like. This DVD gave me a good feel for Kilimanjaro and a bit of the spirit of the mountain. The DVD would be good to view if you planned to go on a climbing trek of Kilimanjaro.,1365811200,,274,3.824561403508772
1777795,5,B00006IUO0,"This IMAX movie is very well done!  It doesn't quite get across to the viewer how taxing this climb is on the human body with regards to low oxygen, sleep deprivation and 10-12 hr days of climbing, but it is a great video nevertheless!",1363478400,,235,4.340909090909091

This prepared me and took away some of my concerns. Sent the videos to them but are waiting to see until they can watch together. Will wait and see how it will compare to their experience.  Will let you know.,1318032000,,347,4.164179104477612
1777799,4,B00006IUO0,"Good documentary movie.
The movie was made for imax films and really gives an artistic view of Kilimanjaro. Honestly i more enjoyed the behind the scenes footage, which revealed more of the true nature of the difficulty of the climb. With that being said, I would estimate the cast & movie crew took approximately 2 weeks to climb the mountain, and sadly you never know if they reach the summit until you watch the 'making of' footage.
I bought this with the hopes of it being for more of a training perspective for an upcoming Kili climb of mine, and from watching in detail it most definitely did help.",1308268800,,604,4.5504587155963305
1777810,5,B00006IUO0,"In short:  If you're thinking about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, or just interested in East Africa, this is a great documentary.  And you can get it brand new from an Amazon partner for only $5.00-- GREAT value in my opinion. Just buy it.

Details:  I climbed Kilimanjaro (Rongai route) over New Year's 2009; then I discovered this DVD a couple of months after the fact & decided to order.  I like it because it gives my family/friends a great IMAX quality overview of the mountain, and is a great supplement to my personal slides/video (*I returned with about 1,500 of my own pics, and about 3 hrs of hi-def video).  I like the DVD's musical score, as well.

The 'plot' of the DVD follows a style I've seen in a number of other IMAX films-- following a group of otherwise ordinary individuals as they tackle an out-of-the-ordinary task (climbing Kilimanjaro, in this case).  If there is anything particularly inaccurate, it's the lack of porters in the video (no, not ONE porter is shown in the entire presentation) and also the lack of other hiking groups on the mountain. [the IMAX group seems to be completely alone, whereas my experience was one of at least dozens if not hundreds of other hikers].  Still, the purpose of the video is NOT to be a detailed hiking guide, but rather to give viewers an idea of the scope and grandeur of the mountain.  This it does very well.

To reiterate:  great movie, great value",1237680000,3,1415,4.616
1777811,3,B00006IUO0,"Enjoyable footage of Kilimanjaro and the climb up.  The IMAX format and story isn't as detailed as a Kilimanjaro documentary might be.  Though the DVD said TRT (total running time) is 70 minutes, the actual feature ran to just under 40 minutes.  So, disappointing in this regard.  I got the sense of the mountain - as IMAX would portray - just not the real-world expedition climbing of it:  preparation, packing, porters, cooks, others on the mountain etc. A good first look at the mountain, but it left many questions unanswered in preparing for a Kili climb.",1229299200,,560,4.791666666666667

1777813,5,B00006IUO0,"In planning for a trip to Kili, we wanted to be able to show our kids what a trip to the mountain would be like.  This DVD was perfect as it included people of all ages on the climb.  This is a great family film, short but perfect for those interested in beginning climbing or family outdoor adventures.  It would also be beneficial to home schoolers that need some visuals to supplement geography and/or African studies.",1219363200,,421,4.5131578947368425
1777814,5,B00006IUO0,"I love the movie very much! It might be a bit romantic and idolized (you see only pretty things. But I found it very encouraging in my preparation to the claim! After all - among others they feature and older lady that didn't look very sporty and two teenagers... If they made it to the top - I can too!!! Just have to train hard!

Very beautiful film!!!",1219190400,,354,4.205882352941177
1777815,4,B00006IUO0,Excellent film... shame that IMAX films are typically only 40 mins long.. but the dvd has extra features such as a 'making of' which adds to the package. From someone who's climbed the mountain the movie is a nice reminder of the experience.. some amazing aerial shots... worth the money just for those.,1129593600,3,303,4.735849056603773
1777816,5,B00006IUO0,"I came across this DVD a couple months before leaving for Kilimanjaro and enjoyed it much. If you are going to climb the mountain via the Western Breach route, purchase is a no-brainer.

It, along with a Nova documentary that appeared about the same time, seems to have contributed to an explosion of thousands of Americans climbing Kilimanjaro in the last 3 years. Said one porter-aid worker I met in  in Moshi, ""Americans used to be rare in Tanzania, but in the last 2-3 years, they are suddenly common ..."". Everyone I met seemed to have viewed or been prompted to go by these two videos.

The film is definately IMAX-ie; beautiful photography, nice swelling music, numerous scenes of herds of animals fleeing in terror along the plains of Africa as the camera swoops down from an airplane overhead. You get the idea.

The narrator (mountain guide Jacob Kyungai) intones that climbers of Kilimanjaro are ""ordinary people people, mostly"", then goes on to introduce a Gilligan's Island cast of climbers, picked to reflect (or engage) the folk who might go to the science museum IMAX theater on a Saturday afternoon  -- as compared to those who actually climb Kili.

You have The Professor (Roger Bilham, an expert volcanologist), Ginger/Mary-Ann (Heidi Albertsen, identified on the DVD only as ""Trekker: Denmark"", but in reality a New York super-model you have probably seen more often on the cover of women's magazines at your grocery store check-out line), a couple of precocious 12-going-on-25 year old kids (self-possessed and well-behaved, every Yuppie parent's dream-child), a writer (Audrey Salkeld), and Rick Thomson, who barely made it out of the editing room, but is the father of the 12 year old girl (and was in a bad car accident shortly before the climb and had a pin in his hip, etc.)

Basically, the film shows a sort of idealized climb.  This is not a movie about man against nature, or pushing the limits of human endurance.  It's about a beautiful, diverse mountain and some ""ordinary"" (*cough*) people who went to the top.

Bottom line: if you are going to experience a Kilimanjaro climb, it's hard to beat tagging along with an expert volcanologist and a super-model.

The DVD contains a ""Making of"" feature that is of even more interest to prospective climbers than the main film. Behind-the-scenes shots of the logistics and events provides context to the apparent effortless serenity of the main feature.

The problem with the film is this: having climbed Kilimanjaro (via Lemosho - Shira -Western Breach route),  the depiction of the Western Breach is disturbingly glossy. This problem is not unique to this film; it exists in the Nova documentary and virtually all text and sales-pitches advocating the Western Breach. Basically, the pitch is that the Western Breach route is ""non-technical"" and suitable for anyone in good physical condition who is capable of hiking for 6-8 hours a day.

The reality is there are at least 4 spots where you will find yourself clinging to an ice-covered rock, searching for slight finger & toe-hold indentations as you skitter 20-30 feet sideways.  Miss a finger or toe, have a balance problem, or slip more than one hold, and you will fall 1000 feet to the rocks below. And aside from those 4 sections, a misstep or slip on any of the rest of the breach also means falling hundreds of feet. And keep in mind you are likely wearing a 20+ pound pack with several pounds of water. Basically, anything is ""non-technical"" if you don't use safety equipment.

The Western Breach is precarious and dangerous. In the film, they show the cast clambering over refrigerator-sized, step-like blocks of stone. This amounts to at most 15% of the climb. The rest is not really shown, probably because it is too precarious to get footage of. A parent allowing a 13-year old on this route is inconceivable to me, unless ropes and support equipment were used to assist.

While clinging to ice-covered rocks and seeing nothing but air beneath my feet, my initial reaction was anger at the public-relations puff-job in this movie and other sources. This was quickly subsumed by the desire to simply stay alive, repeated a couple dozen times that day.

While this movie might lead people in good shape, used to jogging around the park or hiking the local hills, into thinking it's no big deal to climb Kilimanjaro via WB (""hey,  a couple 13 year olds did it""), the reality is inexplicably different than the PR. You have been warned.

By the way, if you read the companion book to this film, there is a note at the end that mentions that a few months after filming, the cast and crew was reassembled and climbed Kilimanjaro AGAIN (a 2nd time) to obtain more shots.",1096848000,77,4704,4.834371108343711
1777817,4,B00006IUO0,"This is a very nice video in which you get the see all the amazing sites of Kilimanjaro.  After having climbed, I can say that it is as nice as it seems in this video.

The only problem with the video is that there is not too much excitement upon achieving each of the stages.  Reaching the summit is very anti-climatic, as they simply walk onto it.  Perhaps it would be impossible to express the true excitement and beauty of the summit, but I do believe they could have tried harder.

If you are planning a trip to Kilimanjaro, it is a nice video to see what you are going to face.  But don't rely on it to predict the difficulties, I think it is a bit more difficult and a bit more exciting than they make it out to be.",1092355200,12,722,4.085106382978723
1777818,4,B00006IUO0,"I enjoyed this movie a lot... went to the IMAX theater 3 times to see it! The cinematography is terrific... some totally unbelievable views. Made me want to go and climb the thing (sabbatical coming next summer)! Anyone who likes the mountains/hiking/climbing should see it... go to the IMAX to see it first, then order the DVD.
I agree that they could have spent more time showing the climbers personal experiences. There was a ""Naked Planet"" special on Kili that was on PBS a couple of years ago, that did it much better.
Just a few clarifications to som of the other reviews:  the approach is via the Machame Route, but the summit climb is via the Great Western Breach, which is the most difficult trekking route on the mountain. The route that is known as the Coca-cola route, is the Marangu route, which is the most popular route on the mountain, that also has the highest failure rate, because it ascends too fast.",1069632000,10,920,4.609756097560975
7969603,5,B00006IUO0,"Before I climbed Kilimanjaro the first time, I watched and read everything I could find on ascending the mountain.  This was the impetus behind my going in the first place.  If anyone wants to know about this mountain, I have climbed it three times taking diffenent routes each time.  This movie is useful, but does not cover the porters in any detail.  They are a crucial part of any climb and should be duly recognized as such.",1483315200,3,429,4.532467532467533
