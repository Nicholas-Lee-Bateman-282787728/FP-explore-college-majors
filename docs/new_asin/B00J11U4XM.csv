8647189,4,B00J11U4XM,A very well done World War II master piece in Twelve O'clock High combined with an international master piece documenting the evening for both the United States and the Empire of Japan leading up to and culminating in the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Included in the package is Von Ryan's Express a story of American and British prisoners of war (POW) executing a mass POW escape to Switzerland with help from their Italian jailers.,1435104000,,428,4.783783783783784
8647190,2,B00J11U4XM,"The movies are classics, of course and get top ratings. The blu-Ray, however is quite lacking. It doesn't run on my newest Samsung blu-Ray machine saying the firmware is obsolete. Of course, there are no new updates for my machine. It runs on another, older machine, but has a hard time starting up. Tora Tora Tora also didn't have the English dubbed in option which we know is available. This is the original theatrical version, but was still disappointing.",1433894400,,458,4.810126582278481

8647194,5,B00J11U4XM,"VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has come and gone many years ago. The sounds of screeching steel along the rails and the distant sound of the steam engine whistling its way to freedom have long been silent, but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, Jerry Goldsmith's moving score, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. This is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart. To paraphrase ... I once told you Ryan, if only one gets out, it's a victory. That still brings a tear to my eye.

1970's TORA! TORA! TORA! should have done much better at the box-office on its release. If remembered at all it is noted for its realistic special visual effects of the Pearl Harbor attack. Long forgotten are the performances of the principal actors and the well-constructed screenplay and editing. This is truly a shame because it is one of the most historically accurate film depictions of any World War II event. Accuracy can always be debated considering film length, budget and scripting. On a relative basis to the hundreds of war films produced this is one of the more accurate. The film is really an in-depth analysis of events leading up to and culminating in the unprovoked actual Japanese attack. These events are shown from both sides with Richard Fleischer directing the American sequences and Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku directing the Japanese. What is amazing is just how well these events create true suspense and tension throughout. This is achieved through skillful editing from James E. Newcom, Pembroke J. Herring and Inoue Chikaya from the well-written and researched screenplay by Larry Forrester, Hideo Oguni and Ryuzo Kikushima. The Special Effects are undeniably the best ever produced for a War film made during the 20th century. They combine both close-ups and panoramic views, which give the real scope of the devastation. On the acting front James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey impressed me the most. He seemed like the one high ranking American officer with a good head on his shoulders, decisive and no procrastinator. Also good were Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminsky (up to his neck in bureaucratic procrastination) and George Macready as Cordell Hull. Macready showed restrained outrage and disgust at the document handed him by Japanese Ambassador Nomura (Shogo Shimada). I thought that all the actors portraying Japanese Naval officers were excellent. Once again composer Jerry Goldsmith demonstrates his brilliance as a composer as he calls upon both American and Oriental motifs to tell this drama from both perspectives. Goldsmith brilliantly captures the underlying mood of the Japanese Naval leaders on one side and the perplexed and frustrated United States Naval and Army Intelligence officers on the other. This film brilliantly depicts the greatest act of modern era cowardice perpetuated from one nation upon another in peacetime. For a country that prided itself on the concept of `honor' this film demonstrates just how dishonorable and cowardly a nation can become under the imperial ambitions of its leaders. As the film reiterates at its conclusion, one man from that country realized that they had awakened a sleeping dragon. This is truly great filmmaking. It also starred Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, Soh Yamamura, E.G. Marshall, Takahiro Tamura, Eijiro Tono, Leon Ames, Richard Anderson, Edward Andrews and G.D. Spradlin.

TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is an emotional and physiologically charged film looking at the devastating effects of command and the effects of war. In some ways this is the greatest WWII film ever made. Several years ago I worked with a WWII veteran who was in the the Big Red One 1st Infantry division. He was there from Casablanca to a Death camp they liberated in Czechoslovakia. We had many discussions during coffee break and lunch break. I once asked him if there was any film made that took place during WWII that he thought came close to depicting what it was like to be there. I was surprised when he told me that TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH was the best. He simply said that it depicted what it was like. He thought this was a very good film. I was always surprised that a guy in the infantry would pick this as the best WWII film. I have watched it many times and I think I understand what he saw. The opening of the film has always haunted me. It is just so moving gives you a feeling of wanting that is so hard to explain. This film is so captivating and so interesting as it unfolds. Gregory Peck's General Frank Savage sees things in what appears to be from an objective standpoint. He relieves Gary Merrill's Colonel Keith Davenport from his command of his tired and worn bomber group because Peck feels Merrill is near the breaking point of his wits and good reason and being too close to his men. Peck takes over command of the group. Peck's objectivity lacks a key emotional content in his sole purpose to command with detached intellect and get the job done. In time Peck finds that a camaraderie has developed with the group who initially resented Merrill's relief of command. In time Peck finds himself in a similar state that he found originally found Gary Merrill and so it goes. Dean Jagger as Major Harvey Stovall is pivotal for Peck's gradual success, and the group's as well, when he first takes command of the group using red tape to hold up communications and give Peck the time he needs to settle in. Dean Jagger's performance is so pivotal in the film and the way the film opens and closes in the post-war era and is actually Jagger's flashback of events remembered with a certain reverence and fervency that is just so telling on the emotional and psychological effects of war, command and much more. Henry King's direction is simply brilliant and heartfelt as is the screenplay. This is probably the best WWII film ever made.",1424736000,2,6525,4.882777276825969
