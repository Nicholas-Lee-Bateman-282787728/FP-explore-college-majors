3872836,1,B0028OH55Y,I'm giving it one star - because I can't give it any less.  The ONLY upside is that Danny Trejo is in the movie.,1473206400,2,112,3.6666666666666665

3872839,2,B0028OH55Y,"If this film were a supermarket, someone would be on the loudspeaker calling for cleanup on every freakin' aisle.  The only thing necessary for this utter mess of a movie is a complete re-write and re-casting.  Don't count on Lance Henriksen to save the day here; having recently accumulated a string of bad movies notches in his acting belt, Henriksen is no longer capable of carrying a weak film solely on his own shoulders.  Indeed, with parts such as this one, I believe that Henriksen is becoming a caricature of his former self, and that poses quite a problem for a plot-challenged movie filled with bad actors.

It's obvious from the start that Necessary Evil doesn't have a lot going for it.  For one thing, the movie opens with an extended narrative voiceover, (which is pretty much a cinematic neon sign flashing the words ""Bad movie ahead"").  Then, before we even get to the opening credits (which appear to have been made using an old Commodore 64), we see that a band of mercenaries making their way to a mysterious and dangerous artifact have brought a stripper along with them.  I'm sorry - what?  Was the writer of this garbage on drugs?  I won't reveal what this archaeological discovery consists of, but it forms an integral part of one mad scientist's plan to achieve immortality.  Dr. Neal Fibrian (Henriksen) runs a huge psychiatric hospital by day, but all he really cares about is getting his drug Reficul (which he has tested extensively on his patients) on the market.  Working in cahoots with a large pharmaceutical company, he's finally managed to get the drug approved by the corrupt FDA.  (What does the marketing of this drug have to do with his own immortality, you ask?  If the writer knows, he sure isn't telling.)  Anyway, only two things stand in the way of this stupid master plan: a nosy detective still looking for a girl who disappeared over a decade earlier and a journalism student determined to blow the lid off of whatever is happening at Dr. Fibrian's hospital.

Given the unprecedented power of the bad guys, you have to wonder why they didn't just do away with Detective Russo (Eric Feldman) at some point over the fourteen years he's been nosing around.  After all, Russo is a pretty good detective, quite capable of making huge illogical leaps over giant plot holes in the story.  Young investigative journalist Deborah Fielding (Kathryn Fiore), on the other hand, poses a different kind of threat to the project, as she unknowingly has a part to play in Dr. Fibrian's elaborate plans.  Laughably, given her penchant for wearing tight jeans around her tiny waist, Deborah is supposedly a few months pregnant. That sort of works out, though, because those tight jeans and a pretty face are about all Kathryn Fiore brings to the table; if she has any real acting skills, she pretty much keeps them to herself throughout the course of this entire movie.

Lest there be any doubt, I hereby declare Necessary Evil a lousy movie.  The only thing worse than the acting is the script, and there's no sign of action or suspense at any point in the film.  After you waste almost a million dollars on something, I guess you have to go ahead and release it - but that doesn't make it right.",1285027200,2,3226,4.704626334519573
3872840,1,B0028OH55Y,"With the exception of Lance Henriksen's stellar performance, this was a total yawner!  What a waste of time.  The writer of this inept loser must have been on drugs...and not the legal kind.  I could have done better with a few glasses of wine (legal stuff) LOL!  The cover of this DVD has nothing to do with the movie...none whatsoever.  It should have been a 30-minute short story.  There's no horror...no thrills...horrible acting (except for Lance)...and no special effects...in fact...NOTHING special.  AVOID!",1265241600,4,514,5.195121951219512
3872841,4,B0028OH55Y,"I really enjoyed this movie.  When I look for movies I avoid the mainstream stuff.  And most anything from Asylum Pictures.  This is definitely not mainstream.  It's offbeat, unusual and more than a little hinky.  And that's a good thing.  Is it perfect?  I've never seen a perfect movie.  But this movie doesn't follow a pat formula.  It's creepy, atmospheric and the cast is solid.  It's got Lance Henrikson, Danny Trejo, Gary Hudson and Richard Reihle.  Those are names that I look for in movies as a fan of character actors.  And it has a brief appearance by a creepy-ass clown.  Bonus.  It's not for everyone, granted, but genre fans will be pleased.  It's worth your while to spend a little time with ""Necessary Evil"".  Well done, all.",1255046400,5,741,4.671875
