7937458,5,B00005BGRG,"YogaZone is one of the absolute best yoga DVDs for people wanting to really get into yoga.  The instructors let you know how a pose should feel and how to not overdo each pose.  They offer beginner and intermediate / advanced instruction with each video.  I know Shiva Rae is supposed to be the best, but honestly - she is more into showing what she can do than actually instructing on the moves and how you should feel in each posture.  I am a diehard YZ fan!!",1437004800,,461,4.264367816091954
7937459,5,B00005BGRG,"I love this video.  I don't feel I have to push ahead to an advanced state.  I can do just as much as I can at this time!
The teachers make me feel I'm doing great!",1374969600,,164,3.5277777777777777
7937460,5,B00005BGRG,There is no annoying music in the background and the yoga teachers were very well spoken and clean and precise in what they wanted to convey the viewer. It really helped me improve confidence in my health.  I practice everyday and now I feel more energy and positive thoughts.  Overall I love this product.,1229040000,,306,4.648148148148148
7937461,5,B00005BGRG,"I've actually have a TON of these Yoga Zone DVDs AND Yoga Zone music! This box set is a great addition to anyone's library of yoga dvd's. You don't have to be just a beginner. In fact, I'm a teacher and I've used a lot of their ques in my own classes! Yoga Zone takes out some of the traditional rigidity of some forms of yoga and focuses on proper alignment and a good workout. Yoga Zone is a great way for a beginner to ease into yoga. I also suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1221177600,,614,5.40625
7937462,5,B00005BGRG,"This series is an outstanding beginning to Yoga, or any other exercise routine. Yoga Zone gracefully overcame a paradox, which is to market teachings of a method that is so deeply against aggression and competition. They make mind-body awareness accessible to an audience who at best has seen bumper-stickers, posters, and flyers on the topic.

At the risk of enormous generalities, they are mainstream north-Americans, who do not appear to be rooted in ideological wars, neither on political, religious nor ethnic fronts. They tease out the essence of the yogic approach to spirituality and physiology, and present it, in a manner that is relevant to the experiences and needs of the secularly-minded western audience. They also, remarkably, use the routine to compensate for the casualties of our hyper-technical, cushy lifestyle, and the pressures of our rigid work-ethic.

Personally, these videos alone introduced me to Yoga and to physiology in general. I have fibromyalgia, and I began to feel a lot better when I started following their stretches, and listening to their advice. Those who are master yoga practitioners might take an interest in their delicate approach.  For those who are not interested in Yoga, it offers an excellent model, of how to incorporate awareness into a physical fitness routine. The dynamic stretches presented would make great 20 minute warm-ups for a more strenuous cardio or resistance routine. Wonderful, inspiring work

7937463,5,B00005BGRG,"I bought this DVD set several years ago on a whim.  Before buying it I had enjoyed Ali McGraw's Yoga Mind and Body VHS, but I found it very difficult to carve out an hour for the full (and very challenging) workout.  One of my favorite things about these DVDs is the 20-minute time frame for each session, which is much more do-able with my busy schedule.
When I started to do these workouts regularly several times each week, I noticed some subtle changes in my body.  My arms, abs, and legs gained definition and I felt longer and leaner and more energized.  Even better, I started to look forward to these workouts for their calming effects.  They help me to release tension and regain focus, so I'm no longer burdened by the stresses of the day and I can even sleep better.  This is the first workout that I've ever truly craved at the end of a long day!
I have purchased many other DVDs - many of them Yoga Zone - since I bought this original set.  These workouts are straightforward, positive, and enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this set for anyone seeking a good introduction to yoga or a stress-reducing workout that will fit into any time frame.
Also recommended: The All-Day Yoga Workout: A.M., Stress Relief, and P.M. Yoga for Beginners (Living Yoga).  I wouldn't call it beginner, but the 20-minute P.M. yoga session with Patricia Walden is the one I gravitate towards at the end of my most stressful days.",1079568000,9,1424,4.552941176470588
7937464,4,B00005BGRG,"I really enjoyed the 6 gentle workouts given in this 3 DVD set.  I think it's great, clear instruction for people just starting out in yoga, with good attention to proper alignment and to the breath/movement connection.  I especially liked the ab workout led by Jennifer and find her to be the best instructor.  Because the workouts are short and gentle, they serve as great warm ups for more strenuous routines and/or high cardio workouts!",1021766400,13,440,4.84
7937465,5,B00005BGRG,"I totally disagree with the reviewer that said these dvd's aren't really for beginners!  I just started doing yoga and first I tried the CRUNCH brand dvd's for beginners and they were IMPOSSIBLE!  I almost decided against yoga after that, but figured I'd try one more different brand.  I chose yoga zone on a whim and am SOOOOO happy with them.  The instructors start you from the very beginning and always tell you what you can do to make it easier if you're struggling.  I would recommend these tapes to anyone!",1017705600,26,513,4.593406593406593
