7975601,3,B00007ELEF,"This movie suprised me.  I had watched the trailer first and groaned, ""another bad, bad movie.""  It turns out the movie is not bad and there are some great extras.  The image and sound is good.  There is one caveat, make sure you get the copy that has ""2003 Version"" near the top of the title.  Another bit of advice.  This DVD is not worth the price Amazon is charging, unless you are a die-hard Mastorakis fan.  You can pick this up at many other vendors for a third of the price.  One of the extras on this disc and others in this ""collection"" is a great autobiograpy on the films of Nico Mastorakis.  He seems like a fairly smart and decent person.  It makes you want to buy the entire ""collection"", but like I stated not at the Amazon price.",1080864000,2,746,4.226950354609929
7975602,3,B00007ELEF,"sorry for the pun, but its true that Bloodstone is one of those forgotten films of the 80's. Most people who saw it in the theater then have forgotten they did and the movie disappeared from theaters never to be heard from again, that is until now. I, for one, was one of the people that forgot about this film For years my memory of the film layed dormate, then one day I saw it on the shelf at one of our local DVD store. I was totally surprised to see it, so I picked it up. This DVD release by Image/Omega Entertainent is a beautiful release. Widescreen, digitally remasted, with plenty of special features. I was impressed. As for the movie, it brought back great memories. The story is your average adventure affair, much like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone, & Firewalker, but it does have many comical moments. The best part of the film is the police chief that speaks with a funny back of the throat voice. I found myself mimicking this voice for days after I saw the movie. The film was a pleasure with its adventure, off-the-wall humor, and exotic locations. If you like adventure films, give this lost gem a try, you shouldn't be disappointed. And for those of you who saw the movie, and can't remember...refresh your memory.",1048118400,8,1240,4.515555555555555
7975603,4,B00007ELEF,"Bloodstone was previously released on the defunct Simitar label. This DVD Re-release for 2003 is far superior. The picture is in true Animorphic Widescreen and has been fully remastered and color corrected. New animated menus included as well. It also includes various trailers of other Nico Mastorakis productions, as well as a nice feature on the films of Nico Mastorakis that runs about 55 minutes in length.
The only complaint I have about this DVD is that It's advertised as having a new 5.1 sound mix. It is even advertised on the boxart and listed on the sound options on the disc itself. But, when you click on the 5.1 option it brings up a screen saying something like ""Not available on this disc version"". It's not a big deal, but still somewhat misleading. All in all though, this is a very professional disc to a great 80's movie.",1046390400,8,842,4.657718120805369
7975604,4,B00007ELEF,"From all the films from Full Moon Entertainment, this is the best one I have seen and seems to be the best vampire movie of the 90s. It's better then SUBSPECIES part 1 in many ways, but I was hoping that they wood use more of David Allen's stop-motion FX. Picking up were part 1 let off, we found that Michelle (Denise Duff) has become a vampire and her human sister arrives to save her from the evil NOSFERATU like vampire Radu (Anders Hove). The low on money film by the makers of PUPPET MASTER has well used make-up and gooey shadow FX. It was filmed back to back with BLOODLUST, part 3 in the series.
