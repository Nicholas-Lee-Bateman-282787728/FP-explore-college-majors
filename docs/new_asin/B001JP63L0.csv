3658952,1,B001JP63L0,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.,1332374400,3,181,4.6875
3658953,4,B001JP63L0,"On the surface there is a lot not to like about this movie, especially if one is not a huge fan of either the perpetually inebriated Oliver Reed or the real life kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst, on whose experiences the story is loosely based.

What is great about the first half of the movie is the quite delicious and surreal abduction of our spoilt little rich girl heroine followed by some of the kinkiest torture and brainwashing that ever made it into a relatively mainstream 1980s movie... this made a great impression on me when I saw it cira late 80s and those scenes have stayed with me to this day, along with a lifelong kink for blacked out swimming goggles and hanging upside down half stripped by my ankles while attractive young women hug me and tell me it's all ok.

The second half of the movie has virtually no merits whatsoever, there is a very boring doomed love affair between our Hearst analogue and her Japanese boyfriend and too much of Mr Reed, so I would recommend just watching it to the half way mark for the good bits... unless you have a partner you're trying to recruit or test the water with, in which case tell them it's a romance :P and gauge their reactions to the interesting bits while you try not to blush too much.

The tagline for this movie was ""They Imprisoned Her Body, But Freed Her Mind""... perhaps it will help you to do the same to someone else. ;)",1330214400,6,1394,4.416342412451362
3658954,1,B001JP63L0,"It had a mindless storyline, bad acting, bad lighting, poor directing, poor sound, you can't understand a thing being said. This movie is a complete and total waste of time, money and misplaced misery.",1310083200,4,201,4.9411764705882355
3658955,5,B001JP63L0,"First off, I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy that this movie is FINALLY released on DVD (I have been relying for YEARS on a VHS former-rental, praying it wouldn't die)!

Captive is not a movie for everyone.  It is the story of the poor little rich woman (actually, her father is a real jerk - Oliver Reed) who is kidnapped by a few ""domestic terrorists"".  They really are not ""terrorists"" so much as they see they misery this woman lives in and ""free"" her from her bounds using sensory deprivation and other means.

You have to remember, this movie was made in the 80's, so the clothes and the atmosphere are purely 80's.  Actually, I had purchased the soundtrack for this movie from the 10 for a dollar cassette bin (Yes, I am a child of the 80's) and the soundtrack written and performed by The Edge from U2 moved me.  It is sensual and visual.  I wanted to see the movie and found it at a local rental store.  I fell in love with the complete absurdity of the movie and ended up purchasing the cassette when the store went out of business.

This movie is experimental to say the least and the story does lack in a lot of areas, but the phrase I used - complete absurdity - is what makes this movie so great!

If you like off the wall, late-night movies from the 80's, this is the movie for you!",1267315200,26,1296,4.296296296296297
3658956,1,B001JP63L0,"One word - AWEFUL.  So aweful in fact that having forced myself to watch the entire film I then threw it in the trash.  The one thing that could have really shone in this dire film was Oliver Reeds performance, who had so little screen time, that he may have not have bothered to have been featured at all. Poor guy. Other than the good grace of Oliver Reed's brief presence, it had a pointless plot, useless acting; poor film quality and a non-sensical ending.  A waste of time and money.",1239321600,14,489,4.351648351648351
8313252,1,B001JP63L0,Two women are topless only. One is topless twice but don't really get a good view. The other is topless three times. All topless scenes are very brief,1519344000,,150,4.392857142857143
8313253,5,B001JP63L0,This movie is an interesting tale about kidnapping and terrorism. The soundtrack is great and the story is too.,1466121600,,111,4.894736842105263
8313254,2,B001JP63L0,I did not like it,1454716800,,17,2.6
8313255,3,B001JP63L0,Not a good film. Irina brook is attractive and plays the captive well.  The film loses its narrative drive when the captive is free.  A fictional retelling of the hearst kidnapping from the 1970s.,1448236800,,196,4.735294117647059
8313256,1,B001JP63L0,"Give this one a miss. In spite of the blurbs, it's not so much salacious as tedious, with some scenes appearing to be injected because someone thought that they looked artsy and cool rather than because they furthered the plot. It's slow, often dull, and ultimately disappointing",1418083200,,279,4.957446808510638
8313257,2,B001JP63L0,Kind of long and Booring Movie.,1408838400,,31,4.333333333333333
8313258,3,B001JP63L0,"The director appears to have been unable to decide if he was making a film about the Stockholm Syndrome or a titillating action/adventure.  You end up getting a bit of both, but not enough of either.

A rich girl is kidnapped and brainwashed by a group of anarchists.  She eventually joins them in their violent (by 1960's standards) crime spree.  Plenty of nudity during her torture/indoctrination, and several subsequent love scenes.",1400457600,2,435,5.084507042253521
8313259,3,B001JP63L0,"Many years ago as very young boy I had heard that records in a radio and copied it on a CC tape. Then through years I tried to find the CD version. Finaly I have found and felt ones more in love, :-). When you only listen to a music you can image the pictures, but what are the pictures about? The movie Captive I purchased some time ago here at Amazon is a DVD copy version of VHS movie isssued in 1986. So, the pictures are not so important if you realy love that music by the Egde from U2. The story is about a rich girl who lives with her father in a large house. She is kidnapped by three men and subjected to mental and sexual torture in an attempt tto brainwash her.  Interested enough?",1347148800,,693,4.021739130434782
8313260,2,B001JP63L0,"This is a ""Stockholm Syndrome"" movie with sex as the means.  The picture on the case is only a very small piece of what the victim went through.",1335830400,,144,4.142857142857143
