8587027,5,B000033Z9G,"I am the creator of this video and the director of the T'ai Chi Center in Madison, Wisconsin - one of the oldest and largest center's in the United States.  I am 55 years old, have done these exercises daily for over 25  years, and advocate this slow, gentle approach to exercise that stimulates  our natural vital energy.
The 52 minute video includes demonstration  and instruction in 3 and 4 minute gentle, stretching  routines that you can  do everyday.  Additionally, it includes warm-ups for T'ai Chi practitioners  and a demonstration of more advanced exercises.
Here is what one  jounalist has written about Energize!:  ""I woke up a couple hours  before dawn one day last week to try the warm-up video, as someone else  might start their day with an aerobics tape...[I] felt like my joints had  been oiled and every fiber of muscle tissue had been massaged from the  inside out.""
