8129575,5,B000G8NVOS,"Laurence Juber  is certainly one of the greatest guitarists on the planet but he's also an exceptional teacher.  This set is for players like myself and  many of my pals who have been picking for years or even decades and have pretty good ability but never took any real music classes and don't know what it is were doing!  Juber breaks down the neck of the guitar and begins with theory 101...he also goes into inversions , minor keys and some cool left hand exercizes.  He also teaches several of his best standard tuning  songs and goes through an easy version  of Greensleves in the minor key lesson.  The multiple angle function is very cool and the over 30 pages of tab/notation a great bonus!

I doubt I'd be able to get a 5 minute lesson with a player like this for $30 so...about 6 hours of footage is a great deal!",1151971200,12,824,4.368421052631579
