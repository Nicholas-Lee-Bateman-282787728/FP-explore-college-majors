2333975,4,B0009X765U,"The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.

Strange things are happening on Hannah's street in The Ghost Next Door, when a new boy magically moves into the house next door that has been abandoned for some time. The pale boy keeps disappearing and there is a dark shadow following her.

The Ghost Next Door is a freaky Goosebumps tale that kids will like watching around Halloween.",1346457600,,469,4.777777777777778
2333976,4,B0009X765U,Everything I show any of these shows to children they all just stop and stare. It is not to scary and good mysteries.,1291852800,,117,4.130434782608695

2333980,4,B0009X765U,"This is a solid Goosebumps movie from the series. If you read the book, it follows the story line somewhat, but does deviate a bit. The characters are the same but no doubt you'll notice scene omissions especially with the ""shadow"" that follows Hannah around. As the movie progresses it moves further away from the book, but still clings on to the main idea. It's not ""scary"", but it's not a cartoon either. Pretty well done",1215216000,,424,4.592105263157895
2333981,5,B0009X765U,"In this movie Hannah, a very weird girl goes around being ignored, she writes letters to this girl, her only friend who never replies back, her parents are never home and this leaves you wondering what is really going on? I won't give any spoilers but see this movie if you love the cheezy acting and fun horror! I laugh everytime! Great twist!

Favorite Part: The boys deaf Mom, and then hannah goes ""Your mom makes me want to learn sign language""",1137024000,,448,4.463414634146342
2333982,4,B0009X765U,"This movie is good, but they should really make a Monster Blood DVD.",1130457600,5,68,4.3076923076923075
2333983,4,B0009X765U,I think that The Ghost Next Door is a really good episode. It is kindof scary and I think its the best episode of the fourth season. It's also kind of creepy with the music and lighting in this movie.,1130371200,4,200,4.025

8069277,5,B0009X765U,"one of the better  goosebumps eps. the entire ep is a hour and worth it. there is no silliness, the acting is actually good and the plot is very good.  the first half of the story really gets u guessing as to who really the ghost is. it has one of those great rl stine twist at the end and the ending is lil sad. way better than the sweet pea story or it came from under the sink. this one is up there with stay out of the basement, the haunted mask, the head house and ghost beach",1412294400,2,481,3.8484848484848486
