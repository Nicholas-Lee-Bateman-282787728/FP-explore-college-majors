8103381,3,B000E0OE3U,"the DVD is actually quite short if you take away all the pseudo MTV talking and showing off the members of the dance group...
My kids are tired of it already",1373760000,,157,4.096774193548387
8103382,5,B000E0OE3U,"My nephews love this DvD.  Whenever they come over my house, they have a lot of fun watching this DVD and learning the dance steps.  I have to admit, I have fun right along with them.  I really wish they would have continued the series!",1279929600,,236,4.2
8103383,2,B000E0OE3U,"I purchased this product for my 3 kids who are 9, 6 and 4 and they became frustrated quickly.  They complained of the moves being too fast once they were taught.  I agree.  The movie also looks like it could be a bootleg movie.  Altough this movie is not extremly horrible, I would say save your money.  I bought this used for $3 with shipping and tax it came to $6 so i wasn't out of much money.",1225152000,,396,4.0256410256410255
8103384,5,B000E0OE3U,"This DVD is the coolest thing ever!  You might not realize it at first, but it is.  As the DVD and bonus features reveal, these kids are all just some of the most spectauclar personalites and talents put on this planet.  They have a lot of fun dancing and being brilliant together, and that awesome feel-good vibe and pulsating energy hits you hard.

  My favotire is Alyson Stoner--ya know, the girl bust'n in Missy Elliot and Eminem video's and JC Penny back to school comercials.  She's also plays Sarah in the Cheaper by the Dozen movies, and Sally on Disney's Mikes Super Short Show (among many other career hilights.)  It's amazing and fun, to see her in a fresh way, never presented before, and watch what she *really* can do.

  This DVD was actually released two years ago, but they're re-releasing it with mind-blowing can't miss bonuses and extras, like a lunch room battle scene, and doing a better job of promoting it this time.  Get on the the train early...these guys will become a phenomenon!",1136592000,10,1008,4.6647727272727275
