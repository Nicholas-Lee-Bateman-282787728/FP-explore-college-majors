8112348,5,B000EOTVQQ,"The story as everyone would guess is about in the snow, well they would be right of course, but this is a very cleverly done show, I love the story line and the actors did it justice. Action galore and I have pity for the baddies, they just woke up a mans inner sense of revenge so they are going to get it well and truly. A copper and family live in a remote part of the snow covered mountains and some strangers, killers I believe invade the home. With exciting moves and traps set to catch the fugitives is terrific. No time to waste so get with it,  go get the popcorn pick up the movie and relax to a full on fantastic show of thrills and spills, hanging by a tread here and there, you haven't got time to think and you won't go to sleep that's for sure. Keeps you on your toes with edge of the seat moves. I rated this movie an A grade plus. So do yourself a favor and put your feet up to a wonderful night of fabulous entertainment.  Enjoy!",1370476800,,947,4.031914893617022
