As this volume opens, Sora is at the beach when she comes upon an abandoned baby seal that has washed up on shore. Knowing Sora, we all know she won't be able to just leave it there, even though she knows pets aren't allowed at Kaleido Stage. Kalos seems to think that if you have time for a pet, you should be using that time to practice. It will be up to Sora and her friends to come up with a plan to allow the seal, who is named Jonathan, to remain.

 Episode 2 has to do with the arrival of Rosetta, the diabolo prodigy. She has signed a temporary one week contract. While Rosetta is a virtuoso with the diabolo, she seems to be lacking in passion and presentation. After she bombs her first performance, Kalos enlists Sora to help her.

 The third episode shows us another side of the always haughty Layla, the current star of the Kaleido Stage. Her father, an important corporate executive comes to visit. It turns out that he has never witnessed a complete performance by his daughter. He never has the time. Even on her birthday, he hires guests to come celebrate with her, instead of showing up himself. It's up to Sora to bring the two together and make Layla a little less lonely.

 The last episode of this volume focuses on Sora's first audition for a starring role in the next production of Kaleido Stage, ""The Little Mermaid"". One of the show's sponsors shows up demanding an instant rehearsal of the new show. If he doesn't like what he sees, the show will be cancelled. And he doesn't want to see Layla in the starring role. He wants someone new. That's when Sora decides to tryout. Will she be able to do it?

 This anime is very beautiful. I really enjoy the character of Sora. She's so kind you just hope she keeps on moving up the ladder of success. The storyline is innocent and engaging without the cuteness you think would be inherent in the setting. The animation is gorgeous, no surprise since this is a Gonzo production. It's also nice to see someone trying their hardest to achieve their dream. And as hard as Sora works, she's always there for her friends, and even Layla, who others would see as her rival. Oh yes, the Spirit of the Stage still lurks in her room, telling fortunes and lusting after Sora. Highly recommended.
