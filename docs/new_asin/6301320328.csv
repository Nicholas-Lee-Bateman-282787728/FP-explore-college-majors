7811046,4,6301320328,"Ah, ""Star Trek The Animated Series"" probably one of the most
overlooked cartoon series of all time. Created by
Paramount, featured the original voice actors: William
Shatner, Deforest Kelley (Doctor Mccoy) and of
of course Spock (Leonard Nimoy), the series was
pretty brilliant and memorable just like the original.
There were about 22 episodes trasmitted during 1973,and
feature scifuturistic and realistic stories, blended
in with the wonderful animation done by ""Funimation""
who did ""He-Man"". It also featured the original Star Trek
series to the letter, we had the classic intro, and we
had the ""captain's log, and captain's supplemental"" whenever
Captain Kirk was pitted in a serious situation. The
cartoon had a bigger budget in some parts than
the series and this was an obvious to fans.
This volume has two episodes ""Once Upon a Planet"" and
""Eye of the Beholder"" two great episodes.
The first episode ""Eye Of the Beholder"" featured
the enterprise investigating the disappearence of a science
team on an alient planet. When Kirk and Team investigated
they are attacked by strange creatures including
Giant slugs. They then realize that these slugs are
tough and have telepathic powers. They also find
among other things that the slugs have made a ""Scientific
Zoo"" capturing alien beings and they are next on the
list.....
They are some great laughs bantering on the relationship
between Dr. McCoy and Spock:
Spock: ""It is my theory that what we have seen since
we landed planet is manufactured, not created.""
Mccoy: ""Spock do you ever say anything straight out.""
Spock: ""I thought I just did.""
Captain Kirk: ""Please men we have work to do"".
LMAO. Great lines.
This a good episode complete with themes such as not
attacking those that look different, and how to
behave in situations that are new and different.
Finally this episode has all the classic Star Trek
lines such as ""Phasers on Stun!!!"". Very cool.
The next episode ""Once Upon a Planet"" is supposedly
a sequel to an episode of the original series called
""Shores Leaves"". The enterprise returns to alien planet
for rest and relaxation, but realize the planet has changed,
and the planet seems to be creating dangerous objects
coming from the planet.
Both these episodes are great. Gene Roddenberry, who
was just barely starting Star Trek a second run
in 1973, did the right decision making a cartoon
series. The bigger budget and scenarios have
given Trekkies yet another avenue to
""Boldy Go Where No One Has Gone Before"".
I haven't seen the cartoon since I was kid, so
I forgot about how good it was, and to see
it now as an adult, and understanding the stories
more, helps me appreciate how great this series
is, and how much of a visionary Gene Roddenberry
was.
So what are you waiting for and check out
""Star Trek The Animated Series""!!!",1083369600,3,2806,4.909473684210527
7811047,5,6301320328,"This volume's got two great episode's. ""The eye of the Beholder"". And a sequel to the original Star Trek's ""Shore Leave"" called ""Once upon a planet."" These cartoons have the  charm of the original tv show plus the original voices of all the  characters. The animation isn't bad for 1973-74. The first episode has a  classic ""lesson to learn"" theme we find through out star trek and  the second finds the crew in trouble on the shore leave planet. Classic  Star Trek.",954028800,5,466,4.634146341463414
