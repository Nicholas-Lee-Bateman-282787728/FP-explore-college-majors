5685350,5,B00C1LIZEE,Amazing film one of the best LGBTQ movies OUT their.  I love how the film focuses on the issues of brown queer youth in a real way.,1370736000,,131,3.8518518518518516
5685351,5,B00C1LIZEE,"From the very beginning, this film held my attention. Every note was perfect, the writing, the story, the directing, the acting. An honest story told beautifully. The dialogue was well done, but it was almost unnecessary, so great is the director at evoking emotion through simple images. Few films with lesbian main characters reach this level. It's no wonder the director, Aurora Guerrero, was named one of the ""25 New Faces of Independent Film."" I'm looking forward to her next film.",1370390400,9,486,5.012345679012346
5685352,3,B00C1LIZEE,"I'm not sure what I expected from the story line, but the ending was a bit out-of-step with the rest of the movie, I thought. Other than that, stellar acting performances from the two young leads...worth watching.",1370390400,,213,4.783783783783784
5685353,4,B00C1LIZEE,i liked this movie.i just wish it would have high lighted there relationship more.all in all it is a good movie to watch when your just wanting to relax and enjoy.,1369872000,,163,4.290322580645161
5685354,5,B00C1LIZEE,"cult classic,about life in general&sexploration of 2 latinas&peer pressure&hard times we face as teens,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!Girls are BEAUTIFUL/GORGEOUS!Mi'Vida'Loca(new age version)",1369612800,,181,8.1
5685359,4,B00C1LIZEE,"Not a stereotypical coming of age/coming out movie. It was very ""real world"". Would have liked to see the relationship blossom more, but you are given enough for your imagination to take it from there. :-)",1379030400,,205,4.722222222222222
5685360,3,B00C1LIZEE,"captured teenage angst very well but the pacing was slow. I became impatient and fast forwarded it so, to be fair, will view it again and amend my comments.",1378252800,,156,4.413793103448276
5685361,5,B00C1LIZEE,although I have given five stars I feel the movie missed out on been a bit raunchier all round .,1376784000,,96,3.85
5685362,5,B00C1LIZEE,"As a queer Latina, I eagerly awaited the release of this film. It did not disappoint. This female-directed feature is beautiful and had me in tears by the end. So many Hollywood films and television shows reduce Latin@s to stereotypes; this, on the other hand, did everything right. It felt true and was both sweet and sad, while never becoming sentimental. One note for people who don't speak Spanish, though, is that some of the dialogue is in Spanish, so you'll have to deal with subtitles. (The only reason that I mention this is that I know that some people don't like subtitles, though, personally, I don't think that's enough of a reason to miss this gem.) All in all, I cannot praise this enough.",1373760000,14,704,4.64
5685363,5,B00C1LIZEE,"EXCELLENT movie. one of its kind. a sweet tale that many lgbt youth can relate to, especially latino lgbt youth. beautifully directed. i highly recommend it.",1373414400,5,157,5.076923076923077
5685364,3,B00C1LIZEE,"This is a cute little movie and I rate it very pg.  It never develops into anything other than puppy love so if you are expecting some HOT romance, be prepared to be disappointed.",1373241600,,179,4.264705882352941
5685365,5,B00C1LIZEE,"The writing, directing, and acting on this film are stellar. It's hard to believe that this is the director's first feature film. Development of each character was captivating and the storylines flowed smoothly. Although the personalities of Mari and Mosquita were diverse, it was easy to identify with their individual plight. This is one of those movies that had me replaying scenes in my head (including the creative ending) long after the credits rolled. The behind-the-scenes clips in the DVD were informative and highlighted the cast and crew's synergy. Highly recommended for all teens and adults.",1373068800,4,604,5.302083333333333
5685366,5,B00C1LIZEE,"This is one of those films that when it ends you feel you want more.  We enter the world of two teenage girls growing up in LA. One comes from a strong intact family that wants to see their daughter succeed and the other is being raised by a struggling single mother. There are no ""declaration of love"" or ""love scenes"". The movie did not need it.  The story felt more real and honest about how two people start to recognize the feelings of love for each other. But, being young one is not sure what to do about it. I highly recommend this movie.",1372982400,6,546,4.190476190476191
5685367,4,B00C1LIZEE,"Good acting by both leads. Nice depiction of life in brief moments of growing up. Always hard to capture the many reasons for ""young adult angst"".",1372377600,,146,4.653846153846154
5685368,4,B00C1LIZEE,"If you can't bear to watch another coming out or coming of age story, you might not want to watch this movie. But you will be missing a beautiful piece of naturalistic film-making. Both these girls go through a loss of innocence, an entirely realistic maturation process from girl into woman that no one is particularly happy about. Not the parents. Not even the young women. Nobody comes out, though. I'm not completely sure that the characters know who they are yet. They're in the process of becoming who they are, or who they're going to become. The filmmaker captures that brief period when sexual identity is awakening, but hasn't declared itself quite yet. It's a poignant time in a young girl's life, where every emotion is amplified, and the line between friendship and something more gets blurred. It's rare that we get to see that time from the point of view of the young women. Usually the story is told from the point of view of an adult -- either some adult in the girl's life, or the girl herself from the relative safety of a point of reference sometime in the future. Not this movie. We are in the moment with these young women. We're allowed a glimpse of what they're going through, what they feel. In that respect, this story has a tone and intensity that reminds me of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" (the book, not the movie). The ending is intentionally ambiguous. It's not your typical Hollywood happy ending. How you perceive the ending, and what you think will happen next, after the closing credits, says more about you than the characters in the film. It's rare when a movie makes you think without preaching.",1372118400,6,1630,4.624137931034483
8576203,1,B00C1LIZEE,Everyone raves about this film when really it's nothing special. The whole thing was one big tease. The audience is built up only to be let down in the end. Don't waste your money purchasing this film. There was more boy/girl action than girl/girl. Highly disappointed and the acting was awful.,1490486400,,294,4.784313725490196
8576204,5,B00C1LIZEE,Do not miss this one. It is a gem,1465948800,,33,2.7777777777777777

8576208,5,B00C1LIZEE,"I gave this movie a 5 star, not because it is a ""gay movie,"" but this movie took me back to my teenage years where I met my bff when I was in 7th grade, and some of the  senerios that occuried in this movie, actually went on in our friendship. We both just couldmt get enough of each other. However, what I thought back then was innocent friendship love, turned out to actually be my first female attraction love. And now as adults, after a long seperation of 18 years from my bfff, we reunited through Facebook, and we talked for a while about our lives, she had missed me every day of her life(according to her husband he said that to me), and I had thought about her at least 5-6 time each year, but never looked for her for fear of rejection, but she found me, and i some how confided in her about my own life, and after a few weeks of catching up, she  no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. Why? Because she recognized that our friendship was really a lesbian romance for all those years of junor high and high school years, she is afraid because she is now a ""christain,"" and think being gay is a ""sin,"" so to keep herself from ""falling,"" she blocked me from her Facebook, phone, Whatapp, and her life, which really hurt me even to this day. As for this movie, the young girls are very confused about their desires, but deep down they really don't know that they will be their first girl crush, and they will always remember  each other because of it!!",1419120000,4,1469,4.220640569395018
8576209,2,B00C1LIZEE,"This movie was alright, but it was kind of about nothing. Spanish culture in America, mostly. 2 girls who don't even go so far as A kiss. I def wouldn't've bought it if I knew how uneventful and long-winded it was. Good $ down the drain...",1414972800,,239,4.217391304347826
8576210,5,B00C1LIZEE,"Saw the screening in NYC and loved it. Great story, directing, and acting. We need more positive representations of young LGBTQ people of color in film and other media!",1400112000,2,168,4.827586206896552
8576211,2,B00C1LIZEE,The reviews I read and even the preview I watched was I lead on. However I did enjoy the movie on sole purpose of friendship and the culture difference that it represented. But as for the genre that it was placed in not so much. There is definite chemistry and potential but too much focus elsewhere for it to be placed in the gay and lesbian romantic movies. Which is where I found it.,1393891200,,386,4.22972972972973
8576212,2,B00C1LIZEE,I was very disappointed in this movie.  It was amateurish and the ending did not bring any sort of closure to the story line.,1383177600,,125,4.208333333333333
