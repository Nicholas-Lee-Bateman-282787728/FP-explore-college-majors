There has been some STUDIO work on the AUDIO TRACK, but I do believe Martin is singing on every song, and not Lip Syncing as mentioned in another review.  The treat for me was seeing Martin Perform a very slow version of Dance With Me.  It is really beautiful.  I know the price seems expensive, but I also know that Brady Harper (I think I got the name correct) spent a lot of TIME and MONEY on this personally.  It is definitely cheaper than traveling to see the band play in Europe!!!  The Quality of the Production is top notch!  There is also an Easter Egg audio of Cosmopolitician!  Love the behind the scenes stuff as well.",1326326400,2,737,4.367647058823529
8432945,4,B004KHWSA4,"The DVD is very good in some places , but then it fades out at the concert progresses.  Mr Gold starts off full of energy and his first few songs he does actually sing live.  A victory of love is excellent and is followed by the best version of Inside out anywhere on the planet.  It is probobly one of the best live versions of any song by any artist .  I was always a big fan of this group from the very beginning .  However , the live concert seems to change as there is a lot of backround vocals used and it really seems that Marion does not appear to be singing live at all on most of the songs . I would say that he recorded some of the songs earlier and then lip sync took over during Forever Young and Big in Japan.
Over all the DVD is a good buy as the songs are still great in any format.  I was disappointed with the group as they could have been so much better if the whole concert was really live.",1304899200,,910,3.891891891891892
