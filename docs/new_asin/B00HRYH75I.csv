6202122,1,B00HRYH75I,This is the worst sci-fi movie Ive ever seen and I have watched alot of them.,1405641600,3,77,3.875
6202123,5,B00HRYH75I,"Asteroid vs Earth is a great movie Directed by Christopher Olen Ray and written by Adam Lipsius.  I stars Tia Carrere, Robert Davi, Gerald Webb, Tim Russ and many others. This is a film release by The Asylum studios. When a shower of massive meteors threatens an extinction level event on Earth, the world's greatest minds devise a dangerous plan that will take the plant off its axis in order to avoid the impact.  This film was very well written, directed and acted. The only thing that could be improved on this film is closed captioning for us older folks that depends on it.  This is a film i am proud to own.",1400976000,2,614,4.415929203539823
6202124,2,B00HRYH75I,"*May have spoilers

I do not like to beat up on a movie but for this one I feel I want to make an exception. There are plenty of science fiction films in the schlock B genre. Some work because the they are funny, silly  or the plot  is just enough to believe in and you feel for the characters in jeopardy. ""Snakes on a Plane,"" was out there but managed to created some tension.

There is little tension in Asteroid vs. Earth.  Jason Brooks Tia Carrerre and Tim Russ are all actors I admire. Here they are mired in the middle of a muddled story that has been done before about a huge asteroid hitting earth. Here the plot twist is duck (spoiler coming )  that instead of blasting the asteroid they come up with a plan to move the earth out of the way.  Tim Russ is shadow of what he can do as are Carrere and Jason Brooks. Robert Davi is not very belivable as the military figure behind much of the plod of the film. Given the material it is not surprising the acting was limp. All the cast have done and can do better.

Physics of the earth being moved notwithstanding, the cast did little to make anything even half-believable or make me feel for them. The main peril was not the cheesy styrofoam asteroid plummeting to earth, but the writer's script and this production hurtling into theaters and crashing onto an unsuspecting public.

Much of the - er - action occurs on the USS POLK (an SSBN, (USS James K. Polk, SSBN-645), a Benjamin Franklin class fleet ballistic missile submarine converted in an attack sub and scrapped in 2000.

The sets on the POLK are a joke (the bridge and con) looked my garage after I took my car to pieces. I will not spoil it by telling you how the sub is used to go into a Pacific trench and then save the world.

Some of these B movies work at some level because they let you have fun by laughing the films expense.  Like a real Asteroid, this was a downhill ride from the opening credits, with little laugh factor I was hoping for. I want to reccommend this, but I cannot think that hard without it hurting.

Having worked in film/tv production this films gets 2 stars for the fact they made it and got it into theaters which is tougher than any foam asteroid.

Beyond that it is overpriced as a 6.00 rental.

Watch at your risk if you are curious.",1400025600,7,2285,4.269141531322505

8635289,2,B00HRYH75I,"Numerous violations of the laws of physics, obvious CGI graphics, a sex pot co-lead (Hi Tia!), stilted dialogue, blatant stereotypes.... what more could you ask for in an action movie!  Did anyone else think the ""nuclear warheads"" when removed from the delivery vehicles looked suspiciously like painted Styrofoam? (The visible polystyrene cells were a bit too obvious)  There must have been some pretty random traveling going on off-camera as well. One scene we are off the island of Palau (probably the main isalnd, which has docks) - then Rudy takes a radio call saying he has 49 minutes to drag a nuke into a volcano on Saipan. For the record, Palau and Saipan are almost 900 miles apart across a stretch of ocean that includes Guam. No doubt Rudy has his work cut out for him as he soups up the engines to make the trip at over 1,000 miles per hour.  Then somehow they find a deserted stretch of beach strewn with landmines which somehow were still live after 70 years of waves and salt water corrosion. The last time I flew into Saipan, the whole island looked inhabited as the plane came in - and I don't recall any volcanic cones. For heaven's sake, why didn't they pick a beach with a road and ""acquire"" a car? More amazing is that the polystyrene warheads (and Rudy) didn't melt as he hobbled backwards up the volcanic slope between two exposed lava flows.

Getting back to the whole ""set off two nukes and de-stabilize the Ring of Fire to somehow magically produce thrust to move the Earth... Imagine the earth as a large plastic bag filled with jello. The only thing setting off a nuke is going to accomplish is causing that jello to slosh around inside the bag. Unless part of the earth's crust breaks free and travels off in one direction, there won't be any thrust, just a lot of needless shaking, and more people dying from earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic activity.

Maybe the plan was to kind of squash the Earth's equator (kind of like tightening a belt), so the asteroid could squeak by... now THAT sounds like something the little boy scientist might have come up with. On one level my brain feels abused, my eyes are bleeding from the special effects, and my ears are still cringing from the dialogue. On the other hand, I did enjoy laughing through this movie. A joy to witness: Tia cranking out line after line of science. And Hollywood, it is possible to make a movie without sticking in a token homosexual couple, and without bowing down to our new economic masters in China - I'm just saying...",1440547200,3,2524,4.612472160356347
