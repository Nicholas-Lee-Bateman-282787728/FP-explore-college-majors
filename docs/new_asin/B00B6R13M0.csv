8563394,5,B00B6R13M0,"A very insightful documentary covering the many facets of aging.  I laughed out loud several times and was equally touched and saddened at times.  Very honest and unafraid, I highly recommend this documentary for the perspective it gives on life, regardless of your current age.",1366848000,,278,5.155555555555556
8563395,5,B00B6R13M0,"I've seen this movie twice.  It makes me laugh, but more than that it is emotionally compelling.  Life and death.  I think it has a good mix of witty humor and life lessons.  This film was revolutionary for me.",1360972800,,210,4.3076923076923075
8563396,5,B00B6R13M0,"A warm, heartfelt story of finding purpose and love at 88 years old in a retirement community. Laughed and cried. A perfect film for all ages.",1359331200,,142,4.5
8563397,5,B00B6R13M0,"I have been waiting a few years for this to come out on DVD, and it lived up to all my expectations!  As a USC film school graduate, I am picky about what documentaries I like, and this one absolutely was one of the best I have ever seen.  From the first couple minutes when the main character introduces himself and smiles (twice), I knew it was going to be a riot from beginning to end.  But what's unique about this film is the fact that, amidst all the opportunities to laugh and have fun, there are also so many moments where you can't help but think about what it means to age.  I have shared it with family, friends, and coworkers of all ages, and everyone agrees that it's a real gem in a world where entertainment is increasingly defined by cheap thrills and shallow storylines.  A must-see!",1359244800,3,800,4.342281879194631
