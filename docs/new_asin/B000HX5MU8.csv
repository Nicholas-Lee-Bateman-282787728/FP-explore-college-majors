Things and events can so easily become exaggerated, of becoming worsened or improved thru the misty lens of memory. So please keep in mind that despite all my efforts, I'm not impartial. I'm fan from when I first screened this film, and that impact has not lessened over the passage of years.

Now, on the other hand, I'm very attuned to the failure of memory. A good example of that was '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Valley-of-Gwangi/dp/B0000B1OGD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Valley of Gwangi</a>'. Like this film, a production that I had very fond memories of - until the day I had a chance to screen it with and through adult eyes. Yeesh. What a steaming pile!  :-D

My point is that even though I'm a fan - this non-stop action, fun-filled flick holds up well some forty years after it hit theaters.

The story: By all appearances Mr. Benjamin Burton is extremely wealthy, fastidiously tailored, and a man of high culture. All true. But how did he come to such social prominence? Answer: He's a thief. Oh, not your average grubby snatch-n-grab thug or agile cat-like burglar. No, Burton is a thinker; a planner of exceptional brilliance. This the man behind some of the most complex heists in the history of the UK.

His street name: Brain.

And Brain has devised the penultimate boost. A theft so clever and so radical that no one, save himself, could've thought of it, much less bring it to fruition.

He and his six cohorts are going to rob The Royal Mint - while still held in lockdown as prisoners.

Their mission: Break out of the penitentiary. Then, unbelievably, break back in and return to incarceration without anyone realizing they were gone. Only when they do, it'll be with 2 million pounds in their back pockets. Mind you this was 1968 money. Two million quid would be approximately twenty-million today. Quite a substantial payday.

Brain's plan is timed down to the very last second - no deviations are allowed. None. Of course, what would this movie be without several such deviations? The biggest and most difficult of which is a hanger-on, another prisoner that's not part of the team or the plan who insists that either he goes with them, or he sinks the lot by turning stool pigeon.

As always, Brain's plan calls for no bloodshed - not one drop - and there's no time for debate. The loud-mouthed idiot goes. So begins this very enjoyable heist flick as the team of seven, and a cumbersome 'plus one', race across London in order to keep pace with the FA Cup Final football match between Sheffield and Everton. All while the coppers, led by inimitable Terry-Thomas, are not far behind.

One of the best from this period of campy European B-Movies. And an all-time personal favorite.

Movie Notes:

- One could argue that this 1968 film could be considered part of a pseudo-trilogy since star Gastone Moschin was in two previous heist capers very similar to '7 Volte 7' by way of The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Golden-Men/dp/B002MZZTY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Golden Men</a>&nbsp;flicks, which were directed by the producer of this film - Marco Vicario.

The key difference was that in those previous productions he played a much smaller role as lieutenant to the head honcho.

I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference it makes to have the bald one in charge - his performance is a tremendous game changer. Devilishly energetic and sly, Moschin's presence amplifies the fun factor by a hundred-fold simply because he's in the production.

Gastone is The Man as far as I'm concerned. And with him in the lead, this kind of lighthearted criminal escapade really found it's archetype.

- Since I grew up with the English dubbed voiceover, I'm quite comfortable with that version today. However, purists might find it distracting. And the only way I know to watch this film with its original Italian soundtrack and in widescreen - notably without English subtitles - is by way of a rare Japanese produced dvd. In fact, I spent years searching for this disc so I could copy the cover artwork and produce a poster for my workspace. After such a long and fruitless endeavor, I eventually gave up and created my own poster. The very same one seen in this Amazon.com listing. <g>

Personal Note:

- As mentioned previously, obtaining a digital copy of this film is quite the herculean task; countless searches ending in disappointment and frustration. And despite the fact that we live in a world of digital everything - obtaining a clean and sharp widescreen disc was like finding an honest sales executive - nearly impossible.
