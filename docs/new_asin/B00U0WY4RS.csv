8703767,5,B00U0WY4RS,"This set first focuses on Hibito and the launch (though from Muttas perspective, not Hibito's), then finishes up with the end of the astronaut exam and the results.
Trivia: When Hibito makes it to the moon, he is dubbed the Moon Rabbit (or something like that) by the Japanese media. This is because the Japanese, instead of seeing the Man in the Moon, see a rabbit pounding mochi (rice cake).

Hibitos screen time is steady growing, which I enjoyed, as Hibito is actually a very interesting character. Kenji and Serika also get more attention, each get their own episode telling their backstory and fleshing them out as characters. An eccentric new character is also introduced.

This set contains episodes 27-38 (12 episodes) out 99 total. At this rate, the last set (number 8 at the current) should come out  around April 2016. That would make it a little over a year to release all sets for the series!

I saw the entire series on Crunchyroll, but am working on collecting the DVDs as well :)",1430352000,4,996,4.674285714285714
