7948816,1,B00005OLB9,"This is not the first film I have bought here that was recommended to me that turned out to be so bad. I think the actor in the main role is kind of charming and engaging, but this film.... Bad script, mediocre to bad acting, no plot development. Doesn't even live up to the quality of the sitcoms on UPN. I wanted to like it. I'm from Philadelphia, and I usually like to see my old city in films.
I suspect the teeny bit of gay content led to the recommendation, as I tend to search out good GLBT themed films. And I like a good indie film. But I am growing very weary of having to settle for mediocrity. This one was worse than most I've seen. I look over my purchases, and I see quite a lot of really good films, shorts collections, and such. And I do rate most of my purchases, so there should be some discretion in amazon's recommendations. Just because other people who made the same purchases bought another product is not grounds for recommendations. My partner has a shorter review of this film, but equally disappointed.",1013731200,5,1030,4.341968911917099
7948817,5,B00005OLB9,"Waiting is a funny real life experience. The actors were believable and made the film move without drag. If anyone that has waited a table in any city, big or small, they have to laugh at seeing things they recognize and have lived through. See it and you'll recommend it to your friends.",1007856000,4,288,4.452830188679245
