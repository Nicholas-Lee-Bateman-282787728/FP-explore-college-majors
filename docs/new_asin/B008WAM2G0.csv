5187395,3,B008WAM2G0,"I enjoyed The Rites Of Spring to a degree, I just wish that they would have concentrated on the Horror/Slasher aspect of the film instead of taking up so much time with the kidnapping sub plot. I feel they were a bit too ambitious especially with a running time of an hour and 20 minutes.
It felt it borrowed from Malevolence and The Messengers 2..
I won't say why but you will be able to decipher for yourself. The slasher aspect was very cool, well done and if it had been an entire film about ""The Rites Of Spring"" I would have loved it,the creature was mad cool and the gore was plentiful for the time that story line was given.
The characters were interwoven cleverly even though I really had to watch it a second time to really understand how each character was connected. The acting was good for a low budget film especially Anessa Ramsey and AJ Bowen..
All in all worth a watch and better than most that are being pumped out lately.",1343520000,3,940,4.346590909090909
5187396,4,B008WAM2G0,"If you are on the hunt for a new thrilling and suspenceful horror flick, then IFC Midnight's latest release, Rites Of Spring, is the one for you. Written and directed by Padraig Reynolds, Rites Of Spring brings the thriller and horror genres together in perfect harmony. This film delivers on all cylinders with an exciting story line, a believable cast and tons-o-gore.

While two stories are being intercut during this film, one being more of a thriller and the other a straight-up horror piece, Rites Of Spring delivers a perfect marrige between the two. With a creepy old farmer preying on young women in one, and a kidnapping that doesn't go as planned in the parallel tale, a great deal of mystery plays out in both.

The cast found within this film are all lesser known/unknown actors who obviously have a passion for film. Anessa Ramsey delivers a spine-tingling performance as the character Rachel and after this film, she is destined to be called upon for many more horror roles in the future. From her line delivery to her trembling hands, Ramsey's screen presence is remarkable to say the least.

As the film progresses, the blood begins to spill more and more. There are a few effects, that looked to be done with After Effects, that can be done without, but overall the look and realism of the gore is well above average. A round of applause must be give to the practical effects crew as well as the members of this production who came up with the look of the mysterious monster-like killer. This very scary and realistc looking crazy killer dons old rags and maggots as he brutely murders his victims.

Rites Of Spring was a surprisingly fun and blood filled ride from begining to end.",1343347200,,1700,4.694630872483222
5187397,4,B008WAM2G0,"A young woman, who is the daughter of a wealthy family is abducted by a group of kidnappers. They all hide in an abandoned school in the woods. The group of kidnappers begin to split up as guilt takes over, and the intense drama begins as the original plan becomes a risk of getting caught. Scary, edge-of-your-seat tension and suspense. The viewer is taken on a roller-coaster-ride through thrills and chills. Haunting, creepy, Acting Performance Good. Recommended for horror and thriller lovers!",1343347200,,497,5.073170731707317
5187398,2,B008WAM2G0,"This is one of those ""sacrifice people for a bountiful harvest"" movies. A quartet of kidnappers runs afoul of a backcountry buffoon who is also kidnapping young women to sacrifice to a demon. The female victims are tied up and then decapitated by someone who runs around in a scary mask and lives in a barn cellar. The two plot points collide as the first kidnappers wind up at the farm. Towards the end, a couple of the main characters make pretty serious errors in judgment, resulting in tragedy for one of them. The story is left a bit open-ended, particularly with the end-credits scene.

Without spoiling the plot, let's just say this movie doesn't explain very much at all what is going on with the ""creature"" (who movies exactly like a man wearing a mask). The relationship between the creature and the kidnapping crazy guy is never explained. What happens to the kidnapped girl held for ransom is never explained, although a minor point. Viewers don't need a lot of explanation in this kind of movie, but this one needed to engage its audience with some sense of the bigger picture.",1438300800,2,1090,4.677083333333333

5187400,4,B008WAM2G0,"Just as in life there is no slow set up to a situation you may face or walk into, so to is how this film begins. The story starts as if we were always watching these characters lives with the plot already in motion. It doesnt stop in the steady intense build from the beginning until the final moments with the scene freezes and the credits role. The movie takes place in a small town with little going on. However in this town there just happens to be a family that gives human sacrifice for prosperity of crops in the coming year. A ritual blood offering to a crazed psychotic slasher that may or may not be supernatural. There is no real detail to the origin of the monster in this film.

When the lives crash into one another the darkness intensifies and you almost hold your breath in anticipation of what will happen next. There are some pretty intense moments that give fright as they characters are cut down gruesomely one by one. When the action and horror unfolds it is sudden and none stop right up until the last scene. Then the film ends just as quick as it began with no real finish or conclusion. The story or stories as I should say at first seem scattered and confusing but before it can bother you much the plot unfolding on screen seems to hold you long enough for the nightmare to begin. I really enjoyed this film and cant wait for another ritual sacrifice to bring on a new spring. In other words I hope there is a sequel to this movie.",1431216000,,1458,4.301818181818182
5187401,3,B008WAM2G0,"I just watched this film yesterday and I have to say that it is a pretty good little film.  It's really like two movies in one, you have a kidnapping and ransom story and you have a slasher flick all in one.  The cinematography is pretty good, the acting is decent too, the only thing is the movie doesn't really go into a lot of detail and leaves you wondering what just happened.
The ""monster"" is really cool, I like him alot.  Big menacing and brutal, everything you want in a killer.  Though, we don't know anything about him, who is he? where is he from? how did he get this way?  is he real or supernatural?  No idea.  The ""stranger"" is just as confusing, all he says in the movie is ""are you clean"" and ""don't let him out"".  No idea.
In the end there are a lot of unanswered questions, like where did the little girl go?  And yes, they left it wide open for a sequel with the Texas Chainsaw massacre like ending.
Nonetheless, the movie does work and it was pretty enjoyable.  Hope they make another and tie up some things for me.",1416182400,,1036,4.213197969543147
5187402,5,B008WAM2G0,"As I am a huge TRUE HORROR fan (not this ""found footage"" crap of today), I really liked this movie and it is movies like this that leave me with some faith that the genre is not lost to ""quick buck-PG13 crapfests"" of the past 8-10 years.  If you like Ti West's movies, you will like Rites of Spring, as it is filmed very similarly (and pleasurably, has AJ Bowen as part of the cast - who is also a Ti West mainstay).  The premise of the movie isn't that convoluted and while the movie is somewhat vague with presenting it's foundation, there are plenty of hints throughout.  This movie is about sacrifice for abundance (LISTEN TO THE NEWS BROADCAST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!!!).  There are many religions that historically would sacrifice people to appease Gods/Goddess or for abundance.  There are people who would sacrifice pretty much anything for money.

SPOILERS!!!!  This film is about a form of ancient evil that much be given human sacrifices once a year on the first of Spring for an abundant farming season - KARMANOR - a Cretan demi-god related to the harvest.  With the cows' heads being placed on the sacrifices and the rows of corn (the one huge ""flaw"" for me in filming, as on March 21, the first day of Spring when the movie is taking place, even in Mississippi, there would not be fully grown corn in the fields).  The mysterious old man even says ""tradition"" when asked why he was doing this.  There are many communities throughout the world that live by superstition/religious beliefs, and this seems to be true with a majority of communities that farm for a living.  Whatever the killer/beast is, it must be sacrificed to for this community to have abundant crops.  It is also clear to me that the entire community is aware that this occurs and will not do anything about it (at the end of the movie, when the store clerk would not let the girl in) as it benefits them all.  I have read complaints on here about the ending, and I thought it is quite well done.  I took it as clearly meaning that she will not be helped by anyone and that once discovered, she will still be sacrificed - she is running away from the inevitable.  You see that she wounds the beast/killer, but it is not clear if she actually kills it . . .or if there are others on other farms.

I have also seen criticisms on the secondary story of the secondary story about the kidnapping.  BOTH STORIES ARE RELATED (listen to the conversation Alyssa and Rachel have at the beginning of the movie).  The ""twist"" involving one of the hostages and one of the kidnappers shows the exact story line - what some people would be willing to sacrifice for abundance (in this case, a daughter would sacrifice her parents for money).  Also, Ben had ""sacrificed"" himself working for the father's company, only for the owner to not even know his name and to be fired for Rachel's mistake.

The glory of a GOOD horror movie is that a truly talented director/writer is cerebral and creates, while at face value seemingly ""shallow"", a movie that has layers of meaning and connection of any/all stories going on during it.  To do that and create the all-important atmosphere direly needed for any horror movie to be done right, and you have a GOOD horror movie . . .and that is what Rites of Spring is in my opinion.",1390348800,,3291,4.506734006734007
5187403,3,B008WAM2G0,"I stumbled upon this film on Netflix, and the plot sounded decent enough so I gave it a try. I wasn't expecting much, and with all of these low budget horror films, there's good reason not to get your hopes up. Every now and then you do find a diamond in the rough. This one is no diamond, but it certainly isn't terrible and definitely watchable. For one, I do have a somewhat of a tolerance and forgiveness when it comes to low budget horror flicks. You have to understand that the story might not be totally cohesive. There might not be the best of acting performances. Maybe not the best special effects. But that's gonna happen. And sure, this film has its problems. But none of them are so bad that it makes the movie not worth watching.
  Without getting too in-depth, the film involved two different plots and characters cross paths with a killer/monster. This is a slasher film, so you have introduce some characters so you can have a body count of sorts. And the overlapping plot of a kidnap/ransom gone wrong works ok. Nothing really creative, but not bad. Sure, there's not a lot of explanation when it comes to the killer..who or what he is, etc. And the ending is very abrupt and sorta reminds me of the ending of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I notice that tends to bother a lot of people in films, when things aren't explained completely or films end suddenly. As for me, it really doesn't bother me, and I don't have to have a backstory explaining everything to enjoy it. (The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is like that, and its a horror masterpiece) Perhaps what could be annoying is that the film does attempt to tell a story about why all this is happening, and falls incomplete. But again, none of this is a big deal to me. Besides that, there's not a lot more to stay about the film. The acting isn't superb, but its decent. The camera and cinematography is pretty good. The special effects/gore was underwhelming, and the kills could have been better. But again, that was probably because of budget reasons. The film's running time is short (around an hour and 20 minutes), and I think that kept the film moving rather quickly  which was good. Overall, this film is a half-step above a lot of low budget horror flicks. It's probably not worth a buy, but it's worth a one-time viewing at least.",1388188800,,2327,4.535714285714286
5187404,5,B008WAM2G0,"Rites of spring is a fine little film, and has a uncommon storyline where there is a dual set of circumstances going on at the same time. i didn't really care for the story of the kidnapping/ransom part of the story, and wish that they would have concentrated more on the sacrificial part of it. i wonder if there is a longer version of this film that had key scenes that were cut out because of censorship, that would have explained why stuff happened the way it did? in the first part of the film an older guy prepares for a sacrificial date and has to have virgins to sacrifice to a monster locked away in the bottom of the barn. it didn't make any sense to me why they had to chop off heads and use goat heads for the sacrifice? it is a shame that they couldn't remake this film and just have the storyline revolve around the monster/sacrifice story. would have been fantastic if they could divulge more about the monster and why they had to sacrifice chicks to him. oh. well... maybe if enough reviewers say the same thing they will do a remake or at least release a longer un-cut version complete with all the nudity, gore, torture missing from the original. Anessa ramsey is a real hotty and so was her girlfriend... hope to see them both in a remake of Rites of Spring. Again great film just thought that it could have been better with the storyline.",1371340800,,1358,4.350393700787402
5187405,5,B008WAM2G0,"Wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  The two story lines really kept me interested through out the movie and it never got boring.  Great acting, cinematography and story.",1362614400,,186,5.379310344827586
5187406,1,B008WAM2G0,"Take 3 somewhat interesting plot ideas, 7 amateur actors, 15 horror cliches (the occult, creepy old man, torture, animal sacrifice, boobs, a good hearted bad guy, a double cross, a rusty weapon, chases on roads, through cornfields, and through the deep dark woods), and mash them all together without the aid of a script editor and you'll wind up with this mess.

Oh, and somewhere, running through the night, is an 8 year old plot device that I guess we're just supposed to forget about. I'm sure she can fend for herself. (She'll have to becuase the storyline abandons her beyond all logic.)

Don't waste your money on a rental. You've probably got a VHS copy of Ghost Dad lying around somewhere.",1346544000,10,698,4.713114754098361
5187407,3,B008WAM2G0,RITES OF SPRING is one creepy little horror flick that is two movies in one.  Part of the movie is a crime drama and the other a WICKER MAN type horror film with a great creature named Worm Face.  At first watch I didn't really know what to think of the movie.  It's very ambitious and keeps you guessing throughout.  Which I found very satisfying for these type of films.  I also enjoyed that the two stories were connected and that the Rachel character is responsible for this butterfly effect that she sets in motion.  There are some holes in the script that left me puzzled.  What happened to the little girl?  What happened to the bodies? Does it really end like that?  The movie looks very professional and is absolutely beautiful.  RITES OF SPRING is a gem of a low budget horror movie but I just wish that the script would have taken a little more time to explain itself.  Definitely worth a rental and far better then a lot of big budget horror movies out there.,1344124800,5,971,4.398876404494382
8531507,5,B008WAM2G0,"A sleeper that strikes a near-perfect balance of elements from Texas Chainsaw, Children Of The Corn and Cohen brothers-style small town crime drama without blatantly ripping them off. The cast of very good unknown actors portray believable characters written with sliding moral scales. The scares and mayhem are there too. For me, many horror films fall apart with multiple viewing but this one has stood strong through two.",1528416000,,424,5.25
8531508,3,B008WAM2G0,"Well-directed horror film is hampered by a weak script that keeps it from ever becoming genuinely good or worth an enthusiastic recommendation.  There are two distinct plots that eventually intersect late in the film.  One involves the kidnapping of a rich girl for a two million dollar ransom that the father has two hours to come up with.  The other involves the fact that beautiful girls disappear without a trace from the same area every year.  We see that a farmer has two such girls tied up in a barn and is preparing them for some sort of ritual.

Rites of Spring has way too many obvious script problems to really work.  If girls are disappearing every year from the exact same area at the exact same time of year how hard could it possibly be for the police to prevent the disappearances and apprehend the person behind it?  Think about it--the police know pretty much where and when these kidnappings are going to occur--they would have to be in on it or entirely incompetent to allow it to happen again and again, year after year.  The victim types are also pretty much identical every time so the police should be able to profile who the potential victims might be pretty easily.  Rites of Spring ignores that aspect of the plot entirely--we never see any police or indications of an investigation--just newspaper clippings about the very regular disappearances every year like clockwork.

During the kidnapping, one of the crooks shoots the wife in the head because she got a brief look at his face--although she's so panicked it's highly unlikely she would remember the kidnapper's face clearly or accurately.  The kidnapper killing the wife even under those circumstances is extremely stupid.  If the kidnappers have already committed murder before taking away the daughter who was their target there's no reason to believe they won't kill the daughter as well, meaning unless the father is a complete moron he has no reason to comply with the kidnapper's demands to not go to the police and pay the ransom.  Again, they already committed cold-blooded murder so the chances the daughter will be released alive if the father follows the kidnapper's instructions are very likely zero.  For a kidnapping to actually work the person who is supposed to pay the ransom has to actually believe he will get the kidnapped person back alive--but there's no reason for him to believe that here.

Then there's the fact that the movie never really offers much of an explanation for what the monster is or why it requires human sacrifices every spring, which didn't really work for me.

Despite the weak script Rites of Spring is otherwise well made enough that it frequently delivers the goods suspense-wise.  There are a few good shocks.  The monster (which appears to be nothing more than a really large man with a cloth sack over his head who is wielding an ax) is fast, strong and vicious.  The violence is delivered effectively.  Once the monster (whatever it's supposed to be) gets loose and starts killing off the movie's characters with his ax Rites of Spring actually becomes effective and suspenseful.  At that point, it just basically turns into a slasher film but by then it's actually a relief that Rites of Spring more or less abandons its weak attempts at plotting and character development in favor of fast paced killing and gore.  If only more of the movie were like the last 20 minutes Rites of Spring might have actually been a good film.",1499558400,,3459,4.787878787878788

Like most of these things it's like ""Maggie The Moron In The Land Of The Brain Dead"", I don't think a single normal decision was made-but then, that's horror. The basic premise of a bunch of dirtbags (who else kidnaps kids) cross paths with a supernatural killing-thing is excellent, revenge flick basically & who doesn't like that. My gripes? 1. The bad dudes (and dudettes) were dispatched way too rapidly-that's where all the fun was. A bit more terrorizing them would have made this excellent. 2. The supernatural killer was a bit lame, it 'was' supernatural but it got nothing from that (strength, speed, invulnerability etc.) I could have taken it out without breaking a sweat. 3. Would liked to have seen the main chick naked (we see others) as she's the cutest... not a movie problem, just something I would have liked (reasonable request I think).
