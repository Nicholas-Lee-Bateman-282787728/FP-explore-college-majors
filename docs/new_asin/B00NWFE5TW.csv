6682994,1,B00NWFE5TW,"I was a die-hard fan of Kathy Smith in the late 1980s. Her workouts were fun, invigorating, challenging, and effective! Because of this, I was thrilled to see her make a comeback and I eagerly purchased her Fat-Burning Walking Workout DVD.  However, I am thoroughly disappointed with this workout. While the background music is great, the workout itself is neither motivating nor challenging. Unlike her past workout videos where she has several people working out with her, she does this one solo. She makes numerous uncoordinated moves and off-beat steps, and she changes exercise routines without giving sufficient notice to the exerciser. This one is a serious thumbs down. Sorry Kathy. Maybe your next DVD (which I have already pre-ordered), will give me what I'm accustomed to getting from your workouts.",1418083200,16,810,5.183206106870229
6682995,4,B00NWFE5TW,Kathy knows what she is doing.  I don't do may walking dvds but think I want to start to so tried this.  I have done others in the past but I must say I enjoyed this on and plan on using it as my staple for days I really don't feel like doing a ton but still want a good workout.,1417996800,10,279,3.557377049180328
6682996,5,B00NWFE5TW,Loved it.  Hope Kathy releases more.,1442966400,3,36,5.0
6682997,5,B00NWFE5TW,"I must first say that I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the negative comments. . .so glad I ordered it anyway.  You need to know that I am 70 years of age and I work out for heart and bone health.  I try to exercise every day and I alternate light and heavy days.  This is the perfect ""light day"" workout when I just need to get through 30 minutes of huffing and puffing without taxing my brain.  It is easy to follow, gets your heart rate up and has enough opportunities to ""up the impact"" a bit for some light bone stress. . what more can one ask of a workout. . . If you want jazzy music, funky moves, and glitzy sets this workout is not for you.  If you, like me, just need a bit of variety to keep from doing the same old DVD's day after day then I can't see any reason you won't find this to be a fine addition to your DVD workout library.",1434153600,25,851,3.8959537572254335
6682998,4,B00NWFE5TW,I use this Walking Workout often. I enjoy the variety. I do not do jumping workouts so I am always looking for energizing walking workouts. Thanks Kathy Smith.,1432425600,5,159,4.714285714285714
6682999,2,B00NWFE5TW,"This is a newer DVD by Kathy Smith that has both a 2-mile-ish walk and a 15-minute stretch.  Note that I say it's a newer DVD, but it's not a newer workout. It's recycled!  It was part of Kathy Smith's older Rejuvenation series - both the walk and the stretch.

The routines are:
Workout 1 - Walking workout is walking program that equates to approximately a 2 mile outside walk. You can use light hand weights to increase the intensity.  About 30 minutes.  If you are looking for an alternative to Leslie, this is an option.

Workout 2 - Stretch & Flex workout using a stretching strap (or similar device) helps increase flexibility and range of motion. About 15 minutes.

Kathy is by herself and talks to the camera. For me, the walk was just OK; I thought the walk was boring and I totally watched the clock. I just did the walk and wanted to take it out and fling it across the room, so I didn't do the stretch.",1430092800,5,915,4.315789473684211
6683000,5,B00NWFE5TW,Thank You!,1426636800,2,10,4.5
6683001,2,B00NWFE5TW,"Bought this DVD from a different online shop and I'm quite disappointed.  It is boring!  I used to love Kathy's DVDs but her latest ones are nothing special.  The studio is somewhat dark, the music is nothing special and the workout is blah.  Sorry Kathy!",1422662400,2,255,4.6
6683002,4,B00NWFE5TW,"I love this DVD!  It is my favorite Kathy Smith workout!  I found it straight forward and easy-to-follow. I find Kathy's personality upbeat and likeable. I don't find her boring at all in this DVD.  This is a great ""fit-for-life"" workout.  I am in my early 50's and am not training for a marathon or trying to lose 20lbs. in two weeks to fit into my wedding dress.  This is a solid, safe workout.  There are many places in the workout where you can make the movements more intense if you want.  If I worked out more like this when I was in my 30's, maybe I would not have the joint and muscle issues that I have now.",1422489600,19,616,4.126050420168068
6683003,5,B00NWFE5TW,"This is an excellent workout, easy to follow and understand.  Maybe a little difficult for first-timers, but easy doesn't do any good, does it?",1421107200,3,143,4.958333333333333
6683004,3,B00NWFE5TW,I thought she would do a little more move's and faster. I am okay with it but would not purchase it if I new what it was liked,1420243200,,126,3.5357142857142856
6683005,1,B00NWFE5TW,"Awful, boring, way to easy, I have nothing good to say about this DVD.",1418169600,6,70,4.071428571428571
8680749,5,B00NWFE5TW,I love this dvd.  It's one of my favorites.,1501286400,,43,3.7777777777777777
8680750,3,B00NWFE5TW,"Got this for my mom, who loves using workout videos. This seems to be decent enough, but I would not recommend it for people who have a hard time moving their legs at a fast pace. This video also has limited upper body workout elements to it, which is what my mom was looking for. Not a bad video, but probably best for those who are best when working at a fast pace and are able to work on full-cardio strength.",1501027200,,412,4.098765432098766
8680751,5,B00NWFE5TW,"This is a great walking workout. I am a big Leslie Sansone fan, but I needed a change. This video incorporates slightly more complicated movements, such as the box step, V step and mambo step.  If you are close to my age (60), you've learned all those steps at some point in your life. Even if you have not, they are easy steps to learn. This workout also gives you the opportunity to pick up the pace or cool down the intensity depending on your fitness level by walking with more or less energy, and by using greater or lesser hand weights. I've tried many Kathy Smith videos since the late 1980's; as I have aged I find myself unable to keep up; I've handed them down to my daughters. This one I can do, and I'm looking forward to increasing the intensity and weight as I become more acclimated to the pace.",1492992000,,810,4.294117647058823
8680752,2,B00NWFE5TW,A little boring. Too many deletions of the same movements. Not as good as her earlier dvds.,1489363200,,91,4.411764705882353
8680753,4,B00NWFE5TW,Great work out,1487980800,,14,4.0
8680754,4,B00NWFE5TW,Thirty minutes of low-impact cardio.  Simple choreography.,1487894400,,58,7.285714285714286
8680755,5,B00NWFE5TW,Perfect for me - beginning of a new journey for me!,1485561600,,51,3.727272727272727
8680756,4,B00NWFE5TW,"Fairly easy to do, but keeps a steady pace. I felt like I had exercised when I was through.",1470614400,3,91,3.8421052631578947
8680757,2,B00NWFE5TW,"didn't care for it, too many steps that are complicated for me, I just want to walk and not think about this move or turning right and then left,",1461456000,,145,4.0344827586206895
8680758,5,B00NWFE5TW,"I'm at a point where I don't feel like exercising that much, so workouts with awful music, too many complicated steps, too repetitious or plain difficult don't work for me.  I like this workout because, it is safe, has great music, the moves are easy to follow, and there is enough variety to keep it from being boring.  I also like that you use hand weights for the entire workout.  I'm using one pound weights now but will soon increase to 3 pound weights.  I feel like I'm getting 30 minutes of cardio and toning at the same time.

I especially love the 15 minute stretch routine with the strap.  I use an old  belt in place of the strap.  I really enjoy the deep stretches to my hips, shoulders, back, and thighs.  But, this is a full body stretch.  Even when I'm done with the workout, I find myself to continuing to stretch out my upper back shoulders and arms because it feels wonderful and I feel lighter.  I normally have to do an hour long yoga class to get the same stretch  relief that I get from this 15 minute workout.

Until I get my motivation back, this workout will keep me fit because it contains my cardio, toning and stretching, 45 minutes a day.",1459036800,11,1167,4.32258064516129
