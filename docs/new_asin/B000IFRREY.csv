8145337,5,B000IFRREY,"This DVD and book is a very well organised method for a begginer to get to grips with riq playing. The DVD mostly shows the techniques, well explained, and afew examples from the book. I would say that most if the work will come from the book, not the DVD. I should point out that if you cannot read rhythm notation then you will have trouble with the book. I have spent afew hours daily working on it for over a month and I feel a huge improvment in my playing.",1405468800,5,462,4.087912087912088
