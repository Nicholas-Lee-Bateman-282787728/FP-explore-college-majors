1741687,1,B00006CXKG,"Flappy the clown is a down on his luck party performer.  Living in a run-down house, driving a beat-up car, and never having any money in his pockets, Flappy decides to re-invent himself...as Vulgar, a cross-dressing party clown for adults.  What Vulgar doesn't know is that his first party will be for a bunch of demented rednecks who gang rape, and beat him.
Humiliated, and near suicide Flappy believes his life to be over, until a strange twist of fate makes him a hero.
Thrown into the spotlight for saving a child in a hostage situation, Flappy has fame, fortune, and finally some peace in his life, until his attackers surface and threaten to expose a video tape of his rape.
`Vulgar' is truly one of the sickest, twisted, most disturbing films in recent years.  How Kevin Smith of `Clerks', and `Dogma' fame could back this film by being it's producer is beyond me! Shot low-budget, on yellowish grainy film `Vulgar' is an ugly movie, about even uglier people that burns into your mind like a hot poker.  This film is categorized as a dark comedy, but is anything but...it's not funny, it's not serious, it's just disgusting.
Many people will be talking about this sick film, but beware it's not for everyone...actually it's not for anyone.

I'm not really sure how Mr. Smith feels about that, but infamy these days, leads to more fame. Plus Shock-Cinema is most  certainly for the niche-market base. I myself, found it intriguing. Also if you thought this rape scence was hardcore watch the very awesome movie ""Irreversible"" by Gaspar Noe, he has recently had a newer piece come out called ""Enter the Void"", watch that. Sorry to stray, anyhow to sum up, this is not for everyone, actually as I stated a very market, but none-the-less, it really interesting piece of cinema.

1741730,1,B00006CXKG,"I truly feel sorry for anyone who actually bought this movie.  I'd warn of SPOILERS but really your senses of sight and hearing are enough to spoil this movie.  I rented it with my now wife then girlfriend as I am a HUGE Kevin Smith fan and I introduced her early on in our relationship to the movies he had out to date I believe it was up through Dogma at that point and we have seen every one of his movies since then in the theater.

We rented this because of the view askew label.  She left and went to bed shortly after the brutal rape scene.  I stuck it out just to make sure the ""bad guys"" got their come uppance, but the movie is nearly unwatchable.  Whether it's the completely unfunny writing, the completely nonsense story and plot that has no cohesiveness at all, or the fact that through about half of the movie the voices and actors' mouths are completely out of sync like watching an old Kung Fu movie.  I sat and suffered through bad acting and worse dialogue the only time I actually laughed was when Jay Mewes showed up as the gun salesman and is... well it's Jay except with guns instead of drugs.  At this point you have an idea of how this tragically bad story is going to end but here is where it earns the one star there is a pretty decent twist with the pay off at the end and I won't completely give it away in case you are morbidly curious about this steaming pile of dog doo, but to quote Randall ""evil is punished""  Let me clarify I didn't want to see the bad guys punished out of any sympathy for the clown.  I just wanted to see if there was ANYTHING redeeming about this movie.  There really isn't.

The time spent watching this movie would be better doing something more enjoyable like having a root canal, or getting kicked in the grapes repeatedly, or having a tooth drilled without any novocaine.... you get the idea.",1257379200,,1852,4.275071633237823

1741734,4,B00006CXKG,"by Dane Youssef

Bryan Johnson shows amazing talent and depth as a first-time greenhorn filmmaker. There's more than just one worthwhile film here. There's two.

""Vulgar"" plays out like a scrappy, slapped-together little campy comedy and then shifts wildly into much darker territory. And then back again. And back...

Johnson seems to have a natural wild indie touch and while it has touches of some of the darkest nature ever uncovered on the screen, it also has some nice Jersey-blue collar comedy.

Now here's a movie Tarantino would enjoy. It's kinda like a soup. It plays out like a stew of movies, styles and ideas. European avant-garde cinema, indie film and campy, low-budget comedy. It's a shame this movie didn't play in Europe and France. Or college kids. This is the kind of thing they all gobble up.

I'm glad I bought a copy. It gives me hope as an aspiring filmmaker... and joy and thrills as a movie-lover who loves off-kilter stuff.

Brian O' Halloran is touchingly determined and vulnerable as the clown. He scrapes out a meager existence as a ""party whore"" and lives in his hovel of a home, living on s*** wages, barely making ends meet. His landlord is understanding and sympathetic and lets him ""mow the lawn or do some maintenance"" and knocks off a few.

Ethan Suplee and Matt Mawer are effective and creepy as his inbred and mentally-retarded sons who seem to have been phoned right out of ""Deliverence.""

Jerry Lewkowitz is just plain frightening and disturbing as Ed Fanelli. With his portly beer-belly, bug-eyes, raspy voice and bad wig that looks like a little boy's hair. I heard that the inspiration for this character was Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet."" He's one of the scariest villains (or any kind of characters) to pop up on any kind of cinema in history.

The rape sequence with Will is just horrifying. It outdoes the whole scene in ""Blue Velvet"" and literally makes you BELIEVE and FEEL what this poor guy who just wants to entertain little kids is feeling.

The morning after where he has his emotional breakdown is just as strong. Will confides in Syd about the whole evening and Syd begs him to go to the cops, but Will swears him to secrecy. These scenes all shows strength, talent and feeling with both O' Halloran's acting and Johnson's directing.

Johnson himself, like Tarantino and producer Kevin Smith, once jockeyed in a video store. He gives the movie the flavor of a lot of low-budget films and masters past. He gives some ""Kevin Smith"" flavor in the dialouge and the juice of other great filmmakers', but he also gives it his own signature style. You'd have to see it to know what I mean.

Johnson has never been within 200 miles of a film school, so he seems to have gotten all of whatever film education and knowledge from Smith and Mosier.

You can tell Johnson is emulating Smith as a filmmaker, like the film's dialouge has an overwritten, over-articulate Kevin Smith-ness to it. Not to mention Smith's one-shot camera set-up. Still, there are moments that generate pain beyond words and conversation that Smith has never shown us.

And anyway, this is NOT a Kevin Smith film. I love the man, but this is another cup of tea altogether. Many will see because of the ""Kevin Smith"" name on the marquee. Which means they;ll be in for some serious shock and disappointment.

Johnson's only real mistake, in my opinion (and this is one that hurts the movie more than anything else) is his decision to act in it as the clown's only friend. You see why Smith only gave him bit-parts as Steve-Dave. He's no actor. He tends to mumble a lot of the time.

Look, read the other ""user reviews"" on IMDb about Johnson's ""Vulgar."" Listen to them describe it. YOU know if it's the movie for you. It all depends on your taste. Go to the site's OFFICIAL WEB PAGE and read the interview with Johnson. After hearing him, does it sound like your type of movie?

All in all, this is a hell of a debut. I liked Johnson's different stories and juggling them all at once. Comedy, drama, horror, working-class stories...

And at the center of it all, View Askew's poster boy--Flappy the Clown.

Have you ever wondered the real story about that clown? Here it is...

Now dear readers, I am not recommending this movie as ""fun for the whole family."" I do not recommend this as a movie to see with your drinking acquaintances. No, this a movie for a specific audience with a very acquired palate--darker, daring, low-budget, creepy, campy, gross and funny all at once.

Don't see this because Kevin Smith produced it. See it because this is your taste. Read the reviews. Does this sound like your brand of poison?

You know who you are.

1741735,3,B00006CXKG,"I'm not too sure what Kevin Smith and co. were thinking with this one. It was a bit weird and overly offensive, even for Kevin Smith. I first rented the movie because of the cast list on the back cover: Brian O'Halloran of `Clerks' starred (where he's known for his role as Dante), along with Smith himself, Jason Mewes, and a few other Smith-movie regulars (the infamous Walt ""the fanboy"" has a very significant role). But overall I was more than disappointed. And to be honest, a bit sickened. I love Kevin's movies; all of them, just not this one (even the underground `A Better Place' was more pleasurable than this) . I'd recommend 'Vulgar' only to anyone who is a HUMONGOUS fan of Kevin Smith and the supporting actors who appear in small roles in his other films. God, I can't even begin to imagine what the unrated version would be like. And I don't want to. This is not a comedy. This is not like `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', `Dogma', or `Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back'. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the decent cast and the ""faster than Walt Flanagan's dog"" reference. Before you think about watching this movie, ask yourself if you'd enjoy watching a poor, pitiful clown get brutally raped by two kids and their father. Otherwise, skip it.",1195603200,,1270,4.550218340611353
1741736,4,B00006CXKG,"Although this movie is produced by View Askew and stars many members of previous View Askew projects don't think this movie is in anyway a comedy or even a black comedy. If you start watching his movie in that frame of mind you surely will hate it.
Vulgar is an excelent thriller and psycological drama. Though obviously filmed on a tight buget, the story is very interrestingly put together and Brian O'Halloran's performance as the violated clown can really move you to tears. His portrail really goes through all possible emotions and shows much more depth than any other movie role has alowed him so far (don't get be wrong, I think he is great as Dante in Clerks, but this gives him much more range to display his acting talent.)",1185148800,,734,4.6106870229007635
1741737,5,B00006CXKG,"This movie is very hard to watch and isn't a very funny one either. It is about a clown that is going broke trying to support himself and his mother. He comes up with a new idea for making money and still doing what he loves and he is raped by his first client. Vulgar doesn't report it as many men that are raped don't out of embarrassment. He then tries to pick up his life as best he could and finally makes it as a television host ""Flappy"" on a children's show. He makes it very big and one day, his assailants come back to blackmail him into being Vulgar so they can again rape him. To me, this is a very powerful movie about the strength of one man after being raped overcoming his abuse and seeking ""justice"". This is not a comedy nor is it a ""feel good"" movie. It is though a movie about strength and courage of one back getting back up and facing his fears.",1176681600,3,866,4.0701754385964914

1741750,4,B00006CXKG,"..unless you're raping a clown, and even then it's still not funny.

It stars Brian O'Halloran (Dante in Clerks/II) as Flappy/Vulgar/Will - a man who has trouble paying his bills and is mocked and laughed at by almost everyone. He works as a clown, performing at parties for kids. He rents himself out as a transvestite clown who, as a joke, jumps out of cakes at bachelor parties. On the day of his debut performance, he's drugged and gang-raped by three men. The rape scene wasn't as horrific as I thought it would be.

O'Halloran is a brilliant actor when it comes to him playing these whiny,weak characters.  Mostly everything he's been in, you just want to hug him and tell him it's gonna be ok.

This movie is called a ""dark comedy"", but there was nothing funny about it. It was a very good movie, anyway.",1167264000,,811,4.496598639455782
1741751,1,B00006CXKG,"I bought this a long time ago and thought it was absolute S***!

I love Brian O'Halloran's work in the Kevin Smith movies he has been in but even he couldn't save this movie.

This movie is not even funny accidentaly!

Only Artificial Intelligence and Napolean Dynamite were worse movies!

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",1167177600,2,312,4.722222222222222
1741752,3,B00006CXKG,"This movie has gotten horrible reviews. Just the main premise of the story is sick and revolting. Looking at the back of the DVD it is clear they were hard up for positive reviews since the two featured read ""...a truly and thankfully a one of a kind work."" and ""An ugly, revolting movie."" This should give anyone with high expectations for this movie an obvious clue as too what they are going to watch. The reviews on websites such as ""rotten tomatoes"" are abysmal to be kind, not only are they bad but some compare the script and camera work to a bad pornographic movie. That being said, I liked it.

A little bit of background on the movie and why I wanted to see it is that it was executive produced by Kevin Smith of Clerks fame. I am fan of his and the fact that his name was attached was enough to get me interested. Also I was intrigued by poster art, it boasted that it was ""the hit of the 2000 Toronto Film Festival"" and sported the tag line ""Everybody loves a clown...some more than others"" and portrays a man in clown makeup pointing a gun downward. I have had an interest in clowns as being sort of scary things that travel with carnivals and freak shows, which is what I actually hoped this movie was about. However, the love for clowns the movies tag line referred too was actually in relation to the pivotal scene in the movie when the clown known as Vulgar thinks he is going to a bachelor party. When he arrives he is gang raped and video taped by a father and his two dim witted sons (think of the famous scene in Deliverance). This is the main event, so to speak, of the whole movie. He is left bloody and humiliated by these guys and tries to go on with his life and never to mention it. A day or so later, after he had pulled himself back together, he went back to doing children's parties, when he arrives at his first party there are cops surrounding the house and long story short he ends up saving a little girl from her father who was holding her and her mother hostage making him famous now and he is approached by a Hollywood producer to star in his own children's show. Once he is on T.V. the demented father sees him on T.V. and contacts him and uses the video he had filmed of him as blackmail. They had made him say degrading remarks about himself and that apparently is what they were going to use. So that in a nut shell is what the movie is about, and I completely understand why it is probably looked on by most as just trash. For a Saturday night viewing the movie was enjoyable for me, I cant see myself ever wanting to watch it again and the rape scene was cringe inducing but I had a few laughs also.

The main character is played by the actor who also played the main character of Dante in Clerks and included cameos from both Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes (Jay and Silent Bob) and for fans of Kevin Smith movies would be worth watching this movie just once, as I did. The writer and director of this movie is Bryan Johnson. This is the only movie he has written or directed which may be a good reflection on how this movie was received since he has yet to make another film. Until this film he was a production assistant on Mallrats and Chasing Amy and seems he was given this opportunity by Smith to make his film. The DVD contains an interesting bonus documentary titled Judge Not: In Defense of Dogma with Smith and the actors from that movie, including Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, that was exclusive to this DVD that looked at the controversy that had surrounded Dogma and was apparently something that was intended to be on that DVD but was not finished and included on this which was also a nice addition. Overall, this movie is for a specific group of people and should not be taken seriously. The budget is low and the story is odd to say the least but if you watch it with a sense of humor, and  not on a full stomach, it could be enjoyable to the right audience.",1161993600,2,3914,4.251006711409396
1741753,4,B00006CXKG,"I rented this the other night after avoiding it for years because of all the bad reviews and comments about it being disgusting. After finally seeing it, I'm left wondering what the hubub was about.

I guess the rape was somewhat disturbing, but it's certainly not the first of it's kind in film. The rape scene in Deliverence is much more graphic and disturbing than the one in this one.

If somebody was expecting something along the lines of Mallrats, I suppose this movie would come as quite a shock, but still, I think the reaction some had is a little over the top. This is a dark comedy/drama, I guess my sense of humor is just off kilter enough to find the things the clowns mother was saying to him to be hilarious, and the vicious waitress was another nice touch.

Sure, Bryan Johnson is no Spielberg, but for a first time director with no real experience, I think he crafted a pretty entertaining little cult flick. If you're looking for a light hearted rom com, then leave Vulgar on the shelf, but if you like dark comedy, and quirky independent films with an interesting twist, give it a shot, you could do worse than this movie.",1161734400,3,1142,4.480769230769231
1741754,4,B00006CXKG,"""Vulgar"" came to me word-of-mouth. I'd seen this movie sitting on a video store shelf when it first came out and I had no urge to see it. It wasn't until a couple months ago when a guy I know told me that I ""have to see it."" Reviews on Amazon didn't look good, the cover looks like it was straight-to-video (it, technically, wasn't. It was shown in a few theatres)...But I was intrigued. The film has Kevin Smith has the Executive Producer and stars Brian O'Halloran, better known as Dante in the ""Clerks"" films, as the main character Will Carlson. Will lives in a crappy apartment (and frequently finds people sleeping in the backseat of his car) and works as a birthday party clown called Flappy. One day Will has an epiphany. He'll still do kids birthday parties, but he'll also hit up some bachelor parties as well. The plan goes like this; He'll come to the party dressed like a clown and wearing lingerie. Everyone'll be in on the joke, except the groom. He'll freak the groom out, collect his money, and then the babes will show up. On his first night, Will (who has chosen the moniker Vulgar when doing this particular job) runs into a demented trio of father and sons who brutally rape Will. Will, embarrassed and ashamed, goes home and tries to forget about everything despite complaints from his friend Syd (Bryan Johnson, the writer/director). Then, the unthinkable happens. Will saves a child from a hostage situation and finds himself plastered on TV, being proclaimed a hero. A TV show deal follows and pretty soon, he's being blackmailed by his rapists for $50,000 dollars. If you've seen the cover of the film, you can probably guess what comes next. Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) both make cameo appearances in the film, although not under their famed monikers. The movie has a straight-to-video feel to it and most viewers won't watch it twice. The acting has it's moments of being pretty good, but is usually laughable due to bad dialogue. O'Halloran does manage to get you to feel sorry for the character, although he looks embarrassed. Ethan Suplee (who appears in Mallrats and is now on the hit show ""My Name is Earl"") plays one/third of the demented trio, as well. The movie is frequently billed as a ""Comedy."" The film has it's subtle moments, but ""comedy"" is stretching it. One bit of subtle humor involves a phone call Flappy makes to a parent to cancel an appearance. He's talking to a woman named Mrs. Affleck who puts her son ""Benny"" on the phone. This is not a great movie, but it is original. Not just the clown thing, but you rarely see male rape (unless the person getting raped is a gay hustler anyway, like in ""Mysterious Skin"") portrayed in film. Johnson could've made this a campy comedy, while making a deeply disturbing portrait of that subject. I think he wanted to, but he just wasn't sure how to film it. Vulgar succeeds in less ways than it doesn't, but if you're into films that fall into the category of this films name or like something a little different you might enjoy this.

1741755,4,B00006CXKG,"My boyfriend and I went to rent this DVD yesterday, after searching in every isle at hollywood video we finally found it in comedy, which I am pretty sure is a mistake lol.

Despite the touchiness of the subject I thought this movie was very good. Some of the acting left a lot to be desired (specifically the mother, it didn't help that our copy had the audio a few seconds before the visual.) But the script and direction were both amazing. In my opinion it kind of gave Will/Flappy too much of a hopeless life in the begining. It was almost like Kafka's Metamorphasis or something. But the way everything played out was pretty neat. I especially loved the ending... it was very unexpected and brupt. Despite some of these flaws I do think that if you aren't easily offended you should at least see this movie. It's very different.. a nice break from the ordinary. Just don't expect to be seeing a comedy.",1158537600,2,907,4.496969696969697
1741756,5,B00006CXKG,"I would like to tip my hat to the creators of this film, and for the very surprising performance of Brian O'Halloran.

While I had become accustomed to his performance in films such as ""Clerks,"" I did not expect him in a role where his character is dragged through one of the worst nightmares that anyone could ever go through...rape.

Some viewers may have a hard time watching the film because it deals with such a touchy subject, and because (like in the case of spouse abuse) we tend to see it as a 'female-victims' crime.  [Which is a bunch of bull because males can be the victims of such crimes just as readily as females].

One of the best scenes is the segment when Will talks to Syd about the incident.  Syd wants him to report the rape, while Will says ""no"" because he is afraid of how a lawyer could flip the situation back onto him...saying that it was his fault.  Unfortunately, this is a real situation that many rape victims have to go through, and his reactions really made me feel for the character on so many different levels.

Also, Will's rescue of Ashley, the little girl being held hostage by her father, spoke loads about his self worth at the time.  Most people would have seen it as heroism, but some would have also seen it as a bit of a suicide attempt, in order to save a life deemed more worthy.

While some may take issue with how the film ends, I don't think I could have seen the film end in the 'other direction.'  Will/Flappy is a guy with a soft heart, who has taken quite a bit of lumps from almost everyone in his life.",1154736000,3,1557,4.301369863013699

It is a disturbing movie but if you are looking for the shock factor it wasn't all there.  The acting was decent some of the smaller parts were played pretty poorly but overall the acting was decent.  This movie is also very low budgeted which shows in some of the camera work but I think it makes the movie a little more unique.  Overall I am on the fence about this movie but I recommend you rent it if you can to checjk it out first becaus it isn't for everyone,1153785600,3,584,4.1415929203539825
1741768,5,B00006CXKG,"This movie is an incredible gem.  It definitely is not the Kevin Smith type lowbrow trash that you think when you see his name on it.  This movie is written and directed by Bryan Johnson who is great at putting many levels of detail into every scene.

It is primarily an incredible comedy.  The comedy is focused mainly on conversational sarcasm between characters and Flappy's undeserved always-a-loser lot in life.

In the middle the comedy gets real dark as Flappy the clown/now Vulgar gets raped by a psychotic father and his two equally psychotic sons.

The character of the father is brilliantly darkly humorous as he just brutally spouts his unrelentingly vicious rape rantings.  This guys voice and actions are just so exceptionally well suited and acted.

Brian O Halloran(?) who plays Flappy/Vulgar also delivers outstanding emotional performances throughout the entire movie.  This performance easily beats anything Hollywood would give an award for.  After the rape, the comedy entirely disappears for a while as Flappy emotionally deals with the rape.  This is so well acted, it goes beyond even what films like Schindler's List does in presenting emotions of this type.  This combination of comedy and such intense emotional drama is too much for most mainstream viewers and why this movie is so hated.

A favorite aspect I had was when we catch up with the father who raped Flappy back at home and his wife and daughter so viciously berate him.

That people say this is a revenge film shows that people are so put off that they don't even pay attention to the end.

I won't give away the details of how I mean this but Flappy does not get revenge in this movie.  My first reaction was that this was disappointing and an anti-climatic ending to the movie.  But after other viewings Flappy being cheated of his revenge is a very interesting aspect of the entire story.

I think Vulgar is probably the end of Bryan Johnson ever doing anything as the main drive of a movie project.  This movie is so hated and unappreciated.  I can only be thankful this movie exists and can't be taken back.

Bryan Johnson is simply above the standards of mainstream audiences which are not interested in anything deeper than obvious punchlines and standard structured presentation of material.

As the other reviews show, either people hated this and called it trash.  Or people understood how well crafted the film is but still were put off by the intensity of the dramatic aspects.  (At least honest and with the integrity to realize and admit it)

Bryan Johnson definitely is talented far beyond his View Askew/Kevin Smith associations.  I wish I could look forward to more brilliant work from him though I doubt many opportunities will be available due to this film's reaction.  Cream may rise to the top of milk, yet as the world is a toilet, sh*t is what obviously rises to the top of the bowl.

If you can accept a film that can brilliantly combine two quite opposite aspects (comedy and intense rape drama), this is for you.  If you simplistically view this as making rape into comedy, then stay away.

Low budget crap that failed at being anything on its own, so instead it was marketed for its Kevin Smith link.  In summary;

A protagonist you can't care about, does some stupid stuff, on some crappy sets, while talking to people nobody would care about, using that annoying, pretentiously over-constructed Kevin-Smith-eese vernacular; then does some more stupid stuff with more bad actors playing uninteresting characters, until he arrives at a predictable unrewarding ending, that leaves the viewer wondering about only one thing,....

""Vulgar"" is the definition in films of acquired taste, you're either into it or you're not. Granted ""Vulgar"" in general is not great cinema, it's not even great independent filmmaking, but from the first scene it is clear what the movie's intentions are and in that sense it succeeds. What director Bryan Johnson gives us is a dark comedy mixed with the trappings of the typical psycho movie. From the start Johnson chooses a subject that is already creepy to some people, clowns, and then throws in homosexual rape, paranoia and a gunfight finale to make this into PURE B-movie material. Had Kevin Smith not produced this movie it could indeed have been worse than what people already think it to be. As a dark comedy it works, we laugh and feel guilty sometimes about it (at least some of us), the story has a creepy of way of getting under your skin with the gritty, low-grade photography and isolated settings, there's even a strangeness to the dialogue and though some complain about the sound mix, it adds to the movie's weird allure. Like the much superior ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Vulgar"" looks cheap but that is precisely how it manipulates the mood of the viewer. Even the music sounds like that dark monotone score you hear in the occasional PSA on television. Yes, it is true that the actors aren't exactly A-list stuff, but this is a small budget production and you can't expect anymore from it than what it is capable of delivering. ""Vulgar"" is creepy, strange and certainly memorable, it is not great but for those looking for something RADICALLY different, here's a movie that fits that category.",1106438400,4,1719,4.8108108108108105

1741781,5,B00006CXKG,"Firstly, there's something I must make clear.  Vulgar is NOT a Kevin Smith movie, despite it being a View Askew movie.  Kevin Smith co-executive produced it and played a bit role, but he did NOT write or direct it - Bryan Johnson did.
That said, I was quite impressed.  I rented it not really knowing what to expect; I mean, the only View Askew works I'd seen thus far were Kevin Smith's, but I could tell this would not be the same comedy fare just by looking at the cover.  I think it's important that you do not expect to laugh while watching this movie; there are a handful of funny scenes, but that's not really what Vulgar is about.
Brian O'Halloran gives an amazing performance in this movie; I don't think many actors would be brave enough to take on the role of Flappy/Vulgar.  For the most part, all the actors are very believable, which is necessary in a film portraying a reality this stark.  The cinematography was superb, and the script was well-thought out and solid.  Some of the sets were a little drab and lackluster, but I won't hold that against it... hey, it's an indie film.
All that said, Vulgar is a twistedly brilliant film, but it's not for the faint of heart.  The final 10 minutes of the film really had my blood pumping - kept me guessing.  I recommend you rent it first and test the waters before you buy it.",1079222400,10,1338,4.384615384615385

There are some snippets of ""Smith-quality"" dialogue in here and it's fairly well written, but lacks quite a bit of the fun-loving sense of humor that is in Smith's movies.
Actually, it would be pretty impossible to have a movie about clown-rape and make it ""funny"".  I guess that's where it goes though.

1741784,2,B00006CXKG,"Given that the video box includes negative comments of critics (""An ugly, revolting movie,"" the San Francisco Chronicle), ""Vulgar"" practically dares you to watch it. If you accept the challenge, you'll be enduring an unpleasant 86 minutes in a world filled with sad and/or vile people leading miserable lives. The main character (played by Brian O'Halloran, from ""Clerks"") is about the most likeable of the bunch, and he's a pathetic loser. Watching him stumble from one indignity to the next (culminating in a gang rape by a father and his half-wit sons, the movie's most sickening - yet most effective - scenes), he seems a likely candidate for suicide. Instead, though, he finds success when, in a rare moment of courage, he rescues a little girl from her gun-weilding father. But with success comes blackmail and, ultimately, revenge.
This cheaply made movie (which ""Dogma"" writer-director Kevin Smith helped produce and has a small role in as well) is not without its merits. The script is better than you might expect and writer-director Bryan Johnson shows a knack for conveying the obscenities of human behavior, showing just enough to make our flesh crawl (though he may have shown more in the unrated version). But the acting is second rate (it should be noted, however, that O'Halloran delivers a fearless performance) and you never buy the main character's success as a syndicated children's TV star. There have been public access shows with higher production values. And even when it seems justice is served, it's hardly triumphant.

The original plot of this movie is great, but there are plenty of problems. Most of the dialogue is fluff, and the shots are either too dark or overly clean. The camera moves too much in many scenes.

The acting is ridiculous... although Brian O'Halleran does a respectable enough job. Bryan Johnson himself added a little zing, I guess. But Kevin Smith's role is both cheap and embarrassing and makes a mockery of every scene he bellyflops into. The rest of the cast (including Jason Mewes and the over-the-top mother) are rock-bottom as well. As for the script... let's just say it REALLY goes downhill after Flappy ""saves the day"". A juvenile and unbelievable turn for the worst, I'd say. Completely ludicrous, since the movie had a pretty decent and gritty start. To be blunt, that scene basically sunk the whole movie. Boy, did it ever tumble after that.",1046390400,,940,4.773006134969325
1741827,2,B00006CXKG,"I'm not too sure what Kevin Smith and co. were thinking with this one.  It was a bit weird and overly offensive, even for Kevin Smith.  I first rented the movie because of the cast list on the back cover: Brian O'Halloran of `Clerks' starred (where he's known for his role as Dante), along with Smith himself, Jason Mewes, and a few other Smith-movie regulars (the infamous Walt ""the fanboy"" has a very significant role).  But overall I was more than disappointed. And to be honest, a bit sickened.  I love Kevin's movies; all of them, just not this one (even the underground `A Better Place' was more pleasurable than this) . I'd recommend 'Vulgar' only to anyone who is a HUMONGOUS fan of Kevin Smith and the supporting actors who appear in small roles in his other films. God, I can't even begin to imagine what the DVD unrated version would be like.  And I don't want to.  This is not a comedy.  This is not like `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', `Dogma', or `Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back'.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the decent cast and the ""faster than Walt Flanagan's dog"" reference.  Before you think about watching this movie, ask yourself if you'd enjoy watching a poor, pitiful clown get brutally raped by two kids and their father. Otherwise, skip it.",1042588800,,1283,4.543478260869565

1741829,1,B00006CXKG,"In his directorial debut, Bryan Johnson's very violent cult-wannabe film ""Vulgar"" portrays the life of the hapless Will Carlson (Brian O'Halloran) struggling to earn a living by working as a clown named ""Flappy"" for children's parties.  Living in a dump and driving a worthless car, Will wants to earn more money, but only as a clown.  He foolishly decides to work as a scantily-clad, clown-in-drag named ""Vulgar"" at men's bachelor parties. His first job as ""Vulgar"" takes him to a motel where three men are waiting: a father named Ed Fanelli (Jerry Lewkowitz) and his two sons Frankie (Ethan Suplee) and Gino (Matthew Maher).  Ed, Frankie and Gino aren't there for a bachelor party; instead, they rape the unsuspecting clown.  After being bound, beaten and raped, the three leave ""Vulgar"" for dead in the motel.  Realizing he's alone, Will struggles back to his car and drives home where he makes a half-hearted attempt at suicide.
Telling his friend Syd (Bryan Johnson) about the ordeal, Will finds the strength to return to the safer job of being a clown at children's parties.  Upon reaching a home where he is to perform as ""Flappy"", he finds it surrounded by police.  The child's estranged father (Scott Schiaffo) is holding his daughter at gunpoint inside the house.  Somehow, with the home surrounded by armed police, Will dressed in his brightly-colored clown costume sneaks into the house and rescues the girl, becoming an instant hero.  (This is the part of the film where my opinion took its final turn for the worst.)  Will is approached by TV-producer Martan Ingram (Kevin Smith, ""Silent Bob"" of ""Dogma"" & ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" fame) to star in his own children's television show as ""Flappy"".  Will agrees and becomes an instant success, but ghosts from the past threaten his achievement.
Kevin Smith's performance as the TV producer was both wooden and unbelievable.  Jerry Lewkowitz' performance as Ed Fanelli was completely one-dimensional as were the brief performances for his wife and daughter (Melissa Rayworth and Deanna Rowe) and his two sons.  Jason Mewes (""Jay"" of ""Dogma"" & ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" fame) makes a cameo appearance as the character Tuott the Basehead,  but he should simply have been named ""Jay"" because he played exactly the same character as he did in ""Dogma"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  (Jason Mewes is either a victim of typecasting or extremely one-dimensional.)  Brian O'Halloran's performance as Will Carlson/Flappy/Vulgar was okay, as was Bryan Johnson's performance as Syd.  By her appearance and demeanor, Will's mother in the film (Debra Karr) reminded me of the Dark Mother (Eisei Amamoto) from the awful 1978 Japanese ""Star Wars"" rip-off film ""Message From Space"".
The plot, though depressing and gruesome, was, nonetheless, believable until Will as ""Flappy"" sneaks into the house surrounded by police unnoticed.  From that point forward, the plot becomes completely predictable. Several reviewers have commented on the humor used in the film.  The humor from incendental characters of trash-throwing teenagers and drunken bums was nothing more than juvenile.  With the graphic violence contained in the film and an R-rating, it is unlikely that any responsible parent would allow their teenaged children (or younger) to watch the film.  Therefore, the juvenile humor is highly unlikely to be enjoyed by adults.  (Of the four of us that watched the film together after renting it, hardly any of us laughed at all.)
I do give Bryan Johnson credit for filming what is probably one of most viscous rape scenes ever filmed, but he still has quite a bit to learn about directing.  The plot is not engaging and none of us watching the film were able to relate with any of the characters. If the intent was to combine horrific violence with humor, the film completely fails because the juvenile incedental humor was an extremely minor element as compared to the main characters' attempt to present very violent drama.
As for DVD quality, the film itself was clearly shot on a shoe-string budget and watching it was very difficult because the sound was not synchronized with the picture.  Some scenes were worse than others in which the sound followed the picture by as much as 2 seconds, giving the illusion that the film had been dubbed.  The DVD that was rented may have been defective, the transfer of the film to DVD may have been poor or the film itself may be defective.  (Since I never saw the film in a theater, I don't know if the sound was originally properly synchronized to the picture.)  The combination of extremely poor DVD quality, unbelievable plot, and one-dimensional acting earns this film 1 star in my book.  With no real redeeming value, I cannot recommend this film to anyone.",1040601600,10,4776,4.9811083123425695
1741830,1,B00006CXKG,"I haven't compiled a real list yet, but this film would definately be up around the top 5 or so worst films I have ever tried to sit through in my entire life.  If you can actually get past the horrible acting and the fact that none of the sound actually matches the chartacters who are speaking, and the fact that the story is really unoriginal and unimaginative, you might make it almost to the end of the movie...I didn't.",1039651200,2,425,4.3125
1741831,4,B00006CXKG,"I couldn't tell you what I thought when I was done watching this movie, I was shocked, hurt, and felt like I had been wrung dry, left as a shapeless ball of inanimate matter.  Yet I couldn't help but feel impressed.  The movie achieves a form of anger and conviction so searing, it would have been like putting your hand into a trash recycler and pulling back a nub.  Movies like this aren't made for wide release, they are meant for those who understand that art isn't always ""pretty"" or easily acceptable.  It's message is inclear, it's morals absent, I cannot look back on a film I have seen recently that has made me feel so cold.
At the center of the movie is a struggling, outcast clown from the styx who achieves celebrity status when a saves a girl from a hostage crises.  He does this for reasons he can't quite grip. Maybe the thought of another person suffering as he had put him a certain position to intervene almost without care for himself.  Overnight he becomes famous.  He gets everything he's wanted.  Until a call from his past brings back events that haunt him still.  Brian O'Halloran (of Clerks fame) occupies the center of the film as Flappy, the clown of which the aforementioned paragraph is in reference to.  O'Halloran's performance is a careful balance of shame, anger, and desperation.  His performance is the center point of the film, and it is nothing short of astonishing.  Watching I realized just how well he had me care and feel for this miserable sap who only tries to be a decent man.
This is not always an easy film to watch, there are moments when we realize that this low-budget, depraved piece of material is presenting us with things not easy to handle.  Yet we feel nothing but pure surprise, that a film this ghastly and cynical could achieve such a zenith.  Vulgar is a one-of-a-kind work, revolting, hurtful, and unforgettable.",1038960000,6,1873,4.619335347432024
1741832,5,B00006CXKG,"""Wooohooo!  I can't believe it's over already!  Put that sucker in AGAIN!""  That's what you'll be saying after watching ""Vulgar"".  What kind of movie is this?  Well, it's 50% romantic comedy, 50% drama, 50% coming-of-age, and 100% FUN!  If you liked Sweet Home Alabama, then this is the movie for YOU!
Flappy the Clown is a crazy, adventurous character who just can't seem to shake off his daily dose of mayhem!  After running into some eccentric customers, chaos ensues in a very Who's The Boss-like fashoin.  BRING ON THE FUNNY!  After surviving one CRAZY night, Flappy, by means of silly luck, saves a girl's birthday from being ruined by her over-protective father, and thus makes the girl's party the BEST BIRTHDAY EVER!  Flappy does such a good job in fact, that he gets to have is very own television show.  Just as things are looking up and up, who should come back into Flappy's life, but the same eccentric customers from the begining, and BOY do they have a new adventure in store for Flappy!  After another night of, chaos, mayhem, and zany off-beat fun, Flappy once again saves the day.
This movie is better than Snow Dogs and That Darn Cat combined!  It looks even better than the upcoming Kangaroo Jack!  If you're in the mood for a nice, lite family comedy, then this is the film to get.  If you're in the mood for a nice chick-flick date movie, then this is also your best bet.  Well good luck with this and remember: take care of yourself, because you're the only you you've got, and I'm not clownin' around!",1038614400,12,1526,4.575645756457565
1741833,3,B00006CXKG,"Okay, the clown-abuse scene:  Definitely the harshest portrayal of rape I've ever come across (even trumping Blue Velvet).  These villains are far more disturbing than Frank Booth or the rednecks in Deliverance.
That aside, not a great movie, but not as horrible as some would have you believe.  The acting is a bit wooden, but the story is fairly interesting and will hold your attention (as opposed to falling asleep on the couch, as I am prone to do!).  One major flaw was the mis-casting of ""silent bob"" as Flappy's agent/publicist.  He doesn't look right in the role, and his acting is pretty bad here.
Vulgar has elements that will remind you of Gummo and/or Julien Donkey-Boy.  If you like disturbing films by young up-and-coming, envelope-pushing filmmakers, this will probably be right up your alley.  However, you will probably be hard-pressed to think of anyone you can recommend or lend this to!
One thing that can be said, even by those who hate it, is that it is not boring (the worst crime any film can commit).",1038355200,2,1026,4.762711864406779
1741834,1,B00006CXKG,"""Vulgar"" is a would-be cult classic that has no idea what it is (or wants to be).  The mood shifts from comedy to drama on a scene-by-scene basis, with no consistent medium being reached; the result is an extremely unbalanced film.  The film starts with a down-on-his luck clown named Flappy, who's a pathetic pin cushion to everyone he meets.  The early scenes have some humor that's loud and obnoxious, but effective in a low-intellect way, but then the movie delves into a dark viciousness that comes out of nowhere.  Anyway, Flappy decides to become a transvestite clown to entertain at bachelor parties and his first clients turn out to be a sicko father-and-son trio who proceed to beat and rape Flappy (in an echo of ""I Spit on Your Grave"").  Why do they do this?  Well, because they're creatures of the plot--they exist to be as pointlessly mean and insipid as the script requires, without any real motive or personality.  Shortly after this incident, Flappy achieves fame after foiling a hostage situation (a lot like ""Death to Smoochy""), but the rapists come up with a ridiculous extortion threat...  And, well, ""Vulgar"" remains inconsistent to the very end--the viciousness and humor aren't mixed into an effective cocktail of 'black comedy'...writer-director Bryan Johnson just cuts from one mood to the next without any balance.  Some of the acting is notable in an amateurish way (I really thought Flappy's friend was a hoot), and the New Jersey locations seem authentic, but the movie is a cavalcade of shock-value without any real purpose (a lot like ""The Doom Generation"").  My advice: if you want a straight-faced revenge flick, rent ""The Last House on the Left"" (Wes Craven's debut); if you want dark comedy that's at least somewhat competent, check out ""Death to Smoochy.""  ""Vulgar"" just isn't worth it.",1038009600,4,1823,4.944262295081967
1741835,2,B00006CXKG,"If you don't know the basic premise of Vulgar, and you want to be suprised when and if you watch the movie, then stop reading now.

I know this sounds bizarre, but that's exactly what this movie is - bizarre. It's not funny, like other View Askew films (although kevin smith and jason Mewes play minor parts in the fim). It's not a terribly interesting story. Just plain weird.
I'm usually not one scared off by the strange or different, but this movie had nothing to offer. No humor, no depth, no interesting dialogue.

1741849,4,B00006CXKG,"God, VULGAR is a tough experience. It's a very good movie, but it's very hard to watch. Will Carlson (Brian O'Halloran) already has a worthless life BEFORE he gets raped by a sick, sadistic psycho and his two idiot sons (these scenes are graphic and intense, but perhaps not as graphic as the hype has led you to belive). Soon after, he saves the life of a little girl and makes it big, even landing a gig as the host of his own TV show. Of course, the rapists call him up and blackmail him, having videotaped their brutal violation. Tough, tough, depressing - but humorously so. It's so dark, you might find yourself laughing.
Also included on the VULGAR DVD is a commentary on DOGMA. But rather than it being a look at Dogma - which would be hard to explain, this being a different movie - it is more a look at the complaints that DOGMA brought on from the Catholic activists. While it is sort of interesting, why does Kevin Smith really feel the need to respond so strongly to his detractors? Don't give them the time of day, and certainly not a special commentary devoted entirely to the people who protest purely for the press. DOGMA was a great flick, and it stands up for itself; there is no need to ride to its defense.",1031616000,2,1227,4.362445414847161

The story is Powerfull and has a message, which should be found out and interpreted on your own. Brian O'Halloran, Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, Walt Flannagan and the writer/director himself Bryan Johnson all bring the story to Life Nicely. Jerry Lewkowitz and Ethen Suplee also have Key roles and do a nice Job.

While in the beginning scenes it is funny, this is a very, very strange film although it is fairly generic at it's heart. This is not a comedy. We've seen this plot many times before only this time the twist is it's a guy that is the victim. I'm not going to go into the plot, if you are curious you are going to see it anyway. Be aware that a heinous and brutal crime is at the centerpiece and is extremely unpleasant to watch.
I have loved everything Kevin Smith has made, and while this is not his movie, it has the same feel to it. At times it feels like the ""lost"" film between Clerks and Mallrats.
The Kevin Smith cameos, as well as Jason Mewes, Scott Mosier, and some other faces you'll recognize keep the movie interesting. However it has a drawn out scene that is so unpleasant it's virtually guranteed to turn off the casual observer immediately. (the implied torture/murder of a child was particularly vile) This ain't a date flick folks. At times you'll be thankful for what you DIDN'T see while still being repulsed by what you are seeing.

I bought it last night and I have watched it twice already. It's packed with great special features you wouldn't think and indi film like this would have. It has commentary by Brian O'Halleran, Kevin Smith, Scott Moiser, and Bryan Johnson, there are tons of deleated scenes, and a small outtake real, a cool photo gallery, and all of the rejection letters from all of the film festivals. Also on the dvd is the lost ""Dogma"" Documentary ""In Defense of Dogma"" that is very cool it really gives you insight on what the Viewaskew guys went threw to get that movie made and Kevin Smith talks alot about his personal life it's really worth catching. As I said before this movie is not for everyone, but check it out even if you don't dig the movie you can't deny the great performances, the great direction, and all of the cool features the dvd has to offer. For those of you who don't know what the movie is about, it goes like this. Brian O'Halleran(Clerks) plays William who works as a childrens party clown named ""Flappy"". His life is going knowhere, he's not making any money at his job his mother hates him and wishes he would do something with his life, and his friend Syd(Bryan Johnson)almost never has anything intellegent to say.  William comes up with an idea to start doing party's as a tranvestite clown as a gag for men's bacholler party but William is in for a surprise when he gets to his first job to find three men who abduct him, beat him and rape him. They leave him for dead, then William gets up and keeps what happened to him to himself. Moving on with his life William begins doing kids partys again when a heroic act of saving a childs life from the hands of her abusive father puts William right in the spotlight and opens allof the doors that have been closed to him for so long. As the years go on everythin gis going great when William gets a phone call and a voice from his past is on the other end. William not wanting anything to ruin his success must now fight to keep his past a secret wich all leads up to a great ending that you'll have to buy the movie to see.
