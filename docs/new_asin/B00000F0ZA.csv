7906357,5,B00000F0ZA,I enjoyed watching Abbott and Costello when I was a kid in the 1950s. It's good to know that these movie treasures still exists so I can watch and remember the old days. The delivery and product are both excellent and its well worth the money.,1333843200,2,243,4.304347826086956

7906359,5,B00000F0ZA,"The Abbott & Costello Show is a timeless classic. This DVD holds some of the best shows of that series. ""Lou's Birthday"" is probably the best episode ever produced. Between the scenes with Mr. Fields and Bacciagalupe, its 30 minutes of non-stop laughs.",1152748800,2,252,4.883720930232558
7906360,5,B00000F0ZA,"I have purchased 4 Abbott and Costello show DVD's and I am very satisfied with the quality. Thank goodness they preserved the original 35mm film masters and were able to use them for this series. When you watch these shows, you feel like you are right there in the rooming house with all the characters and you have Mr Fields as your landlord. The studio which releases them has done a good job of putting the entire series on DVD in a timely fashion and 4 shows on a disc is good value .I sent an Email to Koch Entertainment and asked if they would put all 13 volumes in a special box set so people can save money instead of buying them individually. They sent me an email saying they are in the ealy planning stages of putting out box sets of the series , but that none will be out this year. I didn't want to wait so I went ahead and ordered the rest of the series.",1092268800,5,868,4.1117647058823525
7906361,5,B00000F0ZA,"This dvd contains what may be the funniest episode of this or any series- Lou's Birthday. Syd Fields proves his versatility and steals the show! His verbal joust with Lou over whether or not he is invited to the party (or if he even wants to be invited) is a comedic gem. Then, when he arrives, his outfit is a must see! Finally, watch his obvious pride at his gift to Lou- a picture of himself in the tub! (Please, watch and see for yourself.) With appearances by Joe Besser as Stinky (a 60 year-old man playing an eight year-old) this is a can't miss!",997660800,12,553,4.276190476190476
7906362,5,B00000F0ZA,"I used to own these on VHS, but the DVD really brings back a quality that I have never seen before with these classics. I hope they release all 13 volumes on DVD soon.",963705600,14,167,3.9411764705882355
