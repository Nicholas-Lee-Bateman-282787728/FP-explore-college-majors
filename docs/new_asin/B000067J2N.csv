7963338,3,B000067J2N,"This Cisco Kid package is a mixed bag.  Duncan Renaldo's first outing as The Cisco Kid  in ""South of the Rio Grande"" (1945) is pretty good.  It is a good story but other than a little action at the beginning and at the ending, the story mostly takes place indoors.  The picture quality is excellent.  There is quite a bit of pleasant Mexican music.  Cisco sings but I wonder if that is really his voice.  Reasonably good production values.
""The Girl From San Lorenzo"" (1950) is a more bare-bones movie.  There is little of the girl mentioned in the title.  Story line has ace stuntman Dave Sharpe donning clothing identical to that of the Cisco Kid so he can rob stagecoaches and leave the blame to Cisco.  Not as entertaining as ""South of the Rio Grande"".
There is also an untitled half-hour television program.  Picture quality is only fair.  The interesting interview with Duncan Renaldo is from another of Jon Tuska's programs about the B-westerns dating to approximately 1971.
The disc is nicely done and worth the price.",1332892800,,1026,4.702247191011236
7963339,5,B000067J2N,"Very pleased with the quality of this DVD. 2 one-hour movies. The first is ""South of the Rio Grande"" (1945) with Garralaga as Pancho. They help a rancher friend and his neighbors whose ranches are being terrorized by a ruthless dictator and a gang of horse thieves. In ""The Girl from San Lorenzo"" (1950), with Carrillo, they have to find the robbers who are dressing like them to hold up stage coaches. There is one color TV episode ""Railroad Land Rush"" where a man impersonates a Railroad man who is coming to town on the stage coach to stop swindlers from selling land to the people of the town Echo. The TV episode is a little blurry, but the color is pretty good.

In the interview with Duncan Renaldo (Cisco) he tells us what went on during the filming of the movies and about why Pancho changed during his time as Cisco--why Martin Garralaga did not continue as Pancho and how Leo Carrillo became Pancho. He also talks about why he has a mustache in one movie and it's gone another. Mr. Renaldo (Cisco) talks about Mr. Carrillo's funny use of words during his interview. It is great fun watching him play with words in the American language.",1318204800,,1147,4.514423076923077
7963340,5,B000067J2N,"I wrote a lot about my opinion on ""Cisco Kid Double Feature Vol. 2"". The same review includes Vol. 1 as well.
  It's hard trying to find reasonable reproductions of old pre-1960 TV shows.
These films had the handicap of cellulose which quickly deteriorated along with the images over time if it wasn't remastered. Also archived ""B"" movies and old TV shows probably weren't stored with the same respect a renown movie or TV show would have.
  To a purist the video quality may be unacceptable. But those of us who choose to overlook this and judge it for it's historical value and reminiscence will find a wonderful inexpensive video treat.

Recommend the Cisco book from the University Press by Francis M. Nevins as a companion piece.",1222300800,,271,4.76595744680851

Renaldo was in his '60s and Carillo in his '70s when they appeared at the ""Firemen's Rodeo"" in St. Louis during the '50s ~ my Grandmother and Great Aunt took me to see them, and I believe both of them had a crush on the two actors (Renaldo and Carrillo) came galloping out into the center of the arena, every kid in attendance was in awe, as I was and when the show was over, I rode my imaginary horse home.

Own them now on DVD....if you crave action, drama and plenty of adventure then this is the place for all of the above...if you enjoyed this serial check out another VCI Entertainment release the first big screen full length in color ""Lone Ranger"" (1956) (digitally remastered in Dolby), long running Lone Ranger series on radio and then turned out in the early '40s in the movies...it's all new and in Warnercolor the west's greatest hero...the story line is excellent with outstanding action scenes and production with over hours worth of entertainment
