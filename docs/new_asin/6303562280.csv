722479,5,6303562280,"Ken Maynard, the star of this serial, took a hand in both the producing and directing of ""Mystery Mountain"".  He rounded up every available cowboy actor he could find to staff it.  Even Gene Autry and superstar comedy-singing-sidekick Smiley Burnett have small roles.  If you fancy yourself an expert on the old black & white matinee westerns, I'll bet you can identify 20 to 30 of the men who played the bad men, stage drivers, and cowhands in hundreds of the wonderful old films.
A few of the good guys are good guys include Jim Carey, Al Bridge, Hal Telifino, Jack Rockwell, Gene Autry, and Smiley Burnett.  The homely outlaws include Bob Kortman, Lou Meehan, Tom London, George Chesebro, and many more.
Ken Maynard combined the charm and good looks of John Wayne with the stunt riding ability of Yakima Canutt (the best ever cowboy stuntman).  Maynard was a professional stunt rider before becoming a silent movie star, and easily made the transition to talkies.  Only Maynard was able to compete on equal terms with both Tom Mix in the silents and John Wayne in the talkies.  Ken was so muscular and bowlegged, and had such damaged knees that he could hardly run.
The beautiful Verna Hille plays second fiddle to Ken Maynard's only true love, his horse Tarzan.  Modern movie goers remember Trigger, but Tarzan was certainly the most talented horse in the movies and the most loved by his owner, Ken Maynard.
This was the highest grossing western serial ever released.  It was meant for matinee audiences, which were mostly kids.  So expect a kids' film.
I see than Amazon also carries ""Six Shootin' Sheriff.""  It was one of Ken's last pictures and a favorite of mine.  Ken has to clean out 3 tough outlaw gangs and makes the supreme sacrifice.  He has to pass of a piece of pie made by his girl, Miss Mollie.  He's afraid it'll slow him down too much, because bad man Earl Dwire is waiting to gun him down in front of the saloon.
""Two Gun Man"" is another great Maynard movie.  If you're a handgun shooter, you'll love the insane way Ken's partner teaches some cowhands how to shoot.  Don't miss this one.
""In Old Santa Fe."" is also not only real good but real famous.  Maynard is teamed with Gabbie Hayes; and Gene Autry and Smiley Burnett make their first singing appearance in the movies.  This wasn't the first western with a song or two but it was the western that paved the way for Gene, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen, and all the rest",1041897600,,2437,4.576036866359447

The element where the bad guy is successfully disguising himself as other characters using rubber masks is laughable.  The continuing antics of Ken Maynard's sidekick are rather tiring.

7854303,4,6303562280,"This is an interesting old 1930s serial, starring Ken Maynard and his wonder horse Tarzan. As Ken Williams, a detective, Maynard seeks to solve the continuing series of murders connected with the building of a railroad through a mountain, with a mysterious phantom styling himself ""The Rattler"" being the chief suspect, having left messages propelled by an arrow-like device that plunges into door frames, etc., when least expected.

Verna Hillie is Maynard's leading lady as Jane Corwin, owner of a wagon transport company started by her father. He was the first victim of the Rattler, and she is determined to find the unknown, deadly perpetrator and bring him to justice. And Syd Saylor as Breezy Baker, a caricature of an old-time reporter-photographer, provides the comic relief.

Which brings me to a problem I had with the film. It has plenty of good action (Maynard usually did his own stunts), and the cinematography is fine. But the director gave WAY too much screen time to Saylor, showing us every single minute of the various ""comical"" scrapes he gets into -- including getting knocked out by bad guys so many times that I lost count. I didn't keep track, but I suspect that Saylor had more minutes on screen than did Maynard himself. Comic relief should not be permitted to take over a good Western. Allowed to hog too much of the action, the funny stuff just becomes padding, useful only in making the movie longer.

But, ""Mystery Mountain"" certainly has its moments. Some of the more intriguing ones are just slightly over half-way through, when Maynard approaches a wagon being driven toward him by two teamsters. When Maynard speaks to the men, and the one on the viewer's right answers, the voice sounds strangely familiar. Then when the director cuts to a close-up of the two men, lo and behold, it's Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette! They had made their initial screen appearance just shortly before in the Maynard Western ""In Old Santa Fe,"" singing and playing in a party scene half-way through that film. In ""Mystery Mountain"" they actually have a few lines -- although no screen credits. But then, only 12 of the numerous actors who appear in the film are listed by name.

All in all, the serial ""Mystery Mountain"" is worth watching. But a good part of Syd Saylor's footage is dross. Tighter editing might have convinced me to give it five stars.",1433289600,,2368,4.825123152709359

7854306,4,6303562280,"Mystery Mountain is a 12 episode Mascot Pictures serial where silent movie cowboy star Ken Maynard is trying to track down a nefarious criminal called the 'Rattler'.

Former silent western star Ken Maynard is the main interest in this good effort from Mascot Pictures.  He plays a railroad detective, out to find the villian who's causing trouble for a railroad builder.  The bad guy, known as the ""Rattler"", uses disguises, masks of other members of the cast. You may remember this ""idea"" from John Wayne's ""Hurricane Express - another interesting serial of the era.

As Maynard tries to find out the identity of the ""Rattler"", the ""Rattler"" is busy trying to get a feud going between the railroad and a freight wagon outfit that's owned by leading lady Verna Hillie.  The identity of the ""Rattler"" is finally revealed in the end by a somewhat unusual method...  no spoilers here...

I found it interesting that many people my dad's age (including my dad) remembered this serial and spoke of it with the same fondness as the Gene Autry westerns that were their favorites.

Be careful when buying this item - many of the listings are for single tapes of multi-tape sets. You will need all 4 volumes of the multi-tape set for the complete serial.
