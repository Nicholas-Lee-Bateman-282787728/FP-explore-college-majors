7905480,1,B000009HNJ,"Simon Yam performs as Simon, a male prostitute, or ""gigolo"", who is hired by a woman, Mrs. Lau (Veronica Yip) to impregnate her because her husband is impotent, and has an insufficient sperm level as well, but she becomes passionately attached to Simon although he considers their brief liaison to be strictly a job, and accordingly will not encourage her enormous emotional needs.  During this same time, Simon falls in love with Miss Koh (Sandra Ng), an assistant district attorney and sexually muffled woman who is also strongly attracted to the gigolo, despite her pretension to be alarmed at his lively exploits, and Simon finds that he must woo the rather plain attorney all the while fixing upon a method for her to forfeit an unwanted celibacy.  It appears that Mrs. Lau's craving to bear a child involves financial gain instead of maternal instinct, and following a series of desperate efforts to gain Simon's love that founders completely, she assails him physically and also symbolically in a court of law where she is responsible for his being unjustly tried for murder, with Miss Koh as prosecutor, the film therewith becoming a lurid melodrama, replacing its earlier posture as sex saturated jollity.  Hopelessly muddled in conception, the film is in turn an erotic comedy, a work of suspense based upon sexual obsession, and finally a courtroom drama, none of which is developed well enough to count towards being a rewarding form of entertainment, as the film's tone is simply too uneven, the script is poorly composed, and most attempts at humour are in bad or worse taste.  A DVD has been issued and is of uneven quality, although it is a widescreen version with excellent Dolby sound; English subtitles are available and provide the most amusing element of the entire production.",1156809600,,1798,4.983333333333333
