7989911,1,B000096IAN,"Well, the stop-action furniture piece was somewhat amusing, beyond that, there is nothing I can really recommend here. Poor concepts, poor execution, and yes, flash animation you can get for free online (Happy Tree Friends). Don't waste your time or money friends, this is a clunker! in The early 90s, Spike & Mike used to be a must-see showcase of animation, but this...bottom of the barrel.",1150502400,3,392,4.954545454545454
7989912,1,B000096IAN,"Very poor all around... the one or two cartoons on here that are actually any good are of very poor video cassette quality. I felt like I was watching an amateur VHS dub, instead of a properly authored DVD.

Thankfully the decent cartoons on here are available on other more professional DVD releases.

A word to the wise consumer:  don't be fooled just because the format is DVD! DVD does not mean anything if the source materials that an amateur company uses are sub par!",1091404800,7,473,4.541176470588235
7989913,4,B000096IAN,"The second dvd in the sick and twisted collection is one of the best dvd's i ever bought. It has it all, maakies, Happy tree friends, and the tripped out horned grandma. Clocking in under 2 Hrs this is defenaty a party dvd to show.",1082592000,,231,4.155555555555556
7989914,1,B000096IAN,"I can only guess the positive reviews listed here were written either by children or employees of this DVD's distributor.
I've been involved with independent animation for over thirty years and this is a very desperate ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" collection indeed - only one or two of the pieces here are worthwhile, and are available on far higher quality collections elsewhere (in terms of video and audio quality).
The rest of the pieces are subpar, barely-animated Flash cartoons that most websites would be embarrassed to host for free.
The DVD is also very poorly produced and has no extras.

7989915,5,B000096IAN,"I don't usually like cartoons, but this one really had some very funny bits.  There was some real violent skits called Happy Tree Friends that was very witty.  Can't wait for the next one, Unprotected - I'll tell you all how it is.",1077235200,,231,4.348837209302325
7989916,1,B000096IAN,"Very Disappointing. I bought this DVD only for the film ""rejected"", but then I found out about the all-around superior 'single' DVD version of ""rejected"" (remastered w/extras, etc) that's only available on .....  - GET THAT VERSION INSTEAD FOLKS!! Seriously. I hope that official single will be on Amazon soon!! ""Rejected"" is always a cool film but for some reason this version of it looks like it was streamed off an internet bootleg, which I don't understand
So that's strike one. So then I hoped to at least find other cool cartoons on this DVD. Strike two... They're all super bad
and are not even in the same league :( It's like they only had ""Rejected"" and then piled a bunch of internet junk around it to pad out a release. It's seriously kind of amazing how bad they are. Where are all the other cool animated short films of the world!? I can't imagine this is all they could find?
Strike three, there are no extras anywhere on the DVD: production extras are something I always look forward to, especially with animation releases. Couldn't they have spent some time to offer some original artwork to display? The films just all play in a row with no real polish or care or anything.
To sum up, they kind of took my money and ran fast with this collection. sorry, really not worth it!",1063324800,9,1291,4.540772532188841
7989917,1,B000096IAN,"Spike and Mike have been really going downhill in recent years. This very poor and sloppily-made DVD leaves little hope for their future. I was extremely disappointed and a bit angry with this purchase.
I imagine the only reason anyone would want to buy this DVD is for the classic cartoon, ""Rejected"" - unfortunately the picture and sound quality on this DVD is extremely poor, as it looks like Spike and Mike cheaply copied this film from a murky VHS tape rather than using any real 35mm materials. If ""Rejected"" is solely what you're after on DVD, it goes without saying you'd be better off with the crystal-clear, official remastered version of the film available directly from the filmmakers at Bitter Films - the difference in quality is night and day.
The other cartoons here are terrible, and most are surprisingly nothing more than poor Flash animations that are already available for free on the internet. None of them are particularly ""sick"" nor ""twisted"", either. They are however, universally boring.
My final complaint is that there are no extras. None. There is barely even a menu. What's the point of making a DVD at all if it's got VHS picture and sound quality and has no extras?? Spike and Mike are trying to make another quick buck here by essentially selling us a video tape in a DVD shell. Don't give it to them.",1062288000,12,1334,4.705128205128205
