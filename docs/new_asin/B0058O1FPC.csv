4601166,3,B0058O1FPC,"After 13 years in prison AJ (Paul Levesque) is released. His best friend Jack (Michael Rapaport) is there to greet him. Jack is now married to AJ's former gf (Parker Posey). Jack is still involved in the crime scene, while AJ has renounced his life of crime and wants to make pickles. Jack's father, a veterinarian, runs small time crime, buying and selling untaxed cigarettes to convenience stores in Louisiana. He wants AJ to work for him because his son Jack is unreliable.

Jack is a very irritating character. He has an overly simplistic view of oriental philosophy of cause and effect which he feels he must vocalize, giving us a theme for the movie. The Louisiana ATF is on to the operation. AJ who wants to go straight becomes an accessory to Jack's mishaps. The action takes place in Louisiana with the characters all being local. In spite of that, Parker Posey is the only one who has an accent.

The movie has predictable twists and some unpredictable ones. I think for HHH fans, it was a gallant effort. For those who like fast paced action films, you need to look elsewhere.",1317513600,,1087,4.626943005181347
4601167,3,B0058O1FPC,"""You sir are gonna do one thing before this is over. You're gonna clean this whole thing up and then your gonna keep my son away from me permanently."" After 13 years AJ (Triple H) is released from prison. Meeting up with his best friend Jack (Rapaport) he is ready to start his life over. When Jack messes up his plans AJ realizes he has one more thing to do before he can leave his old life behind. This movie is pretty much exactly what I expected. Any movie starring a wrestler pretty much has a built in fan base and that's what the producers count on. While this one was not as bad as some of the other wrestling movies I have seen, this is still one that you forget as you are watching. I will admit this was not as cheesy as I expected though. Overall, many people will love this movie, I am not one of them. But I expected a little worse. I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - No, I won't.

4601168,5,B0058O1FPC,"First of all, I don't agree with this other schmo who wrote about Triple H being a horrible actor and not to do another film. John Cena, Steve Austin, yeah they aren't too good an actors. However, Triple H, proves the first time was not his real acting ability. I didn't like the first WWE feature film from Triple H (Jean Levesque in real life): ""The Chaperone"", a rip-off of other kiddy camp films such as ""Ernest Goes To Camp"" and ""Meatballs""(if your not counting that picture he was in as a vampire--""Blade III"", I think, and that other one, the Highlander movie--I forget which one). But, this one was great! I was quite surprised this afternoon when I ordered it on PPV on Direct TV). ""Inside Out"" has a great plot to be a WWE Movie: schmo idiot mob middle-tier hitman, Jack Small(played by Michael Rapaport--great actor by the way!) keeps finding ways to get into trouble (shoot the bartender in the gut, hit and almost kill a policeman, etc. Yeah, he's a real genius folks--a guy who has no morals or common sense if that gives you a in-depth look at this fairly shallow character--and believe me Michael Rapaport plays this character well--to the hilt in fact! Great job Mike!). Triple H plays Arlo Jayne (AJ is his nickname he goes by in the film), the ex-con mob hitman and friend to Jack and Claire Small (AJ's ex-wife and mother to AJ's daughter Pepper--played by Juliette Goglia), who is trying to straighten up his own life and keeps getting dragged into the middle of the family's war (yes--Bruce Dern's--a mob boss named Dr. Vic Small! A doctor and a mob boss?! Yep, the hits just keep coming in this one!). Parker Posey adds her touch of grace as Claire Small, the wife of Jack and a terrific supporting performance turned in by her in this one! Martha, (Julie White) an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, has been investigating Dr. Vic for smuggling counterfeit cigarettes into Louisiana and tax evasion. She is determined to bring Dr. Vic and Jack down with or without AJ's help. In the end, AJ will stop at nothing to protect the woman hes always loved and the daughter he never knew he had. Jack Small ends up on the run from his father and the law and Arlo Jayne agrees to turn over his friend to the police (or does he--it seems daddy--Vic Small is a mob boss and a doctor?!). Vic catches up with his son in the bar where Vic's hit woman Irena (played by Jency Griffith) beats the crap out of Jack and leaves him laying. Vic and Irena drive away from the bar and she pushes a button on her cell phone and 'KABOOM!' the bar blows up with Jack in it! (DOA--poor Jack!).  AJ, in the meantime, is dealing with the fact that his daughter Pepper catches him and his ex-wife (her ex-con father) in bed together. AJ gets shot in the abdomen (but not fatally) by Claire, who has a moment of fear and weakness (that's all I can figure out in the only part of the movie I didn't understand). Claire takes Pepper and heads up to a family cabin in the mountains and AJ finds her there. AJ is told by Claire that she's on the run from her father and she was scared for her life when she shot AJ and took Pepper with her into the woods). AJ finds a sign painted on a chair that says ""Kaboom!"" outside and grabs Claire and Pepper and heads out the door just as the cabin blows up. AJ tells Claire and Pepper to run. We see their vehicle pull out of the driveway and AJ gets hit from behind by Irena (Dr. Vic's hit woman--played by Jency Griffith) who obviously wants to kill AJ. However, Claire shoots Irena from behind and the next scene shows the case being wrapped up with all charges cleared on AJ by Claire Small. AJ is seen walking out with Claire and Pepper and driving a car to visit Jack in the cemetery. That's pretty much it! I liked it! I love a good complex action drama as long as it makes sense. This one clicked on every level with me. I would highly suggest watching this film even if you don't like Triple H! The other actors are superb in this! This is one film WWE Studios got right! 5 out of 5 stars from me! Go rent or buy this one! You won't be sorry! Triple H really shines in this one!",1315872000,,4118,4.320413436692506

4601191,4,B0058O1FPC,"INSIDE OUT

As a wrestling fan I try and support anything that has something to do with that. So when any wrestler is in a movie or something I have to get it. Triple H made two movies thus far from WWE films and while this one was filmed first [I believe] it was released second. The writer and the director of this film would team together again for another WWE film which was Bending the Rules starring Edge.

This film follows AJ [Triple H] as he is released from prison and linking back up with his best friend who is now married to his ex. He wants to go clean and start up a pickle business but his friend needs his help with one last thing. Of course things go wrong and now not only are the cops coming for him but his former employer is not happy with him as well. Did I mention his former employer is his friends father and that the only way to make it right his to kill his friend, what is AJ to do?

This movie is one of those films that is good but never seems to reach that full potential. That is a shame because it is a good story and has some good actors in it. Michael Rapaport is great as always as AJs friend and is very believable in the role. Parker Posey may be the best here as the now wife of Rapaports character and Bruce Dern is great. In fact no one is bad here and that includes Triple H. Yes his acting is not Oscar worthy but I think his style was perfect for the character.

Over all the movie is a good one that is just a little short of becoming really good. For a WWE film in particular it is fine and Triple H was fun to watch. The DVD comes with some behind the scenes and stuff but I wish it had a commentary. If you are a wrestling fan I would say check it out.",1428278400,,1701,3.936046511627907

4601202,1,B0058O1FPC,"After watching ""The Chaperone"" I had higher hopes that this more adult orientated film would be much better then the last movie he did.... how wrong I was. Ole Big Nose starts the movie the exact same way as he did his last movie, he is released from prison and wants to drive someone else's car... must be a clause in Triple-H's contract that he will not make a movie unless he is an ex-con who drives a car in the released from prison scenes. This time tho, The Game is picked up by his best friend and goes to stay with him, all while telling his friend he wants no part in cigarette smuggling, he just wants to make pickles. I'm not lying, I swear, it's true, the Cerebral Assassin spends a majority of this movie either eating pickles, talking about pickles, or playing with his pickles. Triple-Hemorrhoids buddy is married to Trip's lover before he went to prison. The bud's father wants his son to collect some money, and in a ridicules scene he shoots dead the guy who the FBI or someone planted, so now the buddy and Triple-HIV dispose of the body and cause a commotion with the cops and the buds dad who wants his own son killed now for being so stupid, and asking .... wait, stop... the plot sounds dumb enough already, right? Check it out if you must, but trust me, this movie is somewhat original, but a complete load of hard to swallow b.s. In fact, The Rock would say this movie is 10 pounds of monkey cr#@ in a 5 pound bag.

Don't get me wrong, I love DX, and Hunter is a fav wrestler of mine, but this movie, ha, well, all I can say it, I love Hulk Hogan too, but no way in hell am I ever going to watch ""The Secret Agent Club"". This movie is a mess of random ideas and hard to swallow BS that keeps imploding with massive stenches of Jim Ross's seven day old underwear. I would not recommend you watch this, but if you are curious, for the love of Mick Foley, do not buy it, rent it, or do the other things, but I assure you, most of you will never want to ever watch this again. It's not a god awful horrible movie, it's just a god awful horrible plot. And the co stars acting is irritating, I dunno who he is, but I accidentally saw him on ""Friends"" today, and he was Pheobes cop-boyfriend, and man, I guess his role in the movie wasn't an act, that really is who he is, which is damn-right annoying.

P.S: It wasn't my fault, my girlfriend was watching Friends, and I walked in at the wrong moment, then pointed and said, ""thats the annoying moron from that movie I watched last night"" then saw Chandler on screen and proceeded to enter the bathroom and bleach my eyes and ears to rid me of the horror.

P.P.S: I can type without the need of vision!",1329436800,3,2670,4.200779727095517
4601203,2,B0058O1FPC,"i am a big WWE fan and used to like seeing triple H in old movies like Blade... Even the chaperone was better then this no action movie that pretty much went nowhere. IT seems like everytime WWE films is involved, the movie itself ends up turning out horrible.  Theirs a reason these kind of movies always go straight to dvd's... because majority of the time they aren't worth buying and not worth even watching.",1325548800,,412,4.493333333333333
4601204,3,B0058O1FPC,"AJ (Triple H) has just been released from prison and all he wants to do is...make pickles. But,Jack (Michael Rapaport), AJ's screw up friend that stole his girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) when he was in prison, gets them in a whole lot of trouble.
  Jack accidentally kills a man during a simple job for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) and steals the money in a briefcase that was left behind. Now, AJ finds himself stuck in the middle and has to choose a side between father and son when, again he just wants to....make pickles.
  Triple H is surprisingly good even though WWE wrestlers are so gigantic that they often look awkward on film and Triple is no exception. But when everyone else in the movie isn't that easy to like, you find yourself rooting for AJ. Michael Rapaport is a likable actor but his character is just so careless and immature that I didn't care if he winded up in a ditch somewhere.",1320192000,,908,4.484848484848484
4601205,3,B0058O1FPC,"A.J. (Triple H) is an ex-convict who was in jail for 13 years for manslaughter.  The man to meet him when he gets out is his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), who's a low-level mobster working for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) & also married to A.J. ex-girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) with them having a daughter named Pepper (Juliette Goglia).  When Jack tries to get A.J. back in the game, he tells him that he's not going back into mob work & just wants to have his own business making pickles (which becomes a running joke throughout the whole movie) but ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time when Jack accidentally shoots someone he's was only suppose to collect money from for his father causing him to handle the situation while Jack kept the money for himself & left town.  It later turns out that the man Jack shot was an undercover informant for Martha (Julie White), an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, who's out to get Dr. Vic for tax evasion & illegal smuggling but also gets the police involved when she informs Detective Calgrove (Michael Cudlitz) about her informant missing only to find out about the shooting.  After Dr. Vic finds out that the deal went back & he didn't get his money, A.J. said he would handle it only for Vic to decide to take matters into his own hands.  So A.J. must deal with trying to protect Jack's family & address the issues between him & Claire, dealing with Martha & Det. Calgrove who are determined to get Vic with or without his help, Jack's out of control attitude, and Vic's deadly assistant Irena (Jency Griffin) who had a habit of leaving notes saying ""Kaboom"" before something bad happens.

The main character Triple H plays here is very similar to the one he did in his previous movie ""The Chaperone"" where he's an ex-con who's out trying to turn his life around but keeps ending up in these bad situations with people from his past however the difference here is that this movie takes a more serious approach instead of comedic with the exception of the constant pickle references here.  They had some establish actors throughout the movie & the story was good, there wasn't anything here really memorable or would make me watch it again after the first viewing so it's worth a rental & you make your own call.",1317945600,5,2287,4.549878345498784
