5040114,5,B006ZL1PGG,"I enjoyed the vision of a future world. The fact that greed and the dark side of humans is ever present, even if actions are taken for originally very positive reasons, this shows how easily we can lapse.",1381708800,3,204,4.394736842105263
5040115,5,B006ZL1PGG,"I had been looking to get the Blueray version of Equilibrium for some time.  I love this movie even though the critics didn't.  I'm not going to critique the movie as I personally would give it 4.5 stars out of 5.  But for someone looking for the Blueray verison of this movie, this is the ONLY version you should buy.  The stand alone USA version Blueray DOES NOT have 5.1 DTS surround audio.  It only has 2.0 audio.  Seems most of the USA releases in Blueray of Equilibrium is worthless.

Granted this version is still not in the proper aspect ratio of 2.35, but it is the best USA release you can get of this movie.  The movie has a 1.78 aspect ratio, but is in DTS 5.1 surround.  Until Echo Bridge releases this movie in the proper aspect ratio, this is the best version of the movie you can get, hands down!!",1374796800,7,813,4.261437908496732
5040116,5,B006ZL1PGG,"Love the action sequences on Equilibrium, for sure the Wachowski brothers would have seen this film and took reference of those scenes and mixed it with Hongkong action cinematics then applied it on The Matrix. A very good film with a nice idea behind it.

 I have Renaissance on DVD which I think is one of the best underrated CGI animated film out there. So having it now on Blu Ray is just a bonus. Because this animated feature is done in black and white it's very clear people won't be able to tell any difference in picture resolution between the DVD against Blu Ray.",1368921600,,573,4.447619047619048
5040117,5,B006ZL1PGG,Awesome! That's all I really have to say. I love these movies and the fact that they are together on one disc with the quality of Blu-ray is amazing.,1367193600,,149,4.172413793103448
5040118,3,B006ZL1PGG,"The aspect ratio listed on the packaging is 1.78:1 for each of these films but upon viewing I found that they are presented in an aspect of 2.35:1, which is the format they were theatrically released as according to IMDb.
Despite being on the same disc, I found the picture quality to be quite good, better in fact than some single film Blu-Ray discs I own.

The audio specs are incorrect on the package which lists English 2.0 Stereo AND English 5.1 DTS for each film. There is no choice on the audio; it is only English 5.1 Dolby Digital rather than either of the options listed on the box (and yes, you do NOT get the option of the original French dialogue on ""Renaissance"").

I had previously seen both of these as DVD rentals and really only wanted to own ""Equilibrium""; but when I saw this edition at a local used bookstore for $5 I figured I'd take a chance.
This is a fine budget set if you don't care about all of the bells and whistles usually found on Blu-rays and only want a bare bones edition of these movies.",1363478400,,1023,4.322916666666667
5040119,2,B006ZL1PGG,"Two good movies in a lame package. No subtitles no extras. Even the remastering was poor.
I was not expecting two BD disk but at least one with decent prints, subtitles and a few audio options.  This is pretty much the original DVD quality.

Booth movies are worth; but try to find a better edition.",1362700800,,299,4.418181818181818
5040120,4,B006ZL1PGG,"Actually, give 4 stars, this one was a good stuffs cos it has a two different features movies in one set",1357171200,,104,4.0
5040121,3,B006ZL1PGG,"Here's the rundown on this disc:

Single layer BD25 Blu-ray disc.  Both films are on the same disc.  Upon disc startup, a screen with silhouettes featuring the characters from each film lets you decide what film to watch.  The menus for each film contain three choices: a play option, a chapter search, and the ability to switch films back and forth.

Video: Both films are presented in 1080p using the AVC MPEG-4 encode in their proper 2.35:1 aspect ratios.
Audio: Both films feature lossy English Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks.  Renaissance does not include its native French track, only the Miramax dub featuring Daniel Craig.  There are no subtitle options or other tracks.

For a full breakdown of this release, keep your eyes peeled on the upcoming HighDefDigest review!",1332460800,25,771,4.96875

8506952,5,B006ZL1PGG,I bought this for Equilibrium. Christian Bale is amazing in this totalitarian style futuristic movie. It definitely reminds of 1984.,1428796800,,132,5.65
8506953,5,B006ZL1PGG,arrived when stated happy with what I received,1427760000,,46,4.875

8506955,2,B006ZL1PGG,"Equilibrium review only (Miramax Double Feature)
Received as a gift.
4 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the release. They must be getting re-mastering on the cheap.
Lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, does have proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (previously only on Japanese release), however details are not strong and movie looks flat, some artifacting, skin tones are inconsistent. Other versions seem to have the butchered 1.78:1 aspect ratio.",1419897600,,437,5.257142857142857
8506956,3,B006ZL1PGG,"Renaissance is not in French, and neither title includes subtitles. Buy them individually if you care about this at all.",1417219200,,120,5.05
8506957,5,B006ZL1PGG,Equilibrium should have gotten more press than it did.  I saw this years after it came out and it just had the right vibe to it.,1392422400,3,128,3.923076923076923
8506958,5,B006ZL1PGG,i don't think either of these got the attention they deserved but they're both stellar flicks. both are great stories but renaissance is a visual feast. it's absolutely gorgeous,1390694400,2,177,5.137931034482759
8506959,3,B006ZL1PGG,"Not a good double feature disk.  Equilibrium has its moments and is well directed and edited, but is not a blockbuster by any stretch.  Renaissance is animated feature and is totally in black and white (too much contrast periodically and too much darkness on the screen at times); no real need for utilizing Blu-ray format.  Film is tough to watch on the screen.  Regret not researching the contents further.",1386201600,5,408,4.869565217391305
