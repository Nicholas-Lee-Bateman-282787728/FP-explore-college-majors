8448018,5,B004Y9OL94,"Got this for a 57 year old for their birthday.  They loved it.  Being a child during those years, 60's anyway made them relive and look back at the things they enjoyed and knew about.",1393372800,,183,4.2
8448019,2,B004Y9OL94,"Repeats material. Thought I would know a lot of these, but didn't remember many because lots of them are close to the 80s. Ice cream section is dominated by one company. Should have mixed ads up instead of 4 in a row from the same company. Not the trip down memory lane I expected. Too bad because I gave this as a gift and had a group of people gathered to watch and people were saying, ""skip to the next section"" way more than having fun.",1386633600,,440,4.127906976744186
8448020,5,B004Y9OL94,"My wife is a huge fan of vintage commercials, and these collections had very few duplicates. Each volume is at least 90 minutes and have many ads that we've never seen, in very clean condition. A very worthwhile purchase!",1384128000,2,221,4.6923076923076925
8448021,5,B004Y9OL94,"As a collector of commercials for over ten years, with many thousands in my (mostly 70's/80's) collection, I was worried that a lot of these would be doubles. I was very excited to find almost all unique ads that I haven't stumbled upon before, and even the ones that are doubles are slightly different versions or, in all cases, vastly superior in viewing quality to anything I already had. I'd say that's the major selling point--these are pretty much all pristine, film-quality commercials. Be prepared for some repetition (for example, the ""ice cream"" segment is virtually all black-and-white Borden ads, with two ads representing each flavor, one of the two being a ""Fury"" TV show tie-in). The seventies are well-represented, though, with many memorable spots, some I hadn't thought of since back in the day. Don't expect anything in the way of packaging, but for the price it's well worth it.",1366848000,6,898,4.953642384105961
8448022,4,B004Y9OL94,"This DVD had many of the classic TV kid commercials of the 60's and 70's - - cereals, candy and gum, toys and games and Ice Cream.  The quality of the commercials was really good.  About my only complaint really, is that this DVD tended to show many commercials in a row of the same product - - such as:  Borden Ice Cream, which I counted 9 straight commercials in a row.  I wish they would have added more variety from different manufacturers and companies is all.  But again, this DVD was really fun to watch.  Great nostalgia.  I remember seeing so many of these when I was young.  I am 57-years old now...and it ABSOLUTELY AMAZED me how once a commercial started, I could fill-in the rest of the words to the punch line - - total recall - - after 40-50 years of not seeing these, I STILL remember most of their slogans, songs and punch lines.",1333238400,11,846,4.276729559748428
