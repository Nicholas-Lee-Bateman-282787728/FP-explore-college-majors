8319042,1,B001LNOL00,"It's a home video. Don't expect a story or an arc, or even a clean sound mix. Don't expect to understand the history or culture of Afghanistan. It's just some random interviews of people on the street stitched together with a voice-over. Not worth paying $1.99 for. I fast forwarded through most of it as it is very poorly done. Hard to sit through for an hour.",1473292800,,361,4.402985074626866
8319043,4,B001LNOL00,A really good complement to reading A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. Highly recommended to get a different view of life in Afghanistan.,1380067200,2,147,5.166666666666667
8319044,2,B001LNOL00,"If you are looking for a travelogue, this is not it. The background scenery provides a small glimpse of Afghan modernity. There are lengthy Farsi and Dari dialogues by locals sans English subtitles and no explanation of the thrust of the conversation by the moderator, Anwar Hajer. I was looking for authentic information to educate me for a possible humanitarian venture in Afghanistan - This did not fulfill that need in the least.
I would like to meet Anwar Hajer, however.",1263600000,4,476,4.888888888888889
8319045,5,B001LNOL00,"Anwar Hajer's return to his home village, Logar Afghanistan, after more than 25 years of war driven exile is a journey of the heart. See the country and culture through the eyes of a native son. Visit the blue mosque of Ali in Mazar-e-sharif, talk to Afghan war widows selling their wares, visit the boys high school in Kundoz, meet a Pashtun family and village elders. This is a view of Afghanistan's people and culture that few westerners have ever seen.",1228176000,7,456,4.6419753086419755
