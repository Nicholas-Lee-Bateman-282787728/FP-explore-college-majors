8751659,3,B01BVRT9B6,"I had purchased the first release of season 1 and had been waiting for the rest of the series to be offered.  While I am glad the rest of the series is finally available, the small print on the packaging states that some episodes have been edited and the music has been changed. I am really disappointed in the fact that it doesn't seem that these are the full original airings.",1466380800,3,378,4.323943661971831
