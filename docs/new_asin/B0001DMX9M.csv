1992216,4,B0001DMX9M,"At the beginning of the summer, I started watching this Cartoon Network show with my five year old son and eight year old niece, and I was hooked from the beginning.

Alex, Sam, and Clover are three teenaged high school girls who deal with the pressures of dating, fashion, school, and being spies.  They work for W.O.O.H.P. (The World Organization of Human Potential), are supervised by a cool Brit named Jerry, and literally fall into their assignments at the most unexpected moments.  The show is beautifully animated and the writing is superbly clever, funny, and age-appropriate.  I plan to buy all three dvd's because this show is great.  If you've got children, they'll love it, and you will, too, because you can sit with them and become engrossed in it.",1094169600,19,762,4.8307692307692305
1992217,4,B0001DMX9M,"My 8YO and 6YO loved this DVD, however buyer beware. I am now back looking for the next DVD in the series as ""A Spy Is Born - Part 1"" is a cliff hanger and Part 2 is not included on this DVD. I say that should cost them at least one star (maybe I should consider a second, but I will be generous).",1090368000,5,297,3.65625
1992218,5,B0001DMX9M,"Totally Spies is one of my favorite shows and I can't wait to this DVD. The best thing about thus is the never before episode ""A Spy is Born"". This episode was never shown on Cartoon Network. If you like action then get this DVD.",1075248000,7,229,4.111111111111111

8010835,5,B0001DMX9M,"I loved this show when I was in middle school and still love it to this day.  It's fun, smart, and highly entertaining.  I wish they'd bring it back!",1293580800,,149,4.103448275862069

8010837,3,B0001DMX9M,I think this show has some pretty lame gender stereotypes but other than that I'm surprised that the so enlightened french made this cartoon(laughing hysterically and snorting). I love this show even though it is done in anime style. I feel this show would have been much better if they ditched the gender stereotypes and gave the characters more in-depth personalities. I think this show would have been a blast if the girls were given real missions instead of standard saturday morning cartoon drek. I feel that calling it a cheap imitation of anime is too harsh a rating. All though I have plainly stated my complaints other than that I recommend Kim Possible a hundred times over this show. It has a strong heroine and is funny too.,1142553600,6,736,4.713178294573644
8010838,4,B0001DMX9M,"I remember one episode of Totally Spies called ""Mommie Dearest"" in which the girls' mothers are turned into mindless slaves by an evil mastermind. Alex (the girl with dark hair) has a mother who's a real babe when she wears a bikini.",1130976000,,233,4.571428571428571
8010839,4,B0001DMX9M,"Hey, I may be a guy and all, but I think ""Totally Spies"" is one high-flyin' action show.  It kind of takes girl power to a whole new level.  I'd like to think of the main spy characters as teenage ""Powerpuff Girls,"" another brand of girl power show on the Cartoon Network.  In fact, the personalities of the superheroines are quite similar to that of the spies !  But I digress...

This DVD may not be much, but like the VHS, it has the first three fun-filled, action-packed episodes and a bonus cliffhanger episode called ""A Spy is Born"".  I think the first three episodes of this show are my most favorites (unlike other episodes of other shows I've reviewed).  They include the episode where the spies save a queen and the one where their boss was a notorious bad guy.

If you like shows like ""Totally Spies,"" may I suggest ""The Powerpuff Girls"" or ""Atomic Betty"" on the Cartoon Network ?  Also, the creators of ""Spies"" did a new show on Nicktoons Network called ""Martin Mystery.""  This features the same brand of anime-like action and stunning animation just like ""Spies"" except this series circles around a young boy solving some super-strange cases.  Also good.",1128384000,2,1167,4.64390243902439
8010840,1,B0001DMX9M,"Not only is the art below par, the one thing that gets me the most about this show is the blatant idiocy and prejudice of the girls.

Throughout the series, the girls are always flaunting their ""popularity"", always putting down the kids who are different, as if they were, as human beings, any less human. The girls may have a go-getter attitude, but they have a very powerful attitude vs. authority problem. In one of the episodes, Alex applies for a job at the mall... but is constantly flaring about how she doesn't ""have to listen to anyone!"" This is the kind of attitude that fosters school bullying problems, and results in school shootings.

Sorry, but I'm not interested in teaching my children arrogance, attitude, and to follow the false ""popular-is-best"" lie that society gets trapped in so much.",1113696000,3,807,4.798561151079137
