7425764,1,B0152AW1GI,"Possibly some the worst acting and storyline I've ever seen.  To be fair, I didn't see the whole thing.  We tried...really tried.  The other two reviews gave me hope but I couldn't ever see it making the turn into something decent.  After about 20-30 minutes I decided to turn it off and watch something else.",1448668800,4,309,4.5636363636363635
7425765,5,B0152AW1GI,"What an awesome movie! As a 3rd generation Greek-American, this movie was heart-warming and a rare treat in Christmas movies by being cute/corny as well as meaningful. Helped to drive home the true meaning of Christmas: faith, family, and love. Definitely recommend to Greeks (my Mom) and non-Greeks (my Dad) alike! Bravo!",1448582400,6,322,5.211538461538462

8732405,5,B0152AW1GI,"here it is a few days post Valentine's, and I just watched this Christmas movie. My mother was visiting, and we watched it together. I have to tell you, it is one of the few movies I think we have enjoyed equally. It really is the epitome of feel good (with no trace of saccharine), funny, and actually somewhat clever. If you are lucky enough to watch it with people you love, you will be glad you did. If you watch it by yourself, you will want to call someone you love as soon as it ends.
Also, it really is suitable for anytime of year. The message is in no way limited to Christmas.",1455667200,,587,4.113043478260869
8732406,5,B0152AW1GI,This is a heart warming story about a slightly dysfunctional Greek family.  Funny and charming.,1452297600,,95,5.333333333333333

8732408,5,B0152AW1GI,"This movie is one the best Christmas movies I've seen in a while. I laughed, I cried, and I would recommend this movie to anyone, Greek or not. This movie reminded me of why I became a Christian and renewed my faith, at the same time it provided a thoughtful and touching story.",1449619200,2,278,4.264150943396227
