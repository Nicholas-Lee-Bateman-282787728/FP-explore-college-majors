1395288,5,B000055YVV,"I was very impressed with In the Beginning. Are the others reviewers insane? The Prince of Egypt or The Ten Commandments are better films? The Prince of Egypt places the story of the Exodus to about 1220 B.C. and not 1446 B.C. and Heston's Egypt is about as antiseptic as a floor of an operating room. You could perform surgery on those palace floors. Landau and the others are great. At least the script writers read the book you know, you've heard of it, The Bible. In the Beginning is biblically accurate and outdoes the current Jesus films, the Noah's Ark fiasco and some of the TNT films. This gives me firm confidence that NBC has writers that are literate unlike the other networks.",1052784000,21,689,4.564516129032258
1395289,3,B000055YVV,"The Good: the film stayed very true to the books of Genesis and Exodus and presented them in a way that was entertaining and easy to follow. This would be a good introduction for those with little experience with the Hebrew Bible, or could be used in conjunction with a Bible study. The Bad: the film presented the story without any of the ""bad"" parts recorded in the Bible. Sarai being given over twice to another man (Gen 12:10-20; 20) was left out, as was Jacob's relations with the servants of his 2 wives (Gen 30:1-13), the rape of Dinah (Gen 34), and Moses brush with death (Ex 4:24-26). Portraying the Patriarchs as purely saintly overlooks their humanly faults that the Bible conveys without pretext. The Hoaky: the make-up and sets were excellent throughout the film, but when it came time for the plagues and the exodus, the hoaky special effects and the over-the-top acting on the part of the Egyptians ruined the last 30 minutes. But overall, it was a worthwhile film, an excellent adaptation of the Biblical story. This would make a good addition to your family video library or a good donation to your church library.",982713600,29,1131,4.688442211055277
1395290,2,B000055YVV,"As I first started to watch this I was really excited, because one of my favorite movies is Moses.  As you go along, you see how many important things they cut out and it is so chopped up.  Someone who knows nothing about Moses, may enjoy this, but once you have seen Moses with Charlton Heston, this movie does not even begin to match it. The best Actor was Martin Landeau, he was quite good. The rest of it left something to be desired. I guess the funniest part was when Eve ate the fruit, come on, was it really blackberries and not an apple!!!!!!!",982713600,4,552,4.247619047619048

1395299,5,B000055YVV,"Within this color, single-disc, DVD motion picture masterpiece highlighting the Book of Genesis straight through too the beginning chapters of the Book of Joshua within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible, this epic film IN THE BEGINNING, covers it all! From the biblical Creation to the first of three Jewish Patriarch's - Abraham, his Covenant Son - Isaac and his marriage to the beautiful but conniving Rebekah and the birth of their twin sons: Esau and Jacob. And how, Jacob (the third Patriarch), left the Land of Canaan to flee from his brother Esau whom he had betrayed, seeking safety with his Uncle Laban. But while there, his not-so-dear 'business man' Uncle, for years cheated Jacob. Until finally, together with his 2 wives (Leah & Rachel), two concubines (Bilhah & Zilpah), a total of 12 sons and one daughter along with his share of the flock, he left the cheap and controlling Laban in the Land of Haran and returned to his native homeland, Canaan (modern-day Israel). This depiction is followed by the horrific and unimaginable betrayal of Jacobs' favorite son - Joseph, and his unwarranted suffering due to the jealousy of his brothers, and the subsequent events that led up to his rise too unprecedented power. That being: The Governor/Prime Minister over all of Egypt. He was second-in-command only to the Pharaoh. After Joseph died, the Egyptian Pharaohs came and went. And each in their own turn, increasingly hardened their hearts towards the Children of Israel (the descendants of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob). Which ultimately resulted in 430 years of slavery. There is a moving depiction of the infamous and miraculous Exodus from bondage and servitude because of the plagues that the Lord placed on Egypt and the Great Deliverance by way of the Parting of the Red Sea, that the Lord also made possible for them. Why? Too once and for all, escape the wrath of Pharaoh. Afterwards, having wandered within the wilderness for no less than 40 years, the Israelite's reached and re-inhabited the land of their forefather's - the Promised Land that followed with milk-n-honey, Canaan (Israel). It's all here..., and it's an easy movie to watch, understand and even, learn from. And, whether you're a Christian or not, you will find it genuinely very interesting and entertaining. This is not a documentary or a segmented television program. It is a feature length film that is approximately 168-minutes of concise, biblical, historical and very educational entertainment. And the special effects within this chronological big-screen illustration are something to behold, as well. This dramatic epic flows in a manner that is easy to comprehend and follow along with, within the Holy Scriptures, as well. And, it features a host of stars, including: Martin Landau as Abraham and Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, his wife. This motion picture IN THE BEGINNING is definitely worthy of your viewing time and it is an absolute keeper for your home or church, DVD collection. So, pop the popcorn for your 'Movie Night', gather family and friends around, and enjoy :) !! Nina Kish",1435190400,,3082,5.021484375

1395315,5,B000055YVV,"This is an amazing film! It stays VERY true to the Biblical accounts. It's as if the Bible ""comes to life"" on the screen, making it a blessing for both ""new"" & ""well versed"" Christians. It covers the first five books of the OT, from Creation through Joseph being sold into slavery by his brothers. In my opinion, this is one of the best Biblical movies available and I highly recommend it.",1397865600,,389,4.416666666666667

1395326,4,B000055YVV,"This is an excellent presentation of a major part of Old Testament Bible history. I am a pastor, and I highly recommend it. It is not entirely accurate. An example would be the omission of the pillar of fire that God put in place to keep the Egyptian army at bay while the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea. I don't know why that was left out. The rest of the event was done so well! Other such inaccuracies are keeping me from giving it 5 stars. As good as this one is, I really wish I could! If you have enjoyed ""The Ten Commandments"", you will find this one to be a bit more engaging, and actually a better made movie. I loved it! If only they had made just a little more effort at accuracy in certain key points. Even still, I wouldn't pass it up!",1375488000,4,745,4.074829931972789

1395332,3,B000055YVV,In the Beginning is a biblical two part film made for Television that spans the books of Genesis and Exodus. The production value is great and the special effects are quite good being a film made for television. Martin Landau is great in the role of Abraham. Here the positive praise ends however. Much of the biblical stories have been changed and some changed beyond recognition. Some of the acting is a bit over the top and the last 30 minutes delve into kitsch more then telling a compelling biblical story. An uneven film that gets a 3 out of 5. 3/5.,1347062400,,555,4.450980392156863
1395337,5,B000055YVV,"We really enjoyed this movie. It would be good in future production to add subtitles for All regions.  I liked all the actors from Martin landau to Jacqueline Bisset and so on.
The story moves very quickly from Creation through the beginnings of the Nation of Israel..funny how Noah and the Flood got left out.
Good acting I thought for what was offered. Fairly accurate, scripturally; however, as I said, the Great Flood got missed.
Suitable for all the family, not much violence and no seeminess, or licentious, scenes.
 I agree with another reviewer about the chatter between Moses and Jethro.

1395339,4,B000055YVV,The video is fine but is misleading since it does not start from the begining and only start with the story of Abraham rather than the creation and the flood of Noe,1308182400,,164,4.15625

1395342,5,B000055YVV,"A well done treatment of the stories of the Old Testament.

1395346,5,B000055YVV,I saw this program on television and ordered it for use at church.  This is a very good tool to have.  It is also very well done.  We had been studying the book of Genesis in our youth bible study and we used this movie to visually tie together everything that we'd learned.  The youth loved it.,1247097600,4,295,4.12280701754386
1395347,5,B000055YVV,"I just loved this movie!  I thought it was very beautifuly done from beginning to end. The actors were wonderful and the stories are very acurate and followed scripture very well.  I recommend this movie, especially if you find it difficult to read the stories yourself. You get a much better understanding of the chronological order of the old testament. (from creation to Moses, that is!) Susan from Texas.",1239062400,3,408,4.898550724637682
1395348,5,B000055YVV,"This is the best general Genesis movie I've seen. The scenes were vivid, the action paced well, the costumes done well and the dialogue was pretty good too.

It goes from the creation, being told by Abraham, to the Israelites entering the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt. The only story really missing in this movie was Noah's Ark, but that would have made this even longer, but I still wish it was included.

But this movie is very well done. The individual stories draw you into them and you really begin to care about the people they're about.

The second part of the film, which deals with the Exodus, is really compelling and the special effects aren't too bad for a made for TV movie.

This is definitely recommended for the family. It's really kid friendly.",1225238400,4,776,4.601449275362318
1395349,5,B000055YVV,"This movie was in part a supposition of the Bible in Human formation.  I believe and would like others to take notice actually understand what and why we were placed/created.

When I was growing up my Mother gave me a book called the Bible Story Book.  It had a child's summary of the great stories from the Bible in it.  This DVD gives you the same thing, but in movie fashion.  From Adam and Eve to Moses receiving the Ten Commandments.

1395351,4,B000055YVV,the movie is a summary of the bible's (old testament) greatest stories.

1395354,4,B000055YVV,"Originally a 4-hour miniseries for NBC, with a large international cast of well-known actors, this telling of parts of the first five books of the Bible is interesting, and on the whole flows well, though it crams a lot of story into one film, therefore skipping many major events.

It starts with Abraham, as he travels to the land of Canaan, in about 2000 B.C., and along the way he recites the narrative of the Creation (which has some nice visuals), the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, their temptation (the fruit here looks more like a small fig in a very thorny tree) and their expulsion from Eden.

There are some fine performances, among them Martin Landau as Abraham, Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, Bill Campbell as Moses, Amanda Donohoe as Potiphar's wife, and Fred Weller as Jacob. Eddie Cibrian as Joseph seems at first out of place, looking more like a modern day hunk, but he grows with the part, and has the most touching scene in the film, when he is reunited with his father Jacob. In the small part of Jethro, the great Alan Bates is marvelous. Other name actors include Diana Rigg (mature Rebeccah), Geraldine Chaplin (Yocheved), David Warner (Eliezer), and Christopher Lee is a theatrical, entertaining Ramses I.

At times there's quite a bit of license taken with scripture (for instance, there is some incredulous dialogue between Moses and Jethro after the parting of the sea, where Moses doesn't seem to have much faith in God), and similar to other TV Bible films, the parts that take place in Egypt are full of gaudy sets and costumes, as well as some characters who have an almost Alice Cooper look in the makeup department, especially Pharaoh's magician (Victor Spinetti).

Filmed in Morocco, with lovely cinematography and score, this one is certainly worth a rental if you like Bible epics.",1090713600,17,1815,4.789137380191693
1395355,5,B000055YVV,"I recommend this movie to anyone who desires to know more about the events that occurred in the Old Testament, this is a close as you'll get to the actually truth. I bought the VHS and was so pleased with the characters, costumes, location and scenes that I loaned the movie to friends and other family members. Well, somewhere along lending it out someone liked it so much never returned it to me. So, I purchased another one. I also own the Ten Commandments and it is a good movie as well, however, if you know the Bible, you will also know that Mose had no romantic relationship with an Egyptian princess. (this love triangle was added to the movie). All I say is if you want to know what really happened in biblical times, buy this movie. I'm sure after you've seen the movie it will build up your curiousity to read the bible. It's a keeper.",1078704000,14,846,4.360759493670886
