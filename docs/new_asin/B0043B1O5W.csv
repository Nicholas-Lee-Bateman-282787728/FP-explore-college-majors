Is a BIT predictable,  maybe the ending.  what movies aren't anymore.  not much surprises me.  But I found myself actually sitting thru the entire movie w/out losing focus.  Its hard for a movie to get me  & then keep me interested.  Especially when I hate allll bugs.  ;)

The movie is about people & how we r as a society as well as Mutated Bullet Ants trying to hitch a ride from Columbia to the U.S.

It has a story line, about 44 ppl on a plane that is unfested w/ Mutated Bullet Ants. Trying to keep it together amonst a group of totally different personalities w/ different outlooks on the out come.  As real as we are as individuals...

& When trying to make an emergency landing in Miami. We get a true dose of the polital realism we don't see or here about.  What truly could B going on behind closed doors.  And I found it made me think a little.  About wrong &  right choices.  What really is the right thing to do.  What would I do.???  Do I agree or disagree, as a person. Save 44 lives or 100's of lives.

I fully enjoyed this movie,,, as I do with most LMN movies.  All I can say.  Is...... It's only 88 minutes of u'r life.  You make u'r own decicion.  We have Alllll watched films much less worthy of our time.",1349222400,2,1434,4.057553956834532
