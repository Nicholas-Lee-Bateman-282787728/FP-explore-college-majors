Most of the people in these clips are unknown and for good reason. Stick to the classics.",1467590400,,246,5.024390243902439

First of all, if this is actually 3 hours, it's only because of the interviews with people who aren't funny.

Second of all, I never saw one bit of John Cleese in this DVD. And Benny Hill only had about 45 seconds - and it was taken out of context, which made it completely unfunny.

It's a lot of people you've never heard of even if you did follow British comedy (which I have from the early 70s.) The quality of the DVD and the content is not worth your time. Not worth anyone's time. I might give it to the worst of our prisoners as a punishment. But that might be called cruel and unusual.
