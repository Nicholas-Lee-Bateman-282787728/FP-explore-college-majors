4910639,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"Other reviewers couldn't have said it better, Budd Dwyer was a remarkable man, and truly the last honest politician. His story is a sad one. The song ""Hey man nice shot"" from 1995 by the band filter is what sparked my interest in Budd Dwyer. To me, the song is saying good job man you did the one last thing any great man would do. (for his family)",1352246400,8,348,4.132352941176471
4910640,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"I had already seen the footage of Dwyer's suicide many times on the Internet, as well as hearing about it the day it happened from relatives who lived in Western PA and called my husband up at work to tell him what they'd just seen on live TV.  I thought it was just another sad case of a politician who'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar and couldn't deal with the shameful aftermath.  What a shock to find out that there is a very, very strong case that he was wrongly convicted and innocent all along.  That just makes the whole thing more poignant, as does the fact that his killing himself was the only way he could preserve some financial security for his wife and two children.

Initially I thought this documentary would be biased in Dwyer's favor because his family was involved, but it gained, not lost, credibility the longer it went on.  Dwyer was, unfortunately, a country bumpkin who believed in honesty, truth, justice and America.  Unfortunately when those people run up against the realities of the political and justice system they often get eaten alive, as this man did.  It's pathetic that Dick Thornburgh, whose misuse of state funds appears to have been the driving force behind Dwyer's prosecution (or should I say persecution?), went on to high office.  I don't know how he sleeps at night but that's the kind of guy who sadly gets ahead in politics, while the honest men get trampled underfoot more often than not.  RIP Budd Dwyer.",1342915200,43,1467,4.611538461538461
4910641,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"I was in the category of those who had no idea why he did it, but I had seen R. Budd Dwyer's suicide in the Faces of Death videos (before the internet) and later, on the internet, where video of that type of thing spreads like a virus. I had heard that Filter's ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" was about this incident, but the lyrics don't really say anything... so when I saw this video being promoted (legally) on BitTorrent (the paid DVD contains all kinds of extras, supposedly including an actual Budd Dwyer Campaign sticker and a copy of his final press conference speech, including the last paragraph that he never got the chance to read), I had to watch it.

A lot of people out there with minimal knowledge of this event might think a dead politician is something to be celebrated, especially if he was found guilty of corruption, but R. Budd Dwyer was an honest man, an innocent man, and this is what paradoxically put him in the cross-hairs of corrupt politicians, prosecutors, investigators and a ""party judge"" who wanted to crucify him because he didn't tolerate abuses of power during his time as State Treasurer.

He planned his suicide in part to protect the financial well-being of his family, as he was going to lose his hard-earned pension (from earlier work in education, not politics) as a result of his persecution... but he also had hoped that his suicide would shine a light on the state of the ""justice"" system in America, how the whole process has been corrupted and perverted to the point that if you rub a powerful politician the wrong way, you can be completely innocent of any crime and still be found guilty.

The message he tried to send in his final moments was all but lost in the gruesome suicide that followed, this movie and the accompanying materials resurrect that message: A call for reform, and a justice system that actually seeks justice for average citizens. Budd Dwyer WAS a modern-day Job; he is a martyr and a hero. Everybody should hear his story.",1339372800,28,1983,4.611898016997167

My husband didn't know about this story and, truth be told, I didn't really know the whole story, so I decided to watch this. It's really well done and tastefully handles the shooting. The film maker provided many opportunities for all involved to provide their points of view before, during, and after the shooting, and really gave a very well rounded story of a storied life and its tragic end on live tv.",1338249600,7,666,4.414634146341464
4910643,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"Very informative I was only 10 when this happened so I really didn't have much interest at that time but I'll never forget the graphic image left in my head that horrible day watching the news.but now that i'm older,i really wanted to know the details of that while situation, and this movie does that.",1331424000,9,302,4.509090909090909
4910644,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"This is an excellent film. I was in graduate school, studying Public Administration, when R. Budd Dwyer committed suicide. This film will go a long way towards telling Mr. Dwyer's story.

The facts are irrefutable:

1.) Mr. Dwyer did not accept any bribe.
2.) A witness, who had already been convicted of perjury, who later recanted his own testimony, and who had cut a deal with the state, is the testimony convicted Mr. Dwyer.
3.) Since this time, probably to prevent innocent people from being convicted when a criminal witness lies, a person accused of bribery will have to actually accept a bribe. (Again, Mr. Dwyer never accepted a bribe; According to the key prosecution witness, he said ""Okay. Let's take that money."" Again, later recanted. And, again, this witness who claimed this, was already a convicted perjure and had already cut a deal for himself when he had taken money.)
4.) Mr. Dwyer's love was so great for his family and children, that he didn't want them to suffer financially if he had lost his state retirement and he likely would have if he had to resign his office prior to his death. (Some may disagree with my statement ""his love so great..."" but I believe that he didn't want his family to suffer financially.)
5.) This film includes interviews with many, many people that knew Mr. Dwyer--including family, friends, colleagues, etc--and even if you think he guilt, evil, or whatever, the film is a terrific portrait of the man and the case.

Mr. Dwyer's desire was to help change the system and I can tell you that I've not stopped trying to fix the system! I've been involved in the Criminal Justice System since this time and now work as a college professor where I try to teach my students the importance of thinking for themselves. My desire is that Mr. Dwyer's death doesn't end his story and this movie does more than anything else to ensure that. I recommend purchasing the movie and helping independent film makers like James Dirschberger continue making such films. Thank you for the great film Mr. Dirschberger.",1327795200,65,2050,4.769014084507043
4910645,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"finally a well made documentary based on the life he lived and the honest man that he was. this documentary goes inside the mindS of those closest to him allowing the viewer to see a genuine side rarely understood in such detail. in addition, this documentary also goes into the injustice he was faced with during his time as treasurer. it allows us to see the corruption among politics that sadly have only gotten worse. however, it does not have a sad undertone. although we are aware that a man can do everything in his power to do good and yet still have a tragic outcome, Budd Dwyer is a martyr who should be remembered as a hero. the last honest man in politics who shows the world what happens when you trust in the system. not suicide but a sacrafice by the men who washed the blood from their shoes and learned nothing.",1326585600,25,828,4.383116883116883
4910646,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"For those who aren't 100% sure about just straight out buying this movie, let me tell you the tale: In the 1980s, a man in Pennsylvania named R. Budd Dwyer (the twice-elected State Treasurer at the time) got himself involved in a major bribery scandal, even though he was innocent... ish. Either way, on January 22nd, 1987, Budd killed himself on live TV.

Thats the short version. For the long version, the film you (Hopefully) are going to at LEAST rent, explores every single aspect of the case. There are some who claim he was innocent, some who said otherwise. The film is slightly biased, sure, but its for a good reason: The man's children and late wife are major parts of this film, plus the man who got him convicted 20+ years ago recants his own testimony.

But heres the big deal: The actual suicide, or what people really want to see in this movie. You will not be disappointed. They worked EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE of this event into the one scene, and it is PERFECT. They got the actual footage from the various stations that recorded the press conference, where he killed himself. They include the various pictures of him speaking, him waving the gun in the air, and the moments leading up to his death. But they blur out his face, where he shot himself. THERE IS NO GRAPHIC CONTENT OTHER THAN HIS BODY LYING THERE. It is absolutely horrifying to watch.

Everything about this movie is so close-to-perfect. The music is incredible, the editing is superb, the direction is great, the interviews are heartfelt; everything about it gives 110%. Nothing is ever truly perfect, and this movie is a bit flawed in that it is kind of biased, but its not Michael Moore-type bias. Its understandable bias (if that even makes sense...).

If you don't get this, get the DVD instead. It has A LOT of special features, like ALL of his political ads and speeches and interviews and such for when he was running for State Treasurer, extra interviews with his now grown up children, and even brand new footage of that speech he gave before killing himself in front of so many people. Then theres the usual stuff, commentary both by the director and by Budd's kids, Rob and Dyan Dwyer, and such. Also, the DVD comes with a real ""R. Budd Dwyer State Treasurer"" campaign sticker, and a final transcript of that speech he gave.

5/5. 10/10. 100/100. Honestly, there are not enough stars in the universe to rate this movie with. It is an incredible movie, and you NEED to see it now.",1326067200,10,2471,4.594104308390023
4910647,5,B005ZJ4UPW,Suicide is an absolute tragedy that leaves survivors devastated.  Period.  Arguments for Budd Dwyer's innocence (and I believe them) should be treated as a separate story.  Prayers go out to everyone in this documentary in such pain.,1506384000,,233,5.243243243243243

4910653,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"I have so many thoughts about this documentary but my anger overrides them. I'm angry that the corruption was allowed to fester and grow after Dwyer killed himself because one of the few innocent people in politics was killed by the corrupt. They may not have literally killed him (there's no denying he pulled the trigger) but they drove him to desperation. They took away everything from him -- most importantly, his reputation -- and he reacted in the only way that would allow his family to keep part of what he worked for his whole life. The only people I was more disgusted with besides the politicians were the press who stood their taking more pictures (how many do you need) and continuing to roll film even after being told to leave, and then tried to justify it. They are as disgusting and vile as politicians.

It is horrific to think the computer files and ramblings of a drunk mobster and his lying lawyer are all that is needed to convict a person. For me, the take away is to question everyone's motives. Who had the most to gain and who has the reputation of honesty? With those questions it is clear that, sadly, the corruption was allowed to tarnish the reputation of the honest man.",1499385600,3,1202,4.539170506912442

Smith admitted in this documentary and prior thereto that he lied at Dwyer's trial implicating Dwyer was guilty in the hopes of obtaining a plea deal.  In this documentary, he comes off as repentant.  However, it turns out that after this documentary was made he was convicted of arson and then convicted again for helping his son try to escape from jail while he was incarcerated there for murdering his wife.

As far as Mr. Dwyer, I don't pass judgment on anyone's decision to end their life.  I can't imagine the pain that his wife and children have endured and for them I send my prayers.",1488499200,19,754,4.548148148148148

I think Dwyer's reason for a public suicide was a heroic act to protect his family; he was not the kid on man to do such a thing for any other reason.

4910705,4,B005ZJ4UPW,"This is the sad story of R. Budd Dwyer, the former state treasurer of Pennsylvania who is best known for his infamous on-air suicide.  Although R. Budd Dwyer is known for the climatic ending of his life, few really knew the person he really was for the most part: An honest man.

Unfortunately, the same traits most people value (honestly, being a wholesome person) do not work in one's favor in certain professions, such as politics.  It's a messed up game that has lots of dirty tricks. If one isn't privy to those tricks, it is easy to be caught up in things that go against everything one values, even his or her life.  This came to the fore when the state of Pennsylvania withheld too much in FICA taxes for its employees, and Dwyer was approached to accept a bribe for the contract on behalf of a company headed by a mafia connect.

Although Dwyer was alleged to have participated in bribery, he never accepted the money.  In fact the only evidence that was produced was the testimony of his shady friends and a paper trail that really didn't say too much other than he was in talks of accepting the bribe.  Doesn't sound like much to go on, but for Budd Dwyer this was the end.

As the documentary shows, Budd Dwyer was too trusting, too believing, and cared too much about his family, his constituents, about the common good.  As he wasn't a dirty politician and being one never crossed his mind, it was easy for for others with less integrity to engage him in their own devious agendas without him grasping the severity of it.  It's not hard for crooks to find a Budd Dwyer to take the fall for their dirty work, but do I believe he was guilty? Compared to the biggest political crooks, no.  Was he completely innocent? Not as much as he or this documentary proclaimed.  Instead, he was a fallible human being who saw no way out of a hopeless situation.",1439510400,3,1862,4.444117647058824

 I want to thank the director for making this film. I first heard about Bob Dwyer from a video named ""pictures taken before death"".  That left me feeling a bit intrigued and so I searched for information on Mr. Dwyer's life and his demise. I got to see the unedited version of R. Budd Dwyer's last speech with the tragic ending. The fact that watching the picture of Mr. Dwyer in which he seems very disturbed and the video got me to research Mr. Dwyer and the C.T.A. case stands as testament of what Mr. Dwyer's plan was. In my opinion Mr. Dwyer plan was to have from America and the world from his time and future generations to look at this and question the ""flawed"" legal process that was used to convict him. I believe there was no hard evidence against him.  The supposed verbal bribe offer was not on record, there was no way to prove this happened. There simply wasn not a way for the prosecution to prove ""without doubt"" that he had accepted any bribe.  This case should be re-opened for investigation. Mr. Dwyer's name should be vindicated and honored.",1431648000,5,1085,4.459595959595959
4910707,4,B005ZJ4UPW,"A well-made documentary that stops just short of being truly compelling, Honest Man: The Life of R. Budd Dwyer still succeeds in its goals of humanizing a now-infamous man and making the case against his conviction.  Budd Dwyer etched his name in infamy when he committed suicide during a roomful of news cameras after being convicted -- wrongly, he always asserted -- of taking bribes in his capacity as Pennsylvania state treasurer.  James Dirschberger tackles the topic over twenty years later and uses interviews with Dwyer's family and colleagues, depicting Dwyer's life and of course the trial and other events that lead to his suicide.

Not everything in this works as well as Dirschberger wants it to.  That's not entirely his fault; it was a massive and confusing case, and following the events are a bit difficult.  But the interviews with Dwyer's children Robert and Dyan, as well as his wife Joanne, are engrossing and they help with the humanization aspect.  That's where the film finds the most of its success; while it seems too one-sided to bring the court of public opinion completely across the aisle on the conviction aspect, those who might have leaned that way anyway (myself included) are brought along effectively enough.  It's a solid documentary that is well-worth checking out.",1430697600,9,1303,5.032558139534884

This was a powerful film and I highly recommend it, Dwyer is a shining example of what can happen to a politician without friends in the right places...",1373414400,8,679,4.44
4910719,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"I was a 22-yr old young man (going on 23), when I, like millions of people
across the country, witnessed R. Budd Dwyer's dramatic & riveting final speech
at a televised press conference that he had called. During this time, a lot of dirty
politicians were being caught with their hands in the cookie jar, on every level
of government, and people were very jaded about it by then.
So, when this man committed suicide at the end of his speech,
and quite gruesomely I may add, many thought that he was just
another grimy politician who got caught, and rather than face his
comeuppance, decided to exit in grand shocking style!
A month or so later, the world had moved on to other news and events.
But that was before the internet.

As the years went on though, I would, every now and then,
for some reason, think of the politician who killed himself on national television.
I began to research the case on the internet, and like many, I have seen the uncensored
version of Dwyer's final press conference and suicide a few more times than I'd like to admit.
Just strange & morbid human curiosity I guess...though I never felt as though it were fodder
for snarky humor, as many in the later generations would.
I always thought it was very tragic.
That's the funny thing about truth, it kind of just calls out to us who are inclined to seek it out.
That's what made me immediately interested in purchasing the video on-demand version
of this documentary (for my kindle) when I found out about it.
I was very impressed by this film; the interviews with Dwyer's family and friends,
who all never waivered in their position that this man was nothing less than honorable
and totally innocent of all of the charges that were brought against him by his political enemies.
Instead of seeing it (his death) the way I did as young man, this documentary changed my whole
perception of it, and became even more of a tragedy to me.
I felt bad for taking on the thinking of the herd...as we so often do when we are young & dumb.
Dwyer didn't take the coward's way out....
He was an honest man, a good family man, and rare true blue politician from a by-gone era,
who actually wanted to help his fellowman, had served as an educator in his youth, and
really was an innovator to the office which he had served before his death.
He was a man who was broken, severely depressed, and had been raked over the coals.
To save the pensions that he had worked so hard for, to ensure his family's financial
security, and to, (in his head), shine the light on what had happened to him,
R. Budd Dwyer did what he did...for better or for worse.
Again, this documentary was well done, and it opened my mind and changed
my whole opinion and perception of the haunting events that lead to what happened
on national TV, 26 years ago.  And now, as saying goes....I KNOW.",1371254400,13,2832,4.454720616570327

4910721,5,B005ZJ4UPW,"R. Budd Dwyer's family members (sister, children, wife) and former co-workers, along with two authors who have written books about Dwyer, and other sources are interviewed in this riveting documentary.

Like many, I first heard about Budd Dwyer during a discussion of media ethics in college. Dwyer shot himself during a press conference and news stations aired varying portions of it, including the entire suicide and aftermath, live during a day and time that meant it was seen by children. Unfortunately, Dwyer's infamous press conference overwhelmingly became what he was remembered for as opposed to a discussion of what really drove him to shoot himself in a room full of reporters in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Fortunately, this documentary delves beneath the surface controversy, looking at a human being caught up in a controversy that was the antitheses of everything he seemed to stand for.

By many accounts, Dwyer was an extremely honest and affable human being who worked hard to establish a family and a career in politics. Dwyer's daughter talks about how her father never hired someone to mow the lawn, even though he could have, because he found that type of daily routine important. She even compares her family to ""the Cleavers."" Another account of Dwyer adds humor, noting that ""Budd"" loved to hand out nail files and matches with his name on them when he was campaigning.

And many of the citizens of Pennsylvania seemed to love Dwyer back. Unfortunately, as the documentary explains, the Pennsylvania governor (Thurnburg) wasn't one of them. When serving as state treasurer, Dwyer apparently offended the governor early on by refusing to foot the bill for the governor's personal expenses. The news media exacerbated the situation, according to the documentary, and what followed were accusations against Dwyer of taking a $300,000 bribe, and a court case involving a ""hanging"" judge, a naive jury and a complicated cast of characters, some of whom were so shady that -- if they were characters in fiction -- you'd have a hard time believing they could really exist.

The trial took a heavy emotional toll on Dwyer, who seemed to always firmly believe his innocence would be proven in a court of law. Then  came the infamous press conference...

This film is extremely important for a number of reasons:
1) It's yet another reminder that, when news reporters don't act responsibly, the result is a misinformed public and unfortunate victims,
2) It explores the way the justice system treated Dwyer and how much of what resulted had little to do with ""justice,""
3) It captures on film Dwyer's wife and some of her final public comments about a husband, whom she defended till her last breath. Props to the film's director for interviewing her and others whose voices might have been lost to history and speculation.
4) It's a reminder to explore the facts of a situation as opposed to getting caught up in the hype surrounding it.
5) It's a tribute to a man who made a huge difference in his service as state treasurer, saving the states thousands of dollars and updating an antiquated system.

I don't want to suggest that the film is one-sided because it isn't. The documentary is objective, as it should be, and I never felt manipulated as an audience member to come to one conclusion or the other. (That being said, you've probably determined by now that I believe Dwyer was innocent.)

I was also impressed by the ""balancing act"" that film does so well. To paraphrase Dwyer's daughter, there are memories of the ""Budd,"" the loving father and husband and there's the man who publicly took his life in front of witnesses--a controversial move, to say the least. The movie manages to balance both, even exploring the reaction (mostly fear for their own safety, it would seem, and the desire to capture on film all the gory details without regard for decorum) of reporters who were there in the room and Dwyer's friends when they heard the news, without losing sight of the family man who had taken his family out to dinner the night before.

I highly recommend this movie and hope, in the future, additional courageous looks at the truth follow from those behind this film.",1365292800,9,4197,4.9069111424541605

Could it happen today? Could it happen to you? Absolutely.  The documentary showed how government witnesses lied - and later (20+ years later) admitted they lied.  The gist of it was that Bud was charged with accepting bribes and ended up being convicted based upon hearsay - he was essentially framed.  He was convicted and faced a possible sentence of 55 years, a fine of $300,000, and the loss of two pensions.  Due to a quirk in ""the law"" he wouldn't lose the pensions until he was sentenced.  On January 22, 1987, Bud committed suicide on live television after once again proclaiming his innocence.  Through this incredible act of conviction Bud preserved his pensions for his wife and two young children.  I remember seeing this on television 25 years ago and, had I really even thought about it at the time, I would have assumed that he was guilty guilty guilty and this was just a ploy to keep his pensions for his family.  Well, true, it was a ploy to protect his family.  But it was also a stand that an honest man took to proclaim his innocence and to make a statement.
