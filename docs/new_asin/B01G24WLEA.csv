7753491,5,B01G24WLEA,I liked everything about this film. The story was very clever and the special effects were amazing. It's the perfect combination of comedy & horror.  I highly recommend it for a totally enjoyable escape.,1473984000,,203,4.970588235294118
7753492,4,B01G24WLEA," The Neon Dead takes me back to a time when film was not trying so hard to either win people over or be smarter than them. It takes me back to a time when the sole purpose of a film, was to entertain you. For you to sit back, put all your problems and worries to the side, and let a film take you on this escape. I understand in the age, when everyone's a critic and has a computer or device that gives them a voice, that people forget how to be entertained unless it involves negativity.  The Neon Dead is a clever and fun throwback to the 80s vhs days. The film opens with a girl named Allison. She gets a phone call from a potential job. She has an interview in the afternoon, and she is so excited. One problem though, she comes across a undead woman in the place she is at. This young girl decides to help her with this issue and turn her on to two paranormal investigators, who just so happen to work for a video store and play video games. Jake and Desmond decide to take the case and go help her with this issue. They soon find out, that this problem is not random and there are more undead people roaming around. This film has so much passion and geek written all over it. You can tell, the people behind the scenes are horror fans. This film has such an awkward sense of humor.

 It is not laugh out loud funny, it is smirk and ridiculous funny. The low budget of this film works very well. This film really showcases what I loved about the 80s campy horror films. When you could go to a video store on any given Tuesday, and find the shelves with new releases that were a lot like this film. The biggest downer for me, is that there are not enough video stores out there. This film on a video store wall, could start such a huge buzz for this film. I want to say this, Wild Eye Releasing put out good films. Sadly, most of the public do not know this. To find one of their films, you either have to be a reader of sites like this and some others. Be a youtube fanatic and seek out those reviews. People go online and cry about  no original horror,  why, another found footage film,  why another PG 13 horror film. Then, we get releases like this and they just go under the radar ignored. That is the biggest negative, I can say about this film. Is if it went under the radar and no one got to see it. This film should be the one doing  Ghostbusters grosses and that film being ignored and under the radar. My advice, if you read these reviews (and thank you for that) and you want to seek out good horror films, check out companies like a WIld Eye Releasing.  The Neon Dead is the best film not playing at the theaters this weekend. If you are looking for nostalgia, a fun horror film that both men and women can enjoy, this one has so much fun and geek joy, you will dig it.",1473379200,6,2786,4.097247706422018
7753493,4,B01G24WLEA,Pretty good. Was not expecting this one.,1476748800,,40,4.857142857142857
7753494,2,B01G24WLEA,"The grating music toward the end during the action scenes started to give me a headache. I liked the characters the story was weak the acting was lame. the effects were bad, all of which I could have pushed through but that god awful music.... It ruined a marginal film. I was shooting for at least three star review thought the story might turn around but I just could not hang.  I can never understand why the music or BACK ground music in some movies is played at a volume that is as high or higher then the voice track.  It is really bothersome when you have some actors that feel the need to almost whisper their lines at times to show some angst or some other emotional luggage of their character. But playing the same two high pitched guitar notes over and over rapidly like some kid with ADHD is something that drives me up a wall.",1476576000,2,839,4.30379746835443
7753495,5,B01G24WLEA,"Loved it, it's rare to find a movie with real heart, where you can tell that everyone involved is doing what they are doing because they WANT to, not just for a paycheck, but because it's what they enjoy doing.  People like this should be supported, truly loved this movie, it was great.",1476489600,,287,4.415094339622642
7753496,4,B01G24WLEA,"A very cute little movie.  The competent abilities of the three leads sells this, as the story line is a little old hat, some places are corny, but it's a good corny. Special effects are passable. The ""Mr. Sardonicus"" look to the evil creature looks good",1476230400,,254,4.521739130434782
7753497,2,B01G24WLEA,"While the special effects were of better quality than I was expecting.  The acting and pacing of this story made it hard to get through the first half.  I gave it the trusty 15 minute test (put a movie on, if it doesn't grab you in the first 15 - it's not worth your time) and it failed miserably.",1476230400,,297,4.016949152542373
7753498,4,B01G24WLEA,"I found this film purely by accident on Prime. First ya got to figure that anyone who supported the project thru indiegogo crowd funding is probably gonna be slapping 5 stars all over this thing. That said and if you take it for the small budget, home grown project it is it's really a halfway decent modern B movie. It's not really ""good""  by many standards I suppose but somehow I liked it ok anyhow. Much better characters than a lot of other modern indie films I've seen lately. Puts Rise of the Robots and Australiens to shame when it comes to story, writing and delivery. Nice balance of humor, romance and horror without ever getting too caught up in any one of those. A few really good lines too, ""Look alive everyone!"" Be prepared that the story is quite formula; no surprises or clever twists but maybe it's that simplicity that makes it work. Never felt like they were fooling themselves, believing that they were making something greater than they actually were. That is, it doesn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously.
It maybe went a bit longer than it needed to. Some scenes should have been shortened imo but at least it didn't drag too bad for too long. Of course what do I know, I don't make films (But if I did they'd have a Samurai).
Not too gory for older kids I wouldn't think but they do get about 3/4 thru and drop a couple 4 letter words if that matters to you. Kind of a shame since they avoided making a expletive laced movie (did have quite a few GDs though). The addition of an f bomb really seemed to serve no purpose and was not really in keeping with the overall tone. Not sure why they chose to do that. But at least they avoided what so many other scripts don't which is act like they were the first to discover these new words and that you can use them in every other sentence and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Those type of directors remind me of a Jr Higher at the mall. Um ya, we've heard it once or twice before... has kinda lost its impact. But I digress...
Anyhow, recommended if you like cheesy, low budget horror movies and aren't going to compare it to a major movie production. Perhaps a flick that Rifftrax will discover one day!",1475798400,,2197,4.3585365853658535
7753499,3,B01G24WLEA,A strange but unique low budgeted horror/comedy with lots of neon lights.,1475539200,,73,5.166666666666667
7753500,5,B01G24WLEA,"My hat is off to Torey Haas and the rest of the crew for making the best budget horror flick I've seen.  The acting, direction and story were top notch.  I would love to know what they spent on special effects.  The makeup had the feel of the afterlife in Beetlejuice.  The main monster may make Ray Harryhausen turn over in his grave.",1475452800,,335,4.26984126984127
7753501,5,B01G24WLEA,"I rarely review movies and usually I review them because I think they are bad.  I believed I was about to watch a bad film when I watched the Neon Dead but I was surprised to see that the movie was actually quite entertaining.  Neon Dead starts out a bit slow.  Allison, played by Marie Barker, is an unemployed college graduate living in a house she has inherited. One day, she discovers that she is not living alone but is sharing her house with an undead female skeleton who leaves behind a green slime (ala Ghost Busters).  A visiting girl scout looking for contributions informs Allison that there is pair called Desmond and Jake who have a ghost elimination business specializing in getting rid  of zombies and other psychic infestations.

Desmond (played by Greg Garrison), is a slacker video clerk (Ala the Brian Chancellor character in 1994;s Clerk).  Greg Garrison is quite the actor Brian O'Halloran is but he is charming enough to be likable.  Jake is played by D. Dylan Schettina.  Jakes' character is the best acted character in the film.

What surprised me most about the Neon Dead is how fast the pace went once the movie got going.  I watched the movie on a video projector that vividly recreated the colors.  The creature makeup and masks were very cleverly designed and the overall neon effect is a very creative low tech/low cost way to hide the ultra low budget of this film (estimated to be $17,000).

Having grown up in the 1960s, I am fully aware of the power of ""black lights"" to create stunning visuals.  Once the Neon Dead creatures come out at night, most of the rest of the movie is filmed with black lights.

The computer generated graphics are very reminiscent of 1980s special effects.  The overall effect is almost cartoonish.  I don't recall the movie having any real gore.  None of the blood or slime elements are very realistic.  They are more in line with Ghost Buster like yuckiness where the blood looks more like bright red paint and the other major element is green slime.

The final combat has Desmond taking on one of the Neon Dead with some swashbuckling sword action.  I was impressed how well choreographic this scene was.  The final combat was Desmond taking on a ""stop motion"" demon.  Seeing this stop motion action reminded me of the little known or remembered 1978 film Laserblast where the three finger stop motion creatures pilot a spaceship to earth.  The stop motion effects were very well integrated into the overall look of the film.

This is by no means a masterpiece.  It is simply a very highly creative and entertaining little flick that is fun to watch.  When the black lights come on, the pace picks up. The editing and look are much better than would be expected for such a low-cost effort.  The acting, while not really good,did not detract from the enjoyment.  The actors all all likable and gave what I would call earnest performances.",1474502400,4,2901,4.677865612648222
7753502,4,B01G24WLEA,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I rolled my eyes when I first read the title of this film.  I thought, Really?  THE NEON DEAD?  Weve gone from the living dead to walking dead, and now we have the neon dead?  I wasn't impressed.  But, since Im a sucker for a good low-budget horror jaunt, I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Wild Eye Releasing rarely steers me wrong, and I figured maybe I was judging a book by its title (I cant say judging a book by its cover here because the artwork for this DVD is wickedly cool).

Sure enough, I got way more than I bargained for with THE NEON DEAD.  Chocked full of quirky humor and admirable special effects, this is a film reminiscent of THE EVIL DEAD and DEAD ALIVE.  And while its not an excellent movie, its still a lot of fun to watch.

Im happy to report this film is better than I thought it would be.  Director Torey Haas has a lot of talent, it seems, and Im eager to see what he has in store for us next.

THE NEON DEAD is shot well and looks pretty good onscreen.  The production value appears high for a low-budget film, and the production team does a good job of utilizing their funds.

The acting is surprisingly very good.  Usually with low budget fare, the money is reserved for special effects and off-camera talent; not so here.  I cant speak to what the actors were paid, but they do a great job in their roles.  Marie Barker shines as the headstrong monster-infested damsel, Allison, while Greg Garrison and D. Dylan Schettina give believable performances as the goofball exterminators.

The special effects are nice and edgy.  I particularly like the use of black-lighting and digital effects to make the monsters neon bright.  My sole complaint about the effects is that some of the camera shots seem to fail in hiding the fact they are being shot in black-light.  I didn't like how evident that came across, as it sort of took me out of the film.

The story in THE NEON DEAD is pretty good, and I have to tip my hat to Haas again here; the story is original, but its execution overshadows the concept.  The resulting film is hokey but intense, a nice combination that reminded me of my first time watching ARMY OF DARKNESS.  I cant say THE NEON DEAD is as good as Sam Raimis work, but its a solid effort nonetheless.

THE NEON DEAD is schlocky fun, and I think horror comedy fans will enjoy it.  Dont go into it expecting to be amazed; just buckle in and enjoy the film for what it is.",1474502400,,2490,4.310344827586207
8762006,3,B01G24WLEA,"After encountering a hideous ghoul in her bathroom, Allison Hillstead (Marie Barker) calls in the professionals for assistance. Enter paranormal investigators / video store employees, Desmond (Greg Garrison) and Jake (Dylan Schettina), exterminators of the undead! Once on the premises, the two spook-hunters soon realize that the problem is far worse than originally thought. THE NEON DEAD (aka: INVASION OF THE UNDEAD) is a micro-budget horror / comedy that uses lots of bright, vivid color -paint and lighting- to create its otherworldly atmosphere. Considering the fact that its budget was in the low thousands, and not millions, the effects are mostly okay. While the acting is as clunky as some of the dialogue, there's still something endearing about the film. The final battle, using puppets and stop-motion, is fun to watch! Is TND the most amazing movie ever made? No. Is it made w/ gobs of gooey cheeeze? Yes, but, if the proper allowances are made, you just might be entertained...",1496620800,2,993,5.173913043478261
