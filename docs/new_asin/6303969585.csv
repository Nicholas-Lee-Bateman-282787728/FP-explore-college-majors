770094,4,6303969585,"I've read The Far Pavilions 5 times.  Anyone who has read this huge novel, knows that once is not enough.

In regards to the production of the movie:
Ben Cross as Ashok/Ashton - A+ - he was able to capture him very, very well
Omar Shariff as Koda Dad Khan - A+
Christopher Lee at Kaka-ji Rao - A+
Shayer Mehta - Jhoti - A+

Amy Irving as Anjuli - D- *Anjuli is a hard act to follow and I think that if Amy Irving read the book - either her interpretation was off OR the script OR directing went horribly bad.

Overall, it was as a very good attempt as one could hope for considering the depth and breadth of the book.  The visuals were great.  2 main characters were left out - Sarji & Dagobaz (which to me was a big bummer).  There was a lot of changes to adapt the story to the movie and it was not done in chronological order...some which were okay given the need to cram everything into a short mini-series.

I would have given this a 5 had they found a good Anjuli - again, that is a tall order but if they were going to go through all this work, they should have kept looking.  There was ZERO chemistry between Amy Irving and Ben Cross.

With that being said - GET IT!  It's worth the time and money.",1494288000,,1206,4.046413502109704

770096,3,6303969585,The first show of the season leaves a lot of information from the book out of the story. The book spends a lot of time in the main character's childhood .

770406,2,6303969585,"If you haven't read the book and if you are a fan of British Raj drama, then you may possibly enjoy this -- although the acting may get you down.  If, however, you HAVE read the book you will be mystified by this adaptation: major parts omitted, others changed around for no apparent reason, well-loved characters inserted into scenes where they had no business to be, etc.  The scenery is beautiful, the sets lavish, and several actors (Christopher Lee, Omar Sharif, Saaeed Jaffrey, Robert Hardy) were excellent -- I am still puzzled by the casting of 80-year-old Sir John Gielgud as the 39-year-old Major Louis Cavagnari, however!

Regarding the lead actors:

(1) Amy Irving: Oh my!  What a travesty of a performance!  I have not seen this actress in any other role but I will assume she can act, when given a part in which she is interested.  In this movie, however, she is totally miscast as an Indian princess and, using a monotone, pseudo-English accent, sounded languid and bored throughout.  I kept asking myself why on earth Irving had accepted a role which she so obviously disliked and to which she was so unsuited? (I will skip over the atrocious make-up job which has already been described in depth by other reviewers.)

(2) Ben Cross: a fairly creditable performance on the whole, particularly when he was playing the part of the soldier; however, there were a few scenes (when he was playing Irving's lover) which were horribly forced, over-acted and, well, plain embarrassing.  The lack of attraction between them is overwhelmingly obvious!  I'd be interested to know if either of them bothered to watch the finished result?  I hope not.  As the credits rolled, I couldn't help wondering if they ever spoke to each other again once the filming ended?

My advice is: read the original book -- it's very well written with exquisite and sympathetic descriptions of a long-ago chapter in British-Indian history.  Don't waste your time (or money) on this movie.",1439078400,2,1973,4.865269461077844

770839,4,6303969585,"British Raj & Indian Romance

I've enjoyed `The Far Pavilions' since its original release as a television miniseries almost 30 years ago. I'm intrigued by India, the British Raj and military history inherent, and the associative romantic storyline between Ash and Juli that serves as one of the central threads to the film overall.

I've always been of the opinion both Ben Cross and Amy Irving were miscast; yet curiously I hold that both portrayed their respective parts rather well. It's a form of cognitive dissonance I suppose. Supporting Cast were well-selected and seem have held their integrity over time. Locations and Sets range from quite good to superior.

As to quality of the DVD specifically, the audio hold its own most of the time but is diminished in volume and clarity here and there. The video is washed and grainy and often disappoints despite the splendor and obvious expense of so many scenes. Darker/Nighttime scenes have not held up well at all. I doubt there was any focused effort to clean up the film, which is indicative of lack of sufficient funding and possibly shortage of interest as well. Too bad, that.

I would love to see what a remake would look like but this version is still worth your investment and time. I'll allow Four Stars.

770900,4,6303969585,"Any attempt to take a book as big as The Far Pavilions and turn it into a 5-hour miniseries is bound to fall short at some point.  The acting is solid--Ben Cross quite good, Amy Irving as good as the script lets her be--but the miniseries overall reveals more of the weakness of the book than its strengths.  Irving's motivations are fatally weak (No, we can't just escape safely now; we have to help my vicious sister who starved me and planned to have me blinded), and even with Cross we are told about his internal conflicts rather than seeing them emerge.  But these are M.M. Kaye's weaknesses in the book as well.  What further limits this effort is the attempt to compact so much into such a short space, particularly the childhood scenes.  For dramatic pacing, the decision to reorder the two key events of the book (Anjuli's rescue and the Afghan mission) is quite correct.  The presentation of India itself, the real star of the book and movie, is sumptuous and rich, especially considering the limited budget of the miniseries.

Ash is raised by India natives after his parents die. Later he's educated in British society and returns an adult with half-caste stigma and emotions. He seeks his ""true self"" struggling with British prejudice against the India people he loves. Ash (Ben Cross-`Star Trek')  now part of the British army (Guards) eventually encounters Indian adoptive dad, Koda Dad (Omar Sharif-`Dr Zhivago'); childhood friends Anjuli (Amy Irving-`Yentl') & Zarin (Art Malik-`Upstairs Downstairs'); and bad Biju Ram (Saeed Jaffrey-`Gandhi'). It is really hard to call this a romance, even when Ash falls in love, because most of the film is his military adventures, not love. Regardless it is entertaining, compelling, and fast paced through 6 segments of the 5 hr total.

Toss in other cast like John Gielgud (`Brideshead R.' 'Six Centuries of Verse' `Under the Hammer' + tons); Christopher Lee (`Star Wars','Lord of the Rings'); Robert Hardy (`Little Dorrit' `Harry Potter' `Sense & Sensibility' `10th Kingdom' `Nancherrow' `All Creatures...+ a long great list); Rossano Brazzi (`South Pacific'); Ash's officer friend Wally (Benedict Taylor-`Barriers'); Rupert Everett (`Shrek 2-3'); Clive Francis (`Poldark' `Sense and Sensibility'); well, stellar.

The political and social lives of the British and India nationals are well presented. Religious difference is downplayed. Not rated but there is language issues and plenty of violent action. Guns, swords, knives, cannon, fists, tables, chairs, kicks, etc. all as weapons.

2-RETURN TO INDIA-part 2: Ash gets a desk after his stint in Afghanistan. Wally is Ash's only officer friend. Ash's assigned to escort 2 siblings, arranged brides. One is an old friend.
3-THE JOURNEY TO BHITHOR-part 1: Jhoti & Ash's enemy, Biju Ram, join the party to Bhithor. Jhoti is attacked. Ash & Anjuli rekindle-oops she's arranged to wed.

771060,2,6303969585,"BEWARE of film adaptations of great books!  There are a few exceptions.  For example, I enjoyed the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's, THE GOOD EARTH.  However, I'm not sure if I enjoyed the film version because it was a great movie, or if I enjoyed the film because it had been many, many years since I had read the novel.

The film, THE FAR PAVILIONS was a different matter entirely.  It was a grave disappointment ... in every way possible: the characters played by Ben Cross and Amy Irving were unconvincing; the cinematography failed to capture the shear grandeur of the era; and the host of other supporting characters in the film were [at best] shallow compared to those in M.M. Kaye's epic novel.  Worse, the film version could not possibly effect the nuances of tension caused by petty jealousies between members of the Hindu royal courts/kingdoms, or the centuries long clashes between rival ethnic groups in India and her princely states, and various tribes in Afghanistan.  Forgo the film and purchase the book.  You will not be disappointed.

I purchased M.M. Kaye's sprawling epic, THE FAR PAVILIONS two years ago from a library book sale.  I could not put it down.  Set in mid-nineteenth century British India, this was an excellent story about love, war, valor, and defeat.  The two main characters in Kaye's voluminous book [960+ pages], Ash [Ashton/Ashok] and the half-caste Hindu little girl Anjuli, who would become a Princess, is a magical tale of adventure, lavish settings, unscrupulous villains, hopeless battles, and trustworthy heroes. This magnificent novel keep me engrossed by Kaye's superb plots, and the romantic and heroic trysts of Ash and Anjuli.  But also, Kaye's descriptions of India in its heyday of glory during British rule is expertly spun with extravagant settings, majestic and lavish princely courts, castles, and kingdoms, which leaves the reader spellbound.

M.M. Kaye accomplished what few writers are able to achieve.  She told an exciting and adventurous story set in India, that you will long remember ... and re-read again and again.

771063,4,6303969585,"This is a miniseries par excellence, which although a slow drama, feels like events are rushing by.

What enthralls me most about this film is the way in which it illuminates the British rule in India in a different way that the regular official histories would have us believe. It certainly highlights the similarities between the British class system and the caste system within the Indian sub-continent. It is also a singular case of dispelling one myth perpetuated around the world, that India is a single homogenous country when indeed, it is a great mix of tribes, and peoples many of whom are at odds with each other and divided not the least by religion, class and custom.

The plot itself is very believable where a member of the Raj is brought up as an Indian and falls for a princess who is a half-caste. Certainly a good piece of artistic license there. The film spans great distances in space and some of the cinematograhy is excellent. One can only imagine what a remastering for Blu Ray release will uncover, a bit like cleaning off a 17th century masterpiece.

I was very impressed with the characters played by Art Malik and Saheed Jaffrey. Malik is superb in the part he plays and it is a shame that he has not achieved a greater degree of celebrity for his performances. The other notables in the cast including Christopher Lee who turns in his usual perfect pieces and Omar Sharif remind me of Lawrence of Arabia in the sense of cross-cultural communication between conquered and conqueror. If fact one of the legacies of the British Empire was the ability of each of the constituent countries to participate in a shared sense of community whatever the differences between them may have been. The living legacy of this was the Commonwealth which remains almost as global as the Empire was.

The Far Pavilions has stood the test of time very well. I personally prefer this to the Passage To India for a variety of reasons. Above all this is a love story, set against a gorgeous panorama of countryside and spectacle. Indeed it is a love story which raise many issues about the role of men and women and the ideogy of religion and civilised valuse. My only reservation is that the quality of photography is not matched by the DVD version.

By the way I have not read the book but it is my opinion that the two are distinct works of art and should not be compared diectly.",1237420800,3,2389,4.598591549295775

It is just possible to suspend disbelief in the elaborateness of the plot though the character of the leading man pales in quality compared to the lead women.

771126,3,6303969585,"When I first saw this adaptation for TV in the 1980s, I thought it was a fantastic recreation of M M Kaye's epic story of Anjuli and Ash which I had read some years previously.  However, having recently reread the book, and followed it up with this DVD, I have to admit that this time round it fell well short of my expectations.

My first gripe is that the story has been changed quite a lot, so that first quarter of the book, dealing with Ash's early life, is covered in the opening credits plus a couple of flashbacks.  Additionally, instead of keeping his background quiet, Ash now spouts off about it to virtually everyone he meets, which changes his character somewhat.  And thirdly, the book has the Afghan war as the final scene, whereas this film uses the rescue of Anjuli from Bithor.  Whilst I understand these changes are probably for the purposes of pace and dramatic effect, for me they spoilt my enjoyment of the film, since the gradual alienation of Ash from the British, Hindu and finally the Moslem communities is not fully explained, and the aftermath of Anjuli's rescue is glossed over as she and Ash ride off into the sunset.

The film is split up into a number of episodes, but after I'd watched the lengthy opening credits for the third time, I began to wish that, before converting it to DVD, it had been edited into a continuous whole.  I also felt rather let down by the casting of the film.  For my money, Ben Cross was just too short, and Amy Irving (Anjuli) looked as if her face had been covered in plaster of Paris, since her expression hardly ever changed.  The child actors were also a bit wooden.  However, the Indian cast were mostly fantastic, and the scenes of India, and particularly the bridal cortege, were great.  The latter, in particular, combined just the right amount of gaudy splendour with noise and chaos.

Overall I felt this wasn't a terrible adaptation of the book, just not as good as I remembered, though my view of it probably suffered because I had read the book again so recently.",1216166400,,2037,4.550684931506849

771129,3,6303969585,"Disappointing at best. It tries to be a visual feast of Indian culture and history at the turn of the 19th C in the height of the British Raj in India. But the colors are washed out, the what ought to be visual lavishness and opulence, dusty and tired, the sets and scenes basedly ruin this movie. The plot is the familiar one of star crossed pre-puberty friends who become lovers separated by enormous differences in time and culture. The subplots are war, the expansion of empire and the wasteful extravagance of the maharajis and other ruling classes of India. But no amount of good writing or excellent acting could have overcome the deficiencies of visual presentation.

And despite a stellar cast of actors, the acting wasn't up to excellent, but rather stuck pretty closely at the level level as the scenery, average at best, bottoming out in the dismal, despite the actor's abilities and the natural beauty of the countryside.

but one problem, above all the rest sticks in my mind. Amy Irving's makeup to portray her as a quarter caste (her mother was russian-indian) european and indian princess. I'm afraid that her makeup and skin tone darker make me constantly think of ""blackface"" and white people playing at being other races, other cultures, other people. Frankly it is irritating and a bit racist. There are lots of (and even were in the mid 1980's when the movie was made) talented and beautiful indian actresses who could have played the part to the hilt, without skin darkener. You are always conscious that it is Amy Irving, that she is Western, not Indian, that she is out of place, despite her enormous talent and most beautiful blue-gray eyes. She is a knockout in Crossing Delancey and mis casted as the princess here.

It would be interesting to see a good review of the movie from an Indian's viewpoint. Is the movie convincing? would she have leapt into his bed, risking loss of not just life but of family honor? would she really have made the transition from loving a 11 year old indian street waif to lusting after a British Raj military officer? i suspect that the movie coherence and continuity is in the minds of Western viewers, however not in the culture it proposes to portray.

In any case, it is a C+ movie, damaged beyond repair with the lousy scenery and upheld only by a plot and character development that probably doesn't really fit the time and place.",1192233600,4,2396,4.697619047619048

771134,4,6303969585,"This is a classic romance story, along the same lines as Dr. Zhivago.  Basically, you have two people who are in love.  But circumstances and events that are larger than they are keep them apart.  Ash and Anjeuli love one another, and yet, the choices they make keep them apart.  Not only their choices, but also the customs and traditions of the times continually stand in the way of them being together.

The romance is only given a short amount of screen time, however.  There is no shortage of action and adventure.  This is a period full of war and conflict after all.  The conflict between the British and the Emir of Afghanistan, as well as the political manipulations happening in the court of the Maharajah continually serve to spice up the plot.

Ash, played by a young Ben Cross, is an officer in the British army.  And Anjeuli, played by a young Amy Irving, is an Indian princess.  Ash was assigned to accompany the Princesses Anjeuli and Sushila to Bhitor.  The Princesses are to marry the ruler of Bhitor, and Ash has been assigned to command the escort party.  Ash and Anjeuli fall in love during the journey.  Anjeuli chooses to go through with the marriage and stays with her husband.  Meanwhile, Ash has been assigned to Afghanistan to help the British establish their presence in that part of the world.

Without spoiling the story for you any further, let me recommend this movie to you.  If you liked Dr. Zhivago, you will like this movie.  If you liked A Passage to India, you will love this movie.  I would also like to add that this is one of Amy Irving's best performance, in my opinion.  Ben Cross, Sir John Gielgud, and Omar Sharif make up the rest of the excellent cast.",1168128000,6,1698,4.541254125412541
771135,2,6303969585,I was quite bored throughout the movie. Amy Irving looks sickly and she has been made to look very ugly. The Kings and Princess' in those times in India enjoyed good clothes and good living. The dresses worn even by the royals are shown to be very cheap. The royal processions shown are shown to be worse than the poor tribals. The movie would be better to watch if it was directed by someone who understood Old Indian royal life. Overall a poor depiction of royal life in India.,1166832000,,479,4.393258426966292
771226,3,6303969585,"I may be in the minority here, but The Far Pavilions was just not that interesting to me (I have never read the book so I am solely commenting on the DVD). The story just lulled along, forcing viewers to watch many slow-paced battle scenes and little side plots; Anjuli and Ash, the ""star crossed lovers"", were hardly ever even together in the movie. It took me a while to get through the entire five hours.

I thought Ben Cross was perfect in his role as Ash, but there was severe miscasting in the role of Anjuli! Amy Irving is a good actress, but the producers should have cast someone more to the character's description. While I realize that Anjuli was of mixed blood (Russian, I believe), they should have cast an actress with at least SOME Indian in her. Irving looks as if her face was painted to make her complexion look darker and that hideous eyeliner...Basically, she stuck out like a sore thumb against the rest of the authentically Indian cast.

To end with, the picture quality was awful. I realize the movie was made in 1984, but my 1939 remastered DVD of Gone With the Wind looks ridiculously better. Viewers are not able to fully appreciate the lush visuals and location shots the movie has to offer. Also, the miniseries was initially divided into six episodes, but one cannot tell on this DVD where they begin and end. It is divided into a Part I and Part II, and Part I cuts off at an inappropriate point where it seems they are still talking. No bonus footage or extras. I suggest they come out with a new remastered version.",1149724800,14,1547,4.4822695035460995

Ash and Anjuli spent a portion of their childhood growing up together, until palace intrigues forced Ash and his Indian foster mother to flee. As a prepubescent youth, he is informed of his English heritage and sent to England for his education and Anglicization.

Returning to India many years later as a young man, Ash becomes a part of a British regiment called the Guides.

As a prepubescent youth, he is informed of his English heritage and sent to England for his education and Anglicization.
Returning to India many years later as a young man, Ash becomes a part of a British regiment called the Guides. He has some difficulties adjusting, as he is not an Englishman comfortable in his own skin, as he also feels Indian in many ways, a view that brings him conflict due to the way the native Indian population is viewed by the British. Meanwhile, Anjuli has continued living as a half caste Indian princess. She and Ash have not seen each other since he and his foster Indian mother fled, and she has no idea that Ash is not Indian, but British.
The film is an amazing cornucopia of adventure, derring do, and romance. It provides a tantalizing glimpse into colonial India. All of this, however, merely serves to propel the story towards the uniting of Ash and Anjuli, as the film is, first and foremost, a love story set against the romantic and lush backdrop of colonial India. When the paths of these star crossed lovers intersect, it is under a most unusual set of circumstances. It is a story that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. I, myself, was unable to tear myself away from the screen and was riveted for the full five hours that it took for this mesmerizing tale of adventure, love, and treachery to unfold.
With a star studded cast that includes the likes of Omar Shariff, Christopher Lee, Sir John Gielgud, and Rossano Brazzi, this is a film what will capture the viewer's imagination. I read and loved the novel upon which this film was based, and while it is not a faithful adaptation of that wonderful book, the film stands on its own considerable merits. It is meant to entertain and that it most certainly does. It is a thoroughly gripping tale of romance and adventure in colonial India.",1027728000,2,2352,4.575829383886256
771306,3,6303969585,"I approached this film with anticipation, for the book by M.M. Kaye, which I have yet to read, had such excellent reviews.  I would have to say this movie was extremely good and the scenery compelling.  The second half of the six-hour film seemed to move along better than the first half.  Most of the performances were very good, but I was let down by Amy Irving's performance in the leading romantic role.  Irving is an actress who is one of my favourites and I was disappointed because she seemed curiously lacking in animation.  The love scenes between her and Ash, which should have been breathtaking,  were short on passion. Ben Cross as Ash was quite good but he too could have been more lively in his role of a fiery and insubordinate soldier of the Raj torn by childhood ties with India.
Yet there were marvelous scenes, such as the caravan of the wedding party, and the suttee near the end of the film.  The battle scenes, especially in Afghanistan, were excellent.  The technical quality of the DVD I watched was top notch.  But the pace occasionally dragged.  There also seemed to be annoying gaps in motivation which may have been lost in the transition from novel to the screen.
I would like to give this film more stars, but for all the money that must have been spent in the production, the story should have had more drive.",1010275200,9,1340,4.545833333333333
771307,4,6303969585,"Based upon M. M. Kaye's best selling novel of the same name, this film is well acted and absorbing. It is a story set during the time of the British Raj in India.

This two disc DVD is somewhat limited in what it offers, however, in terms of features, which is limited to a scene index, some production notes, and a brief biography of M.M. Kaye. In terms of its quality, while the sound is good, the visuals are somewhat grainy at times and washed out looking. It is too bad that they decided to do the transfer from video to DVD on the cheap. In doing so, they did ""The Far Pavilions"" a disservice. Still, it is a DVD well worth having in one's collection, as the story is such a gripping tale.",1009670400,110,2824,4.505859375
771308,2,6303969585,"If you are looking for a movie with sumptuous landscapes and costumes, exotic locales and characters, and a highly romanticized story, this fits perfectly.  If you are looking for a movie with real meat to the story, this does not do so well.  Both Ben Cross and Amy Irving who play the protagonists do not appear to advantage in this film.  [For a better performance from Cross, try CHARIOTS OF FIRE, for that from Irving, try CROSSING DELANCEY].
This kind of movie also paints a distorted view of British India in this time period, romanticized but bearing as much resemblance either to 19th century India or modern India (and South Asia) as would ALADDIN (Disney version) to the Middle East ca 800 or today.  Part of the problem is that the film has cut so much of the beginning of the novel (actually, pretty much the first third ) away.  That leaves the viewer in limbo when Ashton Pelham-Martyn appears as a British officer with an Indian background.  What kind of background?  That is much better described (and far more believable) in the novel than in the film.
Of course, it is hard to compare novels and film adaptations.  On the other hand,  we do want the story within a film to make sense.  Given the complexities of the plot, what is left out gives us little understanding of why Anjuli's position is so bad, or for that matter, why Ashton's ""Indian"" background leaves him highly suspect among his fellow officers.  [Not to mention the fact that an important little sub-plot is almost totally excised].
If you have read the novel before watching the film, the story will make more sense.  On the other hand, if you are just looking for eye candy,  this film version is fine as it stands.
 For the record, if you want to read about 19th century Raj customs and stuff, read Kipling's KIM or anything else by him or watch THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING.  Paul Scott's THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN (TV series and book) and E.M Foster's A PASSAGE TO INDIA (film by David Lean and book) offer a much-better more nuanced and better-researched look at the last decades of the Raj (1920s to 1940s).  For stories set before 1857, I am not really sure there is anything that has been well-translated to the film medium.",1009324800,10,2212,4.5620253164556965
771309,4,6303969585,"I have not read the book THE FAR PAVILIONS and did not see the original film version--which was longer, apparently--however, I did find this DVD entertaining, colorful, and long enough (six hours). It sounds trite, but I suppose you might consider PAVILIONS a 'feast for the eye.""
PAVILIONS was partially shot the state of Jaipur in India and many of the buildings shown in various scenes date from the Mogul dynasty. In case you don't know, the Moguls reigned before the British came to India in the 1600s. I'm sure the buildings destroyed in the fighting scenes between Afghans and British and Indian soldiers were sets, but they too are quite good.
The shots of the marriage procession from Rawalpindi displays a cast of hundreds with plenty of livestock including gaily painted elephants. When one of the princesses says she's sick from riding in the royal litter mounted on the back of an elephant I can see why. The darn things bobble about like corks on a wind-swept pond. The marriage journey takes several days and includes Indian-style camping scenes that are both frightening and intriguing. I was sure someone was going to be stomped by one of those big elephant feet, but true to form the British soldier (Ashe) takes charge and gets the camp sqared away.
In spite of the fine cinematograpy, I can't give the DVD 5 stars. PAVILIONS is a fluffy action/romance tale not high art. Sorry if that sounds snobby, but JEWEL IN THE CROWN ruined me. That's the reason you should never read good literature--it ruins you for the ""good read' which I am sure PAVILION is. So, if you enjoyed the book you will probably love the DVD.
I found the plot incredibly predictable and thin. Ashe/Ashtok and Anjuli have far too much access to each other. In the 19th century, English women would not have ""run around the camp"" at night and they were much more liberated than Hindu women. The typical single female from the royal Hindu stock would have been guarded like a hawk, always accompanied by another woman, and never allowed to be alone with a man--let alone a member of the British Raj (and, social intercourse was verboten between the races). The ""excuses"" for the chance meetings between Ashe/Ashtok and Anjuli, including some on-screen intercourse of the more carnel sort, make for spicy entertainment, but lack verismilitude.
And, the character Anjuli is inconsistention. On the one hand she ignores social convention and becomes involved with the Raj, on the other hand, she supports her selfish, homicidal, half-sibling due either to her social training or to her 'honor' I am not sure which.
M.M. Kaye wrote her book after her former book agent Paul Scott had published his book JEWEL IN THE CROWN. Supposedly, Kaye herself was Anglo-Indian, and I assume PAVILIONS is somehow based on her own ancestral story as she was the descendent of British Raj and Hindu royalty.
When she wrote her book, Kaye had read JEWEL, which was published some ten years before PAVILIONS. Her book is supposed to be the ""reverse"" love story where the woman is the person of mixed race. I might have found this more plausible if the actress playing Anjuli had not been Amy Irving. If you don't know who Amy is, you'll probably enjoy the film more than I did, but unfortunately, I know she's a really fine Broadway actress whom I saw in CROSSING DELANCEY.
Actually, I would have preferred Selma Hayak in the role of Anjuli, and someone more Anglo than Ben Cross in the role of Ashe/Ashok--some one like Joseph Fiennes perhaps. Ben Cross  actually looks more Indian than Amy Irving (even with her skin dyed), which is disconcerting since he's supposed to be the ""daring"" Sahib who jeapardizes his British connections to be with the ""inferior"" Anjuli.
Most of the major characters meet a violent death. I won't say if Ashe and Anjuli are together in the end, but M.M. Kaye was undecided until the last moment as to whether they would be. (I know this from reading Scott's biography which includes some of her letters to him regarding PAVILIONS.)
If you enjoy action/romance tales, I recommend the film in spite of my criticism.  The only caveat I offer is that you might want to watch PAVILIONS before you see the JEWEL IN THE CROWN. JEWEL will ruin you. (Both were released in 1984 by the BBC.) JEWEL is the kind of film you keep thinking about maybe for the rest of your life.",989366400,52,4360,4.743083003952569
