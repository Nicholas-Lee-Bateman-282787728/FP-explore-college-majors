8582769,4,B00CKDO9I4,"The actress is amazing. I hope to see more of her in the future. Kudos to the director and filmmakers for their earnest attempt to create an authentic biopic on this amazing, uncanny and brilliant 'folklorista'. Hopefully the cult of Violeta Parra will go on for a long time to come. Her authenticity and complexity offers us a mirror into Latin America culture. This is depicted in this film. La Viola as they call her, was a force of nature possessing the sensitivity of a butterfly and the drive of a turbine. Violeta se fue a los Cielos could have used stronger editing and film color. It tends to drag on at times and meander somewhat. But if you are a fan of the woman who penned 'Gracias a la Vida'.in that very original prosaic style many of us have heard and reveled in, it will be worth adding to your library or curriculum on Latina feminists, leaders, women, folkloristas, gender studies...",1375228800,2,902,4.574074074074074
8582770,4,B00CKDO9I4,Violeta was a revelation. Elements of the film we liked because we considered a difficult task to do a  dramatized story look so real. Fully recommended. Thanks Amazon,1374883200,,167,4.964285714285714
8582771,5,B00CKDO9I4,"This movie helped me understand what went on with this talented and tenacious woman. She didn't just sit in a studio and write some songs. She had some lofty goals and went out to make sure they came to fruition. She wanted to play music, so she went out and found someone to teach her. Not to the music store on the corner, she walked the Andes! She wanted her art displayed in the Louvre, so she told them the importance and they displayed her wonderful tapestries in the Louvre. She sang about the people and the people loved it. She was a passionate woman who loved hard and lived hard. The loving hard, I'm sure, is what did her in. I think Francisca Gavilan did a fantastic job at acting and singing.",1368489600,,706,4.315789473684211
