7923301,4,B00004U0FR,"Being a huge fan of both Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese this is a great set to own. Plus, you get to have it on dvd,what more could you ask for?I managed to get a sneak peek at this set from a friend of mine and let me  tell you its worth every cent. The picture quality is ok but who really  cares its a documentary about Scorsese and Lee! The sound is average but  the real meat is of course the information about the making of their films,  and bios of their life. I really loved hearing about Goodfellas. This set  goes into much more detail then i thought it would. So, i really think that  if your a fan of these two guys then their shouldn't even be a thought in  your mind except to buy this great dvd. Its worth being in your collection.  Trust me, and before I go:""Are you talking at me.""(I just had to  do it,hee-hee).",961027200,4,828,4.061728395061729
