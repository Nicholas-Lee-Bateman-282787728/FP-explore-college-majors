7846603,5,6303442870,"Very funny VHS - wish we could have a DVD of it . The jokes he makes and stories he tells all involve relationships.  Relationships with others and with our significant other. It's mostly rated G but there are a few PG13 parts and it ends with a very close to R-rated snippet. So if you're watching with kids, you'll want to stop it before you get to the last ""story"". It's most enjoyed with your significant other or with friends, I think. It's really down to earth and true and the way he tells the stories are hilarious. Some parts are a little dated: he talks about having to memorize phone numbers, for example, it shows it came out just before everyone started carrying a cell phone. Very fun to go down memory lane, though.  A great video. Highly recommend you get a VCR so you can order and watch it.",1480982400,,808,4.309210526315789
