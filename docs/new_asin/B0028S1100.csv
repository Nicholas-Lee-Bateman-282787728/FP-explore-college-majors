3873926,5,B0028S1100,"I just spent the last 2 days doing my own version of a mini marathon watching Adam 12 - Season 3.  Shout Factory came through with another fine product.  There were no difficulties with watching the DVDs.  The picture was crisp and clean, colors were not faded and worn out.  The audio was also nicely done!  Great job!  I look forward to buying Season 4 whenever it becomes available.

This is my favorite series (other than Star Trek).",1250380800,11,437,4.5256410256410255
3873927,5,B0028S1100,"I got hooked on Adam-12 when Tv Land aired it a few years ago. It's one of the best done cop shows that has ever aired on television. It has a serious, straight forward look at life on the streets, but there is plenty of humor to give it a perfect balance. Dranget and Emergency also blended well. Jack Webb was in charge of all of the shows mentioned above. I can only hope that Shout Factory will release the rest of Adam-12 and then release the final three years of Dragnet. I am shocked that Dragnet did not sell well enough to continue releasing it. Anyway, buy the third season of Adam-12, you won't regret it.",1249862400,18,616,4.273504273504273

ALONG WITH THE ORIGIONAL BLACK AND WHITE DRAGNET SERIIES IN THE 1950'S, ALSO WITH THE COLOR ONES IN THE LATE 1960'S TOO.

3873974,4,B0028S1100,"Los Angeles: the 70s. Los Angeles police Officers Pete Malloy (Martin Milner) and Jim Reed (Kent McCord) are on patrol and the streets are a seemingly never-ending crimewave of arsonists, con artists, nude drunk drivers, loan sharks, drug busts, shootings, gangs, bombings.

It is all going down, and so are the crooks, courtesy of the City of Angels finest. Created by Jack Webb, ADAM-12 was a spin-off of the popular NBC-TV series DRAGNET and similarly portrayed incidents and situations that were based on real LAPD cases, except Officer Pete Malloy and his hotshot rookie partner(Jim Reed) were patrolmen as opposed to Sgt. Joe Friday(Jack Webb)and Det. Bill Gannon(Harry Morgan)being investigators.

The names may have changed, but the cars, badges and drama remained the same. This police drama aired for 7 years on NBC from 1968 to 1975. So strap in tight for a retro ride-along with Officers Malloy and Reed as they burn rubber patrolling the streets of L.A. in this 1970-71 Season of the police drama classic ADAM-12.

You also get to see these episodes complete & uncut & commercial-free without all those added commercials & deleted scenes you'd get when ADAM-12 and DRAGNET were shown in reruns on Cozi-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, TV Land, and Nickelodeon too.

BTW, Warner Bros.is releasing CHiPs- Season 3 on DVD March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1336,5.031674208144796

3873988,4,B0028S1100,"Not sure if the director changed? Writers changed? Jack Webb got too involved in this season??? But, the acting by main characters (especially Malloy) and the extras changed a lot and not for the better.  The acting is stiff in many episodes - the terminology used is beyond hokey at times - such as Beji yelling out Dadio (episode 3 The Purse snachter) - this is the late 60s Mr. Webb!!! It is obvious that the ""bad acting"" has to be the writers/directors/Jack Webb as many of the extras have appeared in other episodes, other seasons and were much better!
But there are a few episodes that are really good! My favorite is when Malloy realizes in roll call that his license has expired and Reed finally gets to drive! This is an excellent episode and by itself brings the 3 stars up to a 4.  Adam 12 is one of our FAVORITE series! Where is season 6&7???  I've watched them on Netflix, they have to be out there???

Reed starts the day with filing a report on being conned out of $300.00 by a door to door salesman who modifies a $30.00 check Reed gives him. Officer Ed Wells gives Reed a hard time about being too trusting which is further embellished when Reed buys a day old newspaper from a young boy. On the street they are faced with a fight by two men over a marijuana plant. It is followed by a woman running to a bank for a $1000 ransom for her young baby being held by a mentally unstable and armed man. Finally they are called to a home where a hysterical woman tells them a man in a light colored shirt shot at her. Reed and Wells catch a man fitting the description in the backyard but the man says he is innocent. Reed wants to see if the woman can identify him but Wells takes him to the station under arrest. After the woman calmed down she told Mally the man who shot at her was her drunk husband who shows up again threatening her and Reed. Wells is then faced with a chewing out by Sgt. MacDonald for making the false arrest giving Reed some revenge and smiles.

Jack Webb shows his true talent in putting his heart and soul into this series. If you like Dragnet you will loved Adam 12. The only problem is that they aren't being released fast enough. The sound and quality of this DVD series has been flawless.",1261699200,,491,4.3478260869565215

I gave this 4 starts because shipping was very slow. But the end product made up a litte for the 3 weeks it took to get to me.

Shout Factory has made me fall in love with a show that I was too young to watch at the time. Now, I can enjoy it's simpler time when cops were still hailed as heros. But the shows aren't during a ""simpler time"" as in corny. They're all very realistic and exciting. The guys, Pete Malloy and Jim Reed, are loveable, tough, caring, honest cops. And I just love the way officer Malloy can kick in a door!

This is the series that got me thinking about a career in law enforcement. Although fully knowing that each 30 minute episode had more calls than the usual 8 hour shift had, you sure got to have a solid glimpse of what it took to work the streets in the early 70's. Top notch with sticking to details, these actors seemed to not even miss the little nuances of being a cop during these times. You could really think they knew what they were doing. It is enjoyable television from a time when the writing was still fresh because of the relative newness of the industry. Seems like the shows of today have just dirtied up a story previously written. My only complaint is that Universal does not come out with these fast enough. The industry must realize that some of these collectors wanting these episodes for their library are going to pass away before they get them all out (think Gunsmoke). Anyway go Adam-12!",1257033600,,1069,5.22093023255814

It is always interesting to see the differences in the way things are done between then and now, and in one or two programs,there is also a commentary to some of the changes that were made.

Lots of fun in this set, particularly if you are nostalgic for late 60s/early 70s TV.
