4249677,5,B0042DN4Z4,"I was surprised to see weights used in this one with the title...I bought it to rotate for just pure cardio when my body was sore from weights.  But that's my fault for just reading the title rather than the explanation. No matter, I love all the Biggest Loser workouts and this one was no exception.

I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn and a digital display gives me a readout as to how much I burn during a workout in order to allow me to compare it to other workouts and also see how much it increases my metabolism after the workout since strength burns less than cardio during a workout but continues burning calories long after while also building muscle. I say that so you know caloric burn was based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion.

This, like most BL DVDs combines workout components that allow you to burn more calories in less time while not feeling like you are killing yourself doing it. Certain components burn greater calories such as using large muscle groups while also working out smaller ones,, card bursts that bring your heart rate up then allow it to drop again ( just as speeding up and slowing down your car uses more gas, than going one speed fast or slow the same distance, studies have shown your body does too) , and combining strength and cardio in the same workout. This does all that so your perceived exertion feels lower but it's a five star calorie burner due to a well thought- out scientific burn. But only if you combine two workouts...these are very short routines.

Bob is an exceptional trainer as always but this, like many others using the contestants, has some flaws.  First as with the other DVDs the contestants sometimes are doing the move differently than Bob instructs and you aren't sure if you heard him wrong or they did--until he corrects them on the last rep. I always wish they had practiced more when this occurs. I'll get to the routines led by the contestants in a minute...

Also while Bob leading a workout flows great with comfortable and motivational banter on camera, allowing the non-pro contestants to lead segments is quite awkward and, while it may be cheaper production-wise for The Biggest Loser, these segments feel the same (awkward) to the viewer in spite of a well-planned routine during them. it feels unprofessional and they look greatly uncomfortable.

The music is better than most DVDs without the boring electronically but, instead, an upbeat pop tempo. However, it often is very, very repetitive...the first few beats of the Biggest Loser theme over and over and over. Come on, soundtrack! Mix it up!

You can be at any level in using this DVD. You will be shown how to use beginner moves if needed until you are able to progress and you can start with very light weights and increase them as you build muscle.  Yes, you can be totally out of shape or a daily gym rat. You'll still get what you need from it by following the trainer or backup instructor showing alternate moves.

In the past and in this DVD I'm not much of a fan of them allowing the contestants to become the trainers. They aren't comfortable on camera, and while Bob ensures you are moving at all times as he instructs, they sometimes forget this so you are sitting there listening as to what you are to do next as your heart rate drops. Their ""you are doing great"" props to other contestants sounds insincere, especially because they sometimes say it without having even looked at the form of the person they are saying it to...yes, I'm sure they noted that works well when Bob does it but it's also obvious he doesn't say it just to fill in space as it feels like here. Let's face it, yes, it's less expensive for the Biggest Loser to have non-professional trainers train us on the majority of the DVD but I'm sad they continue to do this...buyers continue to complain about how awkward it feels and they are using contestants who clearly gained a good deal of their weight back...Bob is the main figure on the cover of the DVD...he should also be the main trainer herein--the contestants also forget common safety instructions like not allowing your knees to go past your toes in squats that all other trainers say and explanations are not always clear and they interrupt each other trying to say how to do it...it's just uncomfortable and not nearly as professional, but let's face it, the routines are short so combining theirs with Bob's is fine for me.

Bottom line, this DVD works in burning calories but you'll need to combine 2 segments to get a proper burn as they are short. While it may still contain the usual Biggest Loser production errors now that they are allowing the contestants to lead segments and because they sometimes lose form, Bob still explains how to do everything perfectly and clearly not only for safety but for best results as well. For that, it should be a great DVD to add to anyone's rotation.",1294876800,14,4921,4.618993135011442

The first, 25 minute section had a good variety of moves and got my heart rate up.  It was fun to do and I wasn't waiting for it to end.  However, I hated the second section.  My heart rate really didn't get up and I can't stand the banter between Tara and Sione along with their poor cueing. This part reminded me of the 30 Day Jumpstart video, which I didn't care for. While I did like the third section, it wasn't what I consider heart pumping cardio.  Most of it is on the ground in push up position doing various moves.  Warm up and cool down are both good.",1291766400,34,719,4.129496402877698
4249680,4,B0042DN4Z4,"Firstly if you are serious about taking that weight off and keeping it off, a life style change will be necessary. You will need to monitor your weight on a continuous basis, and change some of your eating habits. In order to make this task easy, I recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biggest-Loser-2011-Wall-Calendar/dp/B003YP9VQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biggest Loser 2011 Wall Calendar</a>

This DVD is designed for the beginner as well as the exercise veteran. For beginners the exercise routine builds up in 2-week stages, over a six week period, however, even if you are accustomed to a heavy workout, it is recommended that you still go through this build up period. This will give your body sufficient time to adjust and avoid any over-work complications.

This program is designed to make you sweat and sweat, so be prepared. But more than this it will also increase your endurance levels, also because there is the use of weights our body strength will also improve.

This is a good concept, so as the fat comes off, muscle mass is increased, hence your muscle index will improve. You will find that with time you will feel more energetic and less lethargic.

Get also a good set of hand weights, so that with time you can increase the amount of weight that you heft during the routines.",1291161600,15,1358,5.215596330275229
4249681,5,B0042DN4Z4,"Biggest Loser Cardio Max Weight-Loss is a fat burning, strength, and cardio workout that will get your heart rate pumping and shed pounds!  You can use weights, or do no weights as a beginner modification.  I recommend starting with a low weight like 3-5 lbs until you are familiar with the workout.  It looks like everyone in the workout uses 5 lbs, except Lisa is not using weights.  Watch Lisa in purple tank top for beginner modifications.

 The main menu contains 4 sections: Workouts, Maximum Results Program, Trailers and Credits.  When you select Workouts, you can choose an individual section or play all. The sections are Warm Up, Cardio Max Weight-Loss Level 1, High-Intensity Cardio Level 2, High-Intensity Cardio Level 3, Cooldown.  The Maximum Results Program has workouts for weeks 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and Maintenance.  They recommend Warm Up, Level 1, and Cooldown for weeks 1-2, Warm Up, Levels 1 & 2, and Cooldown for weeks 3-4, and Warm Up, Levels 1, 2 & 3 Cooldown for weeks 5-6, and for maintenance they recommend doing the full workout 3 times per week.

 Former contestants from the Biggest Loser TV lead the warm-up.  Some sample moves are squats, jogging in place with high knees or butt-kicks, knee up/opens, alternating lunge and twist towards knee, and Frankenstein touches.

Cardio Max Weight-Loss Level 1 (25 min)

 Bob Harper leads Level 1.  The workout is designed in short combinations.  You do several combinations on one side before you switch to the other.

Once that side is done, go back to straight arm push up position.  Jump feet in and out.  Stop, and then go into downward dog.  Walk your hands up  to legs and stand up.  Position legs shoulder width apart.  On one side do cresent kick into squat.  Next, on same side do sidekick into squat.  Jump rope.  Switch sides.  Jump rope while moving legs forward and back.

Cooldown (5 min)

 Former contestants from the Biggest Loser TV lead.  The cooldown has typical moves like inner thigh, quad, calf, hamstring, triceps, and arm stretches.

 I have never done the first Cardio Max workout, so don't know how it compares to this one.  Bob Harper's In and Out Method DVDs are similar to this one.  I was a little disappointed that there was not more cardio, but overall I like the DVD.  I already have many workouts that combine weights and cardio, but I think this is still a good addition to my collection.

To say the least, the warmups were so difficult alone caused me to sit and watch and try to catch my breath. And please believe me I tried to keep up, but those folks are professionals, not regular folks...don't believe the info commericals.

Ahhh, but this tape is for real people!  If you have not worked out in a while and need a starting point, than a mid-level. this tape has both.  You will have real people with real challenges working out at a pace that you can get to in a couple of rounds.  I say couple of rounds because I think everyone should watch and get a general idea of the moves.

Bob is encouraging and you do what you can, stop for a few seconds and then join back in.  I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who is willing to get off the sofa and try.  In addition, these folks are not a bunch of beachbody actors who have spent their life in a gym or born with good genes (nothing wrong with being either, but I appreciate the truth)  they are folks trying to get healthy and make the best of what they have been given....AND I'M ON THE SAME PATH!!!

4249751,2,B0042DN4Z4,"I like Bob as a trainer better than Jillian. He actually comes off as being a nice person, while Jillian is just yelling and trying to be ""tough"" on you - a strategy that doesn't motivate me because I am already motivated. I do find that Bob's workouts tend to be better about using lower body more while doing other exercises, which I like. Also, he spends more time on each exercise, which I wish Jillian would do, because I find she doesn't really fatigue one muscle group by sticking to an exercise for longer.

I feel mixed about this workout. I really only liked the first section with Bob, and it would serve as a good workout if your time was limited and you wanted something quick. The second section with the two contestants was not very intense, and I thought it was a waste of time for me. The third section, you spend almost the entire time in push up or down dog position, which is very very hard on the wrists and I could not continue. I am an intermediate exerciser and about 5lbs overweight. I am not likely to add this one to my rotation unless I'm using it just as a quick workout, but then again I have many others that will accomplish the same things.

Other people have said this: Bob's cueing is terrible. He sometimes counts up and sometimes down. He stops counting and then begins again on the wrong number. He has a different number of reps for each side. He does not mirror his audience, which all good instructors do, instead he actually uses left and right properly referring to himself but not his participants. Jillian is much better, although she often doesn't give much instruction on her exercises and leaves too big a break between them.

I have the Biggest Loser Bootcamp and I like it better. It's more intense and longer, without all the plank position stuff that I find too hard on the wrists.",1365033600,,1832,4.446428571428571

4249783,5,B0042DN4Z4,"I purchased this in October looking for a more intense workout then just walking on the treadmill. Well boy did I get it. I've been overweight all my life. I dropped a few pounds since last January but was at a stand still since July. So I thought this workout would help. I lost more weight and after doing this work out for about 8 weeks I got more comments on my weight loss then I did all year! It has helped tone me up and I just plain feel good. I work on my feet at work all day and it's helped me there, too! Definately healthier, stronger and thinner! I would highly recommend. I'm proud to say I have a ""body by Bob""! :)",1357171200,,630,4.007936507936508

4249785,2,B0042DN4Z4,"The overall workout probably isn't that bad. The problem is that the exercises are not led by fitness professionals, nor are the people demonstrating them.  The instructions are not always clear, and when you watch the people, they are often doing different things with varried positions and timing, so they seem confused themselves. I understand the idea of using people who have lost weight as inspiration, but I would rather be guided by someone who can do and teach the exercises properly.",1354752000,,493,5.012195121951219

I browsed around for a good prenatal workout but I couldn't find anything with the desired level of intensity...i'm pregnant but I still want to feel as though I'm getting a challenging workout. This dvd really fit the bill for me. I've just began using it so I've only done Bob's segment...it left me in a pool of sweat, but the modifications allowed me to perform all the moves in a low impact manner that was appropriate for my pregnant state. Definitely looking forward to level 2 as a part of my postpartum routine!",1346976000,,670,4.545454545454546

4249789,5,B0042DN4Z4,"I read some reviews that said it was NOT for beginners or people who are very overweight. However, i am 130 pounds over weight, have a disc injury, and am not in shape at all, and i was able to do the beginners version of the 1st cardio segment. There is a gal in the back that does everything Bob has the other people doing, but at a less intense level. This is a great video! These people are NOT trained instructors but average everyday chubby people doing these exercises! I love that! Usually there are fit and active instructors that have been doing the moves for years, and act like you should be able to do them as well as they are. Not here. They even mess up moves in the video, and that made me feel human, and it made me feel like I CAN do this. Start out slow, 2-3 days a week, and alternate walking. You CAN do this, and if you have any excuse why you can't then you really don't want it. I felt exhilarated afterwards! I did the warm up, 1st segment, and cool down. I know i will not be ready to do the others until i feel good doing these ones. Maybe 3 weeks. I know not to push too hard or i will hurt myself and want to give up.

This DVD is the first one I tried in the past 12 months, I just got it today in fact. I went through all of the 60 minutes and I barely felt a little bit of sweat and my heart rate only went up during the jumping jacks but not enough to be considered cardio target heart rate. I am not trying to advertise the cellerciser here (in fact I wish I had a bellicon) but I feel like I wasted precious 60 minutes that I could have spent on my cellerciser instead.
I am 5'7"", 32 year old female, current weight 158, down from 183 using only the cellerciser.

4249795,4,B0042DN4Z4,This wasn't the type of cardio work out I was expecting because many times my feet were stationary but boy did I sweat and feel it the next day.  As to be expected the sessions led by Bob were far better than the others.  He didn't have the same easy rapport with these cast members as he has on other dvds but that isn't why I use this.  These sessions will help lose weight and tone.  Most excellent!,1308441600,,402,4.115384615384615
4249796,5,B0042DN4Z4,"I'm surprised this workout doesn't have more reviews!  It's pretty great.

If you're not a beginner, all three levels have to be done to get a satisfying workout.  Each level alone isn't enough.  This workout has a lot of variety and goes by very fast, and I think it's comparable to a Jillian workout.  I also love Bob on the Biggest Loser workouts because he's not as crazy as he is on his own dvds.  The reps are reasonable and Bob is very encouraging.

The first level is led by Bob and is 25 min long.  This level is very quad intensive, and you are doing squats about 80% of the time.  It has some great cardio bursts that really get your heart pumping, and there's also an intense push up series towards the end that is pretty exhausting.

The second level is led by Tara and Sione and is 10 min long.  This level is more old-school cardio.  They quickly switch from exercise to exercise and maintain your heart rate.  I didn't feel that this section had any intense bursts, which was disappointing, but this level still kept me sweaty.  I did admire how Tara and Sione do the workout with you, and I thought they were pretty entertaining.  I didn't mind the banter between them.

The third level is back to Bob and is 10 min long.  Bob has you doing weights and cardio bursts again for the first half, and then switches to an awesome plank series for the second half that left a pool of sweat on my yoga mat.

This workout will leave you crazy sweaty, wondering what you even did to get such a good workout.",1301529600,,1515,4.3120567375886525
4249797,5,B0042DN4Z4,Just got this DVD which was quick I may add! Looking for something to join my library so I can challenge myself as I am on a Journey to Perfect Health. The Workout Routines definitely work some muscles that I haven't used in a while. I thought Jillian was a challenge. Bob Harper is the MAN! Like the idea of using the Biggest Loser Contestants as the participants. This DVD will stay in my rotation.,1301011200,,400,4.346666666666667
4249798,4,B0042DN4Z4,I usually do Tony Horton so I wanted to branch out and see how Bob is. He does not disappoint! You need a fairly big area to work out though. I like the ability to choose which workouts to add-what a cool feature! Bob keeps you moving! I am not looking to lose a lot of weight I just work out to be healthy so I alternate this with other videos.,1298246400,4,345,3.8732394366197185
