2113077,3,B0002PUGUM,"When I lived in the Canadian Rockies, one mile from the Continental Divide, I didn't have far to drive to see huge cuts in the trees of the mountains where an avalanche had come crashing down the mountains.  Although some of this movie is obviously special effects, it does give a good idea of the power of a large avalanche.  The main reason to watch this movie, especially for children or teens who ski, is not to frighten them, but to give them time to think of what they could or should do if they find themselves in an avalanche.  The is also about a seventeen year old girl who is trapped with her stepmother in the rubble.  Because it is a TV movie, some of the plot line are a bit trite, but the movie does keep your interest, and there is no bad language at all.",1170374400,13,771,4.1891891891891895

2113079,4,B0002PUGUM,I like really unrealistic disaster movies.  This one is because of man's greed so not one of my favorites.  I no longer look for realism which in this genre is a good thing.  Not a bad story.,1408233600,,191,4.108108108108108

2113081,5,B0002PUGUM,"Family drama rates five stars. There's pulse pounding action, relationship problems, greed, and heros.
This movie arrived today, I inserted it and off I was at a ski resort.  The special effects are good, the drama about power, money and compassion plentiful.  The impact on me, anger at the callousness of the mountain ski manager, it is a descent 96 mins of your time.
The important element of any film is the story and how well the characters are defined, this story is human drama and that is a tough nut to crack at times, For me alone, I think they got it right.",1391731200,,568,4.451923076923077
