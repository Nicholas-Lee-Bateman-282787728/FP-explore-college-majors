As the other reviewer mentioned, the English subs are good.  I've enjoyed other dramas based on Miyabe's books -- Nameless Poison (features same protagonist as Peter), Perfect Blue, Kogure Photo Studio -- but this one is definitely my favorite.",1454630400,,392,4.735294117647059
8694294,5,B00R6O2WPE,"I was so glad this was available on dvd since I couldn't find it subbed anywhere else and I'm thrilled to say the English subs aren't just good, but great!  The writer is just so gifted, this is the second film from author Miyabe Miyuki and is one of the best Jdramas we've seen yet and that is saying a lot since Japan produces some top not dramas, especially  mysteries.  Highly recommend this intelligent entertainment",1446422400,2,421,4.586666666666667
