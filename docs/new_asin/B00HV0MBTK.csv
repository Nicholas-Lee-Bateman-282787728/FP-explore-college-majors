6228699,5,B00HV0MBTK,"I love the short blonde support-role doctor, but I hate that dark-haired one bc the dark haired one was so  stupid that he was horribly unbelievable as a doctor. How many times did he call the highly known pathologist a ""broad""?  Who does that in the professional world?  No one.  He would have been thrown out of every training facility in the United States.  Why couldn't that respectful lovable and good-looking actor stay in that role???  Did you want a minority so badly that they had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for the stupidest one available?",1459641600,,557,4.63265306122449

8636208,5,B00HV0MBTK,"One of my favorite shows if you like solving mysteries this would be a good one to watch, I like a lot of the older movies they tend to be more clean without a lot of profanity and all the extra stuff that's in tv shows today",1480723200,,225,3.8085106382978724
8636209,3,B00HV0MBTK,"The the reason for 3stars is  1 or 2 DVDs freeze up and even cleaning cannot fix it. The pixels start up and you cannot see the end. I have had it with them. I guess I can't send them back. I have bought 1-4 seasons and and just can't afford it any more.
