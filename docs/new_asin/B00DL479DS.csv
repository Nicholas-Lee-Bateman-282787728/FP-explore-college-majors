5825712,1,B00DL479DS,"I was so excited about this movie because of the two main stars that were cast in it, however, I am sorry to say that this was one of the top two worst movies that I have ever seen.  I am shocked that either of these two talented actresses agreed to take part in it.  I could've written this screenplay, and that is not saying much. Poorly acted, poorly directed.  I kept waiting for something profound to happen, and it never did!  Don't rent this.  It is not worth the money!!!",1375747200,8,479,4.21978021978022
5825713,1,B00DL479DS,"Skip this and watch the original French film, Crime D'amour"" (Love Crime) with the always amazing Kristin Scott Thomas in the role of Christine.  This was horrible.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Crime-English-Subtitled/dp/B006OQDIOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Crime (English Subtitled)</a>",1375660800,7,338,9.242424242424242
5825714,3,B00DL479DS,"First, if you haven't seen the original film, 2010's 'Love Crime', I highly recommend it - it was far superior to this remake. That's surprising when you consider the genius talent involved, such as Brian DePalma and Noomi Rapace. If you are watching this film for the purposes of seeing a hot scene between McAdams and Rapace, it isn't going to deliver (the trailer seems to be pushing for that, so don't expect it). This film overall was very inconsistent. DePalma is a master, and unfortunately that doesn't come through in this picture, though the last half an hour it shines through bit. Rapace is one of the best working actresses today, but she isn't meant to be used frivolously. She's good at very specific things, none of which get utilized in this film. I'm not sure why she was chosen, as fantastic an actor as she is, this is the last role she should have been cast for and doesn't suit her. Consequently, this part plays against type completely for McAdams and suspension of belief really has to work overtime to believe either of these two as these characters. I don't agree with any of the casting choices of the supporting actors, either, for that matter. This film suffers from bad casting choices and I fail to see the point or need of an English remake so close to the original, both in release date and scenes, nonetheless one that doesn't add anything to the experience. So you have to read subtitles with the original Love Crime - you'll quickly forget that, it's so well constructed. The same cannot be said for this film, which never seems like it finds its footing. I'd heard bad things so I wasn't expecting a ton, but I am surprised the film could fall so flat and be so mediocre with so much talent involved.",1375660800,4,1737,4.57051282051282
5825715,4,B00DL479DS,"PASSION is likely to be appreciated more by those already familiar with De Palma's films and career trajectory and the very artificial, surreal style he employs. In PASSION, De Palma returns to the genre for he is most celebrated and concocts a tale of shallow, catty advertising execs that tips over into a hallucinatory nightmare. It's absurd, outrageous, and devilishly clever, a film that playfully examines the surveillance culture which we currently inhabit.",1375660800,13,464,5.36986301369863
5825716,2,B00DL479DS,"Brian De Palma has created such absorbing films as Redacted, The Black Dahlia, Femme Fatale, Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way, The Bonfire of the Vanities, Casualties of War,  The Untouchables, Wise Guys, Scarface, Blow Out among others and is usually a dependable craftsman of tightly woven movies that explore the mind of crime. So why is this film such a mess? Perhaps it is his re-writing of Natalie Carter and Alain Corneau's fine French film ""Crime d'amour"" with Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier that is at fault or the strange casting of Rachel McAdams and Noomi Repace (both usually fine actresses) in the lead roles, but whatever happened it makes for a very non-De Palma movie - and a thudding predictable bore at that.

Ruthless executive Christine (Rachel McAdams) brings on Isabelle (Noomi Repace) as her assistant, and she takes delight in toying with the young woman's innocence. But when the protg's ideas become tempting enough for Christine to pass on as her own, she underestimates Isabelle's ambition and cunning -- and the ground is set for all out war. The use of the now infamous spying cameras and computer manipulations are stale, as is complicating the story with a love triangle with the drunken Dirk (Paul Anderson) and a vying for same sex attraction among the two women and Isabelle's protg Dani (Karoline Herfurth). The clues to the silly crimes committed are offered in the first part of the film only to resurrect in the end in a vapid conclusion. Professional women who care about their perception as leaders will be appalled by this flimsy, thoughtless, poorly paced tale of humiliation and revenge and murder. Strange because McAdams and Repace are usually so fine when they have good material. Grady Harp, August 13",1375574400,4,1763,4.993197278911564
5825717,2,B00DL479DS,"The film focuses on the manipulative Christine (Rachel McAdams) who heads the London branch of an ad agency. She desires to get transferred to NY. She has no problem talking credit for Isabel's (Noomi Rapace) ideas. Dirk (Paul Anderson) completes the third side of this love triangle. Isabel attempts to fight back, but is no match for Christine. The back and forth smartly escalates until there is a murder. At this point the film moves from a straight forward film to a who-dun-it, did they really do it mess which caused me to lose interest and enjoyment.

Brian De Palma fans will see similarities to his other works, which I though superior. Decent acting and plot, but it wasn't my cup of tea.

The primal battle of superiority within the 1%, and its no mistake that DePalma garnishes the set with pristine culture (technology, cars,fashion, homes). In turn, DePalma plays out his voyeuristic themes through the very camera that we attach ourselves to the i-phone.

BUT... I got a fever. And the only cure for it is more Noomi Rapace! She was amazing in this film, as she is in every film she makes. Shes my favorite actor (not just actress, because shes better than the men too!). Shes the greatest actor of all time, and I could watch her all day long. I don't care what shes in. I could probably watch a 2 hour movie of nothing but her eating a salad, and would probably think it was awesome. SHES JUST THAT GOOD.

So if you're a rabid Noomi fan like me, then you will enjoy this! But if you're a more normal, balanced individual, then you will probably think this movie is just okay, maybe even not so good. Apparently a lot of people care about the actual plots of movies. Go figure.",1512172800,2,883,4.25

From the first seconds of the films, it is clear that something about it doesn't work - I just couldn't believe in the actors, their behavior often made little sense, and unexplained plot twists are not even interesting enough to try to figure out.  The viewer's perception of the characters is supposed to change and it becomes clear that something is wrong with the point of view that is presented.  This leads to a surprise ending in which the whole thing completely falls apart, either implying that the worst trope of them all explains everything or that it is simply incoherent.

Well, most of them. /Scarface/ was a bitter disappointment, but then, gangster films were never my favorites anyway.
This film falls into a well-known category: a psychological thriller with obvious ties to Hitchcock. Well, obvious in the earlier ones; by now, this has simply become a de Palma style.
And that happens to be a category I enjoy.
And, like /Femme Fatale/, it shows, compared to earlier films like /Dressed to Kill/, what I respond to as a much smoother film.
As to being a version of another film -- when dealing with different versions of a film, in my experience, sometimes one film is better, sometimes another, and sometimes both are worthwhile.

5826094,5,B00DL479DS,"After I got through watching Brian De Palma's latest film, ""Passion"", I have to say it's possibly the best film he's made in his entire career! Amazing how a man in his 70's can still put out such awesome movies!

Now, I've been a long-time fan of De Palma's, going all the way back to when I first saw ""Carrie"" when it came out in 1977. And, honestly, when I first started seeing previews of ""Passion"", and reading some of the negative reviews, I wasn't all that excited as I've been over all of De Palma's other releases to see it.

It just kind of looked like it would be a little too bland for want of better word, and from what I was reading, the plot was going to be over-the-top convoluted to the point of being incomprehensible.

Something that I really hate is when I see so many people stating how they've recently seen a movie, and they didn't ""get"" it, or didn't understand it, thus the movie was bad in their opinion. No, of course it couldn't be because they just don't have the intelligence or the intellect to grasp what the filmmaker was trying to convey, no, it is because the film is bad and that's that.

Well, that is not always the case, matter of fact, probably not the case in any one of the movies those people reviewed. There are lots of great movies out these days that have complicated, intriguing, mysterious hard-to-understand plots, but those of us who follow along and pay attention (and have higher IQ's, obviously) don't consider them ""bad films"" unless they are badly made.

And, unfortunately, over the entire past decade, Brian De Palma has been blasted so many times for making ""bad films"" by people who just don't understand his films (because we live in such a dumbed down world these days) it isn't even funny.

(Oh, and just because something is described as an ""erotic thriller"", doesn't mean that every scene in the film is going to be some kind of titillating erotic soft-porn film for people wanting porno. So, for people complaining about this not being erotic/sexy enough, please buy a clue.)

And, sure, the first half of the film is made with a whole new style than what De Palma fans are probably used to, but honestly, I found that most refreshing, and thought it was a brilliant choice on his behalf to film it that particular way. But, on the other hand, the entire second (and especially the third) half of the film is deliciously, deviously, dementedly De Palma in all his delectable glory.

I'll tell you this, I'm glad I was watching it alone, because the entire last 10 minutes of the film I was shouting out, ""Wow! H*ll yeah! Wow! H*ll yeah! Wow! H*ll Yeah! Wow!"" over and over, and I would have hated to have interrupted someone else's enjoyment of it.

Plot-wise, I'm not going to divulge anything at all, because to say anything about any particular moment in the film would ruin it for anyone reading this, for every moment in the film leads from one glorious surprise to another, giving the viewer twists and turns like riding a roller coaster.

I will say, though, that the film gives De Palma the chance to work in lots of his given themes from older films, ranging from betrayal to the evil doppleganger.

Style-wise, the film is a cornucopia of styles reflecting not only other great films of the same genre from decades past (I even caught whiffs of nods to ""All About Eve""), but also from De Palma's own catalogue, ranging from split diopter to a breath-taking split-screen scene that rates up there with the likes of ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed To Kill"".

So when I saw the two leads were Noomi and Rachel, and that Amazon's summary of this movie includes the words ""erotic"" and ""thriller,"" I thought, Why not?

Okay, so I'm not sure how this ""thriller"" is erotic. All the sexual connections made between characters have strong schadenfreude or nonconsensual elements. Any remaining possibility of sexual sparks is muffled by awkward, formal, even clumsy sexual instigation.

Of the three main characters, not one of them is likeable. And the ""thriller"" element of the movie is pretty anticlimactic.

My suggestion? Pass on this one. For sexual chemistry between two female leads and a compelling storyline, try the Swedish film, Kiss Me.

Note: I have not seen the French original, Love Crime, on which Passion is purportedly based. The internet seems to think it's better than Passion, so there's that.",1406937600,2,1296,4.981481481481482

The only reason I watched the entire film was because I was mildly hopeful that some of these issues would get resolved.  This movie makes no sense most of the time. The entire plot relies on the viewer to figure out subtle clues however they are not clear or even understandable.  One scene starts with Isabelle unable to open her car with her key, then she crashes the car into pillars in the parking lot while the incident is being filmed.  Did Christine force the car to do this?  or was it Isabelle  bizarre and unbelievable emotional response?  It is never clear or explained.  As a viewer I have no compassion for Isabelle at all.

5826201,2,B00DL479DS,"It certainly isn't unusual to remake a movie, especially a good European movie.  It would seem Americans just won't get it unless it is redone.  This time Brian De Palma tries to sex up the story including the title.  Based on the 2010 French film ""Crime d'amour"" (""Love Crime""), by Alain Corneau (director/writer), De Palma, for whatever reason, even keeps the film in Europe. This time Germany.

Kristin Scott Thomas was very believable as Christine, the ambitious executive of an American conglomerate who heads up the European market.  Here De Palma casts Rachel McAdams in the role.  I struggled with that decision from the beginning.  McAdams just seemed a little too pretty and a little too short of corporate smarts.  She did have the cocktail party schmoozing down well however.  Christine has her eyes on a headquarter promotion to NYC and is grooming her protg, Isabelle (Sweden's Noomi Rapace) as a possible replacement.

De Palma makes no secret early on that Christine might just like to get it on with Isabelle as well.  Isabelle flirts back but maybe that's what's required to get a promotion.  Sexual ambiguity is deep seeded in this version with bi-sexual action (Paul Anderson as the film's boy toy) and a clearly lesbian-in-love assistant (Karoline Herfurth) thrown in for good measure.  Admittedly I like De Palma when he gets into the twists and turns that put audiences in a state of bewilderment and he does a good job with the second act.  The film concludes with a spate of reveals that just don't add up.  He also falls well short of the promised ""Passion"" suggested in the title.  I didn't think ""Love Crimes"" was a great film (3  stars) but it does a better job of delivering what are silly premises.",1394150400,,1729,4.806779661016949

5826205,1,B00DL479DS,"Occasionally, a movie will sound so good on paper, only to be a massive train wreck when it hits the big screen. Critics will take note of this, and it will make no money at all as a result. Passion stars Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace as young women working in an advertising firm. One betrays the other, they make up, and a million more betrayals, including an unconvincing lesbian subplot happen. Eventually, the movie devolves into a catfight. A poorly plotted, ridiculously unconvincing and saddeningly poorly acted catfight.

McAdams is in Regina George mode, playing Christine, more or less the head bitch in charge. Except now Regina is maybe fifteen years older, and hadnt learned a single thing from the accident that almost claimed her life. Rapace, who I really did like in the Swedish Girl With the Dragon Tattoo miniseries, has no reason to really be here. Her character Isabelle is gullible, stupid, confused and massively unlikable, even though Im pretty sure shes supposed to be the protagonist.

Brian DePalma has had massive success in movies like this in the past, but I hate to say that he should have let this one sit in post-production hell. McAdams and Rapace are both fine actresses, and they really do try their best, but these characters are so one-sided and so bland, that even talented actresses like these find themselves all dressed up with no place to go.

If you like a soap opera-esque story that reinforces hideous and misogynistic gender stereotypes, Passion might be for you. If you cant see yourself liking a story that involves two gorgeous women fighting over an ugly man, as well as occasional lesbianism, murder, twin sisters that show up at inconvenient times, and a royal letdown of an ending, I say you should skip this one.

And this is only the beginning. Given the name and work of the director, I was surprised by the low production values of this film. Filmed in Germany, the movie has the look of a straight to video erotic thriller. For instance, even though the action takes place within a large company, only four people seem to be working there. De Palma it seems didn't even have enough of a budget to hire extras. This is a remake of a French film that is reportedly better.

Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace fail to shine here, either, despite excellence elsewhere, hence the acting is much better in the original.  That said, the settings and cinematography and ""business"" plot points had far more sizzle under Brian De Palma's charms. Like most films by this director, the ending had a nice twist, then kept going and going.  Overall, I enjoyed many elements of both versions.  LOVE CRIME had subdued photography which lent itself to more realism but also melodrama, and a side-trip which proves unnecessary in DePalma's rendition of the story.

5826298,5,B00DL479DS,"I just got through watching Brian De Palma's latest film, ""Passion"", and have to say it's possibly the best film he's made in his entire career! Amazing how a man in his 70's can still put out such awesome movies!

Something that I really hate is when I see so many people stating how they've recently seen a movie, and they didn't ""get"" it, or didn't understand it, thus the movie was bad in their opinion. No, of course it couldn't be because they just don't have the intelligence or the intellect to grasp what the filmmaker was trying to convey, no, it is because the film is bad and that's that.

Well, that is not always the case, matter of fact, probably not the case in any one of the movies those people reviewed. There are lots of great movies out these days that have complicated, intriguing, mysterious hard-to-understand plots, but those of us who follow along and pay attention (and have higher IQ's, obviously) don't consider them ""bad films"" unless they are badly made.
And, unfortunately, over the entire past decade, Brian De Palma has been blasted so many times for making ""bad films"" by people who just don't understand his films (because we live in such a dumbed down world these days) it isn't even funny.

(Oh, and just because something is described as an ""erotic thriller"", doesn't mean that every scene in the film is going to be some kind of titillating erotic soft-porn film for people wanting porno. So, for people complaining about this not being erotic enough, please buy a clue.)

Now, I've been a long-time fan of De Palma's, going all the way back to when I first saw ""Carrie"" when it came out in 1977. And, honestly, when I first started seeing previews of ""Passion"", and reading some of the negative reviews, I wasn't all that excited as I've been over all of De Palma's other releases to see it.

It just kind of looked like it would be a little too bland for want of better word, and from what I was reading, the plot was going to be over-the-top convoluted to the point of being incomprehensible.

And, sure, the first half of the film is made with a whole new style than what De Palma fans are probably used to, but honestly, I found that most refreshing, and thought it was a brilliant choice on his behalf to film it that particular way. But, on the other hand, the entire second (and especially the third) half of the film is deliciously, deviously, dementedly De Palma in all his delectable glory.

I'll tell you this, I'm glad I was watching it alone, because the entire last 10 minutes of the film I was shouting out, ""Wow! Hell yeah! Wow! Hell yeah! Wow! Hell Yeah! Wow!"" over and over, and I would have hated to have interrupted someone else's enjoyment of it.

Plotwise, I'm not going to divulge anything at all, because to say anything about any particular moment in the film would ruin it for anyone reading this, for every moment in the film leads from one glorious surprise to another, giving the viewer twists and turns like riding a roller coaster.

I will say, though, that the film gives De Palma the chance to work in lots of his given themes from older films, ranging from betrayal to the evil doppleganger.

Stylewise, the film is a cornucopia of styles reflecting not only other great films of the same genre from decades past (I even caught whiffs of nods to ""All About Eve""), but also from De Palma's own catalogue, ranging from split dioptor to a breath-taking split-screen scene that rates up there with the likes of ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed To Kill"".

Anyone who hasn't seen it needs to see it NOW! You'll thank me later.

Thank you!

5826304,3,B00DL479DS,"""Passion"" is Brian De Palma's first film in about five years since ""Redacted"" (2007). His new film, a French-German production, is a remake of French director Alain Corneau's last film ""Love Crime"" (""Crime d'amour"") starring Ludivine Sagnier and Kristin Scott Thomas.

Brian De Palma's new film is, in a nutshell, a crime drama about two women played by Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander of the original Swedish ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"") and Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook""), and their distorted love-and-hate relationship. Though I enjoyed the film together with its ridiculously convoluted plot, I still don't know to what extent I should take this potboiler seriously.

The thriller's story starts with Christine Stanford (Rachel McAdams), a manipulative advertising executive stealing an idea from her subordinate Isabelle James (Noomi Rapace). When

To some viewers (including me), ""Passion"" is a vintage De Palma film, with such familiar topics as voyeurism and recorded images that were seen in his cult classics from ""Sisters"" to ""Body Double"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" - films with incredible characters and impossible storylines bordering on silliness, told with intensity and some intentional and unintentional hilarity. Those things you get in his latest thriller ""Passion,"" but the problem is, his latest film is also so predictable.

With his signature camera works including, of course, split screen, Brian De Palma does what he does, but not always effectively. I kind of like watching the contrived settings and plot twists, no matter how outlandish they may be, but lack of tension is something different. With the atmospheric photography of Jos Luis Alcaine and the gorgeous music of Pino Donaggio, ""Passion"" looks great, but in spite of the interesting narrative gimmicks, the film feels rather empty.",1382227200,4,1821,5.401408450704225

5826306,1,B00DL479DS,"There is an entire genre of Hollywood movies which consist of remakes of better European movies. You take a movie with good reviews (The Vanishing, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). You have a talentless screenwriter ruin the script and assign it to a hack director. You multiply the budget by ten and then you sit back and wonder why the reviews are so bad. These movies almost always stink and this one is no exception.

Based on a much better (but no classic) French movie called, in English, ""Love Crime,"" this movie tells the story of rivalry of a senior ad executive and her assistant that arises when the senior executive steals the idea of her assistant. Like most French movies, the movie is worth watching, first, because the writing, like most French movies, treats its viewers like adults. The screenwriter doesn't insert into his movie dialogue that no one has ever uttered in the history of the spoken word because he trusts the movie's viewers to make inferences and guides them to the assumptions they need to make in order to make the movie realistic.

The second failure of Hollywood is that no one there knows how grown-ups behave. This is because there are no adults in Hollywood. Rachel McAdams is an adequate actor in light comedy playing ingnues, but she doesn't have a clue how to behave like an employee in an office, let alone a high powered business executive. In fairness to Ms. McAdams, almost no one else in Hollywood does either. Anyone who has spent any time in an office will find the dialogue totally implausible. In contrast, Ms. Scott Thomas is completely believable as a senior executive in Love Crimes  and the office scenes were written by someone who either spent time in an office or has enough of an imagination to figure out how office workers behave.

Why does Hollywood keep proving to us that they produce a third rate product.",1381622400,16,1873,4.701219512195122

The film is utterly pathetic in how hard it tries to be ""artistic"".  The excruciatingly drawn-out split-screen sequence with a ballet interpretation of ""Prelude de l'apres midi d'une faune"" on one side, and murderous machinations on the other side, is absurd.  There is simply no way to avoid using the fast-forward button after enduring few minutes of this.  In several key scenes, the heavily contrived lighting effects distract from the story rather than adding to it.

5826360,2,B00DL479DS,"Brian De Palma took some flack in the 1970's for ripping off Alfred Hitchcock so obviously, but at least he used to be good at it.  After 1984's Body Double he decided to branch out into more serious films with generally disastrous results and he never got his groove back when he attempted to return to the thriller genre that had been his bread and butter for the early part of his career.  Passion is easily his worst thriller since the embarrassing Raising Cain.  This is a remake of the excellent but very cold French thriller Love Crimes about the relationship between a cold as ice business executive who steals her assistant's idea for an ad campaign then humiliates her brutally when higher ups in the company find out and she loses a coveted promotion.  I would simply say save your time, skip this garbage and watch the original but some people have an aversion to movies with English subtitles and would rather watch a terrible English remake than a foreign language film--but this thing is about as terrible as terrible English language remakes get.  Both of the film's stars are horribly miscast--Rachel McAdams is too young and likable to be playing the ice-queen boss who everyone is afraid of and Noomi Rapace is not young or fragile enough to pull off the naive, worshipful assistant.  Brian De Palma throws in some elements from his Hitchcock bag of tricks to try and make the material his own but, like Raising Cain, his stylistic touches descend into silly self-parody pretty quickly.  There's a reason this movie is going straight to video in spite of the name cast and director--it's god-awful.  Brian De Palma has made some really terrible movies since his early winning streak (Raising Cain; Bonfire of the Vanities; The Black Dahlia; Mission to Mars; Snake Eyes) and Passion fits squarely in that camp.",1379721600,5,1828,4.7993630573248405

As such, the movie isn't really that effective until this section, with most of the prior dialogue seeming sophomoric and shallow, much like the relationships and characters in the film.

Christine (Rachel McAdams) is the very manipulative and ambitious boss of a big ad agency abroad. Hoping to make it to New York City, she takes credit for the ideas of an attractive employee she likes to flirt with... setting off a chain of retaliation and revenge. I was enjoying the initial seduction. But it doesn't go ANYWHERE you really want it to go if you're hoping for some appealing chemistry and fooling around.

Rachel McAdams seems to be reprising her shallow Mean Girls blonde... all grown up, in charge, and probably a closet lesbian. She has this thing going with a slender male employee who wears a feminine mask when they boink, and I had a great laugh over the strap on he pulls out of her drawer (but no, we don't get to see her wear one dammit, lol)... unfortunately, we never get to see her play out her fantasies with any women either. Disappointing. Lustful looks and a few hugs and kisses is all the f/f action in this movie. Meh. Just another silly psycho lesbian thriller... a 1980s throwback.

McAdams was awesome and believable in Mean Girls... here I couldn't buy her as the boss with the similar persona (and looks). Too immature and crazy. I don't know. It just didn't work. But she sure was beautiful and stylishly dressed in any case. And when the movie only focuses on the brunette the last half hour... how dull it was. I laughed out loud at the ending, though I probably wasn't supposed to. Oh hell, I laughed all through this story even though I probably wasn't supposed to!! omg... this was so bad, lol. It shoulda been made as a (black) comedy. Regina George wasn't meant to be in any other genre. But I loved how stylish the filming was and how beautiful Rachel McAdams was. Disappointed she didn't get to play full on lesbian (yep, that's all I came here to find)... but what can I say.

5826391,3,B00DL479DS,"***2 1/2 stars***  FOR POORLY PLACED CASTING OF TWO TERRIFIC STARS IN A REMAKE THAT FALLS SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL

I love both Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace in their many films, but I feel perhaps they were not used correctly here (I will explain below). Most Americans viewing this film will assume it's an original work if they haven't seen the previous French movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Crime/dp/B006OQDIOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Crime</a>&nbsp;(Crime D'Amour). In fact, Passion is a very close copy of the superior French film staring Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier.

McAdams doesn't have as much the look of power and authority required for a manipulative business executive (too young) and Noomi Rapace struggles trying to be the innocent, young ing&eacute;nue up-and-comer in the company (she has the harder street smart look).  Actually, if they just switched rolls I think Noomi could have projected the slightly more mature authority figure while Mcadams could be the young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Where the French version builds the mystery within a mystery - piece by meticulous piece, the suspense mechanisms in this film come across trite and perfunctory by comparison. If you only watch the US version, you may find it a passable mystery at best unless you are a die hard De Palma fan. Additionally, I didn't find the chemistry between McAdams and Rapace that convincing and the movie as a whole just wasn't that sexy, particularly for the R rating and hype surrounding the film.

THE PLOT (No spoilers): A rising female advertising executive uses the romantic infatuation of her bright young female assistant to manipulate her into giving ideas, which she steals to promote her own career.  Further, she then humiliates the assistant once she has what she wants. The assistant is more than just a bright study with a penchant for powerful women. Needless to say, things take a dark turn for several of the characters involved. This is a little simplistic since both movies try to project more allegorical meanings while plumbing deep emotional and psychological depths. However, I don't wish to give any spoilers so I will leave it at that. There are also plot divergences between the two movies as they deal with the later half of the film and I found the previous French version more satisfying in that respect as well.

I would not call the French version a masterpiece, but it has great depth, meticulous construction of the crime, suspense, and believable sapphic infatuation. Ludivine Sagnier is far more sexy and believable as the nave assistant that is initially manipulated in the affair.

De Palma fans will want to see this movie and may even appreciate it greatly. For other viewers it's probably a mixed bag.",1378425600,8,2815,5.24
5826392,4,B00DL479DS,"I have to say, when I heard that De Palma was remaking the atrocious French ""thriller"" Love Crime my heart sank.  The original film had an interesting premise but was hampered by the fact that the most interesting character (and vastly superior actress) disappeared about halfway through the story and what we were left with was a dull and preposterous police procedural with the main character executing an unbelievable and far fetched plot to get away with a crime.  The bad news is that De Palma has stuck fairly closely to the original's plot, the good news is that he approaches the nonsensical plot twists by veering off into an expressionistic dreamscape where things like logic aren't necessary.  It's a bold move, and not always successful, but the film is saved by a bonkers performance by Rachel McAdams, his usual precise camera work and a great score by Pino Donaggio.  All in all, it won't appeal to the multiplex crowd, but those interested in seeing something a little different, or those who are fans of De Palma's other work, should take a look.",1378080000,3,1063,4.7923497267759565

He has also described himself in rather highfalutin terms as a ""visual stylist"" and ""abstract expressionist."" I didn't see much evidence of the precisely story boarded visual designs of which he speaks, though the film is stylish in a kind of eurotrashy way. But ""abstract expressionist""! Give us a break. This is a really silly movie, the characters are poorly written, the plot points are feebly constructed and the performances by two excellent actresses decidedly subpar. The ballet is lovely but gratuitous. Like what's the friggin connection? I think it's pretty arrogant to do a remake of an excellent French thriller and then claim (as Mr. De P has done) that he has made it better by making it his own. This is second tier De Palma, and that's sad. Maybe it's getting to be time for the guy to put down his view finder and rest on his considerable laurels.",1377907200,5,985,4.904191616766467

This is a film that is not to take serious it just brings Racheal mcadams back to form since Mean Girls. The film only suggest  but doesn't really have any graphic sexual scenes. Bascally its a cat and mouse game of two women who are at each others throats. The boss obviously likes the employee but the employee doesn't feel the same way. Instead she is involved the the same lover as her boss that wants her. So from there things get ugly and it just escalates into a total mess. Racheal in this film is basically a narcisist and spoiled lying Bit*h that wants everything her way or its the highway. Rapace is basically playing the victim and the nice girl that just wants to keep her job. It starts off like soft p*rn but then escalates into a crime thriller of who done it ? That was the main thing that kinda disappointed me about the film. I would have liked to see more of the cat and mouse game it was fun. But the last 30 mins of the film seem like a totally different film. Then there were some scences that even played out like a art film or a play. This is definitley not a bad film in my opinion but does play out like a 90's film or a rehash. It's definitley worth a watch if you like old style sensual crime thrillers. It is shot well and has some lovely locations and beautiful women in it. And most of all pretty funny and campy in some parts. This is a remake of a french film called LOVE CRIME which I thought was just ok. This was definitley is more appealing visually and is more fun overall. There are some slight variations in the films. The ending is different and how the evidence ended up in the other persons car made more sense in the original. But overall I think Brian De Palma's version was a bit more twisted and effective especially the ending.

Passion is playful pure cinema, covering De Palma's common themes and visual styles (voyeurism, technology, obsession, manipulation, deception, guilt, beautiful femme fatale's, heightened performances, overt artificiality, deliberate tonal shifts & stylistic flourishes). Whilst the first half of the film plays as a seemingly straightforward corporate drama, replete with corporate backstabbing (with a brilliant, but frankly bonkers Pino Donaggio soft core score). All is not as it seems however, and the second half of the film takes on a completely different direction and moves into the realms of dreams within dreams and German expressionism with a trademark and quite wonderful split screen section involving Mallarm's/Dubussy's 'Afternoon of the Faun' ballet linking the poem/ballet to a key character and murder of another which tricks you about its timeline. There are images and adverts of the ballet shown prior to this, and the story behind Mallarm's poem (the awakening of a faun and the faun's encounters with several nymphs in a dreamlike oration) is central to both to the plot of the story & the character & motivations of Isabella. (Donaggio's score too transforms to riff's on Bernard Hermann's dramatic strings).

Like so many De Palma films, this gets even better with multiple viewings as you realise and understand more what about what you have and haven't seen, what is and isn't real, & what is a dream or a re-awakening.

Elements of other De Palma psychological thrillers (in particular Sisters, Dressed to Kill & Raising Cain) resonate throughout this film. Overall, fantastic fun.",1375833600,19,1656,5.365384615384615

8594200,2,B00DL479DS,"Rachel McAdams is of course, the mean girl in this very long, drawn out movie.  I'm a noomi fan - her acting was better than the rest of the cast but not a great film.",1520380800,,167,3.7714285714285714
8594201,4,B00DL479DS,"4.5 almost a five, good acting, noomi's eyes as well as rachel's leave you spellbound at times, well done.",1520208000,,106,4.631578947368421
8594202,1,B00DL479DS,Truly the worst movie ever created. You will want to jump through the screen and end each character's life in a vain attempt to rectify your time that has been stolen from you.,1519948800,,176,4.363636363636363
8594203,2,B00DL479DS,"Awful. Predictable. Pretentious. The actors do their best to save the film from itself, but to no avail. Brian De Palma is a director stuck in both time and style and what this film shows is that he's way past his prime. Two stars only for Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace (who probably could tell what the end result was going to be as the days of filming wore on).",1518998400,,365,4.228571428571429
8594204,4,B00DL479DS,Very European style of film. A lots of twist.  Entertaining.,1518912000,,60,5.0
8594205,1,B00DL479DS,"Mildly interesting to start, but gets very drawn-out, confusing and tedious once the ballet starts and Isabelle has a breakdown or whatever. Ugh.",1518825600,,145,5.3478260869565215
