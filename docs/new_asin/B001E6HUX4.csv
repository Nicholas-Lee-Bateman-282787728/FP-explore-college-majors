8296709,5,B001E6HUX4,I missed this series because I didn't have cable and only had recorded a few episodes.  He is by far the best therapist for me.,1360972800,,127,4.08
8296710,3,B001E6HUX4,"I really love Dr. Katz, what a great show. I have the first 2 volumes of the DVD's and then whomever makes/has the rights to it stopped putting them out as season disks and bundled the whole series into one set for $130!!! (i just checked, now it is 60.) So now having the first 2 seasons, and not ready to drop the cash for the complete series, I was excited to discover of the ""BEST OF"" disk.

I just got this for Christmas, and as it is a good show, this is NOT the show, this is just the segments of the comedians/celebrities on Dr. Katz couch doing their routines. I really wish they had put some complete episodes on here, as this is a really short disk. I did enjoy it, I just wish it was episodes, not clips.

To break down my rating, I gave this 3 out of 5 stars because of the length and because it is only clips, not full episodes.

So if you don't have the full series yet I would buy this, it is great, there are some interactions with Laura the receptionists (played by Laura Silverman, Sarah's sister) that are really funny. Also some good stuff from Patton Oswalt, Brian Regan, and a really funny scene from David Duchovny. If your a big fan of  H. Jon Benjamin (Archer, Bob's Burgers, Home Movies, Aqua Teen Hunger Force) you will not find much of him on it, which was also a bit disappointing, since I love the interactions his character ""Ben Katz"" has with his father on the show.

A side note: If you like Dr. Katz, he has an animated internet cartoon on blip.tv called ""Hey We're Back!"", it was a podcast that was animated by the same people that did the Dr. Katz show, not in squiggle-vision but still pretty cool, go to blip.tv site and do a search for Jonathan Katz and you should be able to find it.",1357084800,3,1724,4.212121212121212
8296711,3,B001E6HUX4,"Oops. I didn't realize these were just some clips of the guests in the office, doing just their routine. I was hoping for the whole episodes. Should've read better.
But- good guests, funny stuff.",1296864000,11,195,4.764705882352941
8296712,3,B001E6HUX4,"It certainly isn't the best skits in my opinion from the show, but if ur not into collecting every seoson it won't disappoint u.",1250467200,2,128,4.375
8296713,3,B001E6HUX4,"If you're a fan of Dr. Katz and just want to get one DVD, supposedly this is the one to get. But it really isn't the best bits from the show's long-ish run. More accurately, it contains the bits with the comics or celebrities who are most famous now. Certainly not any kind of criterion for determining ""best."" But if you neeeeeeed your Dr. Katz and can't afford the 3-figure pricetag of the full box set, then I guess this will have to do!",1249171200,6,440,4.25
