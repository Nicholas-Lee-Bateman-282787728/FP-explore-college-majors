8243228,4,B0011ZXM12,I am a retired Cockfighter and this was a good addition to my DVD collection. My only negatine comment is that while there is ample amount of information on the Cockfighters there is not enough on the Birds. I recommend this set of DVDs to anyone interesred in Gamefowl and Cockfighting.,1393545600,2,287,4.647058823529412
8243229,5,B0011ZXM12,"Cockfightig has been a long standing tradition in world history and will continue to be for centuries to come. This documentary tells the story of some of the worlds top cockfighters and how they came to be so great. You will not see the ""bloody and brutal"" fights that certian groups will lead you to believe that goes on. Instead, it gives you an inside look of how these cockers raise these birds to do what they were born to do. Also, gives you the story on how they got into it and why they love it so much to make it their life's work. For anyone who loves the sport, this is a great investment in learning how the greats do what they do.",1237075200,10,644,4.16
