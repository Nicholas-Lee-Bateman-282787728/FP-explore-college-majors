3508482,4,B001CCKJ2E,"I agree, I do not understand why this title is not released in HD.
I also watched on HDnet and would love to purchase it in Blu-ray.
Does anyone know if this will be relased in Blu-ray at a later date?",1217894400,,201,3.926829268292683
3508483,3,B001CCKJ2E,"Yes this was shot in HD, and it was broadcast on HDNET on Halloween weekend 2007 and it looked AMAZING!.....However the DVD pales in comparison to the what I have on my DVR from HDNET. The question is if they went to all the trouble to film this in HD and broadcast it on HDNET, then WHY was it not released on Blu-Ray and DVD instead of just DVD? Seems like a big waste to me to pay for a huge HD production and then not even release it in an HD format. The other strange thing is this comes with a CD of the show, but the DVD has 17 songs, and the CD only 13...WHY?????",1217376000,5,571,3.888888888888889

3508498,5,B001CCKJ2E,"I have yet to buy this dvd, but since I live in the St Louis area, I was at that very concert that night & can tell you that the show was AWESOME. Poison was spot on. I did see the broadcast on VH1  one night & taped it. It wasn't until recently I knew it was available on dvd. From what I seen on tv,  the dvd sounds just like being there. This is gonna be the next dvd that I order sp I can relive that night whenever I choose to :).For anyone who hasn't seen this performance yet, buy this & you will see what a great night that was. Bret Michaels really does enjoy & appreciate his fans & that is  very obvious. It is refreshing to see a star who cares so much about his fans & his roots. I have to say one of the highlights of the concert was seeing C.C. deville singing  I Hate Every Bone In Your Body ( But Mine).  He's actually a fairly decent singer in his own right :).  The  concert I give 5 stars, the dvd,  from what I seen on tv broadcast, I'm giving it a 5 as well :)",1407024000,,982,3.7794117647058822

3508502,5,B001CCKJ2E,"This DVD contains a very nice concert from the glam hair Metal band Poison, in this concert poison play whit her classic guitar C.C DeVille, the sound it's great, image quality also and the show its very fun, if you like this type of music or if you like poison you will enjoy this DVD.",1371168000,,286,4.218181818181818
3508503,4,B001CCKJ2E,"Bought it for my friends girlfriend who just LOVES Bret. Had a problem at first when I was sent a CD by mistake which she just didn't want.  She just had to see Brett strutting around the stage. So she's happy now and her boyfriend and I can pop in our Aerosmith, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin DVD without her B*tching. Win/Win! Thank God she's not into Justin Beber! LOL",1365465600,,372,4.314285714285714

3508505,5,B001CCKJ2E,All the hits including Ride the Wind.  One awesome dvd from Poison performing in St. Louis.  I will be watching this over and over.,1356393600,,131,4.416666666666667

3508507,5,B001CCKJ2E,"great concert, great sound and video quality, a must have.  also comes with a cd so that makes this concert dvd extra cool.  the performances are not perfect, but they are real.  i would rather see a ""real"" group playing and singing their hearts out, than see a flawless lip sinking band.  I Wont Forget You, Talk Dirty To Me, and Nothin But A Good time are extra cool, loaded with energy.  The only song i didn't care for was ""I have every bone in your body except mine.""  CC needs to stick to playing great quality, energetic, and entertaining guitar rather than try to sing.  If you like Poison, I recommend this DVD!",1303603200,2,620,4.385964912280702

3508510,1,B001CCKJ2E,This video does not play on any of my dvd players. I need a refund asap.,1260921600,,72,3.5625
3508511,5,B001CCKJ2E,"This is the video to have. Just like being back at the show. I see them every year. The film is one of the best live show I've seen.
As Bret gets older its seems his shows get shorter. But it was still great. As with all the Poison shows not all the songs you like to hear are in it. As for the few cover songs Poison included I enjoyed them.
Why not everyone thinks they can do a song better or just as good and they did. Would still love to see Poison put out an album with all new stuff. I enjoyed the Hollyweird album except for Squeeze Box. Keep up the good work boys, see ya soon.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POISON-D/dp/B000PC6Y4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POISON'D!</a>",1242172800,,719,4.806451612903226
3508512,5,B001CCKJ2E,"Finally, Poison has released a live dvd with C.C. Deville! Recording during the Poison'd tour in 2007 the dvd captures the whole experience of the Poison'd tour, having attended their one of the dates of the tour makes it even better for me. The cd is also very enjoyable, and probably Poison's best live cd so far. The only complaint is that the cd is missing a handful of songs that are on the dvd, but their only the cover songs. If you buy only one Poison dvd this is the one to get.",1223164800,5,487,4.191489361702128
3508513,4,B001CCKJ2E,"I've been a Poison fan since ""Look What The Cat Dragged In"" and I've been waiting YEARS for a live DVD. Finally, Poison gives it to us with ""Live, Raw and Uncut."" One thing I love about this disc is that Bret keeps it clean by not swearing (at all) in comparison to ""Swallow This Live"" (1991). I do think the songs are played a little fast and Bret sure sounds worn out on some of these tracks, but hey - he's not 21 anymore so kudo's to him and the boys for continuing to do what they do best - ROCK. I do have to gripe (along with one of the other reviewers) that the music CD only has 13 tracks while the DVD has 17 - not cool. And the other gripe is what I hear from a lot of Poison fans - these guys just keep playing the same songs over, and over, and over again - year after year after year. Other than the tracks from ""Poison'd"" (and the lame one from ""Power To The People"") all we ever get are songs from the first 3 albums - the 1986 to 1991 era. These guys have 7 studio albums that span a 22 year period, and it's like the songs don't exist. I would absolutely love to hear more live music from some of the other albums. That said, I'm thrilled to have this new collection - especially on DVD. Thanks guys!",1219276800,5,1218,3.9552845528455283
3508514,5,B001CCKJ2E,"Poison: Live, Raw & Uncut is a dvd / cd combo of a live Poison concert in 2007 in support of their cover album Poison'd.
