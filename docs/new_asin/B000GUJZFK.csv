THE SHIPMENT WAS WRAPPED NICELY!
THE VIDEO QUALITY IS PERFECT!
GREAT GREAT GREAT TAP MOVES FROM A GREAT HOOFER (JARED GRIMES)
I'M THOROUGHLY PLEASED...this is my first order thru Amazon and from this particular seller! THANK YOU!",1361836800,,259,5.046511627906977
8134700,3,B000GUJZFK,"This is fun to watch; I have a ton of tap training, and found it difficult to follow.  Jared is very talented but not great at explaining.  Which sucks, because it's an instructional dvd. Regardless of level, the instructor should be able to break it down.  I did not feel he did that for me.  Which is a shame, because I would have loved to learn those routines.  But I cannot pick up stuff through osmosis, even as an advanced intermediate tapper.  I've reviewed some stuff online now and am going to purchase Hoofin' with Mike Minery who breaks things down very clearly.",1255651200,2,573,4.514563106796117
8134701,5,B000GUJZFK,"I agree this is not for beginners however the video itself says it is for intermediate/advanced of course.  Grimes and his group are very entertaining to watch and good clean taps.  But also, if you like a challenge like myself, it was equally as fun to learn and perform.  I was able to learn the first one to put in an act I did for a talent show for fun and it helped my step look so much more entertaining to say the least.  But it was a workout!  I am not advanced in tapping, just in the last year got the beginners DVDs from Amazon -the ""I hate to exercise but love to Tap"" and the Ginger series which helped me learn between the two of those and this one just added to the fun.  I like a challenge and knew this would be as good as it was!  I am going to learn the second step this coming month to hopefully perform at a future talent show in six months!",1234137600,,862,3.9767441860465116
8134702,5,B000GUJZFK,"This is not for beginners,is for intermediate/advance; you need to be familiar with your tap steps. this DVD is  well explained and steps are very clean. very good routines including traditional steps. a must have for hoofers.",1212537600,2,226,5.108108108108108
8134703,5,B000GUJZFK,"OK, this is definitely NOT for beginners!!! Jared Grimes ABSOLUTELY knows his stuff (Broadway Dance Center). I believe they're going to re-release Henry Le Tang's beginner videos on DVD - be sure to check those out if you're a beginner.

A tap student who's not used to a teacher who scats the rhythms, and who doesn't always name the steps, might wind up feeling completely lost while watching this DVD. I feel if you're more into the hoofer-style stuff, rather than the ""cutesy"" dance school stuff, this DVD is for you!

The production style is very simple, but that's just fine by me. I feel like I'm watching a semi-private lesson with a nice small class.

I really admire the sound quality of the taps on this DVD. Taps are often not mic'ed correctly, but this DVD features nice clean tapping.

Mr. Grimes explains weight shifts very well, and how the steps fit together.

Overall, a nice solid product - if you are actually at the Int. to Int./Advanced level. This is NYC and Chicago advanced stuff. Major cities have a much higher level of difficulty in their tap classes - keep that in mind when looking for a tap instruction DVD.

P.S.: If you're just beginning tap - go for it! The world needs more tap dancers, at every level. :D xooxoxo",1174521600,8,1248,4.573991031390134
8134704,3,B000GUJZFK,"This is a very challenging DVD.  The choreography is not the hard part, the presentation is.  Jared shows you the steps a few times but he doesn't really tell you the steps so you have to watch his feet and it is hard to pick up the steps.  I will keep working at it but it is not easy to learn it.  I would recommend the Shim Sham Shimmy with Leonard Reed or  Bonnie Franklin's I Hate to Exercise but Love to Tap DVDs instead of this one.",1159056000,16,439,3.9431818181818183
