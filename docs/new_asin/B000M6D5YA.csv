2725758,4,B000M6D5YA,"Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) is a Japanese cop travelling to Shanghai on the trail of some jewel smugglers. His quiet persona makes him stand out like a sore thumb, but in a non-threatening way. He befriends the son of the owner of the ship they are sailing on, Robert Hitchins Jr. (Thomas Beck), and the two pal around while running into all sorts of trouble. Mr. Moto is quite ambiguous, because he can be downright creepy sometimes with his slow movements and stupid grin, but the character is quite funny sometimes too.

Also included on this DVD is a feature about Harvey Parry, notorious stuntman of the silent and sound eras. Parry did Lorre's stunts in this film due to Lorre's own poor health.

There are some racial stereotypes here, like Mr. Moto's bad teeth and slow manner of speaking (although that could be a Lorre trait). However, seasoned movie-goers will be able to ignore this and see the quality of the film. The pace is quick to never leave the audience bored, the action is exciting, and the characters are memorable.",1196553600,3,1033,4.670329670329671

8166747,5,B000M6D5YA,"This is the first of nine films made of Marquand's six novels published between 1935 and 1957. Peter Lorre played Mr. Moto in eight of the nine films between 1937 and 1939. Henry Silva had the part in the ninth film in 1965. The film versions of Mr. Moto are unlike his portrayal in the Marquand novels, where he is a Japanese spy. In the films, he is generally an international Law Enforcement Agent, but not in this novel where he is neither.
The film is old but clear and lasts 66 minutes. It does not have a language caption, making it difficult for people with hearing problems to understand it.
Mr. Moto is shown to be very good at hand-to-hand combat. He smiles a lot with gaps between his teeth. In this film he is very good at magic. He is highly respected by the police. It is unclear in the start of the show what he is seeking. All we know is that men have been murdered and found in wicker boxes in San Francisco such as those used in the Orient.
He joins a ship heading from San Francisco to China and is following the playboy son of the owner of the ship. There is a cabin steward on the ship who is clearly a criminal and a beautiful mysterious woman who boards the ship in Honolulu and entices the playboy.",1511654400,2,1223,4.230769230769231

It starts in San Francisco during Chinese New Year. A man enters a store. Anybody here? The peddler offers an item for sale. The deal is interrupted, the peddler escapes, then removes his disguise. A ship will sail at midnight. Mr. Hitchings will carry a confidential letter to Shanghai. Mr. Moto also arrives. He is not easily fooled. Half the world laughs at the other half, and they are both right. Mr. Moto prescribes a drink to cure a hangover for another passenger. They arrive in Honolulu. There are sports on the ship. Men play cards at the Shanghai Club; one wins. He also gets a message. Later Mr. Moto finds a man searching his room; there is a fight! The ship arrives at Shanghai. Stateless people will do anything to leave. [A reference to the politics of that day.] There is smuggling of diamonds and drugs going on. Hitchings wants to find Gloria. [Are some overdressed in this heat?]

Mr. Moto researches a picture of that woman. A note tells Hitchings about the International Club by the waterfront. Moto hires a rickshaw, it goes the wrong way. He gets a ride in an automobile instead. Gloria sings and dances. A shy violet? Roberts meets her, she tells her name is Tanya Marloff, a White Russian from Harbin. Marloff questions Hitchings! Then he meets Roberts party. Moto asks about gambling with cards. They cut for high card. Moto wins. [Watch that shuffle!] They talk about a sideline. Will that lady make a telephone call? Can Moto make a deal with Marloff? They learn Moto is a police spy! Thing fast, Mr. Moto! The police, armed with rifles, raid the place. Mr. Moto explains it all, who was the hidden head of the ring of smugglers. His revolver has one empty cartridge, he shot the woman in the telephone booth. The police take the guilty away. There will be no more smuggling (for now).

This is an interesting story set in the late 1930s about smuggling on ships. High value small items like diamonds or drugs were easiest to hide, but it needed the help of somebody on the ship. Stolen diamonds would be smuggled out of or into another country. [Note the use of stunt doubles for those judo scenes?] There were other Mr. Moto movies, based on a detective that seemed to be inspired by the Charlie Chan stories and movies. They are mostly all worth watching today for entertainment and the culture of that era.",1425859200,,2372,4.602836879432624

8166755,4,B000M6D5YA,"""Think Fast, Mr. Moto"" is the first in a long running series starring John P. Marquand's famous creation, the Japanese super-spy Mr. Moto.  The first martial arts action hero, Mr. Moto is a master of Judo, disguise and slight-of-hand card tricks.

In ""Think Fast, Mr. Moto"", we are introduced to a smiling and deferent gentleman, one who appears harmless but manages to carry an aura of danger about him.  This man, Mr. Moto, quietly inquires into the affairs of fellow passengers on a cruise ship.  He flings a man overboard with no more trouble than as if squishing a mosquito, discovers the secrets of a mysterious beauty, and uncovers an international gem smuggling ring along the way.

The Hungarian Peter Lorre seems an odd choice to play a Japanese super-spy, but he pulls it off with incredible style.  Instead of the over-the-top style of Warner Oland's Charlie Chan (A film series I am also a fan of, I must confess), Lorre plays Mr. Moto with respect and intelligence.  About the only nod to stereotypes of the time are a buck teeth mouth appliance, and a slow way of speaking that is probably more due to Lorre's accent rather than intentional overacting.  In fact, many Japanese at the time were surprised to discover that Lorre was not at least half-Japanese, due to his appearance and performance.

I really like these old black-and-white mystery movies, especially ones with an Oriental flair.  It took me awhile to getting around to Mr. Moto, but now that I have I will definitely continue with the series.",1215993600,,1523,4.800766283524904
