8230491,5,B000Y0BJBK,"Beautiful music, photos, and powerful way to meditate, be inspired, and remember  and be grateful our part in this wonderful gift called life.  Really supports an attitude of gratitude.",1354752000,3,185,5.344827586206897
8230492,5,B000Y0BJBK,"This is AWESOME and POWERFUL. It's not designed to provide you with ""knowlege"" about gratitude, but the ""experience"" of gratitude. If you don't feel grateful after watching this video, you're in deep trouble. I am an addiction counselor and use this in the groups I do. It has 10 segments, about 15 minutes each. You can watch the entire DVD at one time, or just do one, two, or threee segments each day. Every treatment center in the county should have this. Many of my clients told me, ""It takes you to a ""natural"" high. However, you don't have to be a member of a Twelve Step Group to reap the benefits. As a matter of fact, the DVD was not made with the intention of marketing it to treatment centers. Everyone on the planet needs to watch this.
