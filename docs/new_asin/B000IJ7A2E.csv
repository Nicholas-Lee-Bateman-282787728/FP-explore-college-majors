2658600,5,B000IJ7A2E,"If you are looking for an amazing and refreshing workout, then it can be found in this dvd.  It's tough and fun and challenging and effective.

The three instructors (Tracey York, Michelle Dozios and Lisa Wheeler) are knowledgable, outgoing and encouraging.  They each add their two cents when one of the others are leading the class, but not in an egotistacle way or in an annoying way.  No one is the 'princess' - you can see that they all get along.

The first of the three workouts is the toughest.  It's full on cardio and there is no letting up with it.  Lisa demonstrates a modified version if it's too strenuous on you.  The second workout is toning (and you get to use the dyna band that comes with it in a stunning lime green) and the third workout is a mixture of both aerobics and toning.  I like the chest presses with the abdominal work.

If there is one thing I don't like in this, it's that on the dvd player, the count is gone (it only says play) and sometimes you want to know how much time is left to go.  But I would have to say that this set is one of my favourite workouts and if I am anthing to go by, there are results to be found here even if you are already slender.  I love this one for sure.",1170028800,13,1219,4.140425531914894
2658601,4,B000IJ7A2E,"Three excellent instructors, three tough workouts.  I'm recovering from a chronic illness and just getting back into exercising and this DVD was tough for me.  Really felt it later, which is nice.  Definitely recommend this one.",1168992000,6,228,5.277777777777778
2658602,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I've done my share of exercise videos and this one is a winner!  It has it all, arms legs, abs.  It's an easy to follow video, has great cueing and really mixes it up!  I highly recommend this video for anyone wanting a quick or fast (depending on how many sections you do), well rounded cardio workout.",1302048000,,303,4.280701754385965
2658603,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I have never really been ""in shape"" so when I first started trying to do this work out, it was far to intense for me. However, I really liked how easy it was to follow along. Even though doing all the moves together was a strain, I could physically do each move separately, unlike some videos. I also really like all 3 women in this video - none of them look like the 19 year old model on the cover. They're all over 30 with bodies that have some muscle, unlike the model. And I like their attitude. So I've just been working up to being able to do the video slowly.",1300320000,2,566,4.0625
2658604,4,B000IJ7A2E,I like the video but it transitions poorly. I wish they explain the moves a little better but I gave it a four star because it makes you sweat your butt off.,1290556800,,157,3.9375
2658605,1,B000IJ7A2E,The trainers are good looking and svelte--they sure didn't need the workout.  They went too fast so you almost have to watch it several times before you have a prayer of doing some of the moves correctly.  I didn't stick with it--it didn't motivate me--I don't recomment it and am sorry I wasted my money on this.,1283212800,,313,4.473684210526316
2658606,2,B000IJ7A2E,"This workout is very boring.  The instructors are annoying, the setting is bland and the workouts are just basic.  I tried each workout hoping one would be worth my time, and I'm very disappointed.  I haven't been able to motivate myself to try them again since I was so bored the first time through.  I'm sure if you did the workouts enough you would see results, however I know I'll never do them enough to get anything out of them.  I immediately went back to my TurboJam DVDs that I've been doing for months, and I still find it more entertaining than this workout.  If you are looking for quick results, I would recommend 30 Day Shred.
There are definitely much better workouts out there!",1265587200,,693,4.504
2658607,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I'm an intermediate/advanced, consistent exerciser.  This DVD and the other DVD in this set- the ""Bikini Body Redefining Workout""- are an amazing workout set!  I have never done a better workout series, on a DVD or in the gym.  They are tough!  But great!  Between the two DVDs, there are 5 30-minute workouts.  They are all great cardio, and all work your lower and middle body very well.  Some focus more on total body toning too.  They also include power moves and balance. I find the workouts fun and am never bored.  There are 5 workouts, so I never do the same workout twice in one week.  Within a few weeks, I've seen changes in my body, mostly in my butt and abs.  I also feel much healthier and more energetic. I've felt much better all around since doing these workouts, and therefore genuinely, actually look forward to doing them.  The instructors are great and never get annoying!

The ""Redefining"" DVD has 3 5-minute ""mini-workouts"" for the lower body, abs, and upper body that you can add on as well.  I don't do the lower body 5-minute workout because the main workouts kill my lower body as it is.  I add on a 5-minute workout from Shape's ""Shape.. Your Abs"" DVD because I find them better than the 5-minute one on the ""Redefining"" DVD.  But I do add the 5-min upper body workout to the days when I do the workouts focused on strength.

Overall I'd highly recommend these videos.  You get cardio, strength, endurance, power, balance, and energy in 30-minutes.  They are highly efficient, well designed workouts that are very fun to do and make me feel great!",1262476800,3,1575,4.580645161290323
2658608,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This is a great workout for me. I can do one thirty minute workout or two depending on how much time and energy I've got. I'm tying try get back in shape after having twins a year ago, and in combination with diet, I've lost ten pounds and really noticed a difference in my arms so far in a month doing this video. I'm also alternating with other videos (Jillian Michaels, Post Natal Boot Camp, other kickboxing workouts). This workout is not the most difficult out of my collection, but it is probably an seven out of ten, which is good for alot of days.",1260403200,,555,4.295238095238095
2658609,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I did a decent amount of research before deciding on this dvd based on previous reviews.  I have tried a select few at home dvd's before, and had horrible luck. I have always thought I was just more of a gym go-er, and at home workouts just didn't fit for me.  As a newer mom with a ""baby"" that is getting older, I decided to give it one more shot as the gym became more difficult to get to.  All I can say is WoW.  I realize I have been easy on myself at the gym.  This keeps you moving at a steady pace but not so intense there are no breaks.  The moves are NOT awkward, as a previous reviewer indicated.  That is the exact reason I never liked previous dvd's and this one is actually the opposite in my oppinion.  Moves most of us are doing already, but they are very encouraging if a move is too much or you just aren't there yet, just keep moving!  My only recommendation is the first session may not be good for a brand new mom, as there are a lot of moves your body just isn't recouped from to handle yet.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd.  I don't even miss the gym so far!",1256947200,,1073,3.967289719626168
2658610,4,B000IJ7A2E,I enjoyed this workout so much when I rented it from Netflix that I had to purchase it for my collection.,1253059200,,105,4.0476190476190474
2658611,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This DVD contains three amazing 30 minute workouts. I was using Hip Hop Abs, which I still love, but was starting to get bored and decided to pick up this DVD (after I read the rave reviews) and a few others. The three instructors are legends who are very motivating and enjoyable to watch (don't get the ""Shape Ultimate Bikini Body Workout"" - different instructor, not nearly as good). It was more challenging then expected, as I had been doing 45 minute to 1 hour workouts, and the results were amazing and almost instant. It is great for those who are looking to just take that hot bod up a notch for the beach season. While there is a modified version, it is definitely a high impact DVD. If you can't do burpies or lunges due to back/knee problems, this is NOT the DVD for you. It comes with a resistance band, and you will need a set of 3 to 5 pound weights. I am going to pick up the second part ""Shape Redefining: Bikini Body Camp"". If you bought ""Shape Ultimate Bikini Body Workout"" and thought it was just OKAY, THIS ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER!",1250208000,3,1049,4.303030303030303
2658612,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This is one of the DVDs I look forward to do. The instructors are great! In fact, they are 3 of my favorite instructors. I always check to see if they have released anything new. Moves are simple yet very effective. I am looking forward to seing more in the same series.",1249257600,,270,4.211538461538462
2658613,5,B000IJ7A2E,"Don't let the title fool you. This is a very advanced workout. I did all 3 segments back to back and felt very worked out and drenched with sweat after the 90 minutes (and long before then). It is consistently advanced, high impact and never boring. I used 10 to 12 lb. dumbbells, 7 to 15 lb. kettlebells (it doesn't call for it, but I like to get creative) and a heavy resistance band (I've been doing cardio and weights for 20 years - love Cathe and Amy - so I consider myself advanced). In general, Michelle Dozois gets on my nerves and her workouts usually don't challenge me, but after a few minutes into this workout, I realized how different this one was. The other two instructors (Tracy York and Lisa Wheeler) are just great and each of their segments are challenging and interesting. I highly recommend this workout if you love to be challenged.",1248566400,2,855,4.487179487179487
2658614,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I love the option of 3 different workouts on one DVD!  Cardio, Sculpting, and Cardio/Sculpting Mix.  Only a stretch band and 3-5 lbs of dumbells are all you need to get in shape.  The segments are well put together and not boring at all.  The workouts don't waste a bit of time.  I typically reach for this DVD when I want to get in a good workout, fast.  Everyone has time for 30 minutes a day!  Yes, even you!  The biggest downside to this DVD is the lack of a proper warm-up and significant cool-down/stretch.  But the variety and specificity workouts are excellent.",1244678400,,569,4.446601941747573
2658615,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I love this one for those 30 minute workout days!  I find the workout to be effective in getting me to sweat, and love the resistance band workouts.  I think all 3 instructors are great, and really like this one a lot!  It's a staple in my DVD collection!",1239235200,2,255,4.163265306122449
2658616,4,B000IJ7A2E,"Shape Magazine has produced a decent line of at-home workout DVDs (with the possible exception of Bikini Body Cardio...), and this one is a very nice addition!  With this program, you get 3 different workouts (and yes, these workouts ARE actually different, as opposed to edited versions of the same workout): Cardio Interval, led by instructor Michelle Dozois; Sculpt Plus, led by my personal favorite, Lisa Wheeler; and Potpourri, led by Tracy York, Lisa and Michelle, in turn.  A green, stretchy resistance band is included within the DVD. Each of these programs runs 30 minutes in length.
The 1st workout, Cardio Interval, is a pretty intense and effective cardio program which follows the popular interval format (that is, a hill pattern where the intensity gradually increases, peaks out at very high intensity for a few seconds, gradually comes back down and repeats again). It certainly will blast those calories! Now that being said, I personally did not care for this workout at all and did it no more than 3 or 4 times. My reason?  I just did not find it fun! Effective? Yes. But I found it such a serious bootcamp workout that all the pleasure was squeezed out of it! I actually found myself getting tired of many of the moves, which  are repeated several times within the interval pattern. There are bootcamp staple moves such as burpees (dropping to the ground in a push-up position and then hopping back up again), jacks, tire drills, plyo jumps, etc. There are some creative moves as well (after all, Lisa Wheeler, one of the most innovative fitness choreographers in the industry, has co-designed this) such as the fencer lunge (though I personally did not like the way this felt) and the tick-tock (which though I found to be different, I thought was ineffective). But some of the moves felt so hurried to me that it seemed I was just flailing around a lot. I also did not enjoy the music, which is a typical generic dance beat. Though I didn't care for this one, a bootcamp workout CAN certainly be fun (I personally think that The Firm's Bootcamp: Maximum Calorie Burn and Denise Austin's Bootcamp:Total Body Blast both contain cardio that is both ultra-effective AND fun.) My personal opinion, nothing more!
The 2nd workout, Sculpt Plus, is a faster-paced toning workout using one set of weights and (towards the end) the resistance band that comes with the DVD. Led by Lisa, I feel this one does a pretty good job of hitting many of the muscles in your body (though it still is certainly not the best of its genre). Though the name Sculpt Plus implies - as does Lisa W. - that it is both cardio and sculpting, make no mistake, it is just faster-paced weight toning. Unless you precede this with cardio (or are not used to working out), you will not sweat much from this alone.  This program consists of moves that are often compound, that is, your lower body will be working while your upper does something or other with either your weights or the resistance band. Some lower body moves include lunging one leg back, side lunges, squats, plies, glute lifts, etc. I found the moves interesting enough and effective. I especially enjoyed the few moves (in this section there are only 3 or so) that incorporate the band. There is some slight floor ab work towards the end, but don't count on this to sculpt a six-pack! Unless you've never done a single crunch, you won't feel more than a slight pinch. I especially liked the stretching at the end of this workout. It is a floor stretch, and it is very thorough and feels GREAT!
The 3rd workout, Potpourri, is an interesting and fun mix of fitness styles. It also is the one that uses the band the most. The first 10 minutes is cardio kickboxing, led by (my girl!) Lisa Wheeler. I really liked this cardio segment, and even would repeat this first 10 minutes twice before going on to the rest of the workout b/c I loved it so much AND b/c it raised the intensity level significantly. Following Lisa's segment, Michelle is next with a 10-minute sculpting segment using one set of dumbbells and the resistance band. Again, I really enjoyed this, especially when the band was incorporated. There are some creative moves here, such as lunges while pulling the band towards your body; holding in a plank position while stretching your arm - with the band - forwards, side and backwards (harder than it sounds, believe me!); a bug crawl with the band b/t your hands; etc. I enjoyed this and definitely was challenged by this...in a fun way. The final part of this is led by Tracy York and is called ""Skills and Drills"", and is sort of an aggressive sculpting segment. Yeah, that's probably my best description.  It is not quite cardio, but being that it adds some plyo jumping to squats and adds some variation to strength moves, your heart rate will certainly elevate and the sweat will fall! It uses plain old gravity and one dumbbell.
The music in this program is not great and is a little generic, and the set is the inside of a gym (literally, there is gym equipment lined up along the side), so I personally think it could have been a little better...But for 3 full-length, solid workouts on one DVD, led by 3 knowledgeable and inspiring instructors...you can't go wrong! Recommended.",1236297600,6,5252,4.684723726977248
2658617,5,B000IJ7A2E,"Great video! Highly recommended!

Yes I would recommend being somewhat in shape prior to starting.  It took some getting used to and I actually didn't complete the first segment the first 2 times I attempted, which I found nice as I could see that I am getting more in shape as it becomes easier.  I hate wasting $$$ on a video that doesn't even break a sweat.. what's the point?  After the 1st time through (which may be a little awkward as you learn the moves) I found the moves and progression very easy to follow. In the first cardio segment the instructor goes through the steps slowly, then you go back through all the steps again, then again 2 more cutting down the reps of each move.  Then a new chain of moves start again and follows the same pattern.  There are 4 different chains of moves, that I find refreshing and different and I love the concept of doing rolling hills, bringing the intensity up and down.
The second toning segment is easy to follow and I like how they combine everything you need on one video as strength training is very important to add to your routine as cardio!
The third segment is a potpourri of 3 10min segments, for a well-rounded workout!

In conclusion, if you are serious about getting in great shape- buy this video!",1234310400,,1261,4.456521739130435
2658618,4,B000IJ7A2E,"This workout video is pretty good in the way that it really does make you work! I like that it has 3 different workouts so that you can rotate doing them, not getting sick of only one workout. These workouts will make you sweat!! Only thing is that there are days that I would like to have a little easier workout, not so hard.. these workouts are all high intensity, so for those days I want to take it a little easier, I will have to go with something else.",1231632000,,459,4.111111111111111
2658619,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I ordered this so i would have a dvd that had everything included, sculpting and cardio - but I have to say I really LOVE the cardio interval working (program 1) and I think the sculpt (#2) is okay, but I really don't like the potpourri (3#).  I kept the DVD just for the cardio program though, and I keep going back to it when i want to add a good 30 minute cardio routine to my weight lifting.  it's about rolling hills and intervals, good one to keep the heart rate up, bring it back down, bring it back up again.",1229644800,,516,4.049019607843137
2658620,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I bought this dvd, after reading all the good reviews about it and to get some more variety in my workouts.

This was a wonderful addition to my current collection.
I'm in pretty good shape and I found it challenging, it might be a little bit hard for uncoordinated people to follow at first, I come from a dancing background so I found it easy to follow but challenging in my muscles which is perfect.

The 3 workouts make me sweat tons they are short but they give you an awesome workout for sure,.
The second workout makes really sore in my butt and legs!!! Somebody mention that they don't focus on the legs? Come on! I could hardly stand up the next day.

I was looking for a pure cardio workout with no weights for cardio in between my weight workouts to give my muscles a rest. This cardio dvd is perfect for that! I do find that the cardio interval workout on the redefining dvd is a bit harder, but you do have to pick up some light weights a few times in that one. But that particular workout on the redefining workout is my absolute shape favorite, the cardio on the transforming dvd is my 2nd favorite. I love them both and use them both a few times a week. I also use Cathe Freidrich, The Firm, Jillian Michaels 30 day shred, and various other workout dvds of all types. I have lost 90 lbs and kept it off for 4 years with workout videos.

I am not very coordinated, so the beginning was difficult for me, but I did not get discouraged and pushed myself to learn the moves.  Some of the exercises I had a difficult time doing, now the more I do them the easier they have become and the harder I am able to push myself.

The pace of this routine was REALLY fast and I must admit, it will take me a bit to get it down-I'm not used to the high speed and some of the moves are new/a bit complicated to learn on the first go..but seem to be conquerable with time definitely.

And the moves are easy to follow and really get your heart pumping. I hate how some cardio DVDs don't get you moving fast enough. The weight and toning segments were really good and with the combined movements, you are saving time by working 2 areas at once. There isn't a lot of ab work in this DVD so if you want to do abs, you will need to find something else.

Of course I have reduced my caloric intake, but these workouts do help to reshape my body.

The power moves are really fun, jumping and punching the air! You do need balance, but this will help develop balance. The workouts are as intense as you put into it.

I usually do about 30-40 minutes on the elliptical, and when I began this workout, I found it to be challenging. I also like the other two workouts in the dvd. The potpourri is great because it incorporates cardio and strength. The best part of all of the workouts is that they're 30 minutes each but still effective.

I have been alternating this dvd with women's health ""the wedding workout,"" because this dvd features targeted toning segments. I highly recommend combining these two dvds. I am mainly trying to tone up and increase my cardio fitness/maintain my weight. It's a great dvd if you're already in decent shape, but I think it would be a great workout if you're trying to lose a lot of weight too.

I'm a fairly active person (run 2 miles/2-3 times a week) and I was looking for a good indoor workout. This is a good indoor workout! I'll admit; I was sore after the first time I did the workouts.  My favorite is the 3rd program, and I sweat within 5 minutes of starting. I enjoy the variety found in this program. The 1st program is upbeat and has a quick tempo; the streching at the end of the program is nice. I also like that one of the girls in the back will not only show an alternate move to what the lead is doing, but will actually do the move the whole time they are in that set. I have not made it to the second program, because I enjoy the others so much. Some of the comments the girls make while working out can be annoying when you're trying to concentrate, but you can always turn the sound off and put your own music on. If you're looking for something to move to this is a good video. You get a resistance band with the DVD and you'll need free weights for at least the 3rd program.

There are three different exercises to keep you interested and they target the whole body.  First one is a complete cardio intervals of hills.  The second is completely focused on using weights and the resistance band, and the third is a a mix of kickboxing, sculpting, and conditioning.  First time I did tried to do them though it was a little challenging to pick up the moves but don't worry the second time goes much much smoother.  I've only been doing this maybe 3-4 times a week for about a month and my body has completely transformed.

These workouts get your body trimmed and toned in the right places and they are only 30 minutes long so if you are super busy like me they are easy to fix into your schedule.  I definately suggest giving these a try if you are bored with your regular workout and need to re-motivate your fitness life.",1202083200,8,1095,4.457286432160804

I wasn't sore the next day though.  The toning workout out was great and I was drenched in sweat.  It was cardio for me as well as toning.  I will be doing the 3rd workout tomorrow and I look forward to another tough workout.  This is by far the hardest DVD workout that I have tried and owned.

Well, after 6 weeks of religiously sticking to the program, I did not lose a single pound. Uggg.
So after 6 weeks, I started combining segments 1 and 2 and doing that about 2 times per week and going back to my 50 minute step dvds the other 4 days per week. That seems to get better results for me.
Overall, I found this routine to be clear to follow, I definitely work up a sweat in the cardio segment and feel like I get a balanced work out when I do the sculpting routine. I feel the 3rd segment ""potpourri"" is the least challenging and appealing. I wish I could do just 30 minutes a day and see results.",1201651200,2,824,4.188679245283019

The second workout is really good toning with the band, I feel it the next day whenever I use it, the third is also good,but I have to admit I do the first two more. I have alot of other dvd workous that I do along with treadmill running, so I do a lot of dvd rotating,(I get bored very fast) .

I do this dvd (one workout) probably once a week on average, but it is way easier than when I first started. I am going to start adding it in more though because it is a fabulous total body workout and gets the job done and it goes by pretty quick.
For extra intensity I turn the tv down (once you get to know the dvd  moves) and put on a cd or my mp3 player on while I am working out to give myself an extra boost to make me workout harder . After the workout is over I feel pumped up enough to go for a run on the treadmill !

It comes with a resistance band, which is nice because you won't need to buy one to do the exercises that require the band.  I am taking a star off because the trainers are really annoying and offer superfluous and inane comments throughout the workout. For example, in the middle of it someone will keep saying, ""This feels great!""  or ""I want to do more of these.""  Since they don't sound all that genuine it seems rather forced -- I'd rather they just do the exercises without the commentary, or give you tips about where you should be placing your weight/reminders on keeping your back straight/etc.

2658650,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I'll be updating this review as I do more of it.

I got it about two days ago and after reading all the reviews decided to start with the 3rd workout so I wouldn't get discouraged. After previewing the first two workouts it definitely looks more difficult than any exercise DVD I've tried. I got through the 30 minutes fine, as some people have said at times it was a little fast and I felt like I needed more time to learn the moves before being able to keep up but I'm sure once I do it a few times that won't be a problem. Also as other people have said the 3rd work out feels about thrown together and random. It's kind of blah, not all that exciting, but it does work your muscles.

Next I'm going to try the 2nd workout and I don't know if I'll ever get up the courage to try the 1st, it looks so hard. I'll get back to you on that.

Okay so I've done the 2nd work out twice now and I LOVE IT! It's so intense, I sweat like crazy, and the next day my muscles feel sore. It's really fun to do, but I'm partial to sculpting work over cardio. The only thing I'd say is that sometimes I go at my own speed, like with the lunges, because I really want to make sure that I'm doing it with the correct form not just a bad way that could end up hurting me. It definitely takes perseverance but it's worth it. I use 5 lb weights and if I get too tired I switch to 3 lb weights since I'd rather do the workouts well and with intensity than do them poorly and hurt myself trying to lift a heavy weight. I love the green resistance band that came with it, really challenging.

Let's see if next I can face the cardio.

I'd like to update and say, no, I still haven't tried the cardio! But! After having done the 2nd routine for only one month I saw amazing results. My arms and legs have definition and I never get tired of doing the routine. It's definitely one of the most effective efficient dvd's I own!",1195084800,4,1901,4.018518518518518

Each of these three 30 minute segments will blast the fat. The cardio section is done in very effective intervals (or hills as they call them). The sculpting could use a little more reps with the arm toning, but the leg work made my muscles sore for a couple days after. Also in the sculpting section they do compound moves that move quickly so you even get a little cardio benefit out of it, too. The Potpourri gives you a little sample of toning and cardio. I did all three workouts and it definitely was a sweatfest after I was done. I would rate this an an upper-intermediate level and found it very challenging.

2658665,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a workout DVD that can REPLACE my gym workout, not provide me with something a little extra on a ""down"" day.  Lucky for me, unlucky for my muscles, I got what I asked for.

Program 1 is a cardio workout simulating hills so your heart rate goes up and down steadily.  This workout is very intense, and I wouldn't recommend it if you have weak knees due to the jumping lunges and jumping jacks.  Ouch.  I am used to doing 50 min. of moderate/intense training on the elliptical, where I only produce a thin sheen of sweat--not with this one!  I definitely had to stop in the middle to have some H2O.  Everytime I do any of the Shape workouts I lose about 2 lbs of water weight.  Interesting.  I will also note that I go to the gym about 4-5 times a week and am not overweight.  These workouts are challenging to people who are in shape, not just a moderate exerciser.

Program 2 is sculpting...I think there is a little too much emphasis on the arms in this one instead of the legs, but oh well.  I also wish there was a section just for abs instead of them just telling me to squeeze my abs while I did the other exercises.  After lifting for so long I could barely lift my arms and they do shoulders (full extension) towards the end of the weights section, which I think is a terrible idea!!!

Program 3 is a mix of kickboxing, sculpting, and drills.  On my first rotation of the 3 programs, I had to take a day off between programs 2 and 3 to let my muscles heal, because after 2 I could barely stand and definitely could not do a squat or lunge!  Now, this program is either the easiest of all three, or I'm getting the hang of these crazy workouts, because today I'm only a little sore.  I was still sweating a lot during this one though (yup, 2 lbs of water weight gone).

Overall, I really like how there are a variety of workouts on one DVD; you can do it everyday without getting bored (so far).  I am going to continue with the program they suggest of rotating the workouts 5 times a week to see if I tone up some.  However, if I update my review and say that I lost like 10 lbs or something crazy like that, I'm still going to the gym like 4 times a week in addition--so, doing two workouts a day may contribute further to my weight loss, hah.

This one had a lot of compound movements (using upper and lower body at the same time) for maximum calorie burning and it used the major muscles like quads, gluts and hamstrings.

If you have knee or ankle problems, this DVD is too high impact.  Also, since I used to be a personal trainer, I know how to do a squat the correct way so as not to injure myself. If you have not been instructed, this DVD won't instruct you either. They assume you have a certain level of fitness and a certain level of knowledge before beginning this workout.

So my recommendation is don't get this workout DVD if you are new to working out, haven't worked out in a very long time, or can't do high impact workouts because you have knee or ankle problems.

There are a lot of good things about this video, and a few not-so-good things that I've found as well.

First, the good.  The video consists of three half-hour routines (cardio, sculpting/toning, and skills and drills) that you can rotate, so you won't get bored easily.  The instructors aren't annoying, and they show you modifications throughout the video so you don't strain yourself if you're not in top shape.  The routines are challenging enough to where, even after a full two weeks, I still have trouble getting all the way through each workout.  This is good--it gives me something to work up to.

The marketing of the video is great, too.  Instead of just another ""burn fat fast"" video, they slapped the word ""bikini"" on it so you're constantly reminded of what your ultimate goal is.  In addition, the instructors throw in motivational phrases every now and then.  They'll say things like, ""This exercise will give you that great bikini butt you're looking for!"" and ""This will tone your shoulders for those tank tops at the beach.""  I found it very motivational, without going overboard and becoming annoying.

I also really liked the fact that they included the free resistance band with the DVD.  It's such a small detail but I appreciated the fact that they made it so easy to do their workouts.  (By the way, you'll also need a set of light, 3-5 pound weights for this video).

And now for the few not-so-good things.  One thing that initially annoyed me was the way the routines go so fast that I would sometimes get lost.  I'm a pretty clumsy person.  Add to that the fact that I've never done one of these videos before, and it was a little frustrating.  However, after  doing the video a few times I found that it became much easier, so it's not really that big a deal.  If a klutz like me can learn the moves, it shouldn't be a problem for anyone.

The other thing I didn't like is that they suggest doing the video five days in a row and then taking two days' rest.  For someone like me, with knee and shin problems, doing this five days in a row was a bit painful.  I end up doing three days in a row and then doing a low-impact pilates video on the fourth day so I don't kill my shins.

But I guess the best judge of a video should be what kind of results it gets.  Like I said, I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks but I'm already seeing results that I like.  My work pants are now too big, my love handles are shrinking, my buns are tighter, and my confidence has gone up in leaps and bounds.  I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a start in the intimidating world of exercise videos.  It's my first one and I definitely plan on purchasing some more--assuming I ever get bored with this one, that is.",1175904000,17,2968,4.353369763205829
2658673,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I've been exercising almost every day for about a year.  Usually I do the Crunch Pilates and Bootcamp DVDs, coupled with Jari Love's Ripped series, so I'm a fairly experienced exerciser.

I wanted to find a cardio routine that was fast, effective, but didn't use weights, to use on my days that I don't do weight training (since unfortunately, you aren't supposed to do it every day).  All the reviews of different cardio dvds I saw had at least two or three people saying the dvd wasn't hard enough.

When I saw the reviews on this DVD, I knew I had to try it out.

THIS DVD IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE.  In half an hour, I burned 218 calories.  That's more calories per 15 minute increment than any of my other dvds.  AND, that's with me only being able to keep up about 2/3 of the time (physically I was able to, but coordination-wise, it was a no-go through some of this).

The moves are fast and confusing.  It will definitely take me a while to get this routine down.  Lots of jumping around, flailing your arms around, jumping up and down, etc.  If you're in an upstairs apartment and are a morning exerciser (like me), this dvd is sure to irritate your neighbors. I recommend toe sox and foregoing shoes, just to keep a modicum of harmony in your building.

I find a lot of the moves are similar to my Crunch Pilates and Crunch Bootcamp dvds, mainly the ""knee repeater"" (although they don't call it that on this dvd), and some of the arm work, and definitely the stretches at the end.

This dvd isn't as hard on my knees as other dvds I've done, either.

I got this dvd for the the first program, the hardcore cardio one, because I wanted a super intense, fast workout. This first program provides it.  I was definitely sweating and my heart rate was the highest I've ever seen it. I haven't tried the other two programs yet.  I'm not sure how the long green strap I received works on the second program, but when I do that one and figure it out, I'll edit my review.

I take away one star because there's no counter displayed on my dvd, just ""play."" I'm obsessed with time and I need that counter display.",1175731200,23,2109,4.364102564102564
2658674,5,B000IJ7A2E,I loved this DVD. You get an awesome workout in only a half hour. It is great if you are short on time. The instructors are great and in only 2 weeks I am totally seeing results!,1175472000,,178,3.8378378378378377
2658675,5,B000IJ7A2E,This tape starts out hoppin' and keeps the pace up the entire time. I would consider it intermediate as you will die of exhaustion if you are not somewhat fit. It was a great workout and it will be one of my favorites. There are three different 30 minute segments to give variety.,1175212800,3,280,4.30188679245283
2658676,4,B000IJ7A2E,"I've been working out to this DVD 4 days a week for about 3 weeks and I have seen some great results! I have lost 8lbs and have started to see some muscles ""coming back to life"", which is very encouraging. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the first workout is very tough! It is a fast-paced, higher impact cardio interval workout, and I had a lot of trouble with it at the start. It's taken me almost a month, but now I can almost finish it! The fact that I made this progress must mean the workouts are doing something. The other 2 workouts on the DVD are not unreasonable, I definitely look forward to them after that first one. Warning: There are many swats squeezed into these workouts, your glutes will feel the burn!

I would recommend this DVD to a person who is used to regular exercise and can jump right into it. I am a beginner and I struggle to keep up, though I'm improving through persistence. It's okay to not finish a workout the first few times. Your patience will be rewarded. The instructors are very motivating, and what's nice to see is that by the workout's end, they are sweating right along with you!

This DVD workout will hit every muscle group, via its variety. It is a great tool if you cannot go to the gym and have limited time, but still want a workout that combines strength and cardio.",1174608000,11,1335,4.314741035856573
2658677,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I am an avid speed walker and I have been looking for a dvd that is easy to follow cardio.  I am not the most coordinated person, so fancy move are not my thing.  The 1st 30 minutes of this video are a tough cardio workout.  Better than any treadmill.  The next 30 minutes is easier sculpting, and the last 30 minutes is a potpourri.  I strongly recommend this dvd.  The full 90 minutes give you a great butt kicking workout.",1174003200,3,425,4.185185185185185
2658678,3,B000IJ7A2E,"I like the way this program is broken down, presented, and made pretty user friendly.

But the reason I bought this was for a 30 minute program I can use each morning.

I find myself forcing myself to work out...which is not what I want out of a workout DVD. I want to WANT to do it.

Also, it's a struggle to get through. During the cardio, I can BARELY make it through half (though I'm not in perfect shape, I have been working out every week for over a year..). And the moves are repetitive, and sometimes seemingly meaningless.

The sculpt interval, the second program, is my favorite. You still have your heartrate up even just using hand weights and the included band.

The third potpurri program is okay as well, but nothing I look forward to.

If you are looking to feel FORCED to work out...this is good.

But I can safely say, I've used this consistently for 3 weeks and seen NO results.

But maybe I can a NON-bikini body.... :-P",1173657600,4,940,4.362068965517241
2658679,5,B000IJ7A2E,If you are bouncing extra weight with this program you'll need the Aleve like me!!!  It made me more determined to get the moves down as my skin jiggles.  If you want to face the music and admit we have a weight issue.  This will get you where it hurts.  LOVE THE PAIN Ladies!,1172707200,5,276,4.055555555555555
2658680,2,B000IJ7A2E,"This workout is for people who are already in shape and may want a different routine. It is extremely fast paced and requires high energy for a 30 minute workout. I, who am trying to get in shape, could not finish the program and didn't find it encouraging as the program went on.",1172534400,7,280,4.30188679245283
2658681,2,B000IJ7A2E,"I purchased a couple of the DVDs in the ""Shape: Bikini Body Camp series"", including this one, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed.  The reviews all looked fabulous, but when I did it myself I found I was thoroughly bored.  I definitely felt the exercises were difficult enough, and definitely felt the burn.  However, there isn't much here that I haven't seen before.  I didn't feel like I was doing anything ""new"".  Also, the instructors don't really break down the moves for you, and I often found myself lost as they continued into a completely different position out of nowhere.  I suppose if I did this DVD all the time, I might get the routine down, but the first few times it was just infuriating.  I did enjoy the resistance band included in the package, but it was a bit difficult to maneuver this, hand weights, AND keep up with them at the same time!",1171843200,14,869,4.462025316455696
2658682,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This is a tough workout (for me who does mainly yoga)...I did a session today on my lunch hour and it was great! It's a fun, fast paced workout and you'll definetly sweat on this one. You'll use hand weight and a body band which is included with the DVD. You can't go wrong on this one if you want to get in shape for summer! This one's great!",1171584000,9,343,3.9855072463768115
2658683,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This is a fantastic workout.  As someone who runs and lifts already, I sometimes find that videos don't push me enough.  Not the case with this video.  The cardio had me out of breath and in a sweat (of course, there are modifications for beginners).  The 30-minute workouts are just long enough for a busy gal.  The instructors are motivating and not irritating.  It's nice to see a video with three qualified instructors rather than one 'star' and several backup exercisers.",1171497600,2,476,4.814814814814815
2658684,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This video is fantastic! My roommate and I did it last night for the first time and I felt the burn. I did the Potpurri workout (30 min) and can't think of a muscle that wasn't burning. If you do this even twice a week I have no doubt that you will see great results. The movements were generally easy to follow, although they are not really broken down. And honestly, I was so busy sweating that I didn't even pay attention to the music. The weight resistance band was a little strecthy, but you can always order one with more resistance. Can't wait to try the other 2 portions of the video!",1170201600,5,592,4.247787610619469

8145898,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I have had both the Shape Bikini Body Camp Redefining and the Transforming dvd's since I was 40 years old, I am now 49. I had the best body in my 40's than I ever did in my earlier years. I hurt my knee recently so I had to take some time off and of course I gained weight,  too much weight!  I have The Zumba dvds and Shawn T's Rockin Body dvds but I tell you,  nothing whips your booty into shape like the Shape Dvd's. I always go back to these.

These will not disappoint,  my butt looked better in jeans,  my quads and calves were so sculpted and lean I had other women say they wanted legs like mine. I also had more energy and slept better at night plus it helps to be in shape going through menopause.

If I can sit on my booty and watch TV for hours I can invest 30 min looking and feeling good about myself. You can too!  What is 30 min in the whole scheme of things? I do these in my undies,  shoes and a jog bra,  then jump in the shower and I'm good to go.

I went on a school ski trip recently with my kids,  all the other moms were dead by noon. I skied the whole day and packed up drove home and I wasn't tired or sore the next day. It was an amazing experience. Get them you won't be sorry, well maybe the first week but I did the cardiovascular first took a day off then jumped right in doing the other 2 on this dvd and I wasn't too sore. Start with the cardiovascular,  trust me. It's tough but remember they are only 30 min you can do it!  If I can you can and don't forget your water. Pause the dvd if you need to but keep it up you will love your body.  You will truly see results sooner than you think,  my 15 yr old daughter is doing them now!",1428883200,,1667,3.8304093567251463

8145901,5,B000IJ7A2E,I bought this to be able to have something to work out with indoors during the winter and cold months.  I feel like the workouts are very tough and gets your body in shape quickly.  I own a few different workout DVDs and like to rotate between them.  This one is my 2nd favorite one.,1365120000,,283,4.109090909090909
8145902,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I agree that this is not really a ""beginner"" workout, but if you keep with it, it gets easier. For example, when there are only three workouts on the dvd, it doesn't change. They will always do the same things in the same order. I do recommend watching the workout first so as to see what the moves look like and to see how fast the transitions are.
I really like the second workout the best. It's great to work out all the muscles in your body.",1361232000,,445,4.126436781609195

The instructors cue well and give good tips on form throughout the workout. They are peppy and encouraging without being over the top manic.
This DVD delivers, highly recommended.",1359244800,,442,4.753246753246753
8145904,5,B000IJ7A2E,"I love this DVD.  So far, I've just been doing the first workout, which is the cardio one.  My review therefore focusses solely on the first cardio workout - I think it's worth buying the DVD for that workout alone.  I've been doing it for just over a week now, and can feel I'm getting a bit fitter already because it doesn't take me as long to recover my breath afterwards.  And I'm beginning to sweat a little less.  I love the structure of the workout - you have intense periods followed by lighter, recovery bits.  That makes you work as hard as you possibly can, while still keeping it manageable.  The hardest bits are the burpees and the ""atomic"" lunges - they are very effective in getting you exhausted very quickly!  The choreography is very simple to follow, and if you stick at it, you will definitely notice yourself getting fitter.  I've been doing it almost every day for just over a week, and already I can feel I'm a tiny bit fitter.  Without the cool down at the end, the cardio section takes around 25mins, which I think is very efficient.  I choose to do my own separate, longer stretch and cool-down.  If you are moderately fit, then this should challenge you for a while.  If you're new to exercise, probably not the DVD to start with!",1341792000,,1258,4.441048034934497
8145905,5,B000IJ7A2E,"This DVD is the bomb.  Each 30 minute workout is friendly yet challenging and incorporates both strength and cardio.  It's remarkable that at the end of such a short time i feel like all of my muscles were used.  The cardio portion is much more intense than walking ""rolling hills"" as described on the package, but it mixes things up so often you probably won't mind the challenge.  There is quite a bit of variety within each workout and between each workout--classic aerobics movements, burpees, squats, presses, kickboxing, shuffles, lunges, etc...  Effective and fun.",1303171200,,571,5.031914893617022
