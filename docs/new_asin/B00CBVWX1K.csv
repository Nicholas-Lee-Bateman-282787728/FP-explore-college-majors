8580081,2,B00CBVWX1K,Really a boring cartoon that deals with high school girls and somehow they are spies. It is all over the place in terms of storyline and each episode usually has nothing to do with previous one.,1413158400,,194,4.416666666666667

8580084,5,B00CBVWX1K,"Totally Spies! This show was a big part of my childhood with a lot of other shows. And I'm glad dvds have finally been released. Sam, Alex, and Clover are amazing. I just love to see their totally amazing adventures.",1404950400,,216,4.425
8580085,4,B00CBVWX1K,"It's a funny cartoon that even guys can enjoy. I can't really watch it for over 2 hours at a time but it's a nice break from the normal shows you usually see. In a way, it reminds me of sailormoon when it first started out because of the comedy it also had for a short time. What makes this show even better though is that it has always been funny with plenty of action too! I would also recommend Kim Possible for it's constant comedy and action too!",1384560000,,451,4.078651685393258
8580086,5,B00CBVWX1K,"Like, ever heard of ""Totally Spies!"" ?  Y'know, three hot, young teen girls Sam, Alex, and Clover who have some wicked cool adventures as secret agents of the World Organization Of Human Protection or WOOHP for short.  I'm sure you've heard of this series before because it was on the Cartoon Network a few years ago.  Anywho, you can relive the fabulous adventures of these fine young ladies as they travel the globe stopping the cray-cray schemes of bad guys of all kinds and hope they make it back to school on time in their hometown of Beverly Hills.

This volume, ""Top-Secret Missions"" has the first 13 episodes from the first season such as:

""A Thing for Musicians"" - Overnight pop sensation Ricky Mathis has overly crazed fans because his music hypnotizes all who listen to it.  Our girls go undercover as Ricky's backup band, ""The Spies"" to figure out the real mastermind of this scheme.
""The New Jerry"" - The girls discover that their boss Jerry has retired and his replacement is a handsome young man named Mac Smit who spoils the girls with great, but suddenly dangerous gifts.  Also, the girls discover that a villain named Tim Scam has escaped and must track him down.
""The Get Away"" - Jerry treats our spy girls to a Hawaiian vacation.  It's nothing but sun, fun, and suspicious volcanic activity all around for the girls.
""Eraser"" - In Bora Bora, scientists are having their minds zapped away by weird blob creatures.  Also, Sam saves the life of snooty girl Mandy who stops at nothing to repay Sam, especially when Sam and her friends have a mission to take on.
""Stuck in the Middle Ages with You"" - Scientists who are studying time travel have been taken hostage in the Middle Ages by an evil knight who's trying to get back at his royal lineage.  Our spy girls, who are thinking of costumes for a Halloween contest, must fix history at all costs.
""Fugitives"" - Sam, Clover, and Alex are mistaken for committing crimes.  The trio must clear their good names before things get worse.
""Model Citizens"" - While Clover tries to compete in a beauty pageant, she and her friends encounter a villainess who is stealing features from other people to make perfect-bodied models.
""Silicon Valley Girls"" - When a boy's supercomputer system goes haywire by taking over the world and those who have wrongly accused of him, our spy girls must shut it down and fast !
""Passion Patties"" - Kooky cookies that taste deliciously addicting are making those who eat it increasingly obese, including Clover who is frustrated about a designer hat being too small for her.

As a final note, the action-packed series ""Totally Spies!"" is very cool and unique with its special brand of girl power involved.  It also pretty much chronicles the average lives of typical spoiled teenage girls who lead double lives as secret agents which makes the show pretty cool, too, making it visually appealing to both girls and boys alike.  So for that that matter, look for more new DVDs of the spy gals' adventures coming soon !",1377820800,,3008,4.704761904761905
8580087,5,B00CBVWX1K,Totally Spies is one of the best cartoons to ever be created and I can't wait for these releases. Ever since I heard that New  Video Group got the rights to the series I knew had to get them and I hope that I can get the whole series on dvd.,1368921600,,241,3.7254901960784315
8580088,5,B00CBVWX1K,"Finally at long last, it looks like we are going to get the complete series released on DVD in the USA of Totally Spies.

Season 1 in two DVD releases combined is due this August. The only previous USA releases were 3 volumes with just 2-3 episodes each from when the show originally premiered in the USA and since then France where the series was made and is owned has refused to allow USA releases to the high in demand series, apart from a Canada Exclusive release of Season 2, but now looks like they are finally allowing the High In Demand USA Audience to get the series complete on DVD starting with Season 1 this August.

So far, six seasons exist of Totally Spies with 26 episodes per season, equaling 156 episodes in total.

Totally Spies, is a very good top quality unique cartoon animated series of female heroes being lead by an old man, and there is lots of true adult theme and adult love humor in it because in France similar to Japan along with the unlimited involvement France has had with Japanese Anime, is very good at making cartoons aimed at very young kids including cute fury animal type cartoons with lots of adult themed story lines and humor, which America doesn't do anymore since 1968 with cartoons aimed at young kids, but thankfully they've carried on that way in Europe & Japan Etc. The fact the 1970's was a poor decade of animation, Most modern 1980's/90's American cartoons aimed at young kids act too educational with no true adult theme humor.

I collect all new cartoon titles worldwide up to the year 2002 as long as they exist in English Language and were released in English in 2002 or before. There are unlimited amounts of 1990-2002 European, Canada Via France & Japanese cartoons aimed at young kids loaded with more realistic adult themed humor compared to American cartoons aimed at young kids that existed in English Language at the time which never made it to TV in the USA, but there are lots of DVDS available in different European countries which include English Language options including in lots of Foreign Language countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Czeck Republic plus a few more as well as Canada & the UK.

Hope they release the other 5 seasons very soon of Totally Spies.",1367280000,5,2236,4.6221662468513856
