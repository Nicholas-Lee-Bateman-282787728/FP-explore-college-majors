4135418,5,B003L1ZWA8,"I watched this film in Kansas.  I've never been to City Island, but after seeing this film, I'd sure like to visit there.  There's nothing wrong with this movie.  The acting comes through wonderfully from every single actor, especially Andy Garcia.  How much more touching can you get than a story about a man who is so ashamed of his desire to become an actor, he'd rather have his wife think he's having an affair?  It's funny.  See this movie and feel a bit happier for it.",1280793600,2,476,4.413793103448276
4135419,5,B003L1ZWA8,"First, I'll admit (and preface this review with) that I will see anything with Andy Garcia in it ..... I am a huge fan. Aside from that, this movie was AWESOME! I laughed and cried at different points throughout the movie. And, I learned of a place that I had never heard of. I will own this movie as part of my collection. Thank goodness for our little independent movie theater here in Las Cruces or I may never have have had the pleasure of seeing this film. A real winner!!!",1278806400,3,478,4.263736263736264
4135420,5,B003L1ZWA8,"If you like to see stories with heart, where the characters develop, grow and find success in their own small universes, then this film will deliver. If you liked Little Miss Sunshine, you will love this film.

It's wonderfully acted, and it's a really FUN story! Is it a perfect film? Darn close. In my book, a film with heart can surpass those that are ""better"" made. This is one of my favorite films of the year.

Sometimes, a film just sells itself. This is the case with this film.

Trust me. JUST BUY IT!",1278201600,4,510,4.347368421052631
4135421,3,B003L1ZWA8,"It's almost unfair to try and explain the plot of City Island because it would spoil the fun of watching it unfold in front of you. It's not really that original a story, mind you, but the way the talented cast brings it to life is inspired enough to make any predictability forgivable.

4135422,4,B003L1ZWA8,"Compelling new releases have been somewhat hard to come by at the Multiplex lately, so out of mild desperation for entertainment more than anything, my wife and I went to see CITY ISLAND.  What a wonderful treat this movie is!  It's so full of heart and messages of affirmation that we immediately told others about it.  If by some chance it drifts into a theater near you...check it out.

CITY ISLAND introduces us to the Rizzo family.  Father Vince (Andy Garcia) is a prison guard.  His wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) is an office manager.  They have two teenage kids, college student Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorida) and high schooler Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller).  They live on the amazing City Island, a place I've never heard of (but I came home and found it on a map of the NYC area.)  It's an island just off the ""coast"" of the Bronx...a sort of fishing village in the middle of a major metropolitan area.  The Rizzo's are solidly middle class, but because their family has owned this house for 3 generations, they live right on a beach with a view of the city!  The island is truly a character in the film, and one day, I'd love to drive through it.

Each Rizzo has a secret.  Vivian has lost her scholarship and rather than tell her parents, she's working a pole dancer to earn money to pay for her own return to school.  Junior is a super-smart kid (he's like the precocious son on UNITED STATES OF TARA) with a fetish for feeding huge quantities of food to very large women.  Wife Joyce is mostly just unhappy, because she feels distant from her husband.  That distance is no doubt created by Vince's big secret.  He tells his wife he's going to ""poker games"" when in fact, he's going into the city to take acting lessons.  He feels deep shame over this secret desire, and of course, his wife picks up those vibes and assumes Vince is actually having an affair.  And he only spills his secrets to a classmate (Emily Mortimer), a lovely, wacky, fragile Englishwoman with secrets of her own.  The two of them are drawn together deeply, but not as lovers but as co-conspirators and as two individuals deeply drawn to acting.

This would all be complicated enough...but Vince has another secret that comes home to roost.  Decades before, even before he'd met Joyce, he had a child out of wedlock and abandoned the mother and child.  Then one day, his now grown son ends up as an inmate at the prison.  Vince offers to take this stranger Tony (Steven Strait) out of prison to live with him at his home, because the only thing keeping Tony in jail was the lack of anyone willing to vouch for him.  But Vince is so secretive, he tells NO ONE (except Emily Mortimer) that Tony is his son.  Naturally Vince's family wonders just what the heck has gotten into Vince...bringing this strange ex-con to live in their home.

You might gather just from the paragraph above that CITY ISLAND relies on coincidence.  It is, in fact, packed with coincidence...and I've heard other say that the plot resembles a Greek tragedy in its entanglements and coincidences.  HUGE, massive misunderstandings and hurt feelings ensue.

But the film has a splendid, optimistic heart.  We root for ALL the characters in the film, big and small.  Each person has traits that drive the viewer crazy, but each has a warm center and generally good intentions.  The plot may be lacking in credibility, but it is so skillfully written and so earnestly performed that we joyfully cast aside objections to the ludicrous proceedings and just kick back and enjoy.  EVERYONE in the film is good, but I must give special mention to Steven Strait (sadly, known to me only from 10,000 BC) and Andy Garcia.  Strait is perfect in this part.  We see that he's not really a hardened criminal, but we  also see the danger lurking.  He's a gentle soul who has been badly mistreated for much of his life.  Yet he is also very amusing as we watch him watching this dysfunctional family he has joined.  And Garcia is one of the most winning ""heroes"" I've seen in awhile.  He hides his secrets with no malice...he just assumes he'll be ridiculed for his acting.  We can see how he has hidden his ""real"" self for so many years.  And he plays perplexed very well indeed.  (I'll also mention that Garcia is working with his own daughter on this film, playing his fictional daughter.  It's nepotism...but she certainly is very fine in the role, and desired it.)

There is an audition scene that is absolutely hilarious.  It probably helps to have been an actor to truly appreciate it...but honestly, I can't imagine anyone not laughing outloud and strongly rooting for poor Vince during this scene.  I'd almost say the movie is worth seeing just for that...but fortunately, it's worth seeing for everything else as well.

Overlook the preposterous plot and enjoy the warm characters and lovely scenery of CITY ISLAND.",1274227200,6,4861,4.64906103286385
4135423,5,B003L1ZWA8,"It sounds glib to call Raymond De Felitta's ""City Island"" this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" yet the comparison is apt. Both films depict dysfunctional families nearing collapse, and both are blessed with razor-sharp screenplays and ensemble casts that are wonderfully, hilariously perfect. Each member of the cast (especially top-billed Andy Garcia) gives an Oscar-worthy performance, and all will be robbed if they don't win the Screen Actors Guild Best Ensemble Cast Award next year.

The eponymous ""City Island"" is a small community just off the shoreline of the Bronx, officially part of that borough but with a small-town charm all its own. As Molly Charlesworth (Emily Mortimer), one of the film's characters, declares, ""It's a cross between New England and Washington Heights!"" Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) is a ""clamdigger"" (a lifelong resident of City Island), as opposed to a ""mussel-sucker"" (someone who moves to City Island, or one of those very rare natives who moves away). Vince works as a prison guard (though he prefers the term ""corrections officer""), but that job doesn't seem to satisfy him these days. His wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies), daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) and son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) wonder why Vince has a ""poker game"" almost every night, and also why he's brought paroled convict Tony Nardella (Steven Strait) home to live with them. The other Rizzos, meanwhile, are harboring secrets of their own...

To reveal any more of the plot would be sabotage. Let's just say the bickering of the Rizzo family reaches critical mass, with catharsis to follow. In any case, you fall in love with all the characters, and although you might be a little leery of some of the things they do, you'd still be happy to have them all over for your Sunday barbeque. ""City Island"" is a funny, charming, touching must-see.",1272844800,42,1849,5.099009900990099
4135424,4,B003L1ZWA8,"Reading - and the movies - offer the opportunity to explore new and unusual places, some of them not far from home. Thus, the movie ""City Island"" introduced me to a small fishing village of that name in, the Bronx, New York, of all places.  City Island is a quaint close-knit fishing village of about 4000 people on the west end of Long Island Sound.  This movie, which won the audience award at the Tribecca Film Festival in 2009, is set and was filmed in City Island.  It is a town of old homes, beaches, bridges, fishing vessels, and the water. Residents of City Island distinguish between ""Mussel Suckers"" - the larger part of the community born outside the community and ""Clam Diggers"" those residents who grew up in City Island.  This distinction is carried over into the movie.

The story itself might have happened anywhere, but it gains strength by the setting in a small urban area where people seemingly know their neighbors. The movie tells of the secrets that people hold from those closest to them and of the difficulties of opening up. The main character is the Rizzo family.  Vincent Rizzo, played by Andy Garcia who also produced the movie is a middle-aged corrections office (he resents the term ""prison guard"") who harbors dreams of being an actor.  He attends acting school one evening a week and, to avoid embarrassment, tells his disbelieving wife that he is out for a poker night. A woman student at the acting school with secrets of her own encourages Vince who begins as an imitator of Marlon Brando and learns to act in his own person and character. Against odds, newcomer Vince auditions for a tough-guy part in a movie by Scorsese.

Vince's  hard-bitten wife, Joyce, (Juliana Margulies) feels lonely and frustrated as she feels the passion between Vincent and herself has died. She thinks Vince is having an affair during his ""poker night"" and of course thinks the worst when she meets Vince's acting companion. The couple have two children, Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) who unknown to her family has dropped out of college and is working as a stripper in the hope of returning to school  and high school student Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller).  Ezra is strongly attracted to big beautiful women (BBWs), including his neighbor who has a BBW cam site  and a young girl in his high school class who at the outset spurns him. It was endearing and refreshing to see a story of men who are attracted to large women. Vince Rizzo also has a secret in that before his marriage to Joyce he fathered a child and then left the mother.  The son he had never met, Tony, (Steven Sttrait) winds up in prison.  Without revealing his identity, Vince brings Tony into his home.  The movie features a long denouement in which the family, and other associated characters level with each other and learn who they themselves, and the other people, each are.

City Island is an entertaining well-acted movie about the difficulty of knowing self and others. In an unpretentious way, it gets inside the feelings and dreams of its characters.  But the movie also taught me about a place I hadn't seen or heard of before and made it come to life. I loved seeing it, and I found getting to know City Island the place the main attraction of this movie.

4136081,3,B003L1ZWA8,"Eh, it was ""ok""... A little weird- lots of ""dysfunctional"" issues & weirdness,- but presented in a sort of ""semi-humorous way"" so I suppose that's supposed to make it funny? Idk... BUT if you're expecting this to be 90mins worth of dysfunctional-knee-slappin-laughs,-- it is not. Not really a ""lighthearted"" movie per say... So, I guess, to sum it up: heavy, weird, dysfunctional issues masked by, & mixed with ""stupid-humor""... Idk what else to say really about that... The End.",1426723200,,479,5.075949367088608
