3729381,5,B001O8ALBU,"The ""Amerika"" miniseries is the story of a Soviet occupation of the United States circa 1988.  Evidently (the series is a little vague about this) the Soviets explode Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapons over the United States, leading to a breakdown in communications and an end to US military capability.  The Soviets occupy the USA with United Nations Special Service Unit (UNSSU) soldiers, and America undergoes ""The Transition"" which is essentially a transition, aided by Gulag-style concentration camps and Leftist American Quisling politicians, to Soviet-style Socialism.  The Soviets divide the country into ""Administrative Areas"" under the domination of the ""American Unity Party"" which in reality is the Communist Party.  The President and Congress become figureheads to the Soviet National and Area ""Advisors.""

The story is ultimately inspiring.  Kris Kristofferson stars as Devin Milford, a charismatic American politician who had been jailed in the American Gulag following ""The Transition.""  He seeks to oppose the Soviet plans for America.  Most of the best scenes in this film involve Kristofferson, particularly the inspiring scene in front of a Chicago Federal Courthouse in which Kristofferson rouses the crowd by reciting the now-forbidden Pledge of Allegiance.  This scene is brilliantly acted and directed, and the reaction of the crowd, which finally acknowledges the love that most citizens ultimately have for the America that the Founders envisioned, is unforgettable.

The special effects in this film are outstanding.  The UNSSU troops and equipment appear frighteningly real, and the downtrodden American ""Zeks"" and Exiles look authentic.  The actors who play the pro-Soviet American Quisling politicians are even more frightening in their authenticity than the Soviet troops.  In one depressing scene, we see a sixth-grade history classroom in which a pro-Soviet teacher is explaining that pre-Soviet America was a bad country in which ""the rich and powerful plundered the continent, oppressed the workers, and killed the peaceful Indians.""  Not much different from today's public-school curriculum.  We didn't need the Soviets.  We did it to ourselves.

This film is as relevant now as it ever was, notwithstanding the demise (and perhaps resurrection) of the Soviet Union.  The film points out that the Government needs ""only two things to establish a totalitarian state.  Control of the media, and the power to dispense or withhold privilege.""  Today (2010) we have a one-party media that has abandoned the principle of objective journalistic coverage and most all pretense of providing anything but pro-Statist coverage.  We have a near-Trillion dollar TARP program for dispensing Governmental largesse to favored political groups, i.e. the UAW, etc.  Again, we did not need the Soviets.  We have done it ourselves to ourselves.

Pro-Leftist miniseries such as the forgettable ""The Day After"" are shown on television constantly, and are released and re-released on DVD, but ""Amerika"" is very hard to obtain and was only shown on television one time.  Apparently it was released in only small quantities in DVD.  I was fortunate to find one on Amazon.  If you find it, buy it. Then lend it out to friends. Highly recommended.

3729382,3,B001O8ALBU,"Just finished watching all five episodes of the 1987 alternate history film Amerika, which portrays life in Soviet-occupied America ten years after the Federal Government has effectively surrendered. As drama, Amerika rarely rises above the pedestrian and sees words, rather than actions, as the main ingredient of resistance to foreign oppression. For many viewers, this results in a very tedious exposition, interspersed with occasional acts of violence but with the emphasis upon internal debate. Those who put Amerika together want to pose the question (again and again) about what it means to be an American (short answer: it's not a flag or the land, but ""us"" and how can we give ""us"" up?). Kris Kristofferson, cast as a semi-rehabilitated congressman who once dared to question the easy slide into totalitarianism, leads the charge to revive the American spirit while his former friend, Robert Urich, opts into the Soviet scheme to Balkanize the United States by dividing it into weaker, more easily manipulated client states. There is some real drama here and even some important issues, but it seems at points like Amerika is held together more with spit and good intentions, rather than solid writing, directing or acting. Overall, Amerika provides an interesting look at an alternate outcome, putting the lie to the assertion that `the opposite of war is peace' and poses questions about where our loyalties lie that are likely uncomfortable for some Americans today. Obviously, this is a very controversial film, which is what makes it worth watching.

 Given the conflict between those who would tear down the old United States and replace it with a Communist puppet state, Amerika does not really delve into some of the meat-and-potatoes issues of resistance. Throughout the film, the resistance is murky - too murky to seem substantial (even Sam Neil, portraying a KGB officer, jokes about how pathetic the resistance is) and given the number of people with guns in pre-Soviet America, rather odd. Soviet seizures of personal property, including most cars, many homes and other property are detailed but there is no mention of any real resistance to this; it is unlikely that millions of Americans would meekly hand over their property to foreign invaders without more of a fight. Instead, most Americans are portrayed as unusually apathetic and even sheep like, tolerating one outrage after another and only moved to action when Kristofferson speaks out. Another odd omission in Amerika is the absence of religion which given powerful resistance posed by the Church-Solidarity combination in Poland (already happening when this film was made) appears weird. Nor is there any mention of the Communists closing churches or enforcing atheism, but that would be bound to engender resistance as well. Thus the Communist levers of oppression that normally fuel resistance - seizure of property and elimination of personal freedoms - are shown but disembodied from their effects.

 As Kristofferson gradually energizes the rural townsfolk to take back their pride as Americans and resist, the viewer will find themselves looking for some kind of answer to ""how?"" but this film provides few answers. On the tactical level, it is clear that the resisters have little chance against Soviet tanks and helicopters and there is a doomed sense of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising about this part of the film. On the strategic level, the viewer knows that the Soviet characters have revealed that the Politburo is willing to employ nuclear attacks against several American cities in order to cow the resistance, so it further seems to cast Kristofferson's bid as a fools errand. Urich is also ultimately revealed as something of a fool, willing to not see how he is being used by the Soviets. In the end, both Kristofferson and Urich's characters, driven by their own idealism, are too lacking in pragmatism to succeed.

 The key pragmatic question which is never addressed - and should have been addressed for this drama to provide any kind of moral lesson - is how would a second American Revolution avoid getting nuked out of existence? Even if Kristofferson and crew liberated Chicago and the Heartland - a big if - the Soviets were poised to snuff that out with nuclear fireballs. Clearly for the Revolution to have a chance, there would have to be some effort to regain some type of deterrence with the Soviets, either by recapturing some of America's impounded nuclear arsenal or establishing a relationship with other foreign powers that still hold out against Soviet world domination (China and South Africa are briefly mentioned). In line with the film's anti-pragmatic/pro-people power core, there's no effort to co-opt any of the residual American military forces that serve the new Republic of Heartland. Trying to start a revolution without at least some experienced military veterans leading it would be suicidal.

 Despite the film's blind spots, it does highlight that change is not always a good thing. The Americans who eagerly embrace the new Communist reality seem particularly loathsome, beginning with Mariel Hemmingway as an actress sleeping with the KGB colonel and happy with her privileges. She only gets angry and discovers her American identity when some of her actor friends are arrested by the Soviets and her play cancelled, which appears trivial in comparison to Kristofferson's sister, who is raped by the Soviets. Hopefully, this film could be re-made some day and updated (oppression is not going to go away) and made a bit more sensible than `lets just sing the National Anthem until they nuke us.' Given the ingenuity of Americans, an insurgency in this country against a foreign oppressor would make the current insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan pale in comparison.",1263686400,23,5803,5.159404888416578
3729383,1,B001O8ALBU,"I received the DVD from a private seller.  The disks don't work.  Product information claimed DVD was original and in good condition.  This DVD is a copy, not original.  I emailed the seller, but he has not responded back to me.  So now I'm out $50.  I've learned my lesson in buying from private sellers.",1260576000,8,305,4.454545454545454
3729384,5,B001O8ALBU,"I bought this dvd version quickly, fearing that those who had kept it off dvd would not tolerate its
existence in the market long. I was correct. Amazon declares itself now out of stock. The quality is good, about the same as the very expensive vhs collectible. I paid Amazon $35 for the new dvd version (during the brief window of availability). It is worth much more than that. I would advise interested persons to
try for a used copy before that too becomes unavailable.

Having spent some years on the dark side of the Iron Curtain, I was amazed to see how well Donald Wrye has constructed his ""What If?"" tale. This is the way Russians behave on their good days. AMERIKA presents a sanitized version of the way Russia has, under csar and commissar, ruthlessly crushed other cultures and civilizations. For two centuries Russia expanded its control by the land size of a Belgium per year. It has never produced anything anyone wanted beyond raw materials, these from stolen lands. It has prospered by the ability of its army to take goods from other countries. It is instructive for Americans to see what might have been their fate had Russia dealt with them as they had with Poles, Estonians, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Tartars, Chechens, Khazhaks, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, Chechs, Slovaks, Lativaks, Yakuts. Just watching AMERIKA gives one a feeling of gratitude to Reagan, JP II, Solidarity, the American people, and the others who brought the Evil Empire down.

Looking at our own present situation in America, I suppose one reason that dvds of Amerika have been suppressed is that the Neocons  have been taking over America in ways not dissimilar to those of the Soviet Union in the movie. A tiny kabal, some former Trotsykyites (such as Irving Kristol), now manage America's financial and  foreign policy. We are spending 3 trillion dollars on the Iraq War (Nobel laureate Joseph Stigliz's estimate) -- a war which removed Saddam, an anti-al-Quaida secularist from office and replaced him by chaos. Israel wants America to be hated and in its pocket. Both goals have been achieved. W was the willing puppet of Likud. He has created an American screen in the Middle East behind which Israel can carry out ethnic cleansing. Interestingly, our the most dangerous country in the world is the country to whom we give the most foreign aid.",1230768000,41,2345,4.884422110552764

I knew before I left that it would be on, and I remember being surprised at all the criticisms that were being leveled at it ahead of time.  Many people seemed to think that it was to be over-critical of the USSR, and I was concerned that the network that aired it would KOWTOW to the whiney malcontents and tone it down/water it down/soft-pedal it.  To date, I don't know it this mini-series suffered that fate, or instead survived intact and aired as originally filmed.  I hope the latter!  And I also hope to FINALLY get to see and own the DVDs of it someday.  Because as I write this, it is only BARELY available, and GROSSLY over-priced!!  Go figure that!!  Ironically, I was in MOSCOW when it aired!  The Russians get to see a LOT more of OUR TV than we see of theirs.  (How I WISH we could receive ALL of Europe''s networks and TV shows over here in the USA... and that it would be free of any censorship.  I should be lucky enough to LIVE that long!  Considering the fact that the technology that would make that both possible and EASY to do has been around for several decades, it's AMAZING that it hasn't happened yet!)  (Oh well --- we haven'r even been back to the MOON in the last 45 years, so such foot-dragging on America's part is par for the course, unfortunately.)  When I was in Moscow, ""Amerika"" didn't air there in real time, so I don't know it the Russians have ever yet seen it, or if so, what they thought of it.",1500595200,,1590,4.2218543046357615

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter to urge you to release the 1987 ABC mini-series Amerika starring Kris Kristofferson on DVD. Although this excellent mini-series was nominated for three Emmys (including Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Series or a Special and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Special) and was nominated for an Artios (Best Casting for TV Miniseries') and a Golden Globe, it has not been released on DVD in sufficient quantities for me to obtain a copy. It was released in 1995 on VHS.

When you do decide to release this mini-series on DVD, please restore and re-master the original, un-cut, un-edited version that aired on ABC. I'd really appreciate it if you could include the original ABC promotional trailers as well.

Many thanks,

Your name and

8329936,4,B001O8ALBU,"Starts slow...REAL slow.  Gets better about 30% in, worth the wait if you stick with it.

To be sure, this portrays the old Soviet-style occupations as ""gulag lite,"" really more a series of inconveniences and tactical disagreements than the reality in true life:  SOVIET OPPRESSION WAS HELL ON EARTH, if you got on the wrong side of the Soviet-defined fence.  And for hundreds of thousands that just didn't get in the way.

I would have liked to have seen more realism; Lord knows, the history books are full of the horrors of the Soviet Gulag...many tales could have been lifted from the histories.  Just for one example:  Stalin starved MILLIONS (no one knows exactly how many millions) in the Ukraine alone, over a period of three separate induced/enforced famines in the countryside, to bring the so-called ""rich peasants"" to their graves, and enable the ushering-in of the ""new Soviet man and woman,"" not to mention the great Socialist utopian vision.

The thing is, after the Soviet Union finally dissolved in 1991, access was gained to many TONS ( I do not lie; TONS, as in the physical poundage amount) of old Soviet government histories & records.  Essentially, every ""alleged"" crime against humanity that critics claimed had happened...was PROVEN to have happened.  Usually, in far worse fashion than even the darkest tales.

The Ukrainian starvations are impossible to believe...but they happened.  They are very well documented.  Why wouldn't they have been documented in Amerika?

Do a search on the Katyn Woods in Poland...and read about how the Soviets methodically eliminated an entire generation of Polish political, military and civilian leadership...with the proverbial bullet to the brain and mass graves for all.  THAT should have been depicted on Amerika!

Also noteworthy was the Soviet approach to insurgents (aka, Freedom Fighters) -- kill everyone that moves, import new slaves for the camps.  (Yes, I know I simplified that a lot...but if you're honest, you'll admit that ultimately, Soviet Counter-Insurgency doctrine really did boil down to this simple dictum: kill them all!

Oh, I could go on and on.  Certainly for hours, but also days, with just a few breaks to double-check my memories with current sources.  But, you get the point.

Watch the Amerika series; enjoy it for what it is, as far as it goes.  Then read some Solzyneitsen (sp?), etc.

Then, spend just a little time considering that there are many American citizens today...who are doing their best to bring about a ""new form"" of Communism...but they disingenuously call it ""progressivism.""  It is just a different label pasted onto the same old sloop.

Watch Amerika...watch especially the quisling Americans...and ask yourself whether you don't see perfect example of those types of people in major leadership positions today?  You'd better believe it!",1386028800,4,2849,5.139130434782609

8329939,1,B001O8ALBU,"This is a very unrealistic and poorly scripted mini-series.  I'm glad I missed it when it first hit the airwaves.  There's no hope in this movie whatsoever for the USA to recover, just two bad choices: secede or follow an un-motivational and uninspiring reluctant leader who's the most anti-heroic figure since the Thomas Covenant book series.

Two of the women are constantly breaking down and going into hysterical tirades after pretending to be tough (blame the writers) and one of the wives is a slut.

The parts that are pretty good are the ones with Sam Neil and Armin Mueller-Stahl who play Soviet officers--that is until the last two hours and then everything just falls apart.  Wendy Hughes was a pretty good villainess as well.  They need to keep Kristofferson off any and every screen and maybe away from music too.  Unfortunately, none of the good actors could save this lethargic monstrosity from plunging into the abyss of oblivion.

How does an anti-heroic figure expect to win a revolution when he's constantly telling everyone to get down and take it?  And even worse, leading a charge without weapons--he deserved to die--what a moron (that includes the writers too).

I was hoping just like in the Thomas Covenant series (which never happened) that this anti-heroic leader would really start rallying the people and forming a new continental army but it was so weak in all respects that I can understand why one Russian Officer shot himself and the other one cried.

If you wish to see a good rendition of how to conduct a revolution then you're better off watching ""The Patriot"" with Mel Gibson.
