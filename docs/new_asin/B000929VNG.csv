8056879,4,B000929VNG,"This is a 60 minute workout where Mindy will be very chatty and use a variety of equipment: Bosu, step, med ball, tubing, Body bar, elastic band, paper plates, and a mat.  Her back ups use the different equipment while they all do the same exercise.  The workout is split into standing where it seems like you're doing cardio because of the fast pace, but Mindy stresses, ""It's strength!""  You'll do classic exercises with lots of options and modifications.  Standing exercises include: lunges, military presses, push-ups, plies with paper plates!  The floor exercises will work the chest, the legs, more push-ups!, sit-ups, tricep dips, and core work with paper plates.  As usual, Mindy uses classic, simple, athletic moves while using multi-joints.",1264204800,2,750,5.1570247933884295
8056880,5,B000929VNG,I've been doing workout videos for years and really struggle with weight. Advanced level videos that mix weight training and cardio have been a Godsend. Mindy Mylrea does a superb job of this. I highly reccommend this particular video. The background girls are pretty entertaining as opposed to the usual stoic boring extras. Well done Mindy!,1241740800,,342,5.125
