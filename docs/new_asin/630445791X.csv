881945,2,630445791X,"PIGSKIN PARADE was a modest little collegiate B-musical made at Fox in 1936 boasting Jack Haley and Patsy Kelly as its biggest stars. Fox made several musicals that year which are far better, and much more entertaining.

We'll probably never see them on DVD.

But we've got PIGSKIN PARADE selected for DVD because it features the film debut of the wonderful Judy Garland who plays a minor supporting role, and gets to sing a few entertaining numbers. Also on hand is a 20 year-old Betty Grable, who was still about 4 years away from becoming a star, and having to stumble through middling pictures like this in between.

For Garland or Grable completists, this is an obvious buy...but others will likely be better off spending their money on a better movie.",1176595200,,757,4.763358778625954
881946,2,630445791X,"Let me speak bluntly: this is a remarkably weak B comedy that would not be watched or remembered today except for a quite astonishing collection of future Hollywood stars. The film's plot was hackneyed even when it was made: a Texas university with a lousy football team discovers a hick from Arkansas with a throwing arm for the ages, entices him to join their team, and enjoy exceptional gridiron success. If the film were peopled entirely with performers who were today unknown, there would be no motivation for anyone to see this. But given that the football star from Arkansas has a sister played by Judy Garland, the coach by her future costar in THE WIZARD OF OZ Jack Haley, and the rest of the cast filled out by such Hollywood stalwarts future musical superstar and pin up girl Betty Grable, star character actor Elisha Cook Jr. (THE MALTESE FALCON, THE BIG SLEEP, PHANTOM LADY, and SHANE), and Grady Sutton, the butt of a thousand jokes in various comedies of the thirties and forties. And if one is very, very attentive, it is possible to spot Alan Ladd in an uncredited role as one of the college students.

 Take away the future big names, and this is a pretty dreadful film. It is interesting to see Judy Garland a few years before THE WIZARD OF OZ putting her amazing voice on display, and it is fascinating to see Betty Grable and Elisha Cook Jr. and Alan Ladd ages before they would achieve any degree of fame, but once you've played that game, there really isn't too terribly much to enjoy in this film. It was a ""B"" film made to fill out a double bill, and the studio put no money and no effort into trying to make much of a film.

 It is hard to know whether or not to recommend a film of this quality. It is odd to see the stars in a film so vastly below what we later would learn was the level of their talents, but apart from that I can't find a reason to see this one. I'll add a star to the minimum because of the presence of Ms. Garland and the rest, but all in all I would recommend seeking out a more substantive thirties comedy instead.",1090972800,4,2065,4.341968911917099
881947,4,630445791X,"Yale invites the University of Texas to compete in a charity football game--but a secretary fumbles the communication and extends the invitation to tiny Texas State University instead.  New coach Slug Winters (Jack Haley) and his harridan wife Bessie (Patsy Kelly) manage to whip the team into shape, but when an accident sidelines the star player they find an unexpected replacement in barefoot yokel Amos Dodd (Stuart Erwin)... and before you can say Sis Boom Bah every one is off to the big game!

Best known for his later performance of The Tin Man in THE WIZARD OF OZ, Jack Haley was a memorable light comic of stage and screen, and his pairing with Patsy Kelly is truly inspired.  In addition to the then-popular quartet The Yachtclub Boys, the film also offers early glimpses of future big names like Betty Grable, Alan Ladd, Tony Martin, and Elisha Cook Jr., not to mention B movie queens Arline Judge and Lynn Bari.

But then as now, the real noise in the film was teenage Judy Garland, who made her feature film debut on loan from home studio MGM with the small role of Amos Dodd's hillbilly sister ""Sairy.""  Slight though the role was, Garland's handful of cornpone-humor scenes and her three songs served as a wake-up call to her MGM handlers, and for the rest of her MGM contract she would never work off-studio again.

Although PIGSKIN PARADE is hardly in the same league with the Paramount, Warner Brothers, or MGM musicals of the same era, the lightweight story, memorable cast, silly dialogue (""Well, Call My Hawgs!"") and pleasant if not greatly memorable songs has a great deal of period charm.  I do not think it will greatly appeal to any one who isn't already a fan of 1930s musicals, but those who are will enjoy it--and Garland fans will consider it a minor classic.

881948,4,630445791X,"This college comedy is notable as the onscreen debut of the teenage diva-to-be, Judy Garland, but it also stands on its own as a fine, fluffy '30s comedy.  A small-town college in Texas is accidentally invited to meet Yale in a nationally-watched football match.  It's the biggest thing that's ever happened at good old TSU, and the student body is understandably all worked up about it -- moved to stage musical shows and pep rallies galore, as a matter of fact.  Garland, who was constantly miscast in her early career, enters the picture as the snub-nosed hayseed little sister of TSU's new star quarterback, an Arkansas [kid] who can pitch a long pass with devastating accuracy.  The real stars of the show, though, are the team's coach, played by comedian Jack Haley (later to work with Garland as the Tin Woodman) and the brassy, wisecracking Patsy Haley, as the coach's sports-savvy, shrewish wife.  The plot isn't too flimsy and pleasantly zips along, bouyed by some choice performances by all concerned.  Yeah, Betty Grable's in there, too, but only in a bit part; half the musical numbers are provided by vocal quartet from the Catskills circuit known as the Yacht Club Boys... Their middleaged appearances are deftly explained by a goofy number called ""Sophmores 'Til The Day We Die""; even more hilarious is a political numer called ""Down With Everything!"" which is sung in honor of a young Bolshie agitator who appears in order to rile up the locals, but winds up instead ont he wrong side of Texas justice.  Sports fans will be gratified by the finale, which edits in some tantalizing archival footage of a 1930s Yale game, played in a howling blizzard.  Fun film all around... and you can certainly see why the studio heads went ga-ga over Garland!",1041811200,15,1762,4.8305647840531565
881949,4,630445791X,"Garland fans I'm sure were happy when this movie was finally made available on home video.  An otherwise forgettable outing about college football is made great by a young Garland who steals the show from the  likes of Betty Grable and Jack Haley (aka ""The Tin Man"").  When  Garland sings, the film soars.  Buyer beware:  Garland is really more  supporting player than star in this one.  For fans only.",937008000,12,402,4.72463768115942

882085,5,630445791X,"College musicals were a Hollywood staple in the Depression years, with a
large cast of engaging personalities, tuneful songs, corny comedy, and, of
course, the big game--football. This one is a lot better than most, mainly
because the cast is wonderful. They say if Betty Grable wasn't in this kind
of thing then Patsy Kelly was. Well, they're both in this, along with Jack
Haley, Johnny Downs, Dixie Dunbar, Tony Martin, and Judy Garland a couple of
years before Oz. Unfortunately, the Yacht Club Boys are in it, too--the curse
of the Depression musical. The story pits a small Texas college against Yale,
but football is the mcguffin. What matters is the incidentals, mainly the
jokes and the songs. Very entertaining.",1362787200,,720,4.958677685950414
882086,4,630445791X,"This movie is hard to categorize because although it boasts an all-star cast, at the time, the big stars were just starting out and hadn't made big names for themselves. One will immediately recognize Betty Grable, already radiantly platinum blonde and pretty as a picture, but this is prior to becoming the world-famous pin-up girl. Judy Garland is here too, but in her very early days before she was groomed to be glamorous. Of course, the powerful singing voice is intact; the studio didn't have to mess with that to make her a star. The cast also includes Johnny Downs (post-Little Rascals fame), Patsy Kelly, and Jack Haley.

This film is about a small Texas college whose football team accidentally gets chosen to face off against Yale. With a new coach and a lot of motivation to show the world what they've got the team tries its hardest to get into shape, but they really need a star athlete. They find one in a hick farmer who spends his time hurling melons across the field.

The film is peppered with lots of music from a variety of players, all of the youthful college-age variety. From dance crazes, jazzy numbers, and novelty songs, you'll find yourself tapping your toes but completely forgetting the music after the movie's done.",1326067200,,1246,4.7373271889400925
882087,5,630445791X,"MGM loaned the 14-years-old Judy Garland to the 20 Fox Studio where she made her filmdebut (except the musical short ""Every Sunday""). You can hear that Judy Garland already had a amazing voice.

Of course, this musical isn't the best musical but very entertaining with any funny scenes. Sure, its now old fashioned.

Also great are The Yacht Club Boys with their songs ""Woo! Woo!"", ""Down With Everything"" with amazing tunes and word games. So i think its 1A entertaining.

You may know Jack Haley who became famous 3 years later as the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz"". His Co-Star Patsy Kelly is funny.

And yes... also Tony Martin (born 1912 and still living!!!!) starring and singing in this movie.

DVD:

The picture quality is pretty good (of course not quite perfect). The soundtrack is in his original in MONO.

BONUS-FEAUTRES:

Very good and interesting are the 3 short documentaries: Making a Team, Lorna Luft talking about her Mother Judy Garland and a documentation about Darryl F. Zanuck.

Also a short clip about the restoration is on the Disc

Plus a Gallery with Photos.

Fazit: the movie is maybe not the best but I give this product 5 stars because it contains bonus features. And when you never have seen this movie and love Judy Garland : its a must have it.",1307404800,,1274,4.642857142857143
882088,3,630445791X,"This is one of those films with a few scenes vividly remembered from bygone days.  Generally speaking, the movie was pure corn.  Patsy Kelly was about as funny as a violent head cold and the phony musical numbers smelled.  Even Judy Garland bombed.

Pigskin Parade is a rather underrated movie musical that really should get an ""A-."" The acting is convincing and the numerous musical numbers are performed with panache; I especially enjoyed Judy's Garland's numbers and The Yacht Club Boys perform some song and dance routine flawlessly. There's a fair amount of action in the last twenty or so minutes of the film when the football game is being played. The cinematography works well; and the choreography for crowd scenes and the musical numbers couldn't have been better. In addition, the plot moves along at a very good pace.

The film begins with Yale University professors having a heated debate over which college football team to invite for their ""charity"" throw-away game. They decide on a college in Texas; but by accident they invite an especially unsuccessful football team from Texas State University. The kids at Texas State are thrilled including Chip (Johnny Downs) and Laura (Betty Grable), especially because they have their star player Biff (Fred Kohler Jr.). They're even more excited because they're getting a brand new football coach from New York's Long Island, Winston 'Slug' Winters (Jack Haley) who comes by train to Texas with his spunky wife Bessie (Patsy Kelly).

Trouble starts, though, when Winston and Bessie take a look at the team. The kids are enthusiastic but they're not well trained athletes; they've lost a lot of games and now the new coach and his wife see why they have such a poor record. However, Winston tries to get them together for the big game against Yale with the strong encouragement of Bessie; and for a while it seems that they might pull a team together.

But then there's more trouble. Their star player, Biff, breaks his leg in a freak accident when a slightly drunken Bessie tries to show him a sure-fire way to tackle someone. A crisis immediately arises: where and how can they find another young man to replace Biff fast? They try to track down one guy but they fail; however on their way back they stop alongside the road where just by chance they discover the very athletic but rather shy Amos Dodd (Stuart Erwin) and his younger sister Sairy (Judy Garland). They are amazed at Amos's athletic prowess especially after they try him out at their school; and Sairy tags along with Amos to get singing lessons on campus.

After a quick plot twist to let Amos claim to be a student with a totally different identity and outlook on life, Amos must assume the identity of that guy, Herbert Terwilliger Van Dyck. He agrees; and it appears Texas State again has a real chance to beat Yale after all.

What happens from here can be anyone's guess. Will Amos be able to pass for Herbert? How do they get him an assumed identity--and how will they all play against Yale in Connecticut during a very bad snowstorm? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with some very nice extras. Judy Garland's daughter Lorna Luft talks about her mother; and there's a ""meet the cast"" featurette. The extra about Darryl F. Zanuck was very nicely done as well. As another reviewer correctly notes, this film is NOT in color; it's presented here in black and white, the way it was originally filmed.

Pigskin Parade offers a lot and I don't think it's truly a ""B"" movie; that's selling it short. Sure, it's not the best musical I've ever seen; but it packs a very real punch. We see Betty Grable and Judy Garland at the beginning of their work in feature length motion pictures; and that's excellent. The musical numbers and the action packed football game conclusion make this even better. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movie musicals will also enjoy this film.",1242950400,,3714,4.738390092879257
882090,3,630445791X,"Well, there's not much to say: this is one of those tossed-off little pieces of entertainment with a lot of talented people (including Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley, Stu Erwin, Betty Grable, Tony Martin before he was Tony Martin - here he's billed as Anthony Martin - and the very young, charmingly chubby Judy Garland in her first feature movie role) getting chances to show off a little. The plot is some nonsense about a college football team, with Haley as the coach and Kelly as his wife (though who's actually in charge is part of the joke), but that's only an excuse for some very amusing musical numbers.",1210291200,,606,4.62037037037037
882091,3,630445791X,"For any Judy Garland fan, this DVD is a Must Have. Packed with extras such as interviews and biographies, the story itself is kind of corny for modern audiences but there are still a few funny parts. The musical performances are terrific. It's one of those ensemble casts where no one was really a star at the time but all became stars later (like American Graffitti or Diner). I bought it because I'm a big Betty Grable fan and, although she only has a small part in this, she still shines.",1190592000,,491,4.406593406593407
882092,4,630445791X,"Well, the public library shelves lead me to another obscure but fun film. Randomness can be so fulfilling sometimes!

Pigskin Parade--the story of a small Texas university football team accidentally invited to play against Yale--is a predecessor of all the ""underdog makes good"" sports movies that would come out, and continue to, in the decades that follow.  But, with one difference:  This one has a legendary cast, or at least a cast that would become legendary years later.

The shining star is, of course, Judy Garland, in her musical debut. You marvel watching her perform, realizing that she is but 15 and already has a mature style and expressiveness that will lead her to things both great and tragic in later life.  Betty Grable is barely paid attention to in this film, but just wait a few years and everyone will know her name.  Jack Haley, the bumbling football coach with a good-hearted harpy of a wife (also a terrific comedic performance), already portrays many of the character quirks that will make him such a loveable tinman just three years down the road.

Anyway, the movie is fun, as are most of the songs, esp. those sung by the Texas university quartet. Their pieces could be performed today to great advantage.  Talented high school kids could have great fun with ""Woo-Hoo,"" for instance.

Predictable, yes, but who cares. It moves along at a rapid clip and, though the climactic football game's results can be guessed way in advance, that doesn't stop this film from being enjoyable.",1182470400,7,1509,4.86328125
882093,4,630445791X,"PIGSKIN PARADE is a 1936 Fox football musical comedy with location filming at USC and the nearby Coliseum.  It stars Oscar nominee Stuart Erwin, Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley, Betty Grable, Dixie Dunbar, Tony Martin, and a scene-stealing young Judy Garland in her film debut.  She was on loan-out from MGM and three years later would be reunited there with Haley for THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Kelly is a delight.  Garland's one musical number, ""It's Love I'm After"", brought down the house when it was filmed; applause ruined the first take.  And Grable would become a huge star in the 1940's at Fox with Technicolor musical delights, some with Haley also.  What a cast this has!

The plot is nonsensical.  Yale is playing a big football game with the Texas State University hayseeds, and the latter's musical numbers are what really matters.  The Yacht Club Boys are also featured in a couple of numbers.  Of course, there is a last minute winning touchdown, and the movie patrons exit the theater happily.

There are tons of bonuses on a $14.95 DVD--Meet the Cast featurette, meet producer Darryl F. Zanuck, Lorna Luft talks about mother Judy Garland, there is a theatrical trailer, and there is an envelope of lobby cards.  And incidentally the DVD box is wrong; the movie is in original B&W, not color.  Have a great time with PIGSKIN PARADE, on home video for the first time.",1181520000,10,1367,4.741525423728813

7871771,5,630445791X,"If you're a fan of 1930s musicals, then you'll definitely want to see this movie! One reason, of course, is the debut performance of 14-year-old Judy Garland as a way-over-the-top bare-foot farm girl with a powerhouse singing voice. One of the movie's continuing jokes involves little Judy begging to be allowed to singand those around her insisting it's not time yet. When she finally lets loosewow!

But that's not all! Like a lot of mid-'30s musicals, the creators of this feature threw the kitchen sink of available studio resources into this feature. There's a very odd-ball sequence of a novelty harmonica player in the middle of this film that is jaw dropping. Why a harmonica player in this particular plot? Who knows, except that somebody at Warner Brothers wanted this strange performer to show his stuff on the big screen.

My personal favorite is the ""Woo! Woo!"" song, which became an immediate hit in my family. We kept popping the DVD back in the player just to show that little song over and over. It doesn't involve Judy. It's a performance by a quartet then known as the Yacht Club Boys. It just makes you laugh out loud when they perform it. Tons of rapid-fire comic patter as the song unfolds.

Are there stereotypes in this movie? Our extended family are proud dairy farmers and the portrayal of country families in this movie casts farmers as cartoon Hillbillies. You'll spot other groaners as well. But it's all in the service of good-hearted fun.

Go on! Order a copy! And I'll bet you'll pull out this DVD on repeated occasions to show friends particularly light-hearted clips.",1493683200,,1601,4.810909090909091

By the time they realize the mistake its too late to back out.  Fortunately for TSU, theyve got a new coach to whip them into shape.  Coach Slug (Jack Haley) is enthusiastic but not particularly versed in the sport.  However, his wife Bessie (Patsy Kelly) is knowledgeable and has the best advice that she makes him follow.  Through an unfortunate accident, Bessie injures the quarterback requiring that TSU cheat by putting in a ringer instead (Stuart Erwin as Amos).  They swipe the identity of another student and get him thrown into jail.  Its not how you play the game that counts..........its winning that matters.  Eventually, they let Judy Garland (as Sairy) sing a couple of tunes as only she could.
Stuart Erwin was nominated for best supporting actor but lost the Oscar to Walter Brennan (Come and Get It).
