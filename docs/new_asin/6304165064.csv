808100,5,6304165064,"For children of all ages, a new spin on Merlin and the sword of Excalibur, a tale of good and evil with fun characters !",1230249600,2,120,3.84
808101,3,6304165064,"This could have been a good movie.  The technical quality is good.  Good sound, occasional good music.  But the script jumped from one sequence to another, with resolutions coming too quickly and easily.  The kids performed okay.

The two-minute music interludes during which the story stopped and we are forced to listen to hard-rock music or rap music are not going to be to everyone's taste.  The people who would like this moralistic movie are not likely to care for this music.  The people who like rap and rock are going to hate this story.  Incompatible audiences again.  Director, take note.

The title is misleading.  Excalibur was used as a device and Merlin.  Otherwise, the movie had nothing to do with the round table or Arthur's time.  Don't expect ""A Kid in King Arthur's Court"" (a good movie except for the casting of the kid).

Bottom line: okay movie if you can get it for $7.00.  Don't even think of buying it for $12.99.",1156291200,5,940,4.646341463414634

7864636,4,6304165064,"This film strikes the perfect balance between fantasy and reality. When I watched it for the first time, I was around the age Johnny Morina was when he played Alex, and I identified with his struggles. Girls, boys, family, bullies, it's all here, with a neat twist. What if you had harnessed the power of Excalibur and you had Merlin himself as your mentor? The film never loses it's rhythm, and, even if the acting leaves a bit to be desired as I watch it with more mature eyes, the cast has charisma to spare. I still watch this movie, because it takes me back to that first Saturday afternoon I was blessed enough to catch a showing on the Disney Channel. I definitely recommend this.

Final word: It's all here! Flannel shirts, hidden portals of magic, and most of all - heart.",1373241600,,781,4.461538461538462
7864637,5,6304165064,"The product came quickly, and is great quality: 10 out of 10 on a 42"" flatscreen. Please note, my rating is only for the physical product, not the actual movie/storyline. It is a cheesy 90's movie with a good message. Glad I found this and was able to add it to my collection!",1367452800,,276,4.226415094339623
