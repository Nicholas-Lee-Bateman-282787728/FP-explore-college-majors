3991533,4,B002UNMWGK,"I have been doing more and more Kundalini yoga lately and enjoying it immensely. This is a very good, authentic dvd that combines all aspects of Kundalini: movement, meditation, chanting, and breath. I was particularly delighted with the focus on the breath.

If you like Kundalini, you may want to try Maya Fiennes' DVDs, and check out the great teachers on ""my yoga online d o t  c o m,""  which is a truly excellent site out of Vancouver with streaming yoga videos 24/7. I can't sing their praises enough.",1281484800,4,507,4.611111111111111
3991534,5,B002UNMWGK,"What a beautiful kundalini class and DVD.  Harijiwan comes through as so genuine and calming.  I love when he talks about the gong, ""you'll love the gong!"".  It truly is relaxing and wonderful and this is a perfect example of why I love kundalini yoga so much.  Sat Nam!",1269302400,4,270,4.448979591836735

3991536,5,B002UNMWGK,"I have never been to a yoga class. Instead, I have been doing yoga at home with DVD for many months.  This is one of the best around.  I feel the individual segments were long enough, as I imagine a class would be.  Some other DVD's segments seem too short. After the class, I felt a great sense of calm and peace.  I wish there were more DVDs of this teacher's available.  I would certainly buy and use it over and over. Sat Nam",1265846400,12,429,4.059523809523809
3991537,5,B002UNMWGK,"I have had this dvd for 3 years now.  The cover is just different.  This is the best authentic kundalini yoga class dvd out there. By authentic I mean it transports you to an actual class with about 15 students and the teacher.

Setting:  Yoga studio with the teacher Harijiwan sitting in front of about 15 students.  Harijiwan is a Sikh and is dressed in white with a turban (traditional Sikh clothing).

The class:  This is a typical kundalini yoga class.  No dippy music, no half dressed woman on a lilly pad, no women dressed in harem pants on a beach, no mishmash of poses from random sets.  The set taught is The Ten bodies.  It is a great set for beginners. The class opens with the opening chant as well as the mantra of protection.  It then proceeds to the set which is done mostly seated and frog poses at the end.  There is a wonderful relaxtion to the sound of gong.  Blissful!! The class then does the ek ong kar sat nam siri wahe guru meditation which is about 11 mintues long.  Wonderful.  The class ends with the Long Time Sunshine song sung acapella and concludes with 3 sat nams.  The version of the song is the most soulful rendition of the song I have ever heard.

The teacher:  I loved Harijiwan's  energy.  His love and kindness come straight through the camera.  When he smiles, you feel his smile. The dvd is called Breathe because he is a master breather.  The audio is so excellent that you can hear him and the students breathing which is fundamental to kundalini yoga.

If you have never done kundalini yoga before, then get this dvd first before you get any RaviAna dvds.  This is the real deal folks.  Even if you are a seasoned kundalini yoga practioner, you will still benefit from this dvd.  I have doing kundalini yoga for 8 years and I still benefited from this dvd.  Loved it!  Get it.",1260662400,66,1821,4.403614457831325
8381332,5,B002UNMWGK,"I can't be described with words, because the love that Comes out of this teaching of yogi Bhajan and his Gold chain Harijiwan is far more than amazing!",1383177600,,151,4.428571428571429
8381333,1,B002UNMWGK,"I must applaud Aimee on her astute observations about Harijiwan when she said in her review of ""Breathe: Kundalini Yoga with Harijiwan"", ""Harijiwan looks insane and there is nothing at all about him that is calming, he has angry eyebrows, screams at you to go faster like a drill sergeant and his inhaling is so loud it just about gave me a heart attack.""

I worked with Harijiwan for 20 years at the Yogi Bhajan toner boiler rooms in Los Angeles. The last time I talked with Harijiwan, he said to me, ""I don't want anybody to know my criminal past, I want to bury it, I am in the ""Kundalini Yoga Business"" now!""

Now Harijiwan is just trying to cash in on the craze over yoga. I never saw Harijiwan ever teach a Yogi Bhajan Kundalini Yoga class before 2005. He was only involved with sending out fraudulent invoices for copy machine toner & incarcerated in Federal prison for fraud before the year 2000!

TONER BANDIT' GETS PRISON TERM
Article from:Rocky Mountain News (Denver, CO) Article date:August 17, 2000

Byline: Hector Gutierrez News Staff Writer
A Los Angeles man dubbed the ``toner bandit'' has been ordered to spend 24 months in prison and pay $155,371 to hundreds of customers in a mail and tax fraud case.
Harijiwan Singh Khalsa, 43, tried to swindle more than 1,060 people of $315,218 by using fraudulent invoices, the U.S. Attorney's Office said Wednesday.
Operating out of Aurora, Khalsa sent fictitious invoices for expensive copy machine toner to medical and dental providers. The invoices were fake, and the product had never been ordered by the customers, the victims and investigators learned.
An accomplice, Paul Elison, was sentenced in December to six months in prison and fined $5,000.
Federal grand jurors in Denver returned indictments against the two men in 1999. They operated the scheme from October 1995 to June 1996, and federal and local authorities began investigating the case after victims contacted the Aurora Police Department.
The indictments found that Khalsa hired Elison, who used the alias Kirpal Singh Khalsa, to open the Supply Distribution Center in Aurora.
Khalsa created the false invoices in California and printed in Colorado.
The invoices charged as much as $318 for one carton of copy machine toner.
The last time I talked with Harijiwan, he said to me, ""I don't want anybody to know my past, I want to bury it, I am in the yoga business now!""
I worked with Harijiwan for 25 years and I believe Harijiwan's only motivation for teaching yoga is to extract huge amounts of money from his innocent yoga students as he did with thousands of victims in his telemarketing scams over a period of 19 years from 1980 until 1999. Harijiwan still owes over 125,000 dollars in victim restitution, according to the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado . Does Harijiwan pay 25% of his income in restitution as stipulated by Federal guidelines? His payments to the court are only $500 per month but it seems from the high price of admission to a single yoga course, which can be as much as $3,600, that he makes much more than $2,000 per month.",1358553600,8,3373,4.84055459272097
8381334,5,B002UNMWGK,"Kundalini yoga is great and this video is great! Yes it is intense, but there is a reason kundalini yoga is referred to as the king of yogas. As I told my my mom recently I don't F around and thats why I do kundalini yoga. Yes you can hear Harijiwan's breathing which is great. He is such a master. Yes they could have added music, but this is exactly as a class should be. He is kind, compassionate, but it may not come across that way if you are unfamilar with kundalini yoga. I have watched the video twice so far and the second time took it as a class. As they say you get stronger each time you do it. A great hour and 10 minute class. Really nothing more you can ask for. A great class on a DVD. Be well!",1322438400,,710,3.9375
8381335,1,B002UNMWGK,"I agree with Aimee: ""I am very sorry that I bought this DVD.

Don't buy it is terrible!!! The kriya is very common and simple.
Instead buy the Maya Fiennes DVD's or Gurmukh or Gurutej, they are good kundalini yoga Dvd's
The worst of all is the Insane Breathing and the face of Harijiwan!!!",1316390400,6,616,4.310344827586207
8381336,5,B002UNMWGK,"I hesitated a little bit before playing this DVD for the first time... but unlike any other yoga DVD this one was able to awaken my emotions... Everytime I play this DVD - I cry. Not from exhaustion or laughter:-).... I am just happy. I also found the breath of Harijiwan a little bit strange at first but then I found it useful in making me keeping pace while having my eyes closed and it keeps me thinking about my breathing. I cannot imagine that once I will be able to take such a long breath in:-) 1/3 of Harijiwan's and I am feeling full.

I like this DVD and play it daily. I realize that I am thinking about it during the workday and looking forward to it. I do not know whether this can have impact on my work but I find it now extremely easy and not so stressing at all. It is easy to concentrate on my priorities and do all tasks on time. I still look for energy while dealing with other people but I hope that this will solve too but gradually. Last year I lost a beloved person and it's still a challenge to keep closer relationships with my friends, colleagues or family members.

Kundalini is a blessing for me. I am extremely grateful that I had found it. Doing this exercises is meaningful for me and makes me feel happy and satisfied.",1309305600,7,1252,4.2125
8381337,5,B002UNMWGK,"So may vids available these days that claim to be Kundalini. While many of them do incorporate elements of Kundalini postures and breath work, this is the one DVD I've seen that most closely resembles the classes I've attended. Not a workout DVD, although it does work some muscles groups here and there for short periods - this is for overall health and peace of mind/spirit. Truly a no-nonsense Kundalini experience.",1302652800,3,418,4.901408450704225
8381338,5,B002UNMWGK,"I've been doing yoga either attending classes or at home with or without a dvd for more than four years.  I first became aware of Kundalini yoga through Yoga Today when some of the classes included some Kundalini kriyas.  I became really interested in learning more since then because I have found the Kundalini techniques to be profoundly beneficial in helping me release stress and increasing my energy.

For the past three months I've included ""Breathe"" in my weekly yoga practice about once or twice a week.  The exercises are simple yet challenging but even after this short amount of time I feel strengthened and energized and more at peace.

There are segments of mantra chanting which I had not really experienced in yoga class setting(apart from the chanting of ""om"" at the beginning and end of class) and I really enjoyed it and find myself much more relaxed and centered after doing these segments.

All in all I really like this set and think this is a great kundalini yoga dvd to add to your yoga library.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breathe-Kundalini-Yoga-with-Harijiwan/dp/B002UNMWGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breathe: Kundalini Yoga with Harijiwan</a>

After I wrote this review I read a negative review which criticized Harijiwan for his appearance and because the breathing was too loud.  Harijiwan wears traditional Sikh clothing (head covered in white silk cloth and white clothes).  As for the breathing being too loud -- I disagree. I find it helpful and useful bringing the focus on taking a full inhale and exhale.  It's easy to get distracted and to forget what the breath is doing.  Hearing it aloud is another tool for staying focused.

Definitely worth the money. I don't care that this is not a big budget cd.  Once you learn the set you will have your eyes closed and will not be watching anyway.",1301184000,11,1868,5.145695364238411
8381339,5,B002UNMWGK,"This is a great Kundalini Yoga CD. I have been going to classes for a few years now and this CD is like being
in the classroom. Harijiwan seems like a kind soul. You definately receive a good work out & raise your Kundalini.
The only minor thing is the way Harijiwan breathes. I know it is important in all yoga but I find it a little distracting
at times.",1287705600,5,356,4.1
8381340,5,B002UNMWGK,This is a live Kundalini Yoga class. It's focus is on the breathing and chanting. Perfect if you want to deepen your spiritual experience. Skip if you are looking for a workout.,1285372800,4,177,4.5625

I couldn't even look at his face because he was creeping me out so bad with his eyes rolling all over the place up inside his head, I mean can't he close his eyelids. I can definitely take the corniness of Ana and Ravi's dvds any day over this cuckoo. I hope I can at least make back some of my money reselling this.",1285027200,9,685,4.066666666666666
