7812305,5,6301540301,"Three intimate friends who never joined after his childhood adventures by that random destiny agressions rejoin in a bar and decide to make a hunt for the week end .

In this encounter which promised a happy meeting the inner demons will appear  from the bottom  of theirs souls . The affective memory in what hate concerns is very hard to forget and so these friends will become in  hunters and hunted in a chilling chase along the film .

Extraordinary metaphor about the three well definited social stereotypes of Franco's Spain .

To my mind this is the best film of Carlos Saura in all his artistic career .

A violent , desperate , bitter , crude and merciless portrait of a heart-rending society .

A superior film and one of my favorite cult movies ever !",1104883200,4,763,4.478260869565218
