8666813,4,B00LN8771S,"First,  I think a great movie with Andy Rooney playing the heavy.  Another favorite of mine is ""Quicksand""
This bluray version is crystal clear
A warning about ""multi-format"".  You may think this will be a dvd/bluray combo, I did.  Information is hard to find, and the seller blamed amazon for listing it that way. They didn't even know what multi format meant???
This disc is blu ray only , why it's 5.00 cheaper than a dvd version, who knows.",1470960000,,444,4.582278481012659
8666814,5,B00LN8771S,"Rooney  as you may never have seen him (a bad guy).  Supporting  actors are also  great.  Mel Torme, Mame Van Doren, Ray Anthony and Jim Backus etc.  Great piece  of  nostalgia  with  interesting  story.",1462752000,,203,4.676470588235294
8666815,2,B00LN8771S,"QUICK!  Name a late-50's film that stars Mr. Magoo, Uncle Fester, Dennis the Menace, Vampira, The ""Velvet Fog"", bandleader Ray Anthony, his then-wife Mamie van Doren ---plus the biggest little street-punk of them all: Whitey Marsh (from 1938's ""Boy's Town"")---AKA Mickey Rooney! One might imagine that Whitey's Boy's Town training has worn off, leading him back to his crime-ridden roots. In any case, Rooney's character in ""The Big Operator"" is a vicious, conniving, arrogant, bullying, loud-mouthed, Capone-like (but still pint-sized) Union boss.

Interestingly, the good guy/hero is (very effectively) played by Steve Cochran, who made a career out of playing vicious hoods and thugs; I kept waiting for him to stand up and kick the crap out of Leo Gordon and Rooney's other goons but, alas, that moment never really comes.

If it weren't for the grueling, L-O-N-G torture scene of Cochran , ""The Big Operator"" plays almost like a comedic parody of the Noir style--sensational and shocking to the max, but so cliched and filled with cheezy dialogue and over-played scenes and stereotypes that I found myself laughing out loud frequently---in between the groans.

True, the film accurately portrays the thuggish, violent world of big-labor union politics--no laughing matter. But with ""the Mick"" stompin' and a-chompin' his cigar, barking orders and threats at everyone around him, it's hard to take seriously.  On a lighter note......Did you ever think you'd see Mel Torme dumped out of a car on his front lawn and set on fire with gasoline? (Looks like the stunt man who performed this scene was in REAL danger!) The fact that he shows up late in the film with a big bandage on his head (and hand), but otherwise seems perfectly OK, is just another aspect of ""B.O."" (Big Operator) that makes it seem like a SEND-UP of the genre.  Or how about Charlie Chaplin, Jr. being fed into a cement mixer in the opening scene? WOW! The only thing I was expecting that DIDN'T happen was some sort of lurid kidnap/titilation scene with Mamie van Doren; I can't imagine how the writer, director, and schlock-meister producer Albert Zugsmith let this opportunity escape him. So Mamie, basically untouched, remains  pure 50's-style, domestic housewife ""Cheescake"", whose main dramatic challenges consist of servin' up waffles, roast beef, and brown potatoes (no vacuuming or ironing, though).

Also interesting is the fact that the script is based on a short story by Paul Gallico, author of such children's classics as  ""The Snow Goose"", ""The Small Miracle"", and the original story that ultimately became the magical MGM musical ""Lili"". Gallico certainly had his dark, ""adult"" side, but I doubt that his original story was anywhere near as over-the-top and grotesque as ""B.O!""

Another L-O-N-G scene has Steve Cochran driving his wife and pals around at night trying to locate the mobster's hideout; it stretches credulity WAY beyond its breaking point. The miffed, frustrated reactions of the other 5 people in the car had me guffawing out loud, as did the big climatic fight scene in the hideout, which is staged in a manner reminiscent of the Three Stooges' best brawls and pie fights (weapons used during the fight include a mop, a picture frame, and a silver loving cup, which makes a lovely musical  ""bong"" sound when it connects with Ray Anthony's noggin).

The cops FINALLY are called into action about 4 minutes from the end, basically sleep-walking through their parts. But the way Steve Cochran finally figures out where his own bratty kidnapped kid (Jay ""Dennis the Menace"" North) and Mickey are hiding is perhaps the single most hilarious moment in the film; I was almost giddy with delight as I replayed it several times.

Steve, spying a cigar butt on the mantle place, picks it up and says to the police detective:  ""It's the kind of cigar Joe Braun (Mickey Rooney) smokes;  FEEL THAT....it's still warm(!)"" He then walks to a closet and discovers cigar ashes on the floor, which miraculously leads to the discovery  of a secret compartment in the closet. Steve flings it open...and there's Mickey, sort of crouching with his face sticking out,  just itching to be slugged! (which FINALLY happens).

But...I do go on.  Part violent indictment of union/mob violence, part sensationalistic noir, part cheap, vaudeville-style parody...especially considering its eclectic cast,  ""The Big Operator"" is an experience you won't easily forget, try as you might. It's definitely too loony to be taken seriously. How the once-mighty, wholesome, family-oriented MGM Studio had fallen by 1959!  But I'm glad the film is available. If you're the type who can't resist walking through the freak show at the carnival-- just for the shock and thrill--- ""The Big Operator"" is probably your cup of tea.

PS-- Interesting also to note the high incidence of jazz musicians in the cast-- Torme, Ray Anthony and singer Billy Daniels, who has a walk-on as a crooked gas station owner.",1438732800,,4970,5.056303549571603

8666817,3,B00LN8771S,"The way movies are made and released now its easy to forget (for those of us older folks) and completely unknown to young people that there was a whole cottage industry of low budget movies made in the past that played at low end theaters or just drive ins. The grindhouse phenomena in the last decade tried to recall those years but it relied more on pure exploitation genres than the movies that were made in earnest but with miniscule budgets. So its nice to see some DVD companies like Olive keeping these films alive. Case in point THE BIG OPERATOR.

Mickey Rooney stars as Little Joe Braun, the tough as nails union boss obviously modeled after Jimmy Hoffa. Joe doesnt like to be told no and runs his union with an iron fists. Without actually saying so you know this group has ties to the mob most noticeably in the goons Joe employs to make sure his will is enforced.

When the members of the local union aren't happy with the way Joe is running things they begin to think of getting rid of the union and the national organization that Joe represents. His bowing to the plans of those bosses instead of the local members sets them off but Joe puts them in their place. When a member of the unions office is about to turn states evidence against Joe, he is murdered. Unfortunately Bill, another union member, might have been aware of what happened and Joe sets about keeping him quiet as well.

Bill Gibson (Steve Cochran) us a working stiff who does his job, is shop steward and tries to keep things on the up and up. Fred (Mel Torme) is his best friend. When Fred confronts Joe and his goons over an issue hes beat up, set on fire and left on Bills front lawn. If that wasn't enough to convince Bill to keep quiet Joe kidnaps him and beats him to a pulp. But Bill is stubborn so in a last ditch attempt to silence him Joe kidnaps and threatens his son.

The end result is quickly resolved and a happy ending provided for all with the exception of Joe and his goons. Knowing the film was made in 1959 the chances of an offbeat ending were never in question. What makes the movie stand out among the many that were made is the realism seen here as well as the amount of violence. Jaded viewers grown up on Jason and Freddy may think this is tame but when it was released this was intense.

Some may think this film is hokey but those who do are viewers that never attempt to insert themselves into the time period when the movie was made. When you make an attempt to do that the movie takes on a whole different feeling. Some parts are good, some bad and some in between but in the end it results in a decent movie about a topic rarely discussed these days.",1425168000,2,2664,4.298804780876494
8666818,5,B00LN8771S,"It is my favorite Mamie Van Doren movie and this was also released in the widescreen version, which for me is always a plus. The film is good quality too. Looks like brand new. It's not great film making but not all movies are. You take them for what they are and this is just fun to watch. I think seeing suburban America where the main characters live, in the 1950's is fun. Being from Detroit I can also relate to the big powerful union theme of this movie. Mickey Rooney is a hoot in this and Mel Torme in a film where he doesn't sing even once is quite interesting. He was not a bad actor at all. Featuring lots of good actors like Jackie Coogan and Steve Cochrane as well as many others.",1425081600,4,693,4.140740740740741

8666821,5,B00LN8771S,"The Big Operator was released in 1959, and is a good B-Film starring the fabulous Mamie Van Doren. Mamie plays an unusual acting role as a housewife and mother. Steve Cochran plays the husband who gets involved in some rough union business. Read Mamie's book Playing The Field for the real life connection between her and Steve. Her son is played by Jay North,who later was famous on television as Dennis The Menace. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights.  A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1411516800,5,586,4.376146788990826
