6403033,5,B00K5SY9GI,It was one of my cartoons back in the 1980s now it's available on DVD & I am looking forward to the next volume of the series,1408924800,6,125,3.6666666666666665
6403034,5,B00K5SY9GI,"Note: Amazon has the same item under two separate choices: This one labeled ""DVD"", the other choice was/is ""DVD-R"". There are 3 discs, each about 3+ hours worth of episodes, an average of 25 minutes per episode. This was a daily series during the weekdays to account for so many episodes, 65 total, but this being the first volume of 35. Volume 2 now available thanks to Warner Bros.

Challenge of the Gobots, the animated Series (First 35 Main Season Episodes) offers plenty of varied adventures in every episode, with some of the best voice acting in the cartoon industry, including Frank Welker (Uni and many other voices). Peter Cullen, voices from Voltron, etc.

The quality of the remastering of this series is exceptional. The colors are vibrant and don't bleed into one another, with a clear image in practically every frame. Amazing considering each disc contains about 3 hours and 40 minutes, or about 10+ episodes on each disc of 3 total.

Most episodes center around Leader 1 (jet), Scooter (red scooter) and Turbo (red car) versus the notorious and very evil Cy-Kill (red white motorcycle), Crasher (black car) and Copter (blue helicopter). The good news is, these are very well developed characters over the series, who have to handle a myriad of difficult situations and interactions. In one episode, both good and evil are forced to work together to unite against a more powerful force hindering their future. Many other new Guardians and Renegades make appearances throughout the series. Many planets are visited, including a snow land where the good Gobots' Tranport ship resembles an AT-AT Walker from Star Wars. There are quite a few nods in this show to Star Wars, like plan for the attack on the Death Star as another example in another episode.

Cy-kill, the main villain, really shines in this series. Voiced by a now deceased voice actor, his range and villainy oftentimes steal the show, as he connives one devious plan after the other, sometimes succeeding while ultimately losing to the good of the Guardians and their three human friends. Leader 1 is great as I remember him, and Scooter is an endearing character who is not as wimpy as one might first imagine, even with his unique, strange voice.

The great news is, Challenge of the Gobots includes great sound effects, music and animation for an animated series from the 80's. The transformations are plentiful and really well done, and usually serve a purpose for the situation. The special effects are nice too, with glowing lasers and blasts in every episode.

I can't say enough good things about this series, which has gone far beyond my expectations, having only seen a few episodes as a kid. Do not be fooled by the questionable artwork of the cover art of this DVD set. The quality of the video and the show matches that of the original Mini Series offered also from the Gobots Warner Hanna Barbera Classic Collection (5 episode mini series).

Highly recommended to fans of Transformers and one of the best series offered from Hanna Barbera. Lots of fun to be had here with Challenge of the Gobots. Brilliant.

6403036,4,B00K5SY9GI,"Before there was the transformers there was the GoBots. Even though this series started after the transformers, the Gobots toyline was first and inspired those who would make the transformers.
The good guys are powerful robots known as the guardians their foes are the renegades. Both are part of an ancient alien race that centuries ago discovered away to become immortal by having their brains placed in giant robots that can transform into vehicles. The earth as become part of their battleground for the ultimate prize, the control of their homeworld Gobotron.
This volume 1 contains 30 episodes, picking up where the original mini-series left off, which is also available on DVD.
A great addition to add to ones collection of great 80s cartoons and transformers fans.
There are no special features on this set. But the quality of the episodes look and sound beautiful as when they were brand new, near mint condition. They have been fully restored and remastered.",1453680000,,968,5.0186335403726705

6403047,5,B00K5SY9GI,"As a kid I always liked Gobots better than Transformers. But I'm weird like that, I always end up liking things that aren't as popular, or that people like to make fun of. Gobots, they're light hearted, funny, campy, and absolutely wonderful. I'm introducing my kid to one of the best things from my childhood and she loves 'em too! This collection is good quality. Three discs, no bells or whistles, just good times with Gobots. The incidental music, it's so funny too! Very catchy and funky just like a lot of those great Hanna Barbera shows from the 70's and 80's.

As a DVD set, it's great. As a show, it's fantastic. What more is there to say? I never thought I'd get to see these old cartoons again since everyone's all ""Transformers this"" and ""Optimus Prime"" that. Bah, Gobots are where it's at!",1424563200,7,802,4.531034482758621

6403049,5,B00K5SY9GI,"A am a Long time fan of the Gobots since I first watched them as a kid.  it's heart warming and gratifying too see Hana Barbara bring back the series after all these years.  It's sad they were over shadowed by Transformers.  I still hope and wish for the day when someone takes up the Gobots mantel to remaster them.

This DVD series is a blessing and a wonderful return tribute to a personal fan favorite.",1424044800,3,406,4.302631578947368
