2909301,3,B000TSMO70,"Someone else has already said which films are in this set, so I will add detailed descriptions of each featured film:

From Beyond the Grave (1973) Peter Cushing - 4/5 - Cushing hosts this anthology of four tales that is pretty good if you are a fan of British style horror. The shortness of the four tales keeps things moving along nicely so that you don't get bored. What holds the stories together is that Cushing plays the owner of an antique shop whose customers meet supernaturally tragic fates if they try to wrong him.

Someone's Watching Me (1978) - Stars Lauren Hutton and David Birney, directed by John Carpenter - 4/5 - Lauren Hutton is a woman being stalked by a neighbor across from her apartment. He calls her, sends her gifts, and watches her through his telescope. When she can't get the police to take her seriously, she has to take on her tormenter herself along with her boyfriend and a woman that works at the same TV station as she. This is actually a well-done film that was made for TV. The features are:
Anamorphic Widescreen Presentation
English, French and Spanish Mono
English, French and Spanish subtitles
New Featurette ""John Carpenter: Director Rising""

The Hand (1981) - stars Michael Caine, directed by Oliver Stone - 3/5 - The idea is simple enough. Jonathan Lonsdale is a comic book artist whose right hand is severed in a car accident. The hand takes on a life of its own and kills everyone who annoys or wrongs Jon. Although not great, good direction by Stone and good acting by Michael Caine as the tortured artist really save this one. It's not meant to be so much horror as a character study of Lonsdale, and on that level it works. The features are:
Anamorphic Widescreen Presentation
English and Spanish Dolby Surround
English, French and Spanish subtitles
Commentary by Oliver Stone
Theatrical Trailer

Eyes of a Stranger (1981) - Lauren Tewes and Jennifer Jason Leigh - 2/5 - This is your typical immediate post Jason/Michael Myers kind of slasher movie that was prevalent at the time. Tewes, of ""Loveboat"" fame, is a reporter on the trail of a neighbor that she believes is a serial killer. And of course, what would a 1980 era slasher film be without the helpless girl waiting to be a victim, Jason Leigh, the blind and deaf sister of Tewes. Not very interesting or thrilling at all except for the fact that this is Leigh's film debut. The features are:

Theatrical Trailer

Deadly Friend (1986) stars Matthew Laborteaux (Little House on the Prairie) and Kristy Swanson (Buffy in the original BTVS movie) directed by Wes Craven - 2.5/5 - Laborteaux plays Paul, a new kid in a strange town whose only real friends are the girl next door, Samantha (Kristy Swanson), and a robot that he has built. When Samantha is murdered by her abusive father, Paul steals Samantha's body and implants his robot's microchips into her brain to bring her back to life. However she is merely reanimated rather than ""alive"" in the moral sense, and soon becomes out of control. I have to say it's not like any other Craven film I've seen, and it comes across more cheesy than anything else. It does have one extremely original thing going for it - death by basketball. What a hoot. The features are:

Theatrical Trailer

Dr. Giggles (1992) - Holly Marie Combs (Charmed)  and Glenn Quinn (Angel) - 2.5/5 - Larry Drake, the villain in ""Darkman"", plays the insane son of a mass-murdering doctor. Drake's character escapes from his confinement, sets up practice as a doctor in the town where his father was caught, and comes up with all kinds of inventive ways of killing his patients as a means of avenging his dad. The worst thing a horror film can be is boring, and it seems the film makers had this in the front of their minds because they are so busy juggling activity that the picture literally becomes cramped with action. Much could have been cut from the script and they would have had a better movie. The features are:

I didn't show any extra features for ""From Beyond the Grave"" because the Warner press release doesn't specifically mention any. The extra features on the whole package really just add up to the commentary by Oliver Stone on ""The Hand"" and the featurette about John Carpenter on ""Someone's Watching Me"".  Because of the paucity of extra features in this set I just averaged my ratings of the individual movies in the set to get my final rating of three out of five stars.",1185667200,65,4726,4.7818627450980395

2909304,4,B000TSMO70,"I was going to buy ""From Beyond The Grave"" but for about the same price I got this. Four out of the six movies are ones I like and are pretty hard to find, so this was a cheap way to get them all. For the price it is well worth it and for me I like most of them anyway. Good Set !!!",1358208000,,282,3.421875

2909307,5,B000TSMO70,These movies might be a bit old but they're great to watch.  Eyes of a Stranger was my favorite. The acting is good in all of them and the price is a bargain.,1320364800,,158,3.787878787878788
2909308,5,B000TSMO70,"The TWISTED TERROR COLLECTION consists of 5 horror movies of varying quality and frightfulness. SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME has Lauren Hutton as a woman victimized by a phone-stalker / homicidal maniac. This guy just won't quit! Hutton changes her number, moves, etc., but the freak keeps finding her! John Carpenter did his best within the suffocating limits of network TV. Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog, Creepshow) and Charles Cyphers (The Fog, Halloween 1+2, Assault On Precinct 13) co-star. EYES OF A STRANGER is about a TV news anchor (Lauren Tewes) who witnesses a man throwing away his bloody shirt, and believes he might be the very serial rapist / killer she's been reporting on! Not bad. This one features the infamous decapitation / fishtank scene! It's also Jennifer Jason Liegh's (The Hitcher, Single White Female) debut film. FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE gives us Peter Cushing as the owner of an odd little antique shop where any customers caught stealing from / cheating the owner are dealt with in strange and diabolical ways. This Amicus anthology is almost as good as TALES FROM THE CRYPT and ASYLUM. It has five stories w/ stars like David Warner (The Omen, Time After Time) and Donald Pleasence (Halloween 1+2, Raw Meat, Phenomena)! It's like a mini-classic collection within this collection!  THE HAND is Oliver Stone's take on horror. We get Michael Caine (Dressed To Kill) as a cartoonist who loses his hand in a car accident. Weird things begin happening and people start dying. We don't know if it's the creeping hand or Michael Caine's crumbling mind causing the deaths! This one's goofy but fun. Wes Craven's DEADLY FRIEND is a completely ridiculous story about a teen who re-animates his ghoulfriend, only to have her go bananas and start killing people. Still, DF is somehow watchable, even addictive! I liked the characters (especially Samantha) and find myself watching this one a lot. Of course, I love Anne Ramsey's head-exploding-like-a-tomato-with-an-M80-stuck-in-it scene! I'm sick! DR. GIGGLES is a showcase for Larry Drake's (Darkman) skills as a darkly humorous psycho-surgeon w/ his black bag of (lethal) tricks. His one-liners and notorious chortling make this one a true creeper-keeper! Well, there's the lot. TWISTED TERROR is definitely worth owning...",1192233600,8,2280,5.178861788617886
2909309,3,B000TSMO70,"So yes, 'Eyes of a Stranger' and 'Deadly Friend' are indeed completely uncut, and the sound and picture quality on all of these is superb, and the movies are...well, you're on your own there.  I just wanted to note that every single DVD in this set is presented in what I guess you'd call anamorphic pan & scan, at a ratio of 1.78:1 or so (which fills up the entire screen on an HDTV, you see).  This is fine for four out of the six movies here; they were originally 1.85:1, so there's very little difference.  'Someone's Watching Me!,' however, was originally 1.33:1 and is cropped on the top and bottom, and 'Dr. Giggles' was originally 2.35:1 and is presented in this ratio through a combination of cropping (on the sides) and unmatting (on the bottom).  My guess is that the masters for all of these were originally made for use as programming material for HD movie channels, and were then just transferred to DVD.

Anyway, it's a perfectly competent pan & scan job, but if you were hoping to see these two films in their original ratios, you won't...and the packaging does very little to let you know this beforehand.  ('Someone's Watching Me!' is presented in ""a theatrical aspect ratio,"" which is a great way of saying nothing at all, and 'Dr. Giggles' is described as scope (ie, 2.35:1) while turning out to be nothing of the kind.)",1191542400,7,1340,4.585774058577406
2909310,4,B000TSMO70,"These films are not great by any means but the set as a whole is well put together in keepcases instead of those horrible slimline cases. I think we could have done without the banner/borders on the front of the cover art stating ""twisted terror collection"" Warner Bros always does a great job with original poster artwork etc... but this I think they are trying to make people believe they are seeing a bunch of films in the same line of Saw and Hostel they are not, which is a good thing.",1190851200,,490,4.336956521739131
2909311,5,B000TSMO70,"OMG! Dont let the ""R"" ratings listed on the sleeves fool you... Both EYES OF A STRANGER and DEADLY FRIEND are the super rare UNCUT versions that were given X-Ratings by the MPAA!

Whata  treat! I wonder if Warner's knows this?",1190592000,13,226,4.487804878048781

the price is high the quality is low
I am not talking Rob Lowe
I am talking a bunch of films that stink
I would rather throw them in the drink
then waste the overpriced asking of this set
I don't even think I will donate it for the wagons headed for Tibet
Just buy them individually it will cost less
of course the zombies profess
it is so good!
