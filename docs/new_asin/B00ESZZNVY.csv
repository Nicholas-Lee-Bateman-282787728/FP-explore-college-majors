8609136,1,B00ESZZNVY,"Fit for middle school - or lower. Good G-d! After awhile, I literally *could not* wait for this to END! The narrator' voice - don't know
who it was - was incredibly annoying; I don't know what it was about the voice but I would not willingly view this again. I'd have to
be forced.",1414281600,,281,4.127272727272727
8609137,5,B00ESZZNVY,ANOTHER DVD THAT I HAD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD AND IT TOPPED MY EXPECTATIONS,1391817600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8609138,3,B00ESZZNVY,"As noted by the other reviewers this program was originally named ""Prehistoric Disasters"" and then renamed ""Prehistoric Dinosaur Disasters"" despite the fact that dinosaurs are not central to this program.  The first two episodes, Birth of the Planet"" and ""Snowball Earth"" have nothing to do with dinosaurs. The third episode called ""Planet of Fire"" deals with the Permian extinction, so at least we are getting close.  The fourth episode is ""Asteroid Strike"" and addresses the catastrophe 65 million years ago that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

My favorite feature is the bonus program, ""Mammals vs. Dinos: Age of Gigantism.""  Some of the prehistoric mammals and other creatures look a little fake, but it is otherwise an interesting program that has a lot to say.  I just wish that they had given us the other episode of Mammals vs. Dinos rather than the first two episodes of Prehistoric Disasters.",1391126400,,911,5.046666666666667
8609139,2,B00ESZZNVY,"Very few dinosaurs, more of earth disasters thru the x millions of years.  Bonus on the disk was dinosaurs tho.  Frankly was bored.",1390867200,,131,4.6521739130434785
8609140,3,B00ESZZNVY,"If you are looking for a DVD about Dinosaurs, or related material, this is not one. With the exception of one out of five episodes, the series mainly focuses on earlier natural disasters that have shaped the Earth. There is a bonus program that includes dinosaurs, but this is simply a re-release of Prehistoric Disaters. Discovery has been re-releasing many of its programs lately, in an attempt to fool people into buying it again, thinking it is a new release.
Now on its own, this program has merit. The episodes are well done, interesting and worth viewing. I only find that using dinosaurs as the hook to sell unrelated content is not honest. With the Suchomimus and Majungosaurus on the cover, you would think you are in for a great program focusing on dinosaurs. Buyers beware. The content is well done and useful, and well produced.",1386892800,5,841,4.767123287671233
8609141,4,B00ESZZNVY,"Discovery Communications every so often rereleases some of its previously aired dinosaur science programs.
