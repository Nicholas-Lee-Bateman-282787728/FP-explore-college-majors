2613659,4,B000GI3S00,"Thought the film was excellent.  Judy Davis and Glenn Close were excellent.  I have the good fortune to know Grethe and her partner Diane.  Glenn Close really captured her.  There were times when I saw her from behind that I thought it really was Grethe.  I think the script could have been better written which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  The ending in particular was anticlimatic, ended with a whimper not a bang.  Worth seeing.  Her story is admirable and very courageous.",1170892800,5,479,4.552941176470588
2613660,3,B000GI3S00,"I was lucky enough to have received a tape of this when it aired in the mid-1990s.  However, I am glad that many others will now get to see it.  The film does not stray far from the book, something I also recommend.

Within the gay community, there are concerns that the young, men, the happily out, etc. get center stage in media representations at the expense of others.  This work speaks to rarely mentioned audiences:  women, an older person, a closeted person in the military, and a person who had a heterosexual past.  Personally, I thought Glenn Close fit this role much better than she did the vampy personas in ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses.""

Too many people think that ""gays"" are constantly ""pushing their agenda.""  Here, we see that Cammermeyer came out only in order to be honest in an interview.  She had no intentions of becoming a spokesperson or an activist.  Her future daughter-in-law says something like, ""I plan on being nice to you despite your sin.""  I love that Cammermeyer challenged that half-buttockedness and said, ""I raised my kids, paid my taxes, and obeyed the law like everyone else.  This 'agreeing to disagree' won't cut it.""

Because this was a made-for-TV movie, the places where commercials should be inserted will be obvious and may annoy some DVD viewers.  Still, this documents an issue that was big in the 1990s after AIDS was diagnosed in the 1980s and before Massachusetts allowed gay marriage in the 2000s.  I encourage many to view this.",1157673600,12,1500,4.8046875

2613687,5,B000GI3S00,"This is the story of Colonel Grethe Cammermeyer.  She is an amazing person with a very interesting story.  She kind of accidentally admitted she was a lesbian during a check for higher security clearance in the Army not really knowing what the repercussions would be.  Glenn Close and Judy Davis are are great as you'd expect them to be-they both won Emmys for this, need I say more?",1400198400,,383,4.602941176470588

2613707,4,B000GI3S00,"A must for any Lesbian DVD /Video library. Nicely acted by Glen Close, as honest portrayal and isn't it good to have an Aussie in there as well. A great performance from Judy Davis. This is not a delicate subject anymore and sometimes change can come out of one person's determination not to back down.",1314230400,,302,4.509090909090909
2613708,5,B000GI3S00,"Even though this was based on a military event, it is true about so much throughout the LGBT community. The words at the end when she was describing that the gay community is all around everyone are so true. What would people that are anti gay think if they knew people around them could very well be gay and they don't even know it. Would they go into hiding to stay away from them. More people need to become educated before they judge and hate people they know nothing about. Heterosexual and homosexual lives parallel in many, many ways. The only thing really different about us is the fact that we love someone who is the same sex and they don't. Take the time to get to know someone, learn about them before you judge them. You may realize that we are not that different from anyone else. If you want to be more informed and learn what you can go to [...] to find out what the LGBT community is up against in this country. What you read may surprise and shock you.",1274313600,,970,4.2771739130434785
