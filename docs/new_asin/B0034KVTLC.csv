4068835,3,B0034KVTLC,"Of all the subjects of the FINAL 24 series, I guess you could say I'm most familiar with Janis Joplin's sad story.  There isn't too much in this documentary that was totally unfamiliar to me, and if you've read the multiple bios or even if you were simply alive at the time and more or less aware of pop culture, you'll likely find that to be the case as well.  So the filmmakers get a ""A"" for accuracy, but the premise of the ""final 24"" is nonetheless creepily morbid.  The re-enactments are as good as you could hope for (with an anonymous actress who actually DOES look like a bit like the rock legend--and moves like her), but it's still seems a bit unseemly to watch, what with the digital  countdown timer and all.  Still if Janis' good buds like John Cooke, John Till, Sam Andrew (almost unrecognizable), Dave Getz and Powell St. John can contribute to the project in good conscience, I guess I can allow myself the indulgence of watching it.  Rounding out the commentary are sections featuring her younger brother Michael, whose comments about his big sister and ""role model"" are touching and a high school friend named Jim Langdon and, not insignificantly, publicist Myra Friedman who authored the first (and some would say most authoritative--and certainly the best TITLED) Joplin biography BURIED ALIVE.

For many contemporary viewers, this doc will serve to clear up a number of the myths that have sprung up about Janis'life and death.  To say nothing of the outright lies.  I remember reading a claim by Warhol hanger-on Ultra-Violet that she had been in California when Joplin died and had actually DISCOVERED the singer's body (in Joplin's APARTMENT no less)!  Self-promoting BS like that begs for a corrective.  There is something exploitative about these ""Final 24"" television documentaries themselves, but they do their bit set the record straight.",1353024000,15,1867,4.8765822784810124

I HAVE SEEN SOME PHOTOS THAT I DID NOT KNOW.

A LITTLE REGRET I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED THAT THIS VIDEO WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER, AND NOTICED THAT SOME ASPECTS OF HER FINAL 24 HOURS HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWN, BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARASSING FOR THE JOPLIN FAMILY, WHICH IS VERY PROTECTIVE TOWARDS THE LEGEND OF JANIS.

I KNOW THEY ARE A LOT OF CONCERTS WHERE SHE APPEARS AND FILMED, INTERVIEWS, PICTURES WHICH ARE SLEEPING  IN BOXES BECAUSE THE JOPLIN FAMILY IN A SENSE PROTECT ITS ""CAPITAL"" IN DISTRIBUTING SOME LITTLE PIECES, FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NOT VERY OFTEN.

YOU KNOW ITS OBVIOUSLY A MATTER OF MONEY WITH ALL THE SORT OF THINGS INVOLVED.

IT IS REALLY SAD TO KNOW THAT THE FAMILY TEASE HER MILLION FANS ALL OVER THE WORLD BY NOT REALEASING MORE THINGS.

4068838,5,B0034KVTLC,"Janis Joplin had been clean for six months when she died of a heroin overdose in 1970. What went wrong?

Questions surrounding the death of Janis Joplin have continued for years. At the time of her death Janis had recently become engaged, she was working with her new band, Full Tilt Boogie, and she was excited about the future. She was talking about leaving the music business, settling down, possibly raising a family. More importantly, she had finally kicked the heroin addiction that had plagued her for years. She had been clean for six months when she went into the studio in Hollywood to begin recording what would become her last, and greatest work, the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pearl-legacy-Edition/dp/B0002M1DFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pearl (legacy Edition)</a>.

So how is it that, at a time when she seemed to have so much to live for, Janis Joplin was found dead on the floor of her hotel room from a massive heroin overdose? She had been dead for 18 hours when her body was discovered. She had been alone when she died.

Janis Joplin: Her Final Hours, one of the four Final 24 DVDs released by MVD Visual in April, recreates the last 24 hours in the life of Janis Joplin, the first female rock star. It traces her movements: who she met with, who she spoke to on the phone, where she went.

The hour long film tells the story of her rise to the top of the '60s music scene and her descent into alcohol and heroin addiction. Her brother Michael Joplin speaks, adding his insight into her childhood and her relationship with her parents, particularly the difficult relationship with her mother. Interviews with High School and College friends Jim Langdon and Powell St. John unravel her pre-stardom years--the years that seemed to have doomed her. They talk about the abuse and humiliation she suffered as an outcast in her birth town of Port Arthur, Texas and at the University of Texas in Austin.

Through archival concert and television footage (including her legendary appearances on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dick-Cavett-Show-Rock-Icons/dp/B0009MAPX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dick Cavett Show - Rock Icons</a>) and realistic re-enactments, we are introduced to the woman behind the rock star. The small town girl who would come to be known as 'The Wild Woman of Rock' and finally, simply, Pearl. We catch a glimpse of what those who knew her saw; a little girl, tough on the outside, yet broken inside, afraid to be alone.

Her former road manager John Cooke, publicist Myra Friedman and members of Big Brother and Full Tilt Boogie, David Getz, Sam Andrew and John Till tell the story of Janis' three years as a rock and roll icon. From Big Brother's soul-shaking debut performance at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Monterey-Pop-Festival-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00006JU7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Monterey Pop Festival - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;in 1967--the performance that threw Janis into the whirlwind of rock stardom, through her misery in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Got-Dem-Ol-Kozmic-Blues-Again-Mama/dp/B0012GMW5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!</a>&nbsp;and finally, her recovery from addiction and her excitement in joining Full Tilt Boogie and recording Pearl.

It covers the most compelling mystery of all. How could Janis Joplin have overdosed on heroin? By all accounts, including Full Tilt Boogie Band members working and hanging out with her literally hours before her death, she was clean. Where had she gotten the heroin? Who was the last person to speak with her on the night she died?

Final 24 is a series of true life stories, each of which documents the life and death of a famous person. By examining the past, and re-creating the events that occurred on the day they died, Producer Nick Godwin is able to capture, through reflection, the tragic end that was always rushing towards them like a head-on train. Some died by accident, others through self destruction or suicide, and some had their lives cut short by the hand of another.

So far I've seen four of the episodes released by MVD Entertainment Group and I am absolutely hooked. Final 24, part documentary and part biography, is the most fascinating collection of real life, and death, stories I've ever seen. Heart-wrenching. Tragic. Brilliant. Nick Godwin is a genius.

I give Janis Joplin: Her Final Hours my highest recommendation for those who love 60's and 70's rock, and for her fans, of course. That says a lot coming from me; a girl with an extensive background in rock history. It's rare for me to hear a Joplin story that I haven't heard before. What I liked most about this video is that it wasn't the same old re-hashed stories, it was personal, people talking about a girl they knew. A girl they loved.

I've had a Dead Crush on Janis Joplin for years. I've read the biographies, listened to the music, watched the interviews, but this is the first time I've seen the puzzle pieces of her life put together in such a way. Listening to her friends and family talk about her life, and seeing the impact her death had on them, has brought me that much closer to understanding this complicated woman. Sadly, what is revealed in hindsight might well have saved her life, but I think Jim Langdon put it best in the video, ""She's still with us. 37 years later, no matter where you are in America, you can flip on your car radio and, at some point or another, you're going to hear Janis Joplin... singing.""",1277251200,31,5694,5.308546059933407
4068839,5,B0034KVTLC,"I don't know what or why it is, but it seems that we tend, as a society, to like every thing morbid. We have a fascination with death, especially if it is related to celebrity. Maybe it comes with our glorious way of life, or maybe it just human nature - I simply can't explain it. Sometimes celebrities tend to live forever after their death, and when it comes to rock music, Janis Joplin fits the pattern. ""Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours"" is a fascinating and well-researched documentary about this legendary singer.

The film opens with several people that knew Janis Joplin, voicing their opinion about her. Perhaps the most striking was offered by publicist Myra Friedman, when she said that Joplin ""was a very troubled girl and a genius."" And it sounds right, I shall say, as we watch the following minutes, when we are transported to Hollywood, California, during the day of October 3, 1970. It is there that time begins running out for the singer, with the clock marking hour by hour her final moments in life. She is in town recording what would be her last album. We are taken to her room in the hotel she was staying at, and, through a well-done dramatization, with a well-chosen actress, we find her bored in the hours preceding her death. She calls her then boyfriend, Seth Morgan, in San Francisco, and they have some kind of argument - they are planning to get married. She then calls her dope-dealer, and buys, apparently unknowingly, uncut, and almost 50% pure heroin.  Joplin then leaves her hotel, and goes to the Sunset Sound recording studio, and has a good time with the musicians - it seems that she is enthusiastic about the work in progress. She then goes to eat at Barney's Beanery, returns to her room, injects the heroin, and the rest is history. These last moments take place on a fateful October 14, 1970.

""Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours"" is not only great due to the way that Joplin's actions during her last 24 hours of her life are chronicled. It also great because in-between her every move during these hours, the filmmakers inject historical footage of the artist's life, including her seminal participation in the Monterrey International Pop Festival, her initial years in her hometown in Texas, the influence of black music early in her life, her college days and her beginning in music, her move and life in San Francisco, and how she got together with Big Brother & Holding Company, the group with which she became known and famous. Her work with the Cosmic Blues Band and others is also examined. Special attention, of course, is given to her known and tragic intake of drugs, beginning with speed, moving on to alcohol, then heroin, and finally alcohol and heroin.  All this information is not only provided by research, but also with interviews with Michael Joplin (Janis' brother), John Cooke (Road manager), Jim Langdom (high school friend), Sam Andrew (Big Brother's guitarist), David Getz (Big Brother's drummer), John Till (drummer for Fulltilt, the band with which Joplin was recording her last album), and others. Also featured are segments of her famous TV interview with Dick Cavett and her participation at the Festival Express Tour..

This is definitely an informative and well-documented film, without being creepy or exploitative, but painting a fair picture of a great artist, possibly the first female rock star ever.  The ""Final 24"" series' first set of titles also includes episodes on Nicole Brown Simpson, Keith Moon, and Gianni Versace.. Future titles feature John Belushi, Sid Vicious, Marvin Gaye, Jim Morrison, River Phoenix and more. (USA/UK/Canada/Europe, 2007, color, 60 min.)

4068845,4,B0034KVTLC,"I love Janis Joplin and I thought this was a pretty good documentary. However, after reading just about every book about Janis, I felt some things were left out. For instance, I have read that her former junkie friends were trying to get her to use after 6 months of being clean, and because she had been avoiding these people who made up most of her friendships, she was horribly lonely and that's why she eventually started using again about 3 weeks before she died. Also, the actress in this does a good job, but I had read that Janis was wearing her red gypsy ankle length skirt, the one seen on the cover of Pearl her last night alive. Plus, Janis had a tatoo on her wrist of a bracelet which I didn't seen in this documentary. I know these seem like trivial things, but I believe detail is important.
