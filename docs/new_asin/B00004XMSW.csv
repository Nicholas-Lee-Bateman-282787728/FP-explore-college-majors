1367147,4,B00004XMSW,"I REALLY LOVE THIS VIDEO. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO GET INTO TO SHAPE FOR A WHILE NOW AND THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO DO THAT THAN WITH CHYNA THE NINTH WONDER OF THE WORLD.  BESIDES THE FACT THAT I AM A HUGE FAN OF HERS, THIS VIDEO REALLY IS GREAT. SHE HAS A GREAT BODY AND I AM ALREADY WORKING MY WAY TOWARDS LOOKING LIKE HER (YEAH RIGHT)",969408000,10,334,3.7714285714285714
1367177,5,B00004XMSW,"I got this video when it first came out and I had not lost the weight I had gained from my second pregnancy. Well I am here to testify and say it worked like a miracle. Well,I guess not quite since I worked my butt off.(literally!)I had lost 25-30 lbs. plus was toned and nicely sculpted. Now, I just had another baby, and I am back on track to looking awesome again. The best part of this workout is that you can do it in a small space within a short amount of time. I have 5 friends who went out and bought it because they were amazed at how I look when I do it!!!!",1022630400,3,567,3.896551724137931
1367178,4,B00004XMSW,"Even if you're not a WWF fan I think you'll enjoy this video. It's set at a really easy pace and since Chyna ""trains to failure"" you don't have to try and push yourself beyond your limit. You get a warm up, some stretching, strength training (with and without weights), cardio and even time to rest a little between ""rounds"". Chyna encourages you throughout the video, and even though you know what she's says word-for-word after a few plays it still helps. I started noticing results after 3 weeks and I only do it twice a week. I do agree that there's just too much you have to fast forward through in the beginning, but you can always just rewind it to the start of the workout instead of the beginning of the tape. Too bad there's no DVD that would make it really easy. Anyway to sum up, yes I would recommend this video to anyone looking for a good workout video.",1000684800,7,868,4.331288343558282
1367179,4,B00004XMSW,"I thought this was a great work out for someone who has never really exercised. It was easy and kept a great pace. I would recommend this tape to anyone who feels uncomfortable exercising and is just starting out. You can really do this work out anywhere! However, I did not like that I had to fast forward the tape for about 5 minutes to get to the actual work out.",991267200,3,366,4.169014084507042
1367180,5,B00004XMSW,"This is an excellent get down to buisness workout that combines weight-training, cardio, and stretching. It is adaptable for beginers through advanced exercisers. Warning! This is not a dancy arobic style video. It compares more to boot camp than that.",990230400,3,252,5.325
1367181,5,B00004XMSW,"This workout is awesome! I love it.  Its fun and its actually not too hard. Chyna is awesome, she explains every exercise to you, what its called, what it does, and tells you how to do it properly so you get the maximum benefit and don't hurt yourself.  This video is great, I recommend it to everyone.  Chyna is an incredible woman.",977184000,7,333,4.338709677419355
1367182,2,B00004XMSW,"Too much fluff! This video is deceiving. I do not like to turn on an exercise video and watch 20 minutes of ad campaigns, testimonials, and other filler. I've already purchased the tape; I don't need to be convinced of how GREAT IT IS.  The exercise portion would be more effective if it were not constantly interrupted by wrestling footage and camera art.  When I'm ready to exercise, I'M READY TO EXERCISE! The nonessential footage should have been reserved for the end of the tape --after the workout-- for the wrestling fans, which I AM NOT, and the ads.......bad idea. Come on, Chyna, you can do better than that! Just getting through the junk is exhausting! When Chyna can produce a REAL workout video from start to finish, I will be the first in line. This tape is very deceptive, and I don't appreciate being taken. Lori LaPerle (serious about fitness)",973728000,6,860,4.688741721854305
1367183,4,B00004XMSW,"Well this video will bring back those memories.  Chyna avoids the latest and greatest exercise craze and instead relies on some old standbies to build strenght.  Yes the infamous squat thrust makes its evil return as do the very basic push up.  I like the common sense approach that Chyna takes although some of the routines are difficult for those who might have knee problems as they rely a lot on deep knee bends.  Even if you do not choose to work out with Chyna, this tape does provide some good suggestions for exercises that anyone may wish to integrate into their programs and some limited instruction in how to do them safely.  Not recommended for those who use to hate gym classes that met at eight in the morining in the rain for some good old fashion grunting and sweating.",970790400,6,785,4.539007092198582
1367184,5,B00004XMSW,Man this is the greatest fitness ever and I ever done. I've been doing this video for couple days now and man I haven't this much energy in years. I really reccomded buying this to any Chyna Fan man or woman because you will never regret that you did.,970012800,3,251,4.142857142857143

7925908,5,B00004XMSW,Chyna shows you her workout. Love it!!! Big Chyna fan/supporter. 9th wonder of the world! :D,1471996800,,92,4.8125
7925909,5,B00004XMSW,"Super hot video, if you're a Chyna fan. Hell of a workout too..you'll be dying halfway through if you use this to kick off to start getting into shape again.",1465430400,,157,4.266666666666667

7925911,5,B00004XMSW,I've had this workout a long time and I still love it! It's a great all over aerobic weight bearing workout. It's 40 minutes long so it doesn't take up a lot of your time but gets the job done!,1391385600,,193,3.85
7925912,5,B00004XMSW,"Ah,Joanie Laurer in her prime. Her hard,chiseled,muscular prime. Before VH1 and those exploitative and embarassing shows like Surreal Life and its follow up Fame Games and Celebrity Rehab came along THIS is what Chyna was. THIS is what Joanie Laurer represented. The REAL Glamazon! This glamorous amazon showed that a woman can have strength and beauty and be both muscular and feminine without the ""manly"" and/or ""masculine"" label which she certainly was not. Sexy enough to make gay men go straight and straight women go gay it's a great arm workout. It's also a challenging fitness workout. Although,I didn't get it for that purpose. I get enough exercise and I have my own programs. But this is challenging when you try to do it and keep up with Chyna in real time without pausing the tape. 6 rounds. 3 sets of weights;light,medium and heavy. Poundages may vary according to what you can handle. There is no set weight. Strength and toning exercises. No reps,just time,for instance 45 seconds;time varies. A minute of cardio and a minute of stretching and recovery. There's 2-3 exercises per round before the cardio and s&r. Sounds easy?In case you've been skimming through this review the rest happens at the end of the round. Not between exercises. I remember finishing one of the rounds before I heard Joanie say that we were going to do cardio,which in this round were Squat Thrusts[which I thought were Hill Climbers. What do I know?Maybe,I'm wrong].When I saw what she was taking about,in my head,I was like ""Ugh!,you bitch! I wanna kill you for making me do this. Putting me through all this.""Because at this point I was exhausted from that round's workout. But I made it through and I didn't quit. Sometimes when the physical part of you gives up or wants to give up the mental part of you takes over and it sometimes gets you through and helps you push through any lag you might find yourself in. I usually workout alone but it was fun working out along with the video because I felt like I was working out with Chyna. So in closing this fitness video isn't just for the advanced and the initiated. It's for any and all interested. Regardless of fitness level. If you fail the first time or first few times,that's OK.Don't get discouraged. Keep at it and you'll get better. And remember,it's not solely about having big bi's or other vain concepts but improving your health. Which in the days of high obesity rates in America should be more than enough because it's a challenge to improve your health. And the Chyna Challenge in Chyna Fitness is challenging indeed.

7925913,5,B00004XMSW,"This workout video truly works. I did this workout 6 days a week with one day off for rest and I saw results immediately. Chyna makes it so easy and fun. Granted I am a big fan of hers, she inspires continually throughout the whole video with her encouraging words. I started it in September when it came out. I was at 167 pounds/size 13 pants and by December went down to 140 pounds/size 9 pants. Plus I gained muscle which was cool! I looked and felt awesome and in shape!",1256515200,,474,4.21978021978022
7925914,5,B00004XMSW,"I just received this video 2 days ago. I did the workout for the first time yesterday and was amazed at how easy it seemed. I thought that it wasn't going to do any good because it seemed so easy. When I woke up this morning I could barely move. Every muscle in my body aches, and that my friends means that this video did its job and more! I recommend this video to anyone who is wanting to burn some fat and tone up their body. I definately look forward to seeing the results that this video will bring over a period of time. Chyna is fun in the video, I told my mom that Chynas attitude in the video makes me think of a boot camp instructor on happy pills. She is tough, but fun. Definately a great buy!",1111017600,,706,4.01418439716312
7925915,5,B00004XMSW,"This exercise is great for anyone! I can't say that this product helped me lose weight because ive only had it for 2 days and only done it 2 times. One of the things i noticed after the first exercise is that, even though i use 5, 10, and 15 pound dumbbells for my light, medium, and heavy weights, by the next morning the top of my arms were burning like they never have before, and i noticed alot of burning in my thighs to. What I am doing now is the Chyna video every other day, with Winsor Pilates in between days. Anyway, enough about me, I think that this product will help anyone looking to build muscle and lose fat. The only thing i reccomend is to do it at night because you don't want to move afterwards, lol, and theres one exercise on the video called the fast lunge---not to good for apartments! lol. That exercise, jumping rope, and ""jumping for the belt"" as she calls it, are the only exercises that will get you in trouble if you live in the upstairs of apartments. Like i said i reccomend this video to anyone and after i use this video for a couple of months, i'll let you know how it worked out.",1078012800,,1116,4.171296296296297
7925916,5,B00004XMSW,"Chyna fitness is without a doubt one of the best exercise videos I have ever seen. After doing the exercise only 2 times, I can see and feel the results. The video is very easy to follow, as Chyna (Joanie) helps guide you throughout the entire routine. The only thing you need are 3 sets of weights (dumbells) heavy, medium, and light, a bench or chair, and a jump rope. I didn't have 3 sets of weights, I only had one, so I used that set throughout the entire video. I didn't have a jump rope either, but it says on the video that it's okay to pretend. It serves the same purpose. I would recommend this video to any person looking to better themselves and their body, especially beginners. 5 stars for this one!",1034899200,3,713,4.288888888888889
