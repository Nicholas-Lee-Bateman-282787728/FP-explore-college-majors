2878748,3,B000S1KUP6,"The Dead One (Brian Cox, 2007)

Most people know Wilder Valderrama as Fez from the long-running sitcom That 70s Show. I always hated it, so I had no clue who he was when I popped this disc into the player. I figure now, though, that there will be a lot of surprised Fez fans who pick up this disc and find Valderrama taking a dramatic, if pathetically cheesy, turn. (Someone else must have thought Valderrama was superhero material; later that year, he also appeared as the title character in Stan Lee's The Condor.)

Valderrama plays Diego de la Muerte, a guy living in East L. A. On his way to a Day of the Dead festival, his car crashes and he is killed. Something supernatural took notice of his costume for the party, though, which included a version of the Aztec God of Death's tattoo painted on him, and he is resurrected as El Muerto, an undead minion of that same God of Death, who's looking for a sacrifice. Of course, that sacrifice turns out to be Diego's lady love, Maria (Colombian actress Angie Cepeda, recently of Love in the Time of Cholera).

Based on Javier Hernandez' comic book El Muerto, The Dead One, a movie that got absolutely no push in Hollywood, gives lie to the idea that anyone could make any sort of novel based on a comic in the mid-nineties and have a hit on their hands. Technically, this should remind you of just about every other comic book movie you've seen in the past few years, and the acting is at about the same level you'd expect from a comic book movie that doesn't have any real ambition to transcend the genre (this is far more The Punisher than it is Sin City). So why wasn't it the subject of yet another major media push by the Hollywood production machine? In a word, script. If something could go wrong with a script, it went wrong here. The pace is inconsistent, the action is next to nonexistent, the characters lack motivation, development, or any other aspect that might make us interested in them. (I stress again that in most cases, however, the actors here did as much as they could with the characters they were given.)

Having now dissected this movie and seemingly found it almost entirely cancerous, I'll say that I didn't hate it nearly as much as the rest of the IMDB crowd seems to have (3.1 stars as I write this, or just over my rating of one and a half stars). The movie is beautifully shot, and Cox (Keepin' It Real) has the superhero-comic-book-movie vibe down extremely well. Had the characters jumped off the screen and the pacing been better, this could have easily been right up there with Iron Man and The Dark Knight, but it just wasn't to be. Still, it's not entirely awful, and if you've seen all the rest of the superhero movies from the last few years (those worth seeing, anyway), give this one a shot. You may find it better than you're expecting. ** ",1243814400,4,2834,4.473887814313346
2878749,2,B000S1KUP6,"I just watched this movie and couldn't wait for it to be over so I could do something actually entertaining.  The entire movie I had to constantly turn it up and down due to the horrible sound editing.  This should never have been released as it is.  It goes from speaker-bursting volumes to dialogue so faint you have to turn your TV all the way up.  It is worse than any movie I have ever seen/heard.  I'm sure my neighbors and the whole town's dogs hate me now.  There are only a few times that you actually have just over a minute or two of actual dialogue without horribly loud music and sound effects.  For 1.5 hours, I literally turned the TV up and down almost every minute to be able to hear the scattered dialogue, but mostly it was just blaring noise during this entire fiasco.",1208908800,,788,4.319727891156463
2878750,4,B000S1KUP6,"If you've liked the comic book adventures of Javier Herndez's undead mariachi of justice, this is a very faithful translation onto the screen. Valderama wears the iconic face paint of El Muerto throughout the whole film, too, which is impressive. Too many pretty boys don't want to do superhero roles because the masks hide their features. Not the case here.

The illustrated credit sequence is first rate, and Billy Drago is creepy as hell, too!",1190851200,4,446,4.946666666666666

8203870,3,B000S1KUP6,"El Muerto (The Mexican Crow) is based on the comic about a guy named Eric who gets killed, paints his face up and goes after bad people... oops wrong film, that was The Crow. Please let me start over. El Muerto (The Mexican Crow) is based on the comic about the foreign guy from That 70's Show who gets killed, paints his face up and goes after bad guys. Keep in mind that these two films (and I assume comics) are completely different from each other, after all The Crow was shot by bad guys before he gets his revenge and The Mexican Crow drives into a tree while concentrating on some mariachi radio station. To be perfectly honest I was impressed with this film, although it is a complete rip off from J. O'Barr. It was definitely smarter than the last 2 Crow movies and I hate to admit that Fez is adorable even  without the accent. Check it out, you might surprise yourself.",1348185600,,880,4.333333333333333
8203871,4,B000S1KUP6,"While some liberties are taken with the original comic book ""El Muerto"", the innovations are true to the spirit of the book. Wilder Valderrama 's performace, for those used to seeing him in ""That 70's Show"" was a pleasant surprise and really conveyed a depth and range I hadn't seen before.

The budget is obviously not huge, but it fits really well with those who have come to appreciate Javier Hernandez's style of story telling. This is one of the reasons I love seeing Indie film, these 'underappreciated' gems that are far better than most theatrically released fare.",1268438400,,572,4.836734693877551
8203872,4,B000S1KUP6,"It seems it is a deeper story than a simple attempt of the pagan Aztec god to return the Earth by getting hearts of three humans in run of three days consequently, helped by collaborators chosen and awaiting his command for.

If religious philosophy was left aside, a story is a mix of reality with zombie-horror actions peppered with human love overcoming all obstacles, such a watching-for-watching of the Latino-Americans in Los Angeles,the USA, inextricably linked with their natural Aztec roots and ancient traditions.

What I did personally wrong was watching it after midnight during rainy, windy night.",1246665600,4,610,5.214285714285714
