3478416,5,B001B187FC,"Yes, I have seen this film and no, I am not affiliated with the production in any way. I bought a copy online at their web site a while ago because one of my ""myspace friends,"" Elske McCain, has a small part in the film.

I didn't expect much, but I must admit that I really enjoyed watching it.

Apart from having a clever premise, the thing that really makes this film as entertaining as any big studio production is the cast. The characters are really well written with lots of personality and humor, and the actors do a fantastic job of fleshing out those characters. You really feel like you know these people and it's engrossing to watch them interact and do what they have to do. (Even when it's gross.)

Although it's low budget, it's not just ""slash and gore."" It's good, solid, enjoyable filmmaking.",1215475200,4,809,4.489795918367347
8281016,4,B001B187FC,"Not great, not bad. Found this movie a fun ride into wild time. Alot of dead poeple,here in the end of this movie. All I can say, after watching this movie,let's have more fun get out a copy of  DVD, original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""& have more fun kids.",1256688000,,259,4.285714285714286
8281017,2,B001B187FC,just cause u have a camcorder and u took a couple of classes does not mean u can make a horror movie like john carpenter.also shooting blood onto people does not make it gore.,1241913600,,175,4.176470588235294
8281018,4,B001B187FC,"I'm no horror expert,  but I thought this was a pretty good horror film. Yup, it's a lot of blood and boobs. If that's your thing, you'll like it. Entertaining, interesting premise, and kickass music/soundtrack.",1239148800,3,211,5.0285714285714285
8281019,3,B001B187FC,"Probably a 2 star movie overall, but I am generally willing to give low budget indie films the benefit of an extra star. The flick starts a bit slowly, but when the action picks up, its a decent little slasher cult film (meaning cult of slashers, not cult classic). It's also got Gunnar Hansen. The world needs more Gunnar Hansen.

If you don't like your flicks on video, stay away. If you don't like low-budget production values, stay away. If you don't like blood and boobs, definitely stay away.",1236297600,,498,4.595505617977528
8281020,5,B001B187FC,"Gimme Skelter is an amazing example of the underground horror movie movement going on in Albuquerque, NM where people who love movies are making the kind of fun, outrageous schlock reminiscent of the low-budget horror films of the 70s.  Set in a small town in New Mexico, Skelter follows a gang of murderers led by a man who believes himself to be the son of Charles Manson.  He is trying to outdo dear old dad by killing more people than he did.
This movie is obviously not for everyone.  There is a lot of sex and gore that will upset the more squeamish (i.e. uptight) among you.  But if you love extreme, raw, unpolished movies made by people who weren't influenced by focus groups and corporate meat-heads then Gimme Skelter is a must-own.",1221523200,2,743,4.56390977443609
8281021,5,B001B187FC,"I had heard about this film via Elske McCain.  She was at Scream O Rama here in Tucson.  That's when the intrest sparked.  Also seeing some of the goodies on her Myspace page was a huge boost also.

I finally found a few copies at our local record store here.  I picked it up and took it home.  Upon watching it, I was reminded of my love for indie films.  Gimmie Skelter has some scenes where one feels utterly filthy because it's so brutal and raw.  If you are a fan of zany horror films with the very raw feel, then this is the one for you.  This one also offers a small amount of humor to it.

Gunnar Hansen has a very modest role and does a great job with it.  Elske's may be smaller than I had hoped, but it's not the size of her role.  It's what she did with it, that is important.

Pick it up, you won't be sorry at all.  Support your local artists and indie films.",1221004800,2,873,3.9710982658959537

8281023,5,B001B187FC,"I watch a lot of low-budget films, and believe that every film no matter the budget has a chance at being great.  Some of the best films I've seen have been very low budget. GIMME SKELTER is not only a great low-budget film, it is just a great film period.  The film easily moves from horror to comedy to drama and back.  And GIMME SKELTER also is by for the best serious acting I have ever seen from Gunnar Hansen - his delivery of the line ""You shoulda been there..."" gets me a bit misty-eyed every time, and I am not trying to be funny - that moment in that scene (watch the movie if you want to know what I am talking about) is extremely sad and powerful.  The film's story, characters, acting, production, all hides its low-budget makings.  This is dark, twisted, funny, serious film making for the independently minded crowd.  Highly recommended.

And to be fair, I was involved in the production of this film.  But I truly would have written the same thing if I were not involved; I never expected to be involved with such an outstanding film at the budget level I work within.",1216425600,2,1084,4.385
8281024,5,B001B187FC,"This movie is real independent horror cinema and it works really well.  It's funny and bloody and sexy and everything that you want out of a movie.

If you're reading this far down on the page, then you probably like movies like this and you should just buy it already.",1215648000,,269,4.36
