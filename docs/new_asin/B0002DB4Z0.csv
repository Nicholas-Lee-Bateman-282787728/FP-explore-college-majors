This collection of mostly old monochrome movies from the 1930s stars John Wayne in his early acting days before he was one of the better known actors in Western movies. He also played in other movies. Many of the western movies of this era portrayed the struggles of small ranchers and farmers against the big landowners of that era. These stories are based on historical events mostly censored from schoolbooks. The Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming was the inspiration for many of these stories, as well as the Lincoln County War in New Mexico. These four single-sided DVDs are mostly `Budget pictures'. They are the equivalent of the TV shows of today. Wayne worked as a property man before he became an actor. Many of these movies were shown on TV in the early 1950s. Are they more entertaining than the current shows on TV? Mike Tomkies book ""Duke"" tells about his acting career.

BRENTWOOD 20 movie packs are fairly thick in size because of their design-- the all-plastic box has a middle leaf added to store two of the discs on. This leaf is attached to the box spine by small tabs which may pull away from the main case if not handled carefully. Reassembling the separate pieces can present a challenge best avoided.

If you're a fan of 1930s westerns and would like to add some unusual lesser-known titles to your library,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WESTERN-LEGENDS-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B000QQA5VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WESTERN LEGENDS 50 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT is exactly what you're looking for!
