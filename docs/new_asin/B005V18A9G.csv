8487235,5,B005V18A9G,"Katy is a miracle worker! For any physical ailment that I have, I watch one of her videos to get some insight and therapy. Never thought medical help through my television would work, but it really does!",1428364800,,203,4.513513513513513
8487236,5,B005V18A9G,"Everyone tells you to kegel, but no one really tells you about how to stretch the pelvic floor, which is just as important!

Katy explains it all, and the exercises are really easy---you can do some of them anywhere. And it feels so good (but I think stretching anything feels good, so...).

My husband has bad scoliosis from breaking his leg at age 8 (one leg healed, the other got a growth spurt). His back gives him so much trouble, but I made him do some of the exercises with me... and they helped! At least in so far as he remembers to do them (he didn't believe it would help his back, either---but then he tried them, and surprise! Stretching you legs, etc., really does a lot for you back).

I recommend this for everyone.",1354838400,,731,4.360294117647059
8487237,5,B005V18A9G,"Katy's stuff great.  I have two DVDs, Aligned & Well ""Down There"" and ""Fix your Feet"" and I have her book for the feet.  I recommend them all!  These DVDs are simple, and to the point.  The ""Rx-ercises"" are so basic everyone can, and should do them.  If you can, find one of her seminars and attend.
I'm a true convert.",1348185600,,319,4.163934426229508
8487238,5,B005V18A9G,I started these exercises when I had stress incontinence. They have helped me so much! The stress incontinence is gone and they also helped with hip pain I was experiencing.,1343347200,3,173,4.8
8487239,5,B005V18A9G,"I was really surprised by this video. I'm going to buy it now. I am 64, slender, but not so flexible anymore. I can do all these exercises. The important thing is, I WANT to do them! They feel good when you're doing them. And I loved her mini-lecture afterwards, simply explaining the connection between using your muscles and with your health. I'm an RN and I hate being bored by hearing what I already know. But this sounded fresh. And she didn't look like she was trying out for a Hollywood Boulevard revealed movie, which I TOTALLY appreciated. She looked like a real person. I'm going to rent some of her other ones, now. I'm so not an exercise DVD person, but I was curious about this one, since the Whole Woman DVD had already opened my eyes to pelvic ""floor"" myths. I wish I could personally thank her for making this DVD. Thanks!",1330819200,,838,4.412903225806452
8487240,4,B005V18A9G,"This video contains an exercise segment and a lecture.

The exercise segment presents 6 exercises:
1. Single calf stretch: Put the ball of the foot on a rolled-up towel and step the other leg forward to stretch the calf of the hind leg.
2. Double calf stretch: Stand up and lean forward with hands on a chair seat.
3. Pelvic list: Tilt the pelvis sideways to lift your feet.
4. Knee squeeze: Lying on your back, squeeze an object between your knees.
5. Legs on the wall: Lie on your back with your behind near a wall. Put the legs up the wall and allow them to fall outward.
6. Walk sideways: Tilt the pelvis to walk right to left and left to right.

Exercises 2 and 5 are also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aligned-and-Well-Smart-Digestion/dp/B006JIVILW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aligned and Well - Smart Digestion</a>&nbsp;in the same series.

There's a lot more to these exercises than my summary. E.g some of them include special instructions for people who have had a hip replacement.

The lecture is the same bio-mechanical lecture as in the other videos in this series. I got kind of distracted by the lovely library and the poor lip synching. The rest of the video also had lip synching trouble. That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars.",1328572800,2,1291,5.018691588785047
8487241,5,B005V18A9G,"This is the first time I've heard of the ""Aligned and Well"" series, which is an awesome idea, and this video is very well-done. The exercises are simple, so don't be nervous - I've been frustrated by many an exercise DVD but not this one! Katy does a wonderful job of explaining what you're trying to do and why it will help you.",1327536000,,329,4.238095238095238
