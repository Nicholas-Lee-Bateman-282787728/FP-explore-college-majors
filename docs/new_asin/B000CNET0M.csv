2466338,4,B000CNET0M,"This is for the DVD which was released 2005. The film itself was done in 1995, according to the ending credits although IMDB lists 1996.  It stars

Farrah Fawcett as Dalva Northridge

Peter Coyote as Historian Professor Michael

Rod Steiger John Wesley Northridge II

It's a very sweet story, slow in a few places but with two great romantic scenes between Farrah Fawcett and Powers Boothe...though not on the level of scenes in 'A Breed Apart' and 'The Spree'. But still decent to watch.

The music is by Lee Holdridge which some might remember scored  'Beastmaster' . While it is haunting and beautiful and something like 'Little House on the Prairie' it gets a little repetitive after an hour or so.

Some nitpicks:

It says on the back of the DVD case that 'in time Dalva's grandfather reveals the truth: Duane is Dalva's half-brother."" while this is true, it isn't clear if Dalva ever knows this. Dalva's father had an affair with a young Lakota girl; in fact, people are having affairs with 'young Lakotas' all through this movie.

'Fifteen years later Dalva...and Duane reunite.' Actually it is SEVEN years later, and then fifteen years after THAT the story takes place in the present. 'He confesses that he is dying and wants to marry her before he dies...' well, not exactly.

Anyway, blonde blue-eyed (gag)Native Americans aside, the story I followed is that of adoption, the good side and the bad side. The story is left a little open-ended, we aren't sure exactly how it turns out but then, that's kind of like real life as well.

The real star in my opinion is the mansion. What a beautiful old place. Professor Michael (Peter Coyote in his best Kevin Costner lookalike role)is good for comic relief, but I liked him too as a secondary character. This movie could have been a good half hour shorter without missing much. There are some good Indian wisdom dialogue in it, for those (like me) who like such things.

Worth watching at least once especially for FF and PB fans, and for those interested in Native American history. I haven't yet read the book from which the film was taken, but it's on my list.",1146009600,4,2119,4.679245283018868

Dalva became pregnant as a teenager and her baby son was put up for adoption.  She has been looking for him ever since.  The movie is laugh a little, cry a little with a great cast and a wonderful story.",1463443200,,292,4.452830188679245

8099442,4,B000CNET0M,"Jim Harrison is my favorite author, therefore, I will always prefer his prose to the cinema versions of his work. Having said that, this is a credible recreation of a unique woman. Farrah did it proud. For those of you who aren't familiar with Jim Harrison's work,  he wrote Dalva in the first person. I would not have cast Farrah in the part (goes against type), but she managed to pull it off. Also going against type was Powers Boothe. I have never seen him as a ""good guy"". I kept waiting for him to pull out a gun. Instead he gave a nuanced portrayal of Dalva's love interest, although Peter Coyote was more believable as the scorned professor and butt of jokes. The supporting cast was perfect. Carroll Baker brought Naomi to life.  Rod Steiger was a little over the top as John Wesley Northridge II.  I'm not sure he bought into his character completely. If you like a thoughtful, ""actor's movie"", you may enjoy Dalva. If you're looking for chase scenes and explosions, you'll be bored.",1431993600,3,993,4.567415730337078
8099443,3,B000CNET0M,"Love Farrah Fawcett! My complaint is the Loud music when movie started,and seemed to go on Forever!!!. Farrah's character was telling her story, but couldn't hear most of it due to the Loud music. What was the purpose???  Ginger",1425772800,,228,4.846153846153846

8099445,1,B000CNET0M,"Farrah had some very good acting roles in her career but this is not one of them.  Her shy, demure, flirty personality seems more like a 17 year old than a 49 year old....it's just plain awful.  I couldn't even watch parts of it...it was so ridiculous.  Like an older woman who never grew up and wasn't playing with a full deck.  I can't imagine why someone would even release this movie after viewing.....it should have been left on the cutting room floor.",1352160000,,457,4.469879518072289
8099446,5,B000CNET0M,"This is a stunning movie; not flawless, but great nonetheless.  The film tells the story of Dalva, a woman who gave up her baby at age 16 and her journey through life which she spends longing to find and be reunited with him. The entire film is visually stunning and arresting and you find yourself overwhelmed by the beauty of golden-hued colors: Golden, sprawling cornfields, golden sunlight, Farrah's golden-blonde hair. The storyline is interspersed with a dramatic inner dialogue Dalva has with herself as she is writing in her journal or thinking to herself; this could have come off corny but it somehow works.  This is one of the later films Farrah did where we are able to glimpse the true magic that was Farrah; watching it you know exactly what made her a huge star back in the 1970's. Only a blessed few have that pure charisma, and at times Farrah had it in spades. Farrah is beautiful in this film and the movie contains numerous stunning sequences: A young couple falling in love, then making love; a death, an electric love scene with an adult Dalva, a heart-wrenching reunion.  Watching Dalva is a heart-warming experience and I recommend it to fans of drama and fans of the beautiful Farrah Fawcett.",1337644800,4,1217,4.731132075471698
8099447,5,B000CNET0M,Excellent story about Native Americans.  Farrah Fawcett and Powers Boothe are electric in their shared scenes.  Definitely need a tissue box nearby for well-directed emotional scenes.  A great legacy for dear Farrah.,1248134400,5,216,5.6875
8099448,2,B000CNET0M,"This worshipful hymn to the plains Indians should find favor with aficionados of the sub-genre.

To everyone else, the effect of this movie is soporific at best.  The many times when Farrah begins to take her clothes off keep interest alive.

The DVD is atrocious.  No tracks, just one long PLAY.  The music (which is good) is so loud for the first fifteen minutes that it is hard to understand the words of the narrative, and the music never lets up.  The narrative voice-over the ""scenes from the life of"" make for a distanced experience.

The fine cast is wasted, but they lend an air of quality to this lame excuse for a movie.",1188777600,2,631,4.482456140350878
8099449,5,B000CNET0M,"Farrah Fawcett always seems to seek quality in the television movie rolls she chooses.  She plays the title roll, Dalva, a part Sioux Indian who becomes pregnant at the age of 15, but is forced to give up her baby by her grandfather, played by Rod Steiger.  The movie covers these years, and 15 years later, when she is involved in a romance with Powers Boothe.

When he learns the devasting reason behind her grandfather's decision, he encourages Dalva to search for her lost son and to find some peace in her life.

Interesting sidelights on Native American history in this family make for an enjoyable movie all around.",1179878400,10,622,4.678899082568807
