The Madison Savoyards can't be faulted by not trying.  It's very nice of them to provide DVDs of their efforts.  Would that the San Diego Lyric Opera did the same.  Good performances of Sullivan's operettas are always welcome.  Unfortunately, the Savoyards are so often so off the mark that one almost cries for the inadequacies.

Every MS production has its own shortcomings.  Patience is a difficult Sullivan operetta to produce successfully.  It would be easier in its original (Victorian) period or even the era of the ""beat"" poets.  But now only truly high-quality staging will do.

Please note that Patience happens during the time of Wilde and his ilk, the hothouse beginnings of Art Nouveau.  It demands over-the-top lavishness in keeping with the theme - a put-on the so-called ""aesthetic"" poets.

Alas.

The Savoyard production reduces this wonderful parody of cultural over-ripeness into a fairly dreary bucolic romance.  Well, actually, a barnyard romance.  The scenery projects a vivid feeling of dreariness.  It looks as if the work is set in the Midwestern cultural (and political) dust bowl of the United States: Texas, for instance, or Oklahoma, or Kansas.  Its strongest claim to fame is its sheer lack of inspiration.

Sonically, this DVD is a stunning example of ""less is too much less"".  The sound is recorded at such a low level one suspects it passed through an Edison cone.  Not only is the sound at too low a level, it tends toward muddiness.

The dreariness of the setting must have passed itself to the cast, who - had there been no audience - might have believed they were doing a dress rehearsal before the actual scenery arrived.  If and when one hears the words, it's immediately apparent that the actors know their lines but have little emotional attachment to them.  The voices tend to be second-rate at best.

The orchestra manages to get the notes, but its performance is so lackluster that the listener is moved to wonder how this work got a second performance.  To see the vastly superior Australian performance, just recently available, is to apprehend why Patience did very well in London.

I don't recommend this performance at all.  We're lucky to have available at least 2 better productions available to us.",1249689600,,2260,4.941489361702128
8170184,1,B000MMMWPW,"After reading the two 5-star reviews of this item, I purchased it.  Having seen it, I have to think there is some sort of mistake.  The DVD I viewed cannot possibly have received any positive reviews from anyone at any time.

The performance itself is fine, if uninspired.  But the production of the DVD is so poor as to ruin any chance of enjoyment for the viewer.  This video looks like someone in the audience made a home video of their kid's high school play.  One camera.  I can detect no attempt to professionally capture the sound.  It really sounds as if they just used the microphone on Dad's digital camera.  The only vocals that are distinguishable at all are the group vocals (which are so mushy, the words cannot be recognized).

I am an avid fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, and it doesn't take much to satisfy me.  The mere effort of putting on the musical production is laudible, in my book.  In other words, I am prone to be lenient in my criticism.  So you know how bad this production has to be, to earn the remarks printed here.

If you know someone in this production, purchase it as a keepsake.  Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",1207267200,5,1150,4.435406698564593
8170185,5,B000MMMWPW,"This offering by the Madison Savoyards is a great performance of one of the more difficult Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.

 I consider it difficult because it would be far easier to get it wrong than almost any of the others.

 Someone else once made the observation that the charm of what Gilbert wrote was the seriousness with which the characters run right up the tree following the squirrel track of logical daffiness.

  Patience is still just a bit more offside, rival poetical aesthetes not being a thing much encountered by most folk in everyday life.

 Within the limits of what is physically possible, given the space available, the performance of both cast and orchestra is marvellous, and the nearest I would come to a quibble with any of it is that the cast was pretty obviously barred by time or direction from doing any of the extra flourishes their ability might well have permitted.

 On the other hand, this did make it as near a pure presntation as any I have seen, so perhaps that is a wash?

 Both the sound and the camera work are well done and make both the viewing and sound enjoyable.

 Due to my experience with their first DVD, was a bit twitchy about this new one.

 As I commented, the parts of the performance available were excellent, but the thing (Ruddigore) had been chopped up so badly by deletion of the spoken parts as to be an incoherent atrocity.

 Have to say,  WOW!

 And many kudos to Evan Richards, a man who obviously either learns from experience or possibly was given faulty orders, it matters not which, since he got it right this time.",1179273600,12,1584,4.582142857142857
