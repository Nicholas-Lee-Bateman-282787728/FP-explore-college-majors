Well I was just a dumb teen, I guess.  In retrospect, I would be ashamed that I actually liked this.  I think Weird Science had a better edge than this.  And why did romance have to come into play.  Could not this Barney use his power for a more noble purpose - like Spiderman - than to just get some girl?

Sorry I ever watched this!

I know it's 80's nostalga that I am probally getting no-help votes but there are some better 80's movies.  I enjoyed it as a kid but it would just plane look dumb now.  Try Xanadu for a bit of fantasy.",1140566400,,634,4.048387096774194
