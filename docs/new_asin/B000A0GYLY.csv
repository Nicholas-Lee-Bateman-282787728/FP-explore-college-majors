8071630,4,B000A0GYLY,"I used this in my ""frontier women"" classes I hosted for K-12 teachers' professional development. The film is good and has many details about NB's life; however, it introduces Elizabeth Bisland, then never goes back and speaks of her again. It also omits some elements of NB's life that, if they had been included, would have rounded out her character, the zeitgeist, and the fourth estate. I showed the film, but I front-loaded with ""pay-attention-to"" details that we later discussed. I definitely recommend it, but make sure you do YOUR research and be able to discuss the details left out. It is suitable for students and adults. There is a short teaching guide with this DVD also. I recommend that your read Eighty Days by Matthew Goodman before showing this DVD. His research is more thorough and current. There's an indie film being made about Nellie Bly due for release quite soon (2014). Look into that, too.",1396310400,,915,4.834394904458598

8071632,5,B000A0GYLY,"My daughter is doing a middle school history project on Nellie Bly. I bought this for her because she seemed to be drowning in facts and quotes. We found that this documentary was really well done. It's 40-50 minutes long, and contains just enough information on Nellie Bly--her childhood, how she got started as a reporter, her work as an undercover and stunt journalist, and her record-breaking trip around the world. A little mention is given on how stunt journalism impacted the opportunities for women in the workforce and Nellie's adoption of orphans. The filmmakers use photographs from the time and interviews with experts to tell her story. They do an excellent job of capturing the mood of Blackwell's Asylum and the excitement people felt about Nellie's journey around the world.

Brooke Kroeger, the author of ""Nellie Bly: Daredevil, Reporter and Feminist"" is the primary consultant for this documentary. Her book is considered to be the authoritative work on Nellie Bly. However, the book is 500 pages long--a little overwhelming for the average middle school student. This documentary is a great companion to Kroeger's book. Watch it to get the gist of Nellie's life, then consult the book for in-depth information,facts,and quotes.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Nellie Bly, journalism, or 19th century women who didn't behave like ""ladies"".",1329350400,5,1378,5.174887892376682
8071633,5,B000A0GYLY,"Our Seattle Times newspaper carried a 14-week serial on the life of one of the first women newspaper reporters.  For my special ed students, to see someone who had great ideas, a strong desire to succeed, but had done poorly in school, was a great role model.  Her life was certainly a remarkable one.

To complete the unit, I wanted a visual story of her life.  During a Google search, I found PBS and the American Experience series - Around the World in 72 Days.  It was a great way to end our study of Nellie Bly.",1244937600,3,516,4.278350515463917
