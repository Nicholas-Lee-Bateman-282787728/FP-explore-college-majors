8362366,5,1892198479,"In this childrens video, a girl visits this greenhouse in which the plants and animals grow naturally.  Birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish flourish among the exotic plants and central pond. A stream flows from the pond to  the outside, around the outdoor gardens and back into the greenhouse pond.  Here people can study the natural behavior of animals.  The director,  Gerry Williams, explains to Tabitha how the greenhouse works and shows her  all the animals and how they live together.  The pace of the camera work is  relaxed so the viewer can feel he or she is actually in the greenhouse.  The result is a feeling of relaxation in the child.  People have told us  that children love to watch this video on a regular basis because it makes  them feel good.  It is also very educational with an ecological message.",957744000,2,820,4.7304964539007095
