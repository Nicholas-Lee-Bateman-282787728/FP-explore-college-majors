8284399,5,B001BS2VKW,"Another treasure for my collection. Feel blessed that my GB Packers have so many championship DVDs. They sure are fun to watch. Desmond Howard is pretty magnetic in this one. Favre and Holmgren's personalities come out nicely. Lots of laughs, too.",1425600000,,247,5.048780487804878

8284402,5,B001BS2VKW,"Although slightly misleading that this DVD/Blu Ray is a copy of the actual Super Bowl, it still delivers.

NFL films never lets anyone down; epic music, epic commentary, and epic footage.  A must have for any fan looking to recapture the magic of the 96-97 season - also goes well with the 2010-2011 Packers DVD/Blue Ray.

Go Packers!",1309305600,,334,4.724137931034483

8284404,5,B001BS2VKW,"I watched the NFL Network countdown of the 20 greatest Super Bowl teams, and some of them really stand out-this one does!
The team was ranked #16 out of the top 20, but while the team may be ranked 16th, the DVD is at the top of the class. There are great individual stories, video, and music, all of which are tied together nicely.

This and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-Americas-Game-Chicago-Bears-Super-Bowl-XX/dp/B00127SO4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL Americas Game: Chicago Bears Super Bowl XX</a>&nbsp;are two of the best I've seen.
The Bears team was ranked #2 in the countdown, but like the 1996 Packers DVD, the DVD itself ranks higher than that.
This is NOT for football fans only!

Both this and the 85 Bears version make great gifts.",1248739200,,798,5.586776859504132
