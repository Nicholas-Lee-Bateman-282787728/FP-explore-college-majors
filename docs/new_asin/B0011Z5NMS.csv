3070486,5,B0011Z5NMS,"If we think about it, we all might come to the same conclusion as many of these families ... that the dysfunction of our families is our own doing and sometimes you just need help to get back on track. And these families really needed HELP!

Although the techniques used in Nanny 911 are not revolutionary, it is amazing the consistency with which their techniques serve to form order out of chaos and bring balance to these tilted (not twisted) families. These families are selected for their types of problems, still, I am amazed at the variety of family types represented. I am reminded how human we all are and that many of our struggles are shared across class, education and culture: there is much to be learned from our brothers and sisters struggles. These families' humility humble me and motivate me to lower my expectations of perfections, to be a more realistic about the work it take to be a family and raises my expectation as to what is possible. I've learned to keep the communication flowing.

Nannies! Which family with children does not wish they had one or two or three!

Families are consistently void of serious problems such as drug additions, criminal behavior, alcoholism, abuse, etc. Children are still children with only an occasional teenager. Problems revolve around organization, communication, mutual support between parents, over nurturing, lack of rules, etc. Families are willing participants and only occasionally proud. This is a good program to help a family who is not yet burdened with the special approaches need to deal with serious behaviors.

My feeling is that learning from these families' struggles may help some to avoid the routine pitfalls which lead to more serious behaviors. In the end, what you learn is that consistency, staying positive, communication and enduring to the end (perseverance) are the keys to a happy home. Family is work! But it's more work if you avoid the dysfunctions we create for ourselves. A theme I see in these shows is that parents need to stop 'babying your baby' and prepare them to contribute, and that the main focus is on the parents being united, undivided by the children's struggles to find their place in a new and sometimes confusing world.

If you have seen the online video library version available on Amazon, which I assume are true, uncut versions of the 'tele' performance, you'll notice something different ... the program is in a longer format. I make my comparisons to these later seasons. Each episode is a little more formal than later episodes with the Head Nanny's roll in directing affairs more evident. There is more discussion (very brief commentary between nannies which exaggerate each families specific crisis and perfectly formed to be and advertised TV commercial sound-bite. They make a good effort to make it seem natural but it comes across as over production. Later seasons loose this silly insert. I noticed that they gave families an additional few days to adapt to the nannies coaching than in later issues. Adding to the length is more relationship development, more conversation and less repeat foreshadowing of scenes with 'shock value' as compared to later episodes. And something that surprised me, which is eliminated from later issues, is the issuance of a sur""prize"" at the end, which is usually some sort of opportunity for family bonding such as a trip, vacation, etc. A nice enticement for people to place their families and lives on public display.

These episodes are more confrontational than in later issues. Nothing severe, but there is more angst than in latter episodes.

There is a third nanny in the mix. My guess is that the producers wanted a little 'eye candy' for the episodes as the camera frequently pans to highlight her pretty smile and attractive build. But her looks do not make her any less affective at settings things straight with these needing families.",1344211200,2,3905,4.9526717557251905
3070487,3,B0011Z5NMS,Unfortuantely it is difficult for me to write a review on this as I gave it to somone needing assistance with parenting.

3070488,4,B0011Z5NMS,"To say that the parents and Nanny Stella did not even know that the daughter was stealing money because the big brother was threatening her. These 3 children together act like a maffia. Giovanni and Adrianna are older than most kids who feature in Nanny 911. I guess delinquent children is what you get for never disciplining them properly. I'll bet Nanny Stella didn't know what she was letting herself into. It's the first time I hear her say ""I'm gonna call the police"" and that the parents will end up visiting their kids in jail, in the middle of an episode.
