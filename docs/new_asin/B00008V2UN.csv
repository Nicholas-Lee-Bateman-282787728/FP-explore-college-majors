At first I thought it was an ok Anime, but as they got deeper into it, it's a homosexual love story. Completely disgusting. There's a scene where one of the guys tries to rape the main character. I haven't watched anything after that, I stopped right there.",1236643200,,355,4.476923076923077
7987064,4,B00008V2UN,"I guess the japanese are doing something different for once having two guys as friends Yuzuru and Takeda taking up for each other against evil, funny thing is their no girl who takes place as a character in the series but thats good we see enough of them as if.",1118016000,,261,4.24
7987065,5,B00008V2UN,"This series has been long anticipated by the few in the states that know of it. In Japan it not only has a novel collection, but CD's and a wine as well.
It brings forth many old legends including Shingen Takeda and Oda Nobunaga. By incorporating the factual, it makes the story that much more darker and easier to follow. I would not recommend this for someone who is looking for laughs, but it has an excellent story line that is often missing in other series.",1058486400,9,462,4.383720930232558
7987066,4,B00008V2UN,"There isn't a lot of info out there on this new anime series but I was intrigued enough by the trailer I saw to pick this up and give it a try. Overall I really enjoyed the story, although I didn't think the artwork was particularly impressive. I attribute this to the fact that the anime isn't originating from a manga where there is something visual for the animators to follow since, as I understand it, this is based off a series of novels (38 and counting).
That being said the story is really interesting, if maybe a bit confusing at first. Still, I watched all four episodes and only wanted to see more. The story concerns two high school friends, Yuzuru, an honor student and his anti-social, street-smart buddy Takaya. What both of them don't realize is that they are spirits of long-dead feudal warlords who continue re-incarnating in body after body, perpetuating the battles and rivalries of centuries ago. Yuzuru has been possessed by an 'evil' warlord Shingen Takeda and it is up to Takaya, himself the leader of an opposing faction, to exorcize the warlord and free his friend. Fortunately he doesn't have to do it all by himself, especially since Takaya has lost his memories of his many lives can't believe that he is supposedly some ancient leader. Added to that is he doesn't have the least clue as to how he's supposed to use his powers to save his friend. Enter Naoe, a vassel of Takaya's in feudal times, come to support and assist Takaya with putting down the restless and vengelful spirits of the undead.
Sound complicated? It is a little, but I thought that the first episode did a fairly good job stuffing a lot of exposition into the story. It gave you enough information to get your bearings, but there is obviously plenty more going on that Takaya (and the viewer) don't know. It's the anticipation of learning more about what the heck is going on that got me hooked. Add a little mystery, reincarnation, mystical powers, tangled and twisted fates and historical references and I was in.
If I had any complaints it is that the animation is very dark, lots of grays and neutrals, not a lot in the way of color. I personally didn't think the character designs were anything special, and frankly I had trouble at first keeping the guys straight (Naoe's taller, check. Yuzuru's got more brown hair than black, check). Aside from that I just know this is going to be one of those series that gets you into the story only to end upleaving you unsatisfied - not in the sense that it wasn't good, only that you want MORE. The knowledge that this is based on a series of novels, and 38 (!) of them at that can only mean heartbreak for me since the chances of them ever being translated into english so I can get the whole story is practically nil. It'll drive me crazy, but in a good way.
Still, don't let that stop you checking this series out. I really enjoyed it and thought it was definately something different on the anime front. Since there isn't much info or publicity out there for this I wanted to take the time to give it a positive review. I am very much looking forward to continuing with volume two, due out in August.",1058140800,18,3152,4.521891418563923
