Dr. Arnold is truely blessed by God to be able to author such a colosal work that uses almost every topical area of scriptures to show that the Jew is God's center piece for man and his salvation. With much scripture and uncanny logic he shreds covenant (replacement) theology and presents God's true intention of selecting a people unto Himself ( the Jew); making everlasting covenants with this people (the Jew); bringing forth a Redeemer, Jeshua (a Jew); and presents a plan of salvation for both the Jew and gentile! That's right this is dispensationalism! However, God invented it when He divided the mankind into a people of His own (the Jew) with a special plan, and the rest of mankind who would be part of this plan in due time.

Dr. Fruchtenbaum shows quite convincingly that God's everlasting covenants with the Jew are still in effect. The church is NOT Israel. And yes, covenant theologists, God is not done with the Jew! As a matter of fact if He is done with the Jew then there is no Second Comming!! That's right! Check it out! Start with Lev 26:40-42; then Jer 3: 11-18 (particularly v 15); and then Matt 23:37-39. Without the Jew (the last remant); who acknowledges their sin ( the rejection of the Messiah-the First coming); and realizes it is He whom they have pierced; and then calls upon Him to come and save them from destruction (the final attempt to annililate the Jew at the end of the Tribulation); the Lord does not come back again! The Church will be ""raptured"" but Satan wins the title deed to earth. And God becomes a liar because Chapters 20, 21 and 22 of Revelation do not happen!! Check it out! Think it through!

I give four stars minus for presentation. Dr. Arnold's presentation is somewhat mono-toned and lacks pizzaz, and occasionally his accent makes a word or phrase difficult to understand. But his genius shines! I have his book by the same name and this dvd presentation follows the book quite closely. Word of caution! Don't watch this dvd before bedtime! Be wide awake and energized when viewing!!",1362441600,3,2071,4.671232876712328
