DOUBLE JEOPARDY (USA/Germany/Canada-1999), with Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce Greenwood is a most satisfying chase film where Judd, recently paroled from prison after her conviction for murdering husband Greenwood, has, during her six years of incarceration, learned that Greenwood really isn't dead. He just faked a murder scene, collected on a $2 million life insurance policy and cagily set Judd up for a fall.

Currently, Greenwood under a false identity is living in another state with Annabeth Gish, whom Judd thought was her friend. Now free, she plans to hunt down Greenwood and get her child back, and if so inclined, Judd can this time really kill him and never be convicted for murder, thanks to the double jeopardy section of the 5th Amendment.

Jones as an ex-law professor turned parole officer plays his role with less energy than usual. But this reserved quality contrasts nicely with the story's several high energy moments, like when he rescues Judd from a sinking car, or struggles with Greenwood for control of a handgun.

The last part of the movie is set in New Orleans and the city really looks terrific here, but also most sinister, especially a creepy old cemetery with its numerous above-ground crypts where one of the best sequences unfolds.

I rate it 7 out of 10 stars. IMDb voters only say 6.3 currently.",1434931200,,1496,4.968
