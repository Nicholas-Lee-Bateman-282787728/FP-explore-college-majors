263628,5,6300218228,I have seen this movie and am currently trying to find it on DVD. It truly is a reliable account of the events leading up to the founding of the state of Israel. It really should be shown in high school history classes.,1188864000,2,219,4.116279069767442

An excellent movie & unfortunately the price has always stayed very high, especially for an older movie such as this. I WONDER WHY the price stays so high? It almost makes it too expensive for most of us to want to try such an older type movie at such a high price. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!

263834,5,6300218228,"When I first saw this film, I spent all the time worrying about Ingrid Bergman. She looked so old and so tired aside from her makeup. Much later I learned that she had died 3 months after the filming from breast cancer. One of her arms was so swollen, she had to raise it between shots. The film, for me, is a tribute to Bergman's acting ability, whereas in the past, she was cited only for her great beauty.

The film reminded me of Israel's early struggles for statehood and it struggle to remain in existence against its neighbors. It is a good reminder today when Israel faces the same threats, but is now being blamed for being self-protective. This film helps us remember Israel's history as well as the role a remarkable woman played in its formation. Neither Golda Meier nor Ingrid Bergman should be forgotten. They gave to the world their prodigious talents, both in their different ways. I am grateful to them both.",1424131200,2,925,4.572289156626506

263836,4,6300218228,"I felt this was a very informative and candid portrayal of Golda Meir.  I learned a lot, this could easily be used for a classroom to each about this great Leader of the Jewish People.  Born leaders manifest their leadership traits early in their lives by making strong stands and being sometimes a bit rebellious, and so it was with Golda.  When her family tried to marry her off at the age of fourteen she ran away to her sister's house in Colorado, there she met her husband, a kind, patient man; Mr. Meyerson (played well by Leonard Nimoy; Spock) who made aliyah with her to Palestine.  We get to experience the tough life on the Kibbutz through them and her eventual rise to Political power because of her exceptional leadership and organizational skills.  Sadly we also experience the demise of her marriage and how being a politician can impede one's parental effectiveness.  Ingrid Bergman deserved the awards she achieved, her portrayal of Golda was very convincing until you no longer saw Ingrid but only Golda in the deep voice and matronly clothes.  This is a DVD I happily add to my collection and would recommend it to any educator or student of Jewish/Israeli History.",1421539200,6,1183,4.741463414634146

263931,5,6300218228,"A remarkable , highly educational, absorbing and moving docudrama about one of the greatest women of the 20th century, a woman who embodied the ideals , dreams, fears, and stamina of the Jewish people of her time.
The movie begins when Gold Meir (played in such a sterling way by Ingrid Bergman that we really believe she is Golda while watching), visits her old school in Milwaukee in 1977 and addresses the students. She described with great, charm, wit and empathy her life and we are transported back to Golda's childhood in Russia, where she huddles with her sister when the shtetl where they live is besieged by a violent pogrom which is out to murder Jews believing the Jews killed Jesus (as today the enemies of the Jews are out to destroy us under the lie that we 'stole the Palestinians land.
Then we discover how she later in America marries Morris Myerson (played by Leonard Nimoy-and who could fail to recognize him as  Spock) and emigrates to Palestine, fulfilling Golda's lifelong dream ,  their early struggles in the Holy Land from life on a kibbutz, to Golda's work in the Hisdatrut trade union movement. And the collapse of Golda'a marriage due to her unavailability for her family.

We are observe the proclamation of the State of Israel, the violent Arab reaction and are privy to Golda's visit to Amman to try persuade King Abdullah to keep Transjordan out of the war, and is told by the king that if peace was negotiated between them Ben-Gurion would be hailed by his people as great hero, and Abdullah would be murdered by his own people (as he was by an Arab terrorist four years later). Moving moments such as when Golda weeps when she meets Jewish children in Cyprus-who grew up in Nazi concentration camps, who had never seen flowers in their lives! And her anger at the Soviets granting Arab armies vast quantities  of the most technologically advanced and best weaponry they had free of charge.
A really compelling and inspiring look at Israel and this great woman, relevant now more than ever, at  a time when so much of the world is swallowing the evil and venomous Arab propaganda.
As we follow Golda's political career  as Foreign Minister including her sterling work in Africa, the way in which Israel was forced into the Six Day War (starting with Syria's murderous attacks on Israeli villages in northern Israel, and Nasser's troop movements as with that of the armies of Iraq and Jordan, as well as the violent threats made by the Arabs of genocide.

But we also see how Golda refused to let her diagnosis with lymphoma in the early 1960s stop her from playing her role in history and the destiny of her nation. And her surprise at being asked to become Prime Minister in 1969.
Explains her role in the Yom Kippur War, why she failed to order a preemptive strike when it was clear the Arab armies were attacking Israel just before the Yom Kippur War. and the public anger in Israel at Golda and Moshe Dayan who many blamed for the war. Golda throughout demonstrated her strong longing  for peace and that of all of Israel, with Israel's repeated pleas for peaceful coexistence with the Arab world. It is to the audience of the school at Milwaukee who she tells in this movie 'Peace will come when the Arabs love their own children more than they hate us'.

It ends with Golda's meeting with Anwar Sadat during his visit to Jerusalem in 1978, where she asks Sadat why he took so long to come. My only quibble with the movie takes place here where at the press conference it is Golda who appears next to Sadat as the main speaker when in reality it was the then Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
A compelling look at the life of one of the greatest Jewish women ever and also affirms the extraordinary spirit of the people of Israel,
the most humane, giving, life-affirming people on the planet--
whatever sick propaganda you might have read to the contrary.",1379203200,3,3891,4.627536231884058

263992,5,6300218228,"From humble beginnings in Russia, Golda Meir rose to astounding fame as Israel's Prime Minister during the turbulent period, 1969 - 1974. Her story parallel's that of the Nation of Israel.  This is a made-for-TV movie (2 parts) that aired in April, 1082. It is a remarkable story, both personally and historically.  Since Golda Meir was such a remarkable woman, it required a powerful remarkable actress like Ingrid Bergman to portray her life. Ms. Bergman absolutely becomes Golda Meir, the ""Mother of Israel"".  Her performance won her an Emmy award for Best Leading Actress.  Golda's  story begins in her childhood which involved pogroms to purge the Jews in Russia; this gave her her lifelong dream of returning to Zion (Israel).  Her family immigrated to America, where she met her husband, Morris Meyerson, (wonderfully portrayed by Leonard Nimoy) and then to Palestine and finally, Israel.  This is a marvelous, gripping story; a powerful story of a humble, gentle, ever-so-human, yet, powerful woman who despite remarkable odds, lived to see a peace treaty with Israel's chief enemy, Egypt.

This is a very good story, yet, it will not appeal to a wide audience.  Those interested in history, especially the history of Israel, will love this movie, as I did.  Kids will be bored by it, as will those seeking action and adventure.  No, this is a serious movie for a serious audience.  It is well worth the time invested to learn about the remarkable life that was Golda Meir.

263995,4,6300218228,"A Woman Called Golda was originally made as a two-part television miniseries. It is an important movie on several levels, perhaps mostly because it tells the story of the State of Israel but also because it is the last film appearance by Ingrid Bergman. This is not light entertainment (at almost four hours) to be viewed casually by a fan of the late and beautiful Swedish actress.  Those who remember Golda Meir know that whatever her many fine and great qualities, she was not a beauty. Ingrid wears her hair in the tight, pulled back style of Golda and is as unglamorous as she can be. However, Ingrid is brilliant in this role and this is a fitting, crowning achievement to her career.  This film should be seen to remind us of a great world leader portrayed by one of the greatest stars of all time.
I give this movie only four stars because of its length, and because Ingrid Bergman appears in about one third of the actual movie. A younger actress portrays the young Golda, and there is much historical footage.  It is very well done, but it is a serious work. If you just want to be entertained by Ingrid Bergman, choose one of her other wonderful films.",1317081600,3,1163,4.502369668246446

All the wars and trial & tribulations of a new nation which unfortunately still struggles to exist even today. Ingrid Bergman's acting is superb as Golda. I wish she could have lived to receive the awards that came with the movie although I know she was dying herself of Cancer at the time.  It was one of her best parts & acting from a long career of great movies. I'm so glad her last movie was so great & some of her best work. I love Golda and learning about her. She was an amazing woman at a difficult time in History for her people. Amazing how she contributed to the birth & continued existence of Israel. A struggle all new countries go through having to fight for the right to exist as so many countries have had to experience including the USA where I'm from.

264025,5,6300218228,"STORY - The made for TV mini-series begins with a limousine pulling up to an elementary school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Out steps Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel and the most famous graduate of this school. Born a Russian Jew, she and her family were forced to leave Russia in the early 20th century and emigrated to the US. Golda's dream became to live in Israel. As she answers questions from the school children she flashes back to her life and the events that led to her being the Prime Minister of Israel and one of the most influential women of the 20th century. Ingrid Bergman is outstanding as always and was a great choice to play the part of Golda Meir. This is not only the story of an incredible and influential woman but it is the story of Israel, its journey to statehood and its fight to survive in the midst of its enemies. It's a great biography and an excellent history lesson. It makes one wonder what it would be like now if there were a woman of her stature in Israeli leadership. It's four hours long with the DVD divided into two sections. Well worth the investment of time to learn more about this important area of the world.

264026,5,6300218228,"Ingrid Bergman does a wonderful job, as does Judy Davis, at playing the Iron Lady Golda Meir (before Thatcher, there was Golda).  Golda Meir's life traced itself from the Russian Empire to the American Jewish Diaspora to the formation of Israel and through the pivotal times of war and peace.

Originally run as a television mini-series, this film shows her childhood, life on a kibbutz, early days in Israel, and times as Foreign Minister and Prime Minister in good detail, both personal and professional, to give a real sense of the woman and the political figure.  From her childhood she was a determined person; her shakey marriage with Morris Meyerson is depicted with sensitivity (Leonard Nimoy plays the long-suffering Meyerson).  Her ideas of hope and her determination for both security and peace are depicted with passion and humor.

Watch for cameos from people such as Ned Beatty (who plays an American senator being strong-armed into selling advanced weaponry to Israel), Nigel Hawthorne (in quite a bit of make-up as the King of Jordan who lays the political reality out for Golda Meir as to why he can't initiate peace and live), and Robert Loggia (as Anwar Sadat).

The story has good pacing; much is done in flash-back form.  In part it is done through narrative device of one of Golda's political secretaries, Lou Kaddar, played by Anne Jackson.  I loved the scene where Lou Kaddar interviews for the job with Golda, and presents a letter as a sample of her writing.  The letter is in praise of her former employer; ""He sounds like an outstanding man,"" Golda says, to which Lou Kaddar responds, ""He was a son of a *bleep*.""  Golda, without missing a beat, simply replies, ""You might do well at this job.""

It has been a long time coming, but it is worth the wait.",1240531200,11,1781,4.768729641693811
