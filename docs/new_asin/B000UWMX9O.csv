8215551,3,B000UWMX9O,I want very impressed with this video. It was boring and only about hurricanes in general. I didn't see that it had a whole lot to even do with the 1947 hurricane. There was no footage of the local area where it made landfall on the gulf coast. I learned more about that hurricane and the days that followed from my dad who talked about that particular hurricane all his life. That's the whole reason I bought the DVD. Big disappointment to me. It was so terribly boring that I didn't even finish watching it.,1490140800,,509,4.368421052631579
