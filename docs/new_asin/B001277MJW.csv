I suppose their are many beautiful women in the world. Many are due to surgery. I was shocked to see on line many STARS of today have had surgery or some type of alteration. An example is Nicole Kidman who looked better before altering her lips. What is this wanting of what I would call Lubra lips particularly if it is not natural. Getting back to this movie this Russian country girl really wanted to be a Model and famous. When they dyed her hair blonde and coached her she was a dead ringer for Princess Grace of Monaco, Had the production team FOR ""PRINCESS GRACE lauched a world wide search for a women who had a closer resemblance to Princess Grace & if the script was good it would have been a hit movie instead it went straight to DVD, which says it all. They could have used this Russian actor to play Grace. It was stunning the resemblance. The conclusion o f the movie is left with a Questian mark. I enjoyed this film and have tried to but it. Another film about Princess Diana was also acted by another Australian and I thought her not a good choice, she has no resemblance to Diana.
If this has subtitles I will buy it.",1433808000,,1293,4.260162601626016

I would prefer to watch Nikita Mihalkov's movies-Siberian Barber, Bespridannitsa,and so on-instead of watching Gloss...",1255737600,3,668,5.4326923076923075
