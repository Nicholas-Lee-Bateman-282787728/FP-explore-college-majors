7955027,4,B00005UQ6N,"Enjoyed seeing the same problems with truthfulness in advertising as well as in relationships portrayed in the film. I would caution high school teachers of the language issue, but that is the only thing from keeping it from your students.",1360627200,,239,5.0
7955028,5,B00005UQ6N,We love this movie- may not be for everyone but it is quirky and fun watching the rise and fall of Viktor Vogel.,1357689600,,112,3.9130434782608696
7955029,4,B00005UQ6N,"I screened this for a German class.  Although there is no sex in this movie, there is drinking and some obscenities, so I can't show this in class.  What a shame, as I liken this movie to a toned-down Jim Carrey movie.  It's clever, quirky and hip and actually conveys a message about current social issues without in any way being grim or preachy.  Age discrimination from both the young and the old play a dominant theme in this offbeat comedy.

Victor Vogel is the protagonist who somehow gets mistaken for a high-level ad writer.  He quickly catches on and goes with the flow.  The outcome is hilarious and sweet.  ""Vogel"" ironically is also the animal the Germans use to describe someone who is a big crazy.  ""Er hat einen Vogel"" means ""he's crazy!"" and this Vogel is no exception.

The acting is well done, the script well-written.  For the price of this movie, this is a deal!",1314230400,,883,4.525316455696203
7955030,5,B00005UQ6N,"I bought this because I was looking for a cheap film for learning German. It is absolutely delightful, even after watching it many times. The story is a lot of fun. If you are thinking of getting this to learn German, the dialog is relationship and business based - you aren't going to hear a lot of things about day-to-day life (it isn't going to help you with restaurant ordering). There are also some different accents so some of the people are hard to understand sometimes. This is helpful because there are a lot of different accents in German! The subtitles usually give a good idea of what they said. There are plenty of ""bad"" words in the German dialog and the subtitles, but it isn't that adult - there is implied sex and a fight at the beginning, but nothing that wouldn't be allowed on U.S. TV. I would watch it with my kids, but I would coach them first about which German words and in what context are considered bad.",1306713600,,930,4.412790697674419
7955031,4,B00005UQ6N,"This is a delectable movie. The Viktor Vogel character is hilarious, yet believable. I couldn't help laughing out loud at the way he lived into the lies (the resume embelishments, etc), which eventually caught up with him. Makes you question the validity of the mantra... ""fake it 'til you make it."" I couldn't help but root for him as the underdog in the cut throat world of advertising where personalites with oversized egos will do anything to make a buck.

To the person who wanted info about the sountrack... The song is ""Sometimes"" by ""Minus 8"" aka Robert Jan Meyer. This song is on his Minuit album (try iTunes).

7955032,4,B00005UQ6N,"I enjoyed this movie more as an advertising student than the average person my age would have to be sure....It had its funny moments and managed to entertain me all while watching certain aspects of the business I study come to life...(Wielding chainsaws and such taken with a grain of salt)

Okay...If anyone can help me with this I will be thrilled...I love the opening song on the main DVD menu page...Does anyone know where I can find it?  I believe it's entitled Sometimes...but no searches grab anything...I have no idea as to who the artist is..Can anyone help?  Thanks....

7955033,5,B00005UQ6N,"This movie characterizes in a very enjoyable, light and humorous way the hypocritical world of advertising. It shows how easily one can rise and fall in the world of advertisment.
It certainly is true that sometimes a young and fresh spirit can bring a lot of ""swing"" into an advertisment firm.
The actors do a fantastic job. Highly recommendable for people who like to think a little critically about modern society, yet wants to have fun at the same time. Just wonderful. Go buy it.",1029715200,3,484,4.705882352941177
7955034,4,B00005UQ6N,"This is easily the best German film to make it to North America since Run Lola Run.
To start, this film has excellent sound and picture.  Plus, the extra features are far superior to other European films released in North America. Even the trailer is the original German trailer, not some dubbed over North American trailer.
The story is great.  The actors do a magnificent job.  And the storyline flows along at a nice pace.  Furthermore, the editing is crisp and the mixture of shots works well to move the story along.
The humor in this film is unpredictable and hilarious.  The character Viktor drives the plot well and the supporting characters match the tone perfectly.  Strangely enough, the story is not at all unrealistic.  It's a very believable and totally entertaining situation.
I'd recommend highly.  I don't want to spoil the ending, so let's just say that there are two to choose from, since one is in the extra features.  You'll probably like one better.  If there were any important flaws in the movie I'd list them here, but there aren't.  I challenge anyone to find some and post it.
If you like Gtz George's preformance, I'd highly recommend ""Das Trio"" (The Trio) as well.",1025740800,7,1193,4.742718446601942
