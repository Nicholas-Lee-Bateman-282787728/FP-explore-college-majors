I have found that there is useful information in this poorly constructed video that I have picked out that go hand in hand with other videos that I own. If your MOS is 31 series, I would buy it, if not, it's a matter of how much are you willing to spend to learn a few nifty moves.",1280016000,,398,3.925925925925926
8201147,5,B000RKQ39K,"If you need great martial arts techniques, Military Police or not, buy this DVD!  The sound quality is good (not great) but the techniques are well worth the price.  I would expect this DVD to be sold in seperate DVDs for $50 a piece.  I think it will benefit anyone who serves in the Army or not.  I especially enjoyed the chapter on ground combat.",1211241600,8,349,4.323076923076923
8201148,5,B000RKQ39K,"I was skeptical when I purchased this DVD but was not disappointed once it arrived.  There are no ""bells and whistles"" on this hour plus DVD and sometimes I had to rewind and pause the DVD itself to understand the techniques, but this DVD is PACKED with great hand to hand combat stuff!  It is worth the $25.  I really learned a lot from it and the techniques are simple to learn but realistic at the same time.  It is geared for the military but I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn some good self defense moves!",1182038400,14,526,4.23
