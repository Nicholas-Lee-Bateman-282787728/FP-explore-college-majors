""Eyes on the Prize"" changed my life forever. Today's schools will not share this, but I will keep my promise and share this documentary with my two sons soon.",1117670400,4,301,4.490909090909091
698900,5,6303674992,"This series is the difinitive piece on the history of the Civil Rights Movement from 1954 to the mid 1980's. Anyone looking to understand the struggle for freedom and democracy in the U.S. must see this series. It should be required viewing as part of the curriculum of high schools, and available in every college, and university library.

The first series (6 episodes) focuses on the period from 1954-1965 and looks at issues such as desegregation, voting rights, bocotts, sit-ins, and marches. The series was nominated for an Oscar in 1987. The second series (8 episodes) focuses on the period from 1965 to the mid-80s. It is very diferent in tone than the first series as it explores more controversial issues such as power, law enforcement, distribution of wealth, and poverty. Nonetheless, all of these stories are handled well and are intertwinded in compelling and fascinating history telling.

Currently copyright law has made the series unavailable for distribution (which is why you cannot get the series on DVD). However, there are efforts to re-clear the rights and we may see these incredible programs again in another year or two. Until then hold on to your copies if you have one. Hampton's archive (which has all the materials used in the series) is held at Washington University in St. Louis.",1113264000,5,1310,4.9771689497716896

698902,5,6303674992,"""I know the one thing we did right, was the day we started to fight...keep your eyes on the prize, hold on my lord, hold on! ""  These are the lyrics to the music in the opening of each tape, in the Eyes  on the Prize set.  I consider this collection one of the most influential  forms of film ever made.  The power of the visuals, the singing, the  interviews of the civil rights movement is so overwhelming throughout these  videos.  When I become a classroom teacher, I fully intend to use these  videos to educate students about the experiences and injustice of the civil  rights movement.
This documentary is one of my most prized possessions,  which I value tremendously because it is an important tool in educating  people about the civil rights movement in ways they cannot be educated  through reading of books or articles.
It should be made mandatory in  all schools to have the social studies teachers show this video.  The  students will definately walk away with a much different perspective on  America and race relations - the perspective that offers the truth.
Who  can dispute the horrible murders of Emmitt Till, Cheney Goodman &  Schwerner, among countless of others?  Eyes on the Prize does not cover up  the graphic details of these situations, but rather shows them - close up.  It'll leave images in your mind you will vividly remember for a long, long  time.  Then there's the era of MLKing, Jr. and the March on Washington.  The Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, and  the list goes on and on.
Unquestionably a video worth purchasing and  watching over and over and over.  You'll learn something new each time.",964742400,26,1666,4.710801393728223
698903,5,6303674992,"I watched the series in England over several Monday nights. It left me in tears after each episode. I have been fortunate because I have videotape every single episode and will keep it for any children I have. If you watch  only one documentary about the civil rights then this is the one. It is  authoratitive, accurate, serious and full of heart rendering stories  showing the struggle for human rights for Black people. If every school in  showed this serious, then maybe, just maybe, there would be a better  understanding between us all.",959040000,6,542,4.78494623655914

698905,5,6303674992,"""EYES ON THE PRIZE"" is a film for all races of people to experience.  Because of its frankness the film lends itself to subject matter that can be inflammatory to some, however it is presented in a  manner that can lend itself to be an agent of healing for many more.

698906,5,6303674992,I have used this video series to students of all ages and ethnic/racial backgrounds and it has shocked them that these events took place here in the United States. This is a great tool for anyone who teaches about the  civil rights movement. It is a must see! It has opened the lives of many of  Youth that I have worked with.,924480000,12,326,4.241935483870968
7852396,5,6303674992,"I was heavily involved in the operations depicted in the Albany, Georgia story of 1961 and the March in Washington of 1963. (Dr. King asked us to use ""in"" instead of ""on"" because it was less confrontational.
I can been seen in the mob scene in the march from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. I'm about 50 feet from the front, slightly to the left, and leaning to my left to see around the person in front of me.  I was actually looking to see if Martin Luther King had joined the march! (He had not done so at that time). I am also the only white person in the march in Albany on January 16, 1961. I am in the line led by MLK.  There is a street light pole that bisects the march and I am the 2nd marcher to the left of the pole, wearing an unbuttoned top coat with my hands in my coat pockets. Although this collection does not include the famous picture of King waving to the crowd from the camera stand I am in that picture for the simple reason that he started the waive specifically at me! Most versions are cropped on the left  and I am the 5th person left out, but I have a copy that includes my picture.  I was (and am) personally acquainted with many of the actors in this series, including the narrator, Julian Bond.
Of course, I have to give the package high marks for presenting a few of my own exploits.

7852398,5,6303674992,"""Eyes on the Prize"" is an excellent contemporary history of the civil rights movement from 1954 to 1965, and is ""must viewing"" for anyone who wishes to gain a proper understanding of that difficult time in our history.  Although it is presented from the perspective of the civil rights movement, it is reasonably fair and balanced, as many of the antagonists from that era are interviewed and are permitted to explain the positions they took then and to offer their subsequent reflections on the controversy.  The only shortcoming, in my view, is that the federal judiciary is let off far too lightly for its role in designing and maintaining racial segregation in the United States.  Starting with Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, and continuing for nearly 60 years until 1954, there is an unbroken line of United States Supreme Court cases that uphold the doctrine of ""separate but equal"" upon which racial segregation was based.",1197072000,,926,4.961290322580645
7852399,5,6303674992,"This beautiful, moving, and absolutely essential documentary has been called a masterpiece. The word ""masterpiece"", while apt, does not do this film justice. This is 14 hours of essential and vital American history that no American child should miss. This film should be required viewing in every American high school. An exhaustive and fully rounded examination of the Civil Rights Movement from it's infancy in the 1950's to it's essential realization in the 1980's. Now, in spite of the years-long struggle to obtain the rights to the thousands of pieces of news footage in the film, PBS has finally released ""Eyes on The Prize"" in a 7 DVD box at the price of $375.00 before taxes and shipping. Actually the PBS was only able to secure the limited ""educational use"" rights for the film and not mass release rights for the general public. Intended first and foremost for purchase by educational institutions and libraries (which explains the high price), anyone can actually purchase the set if they're willing to pay the money. To locate the set,you have to go the ""Teacher's Shop"" page of the PBS web site and search for ""Eyes On The Prize DVD"". You will not be able to locate it if you just go to the general PBS site and look in the ""Black History"" section.",1195430400,8,1263,4.745454545454545
7852400,5,6303674992,"Folks, you have to be ready to watch this.  You've got to be in the right mindset to digest this.  It is a hard hitting, thought provoking punch in the gut presentation about what people were willing to endure just to enjoy the simple things that we now take for granted(i.e. voting, quality education, eating in public places, fair justice).  Where would be we without the Civil Rights Movement?

I was exposed to this when I was in undergrad and I immediately purchased my own set because I knew that it was something that I wanted my kids to see when I had them.  This is VERY good and it is not candy coated.  You will get the point relative to how hard the Civil Rights struggle was.  I know I did.",1195171200,,703,4.28030303030303

RE: Eye's On the Prize

Who is holding this educational documentary hostage?

I understand that many people may have their hands in the films royalty cookie jar but lets be real. All their greed should not prevent this film from being legally duplicated and market.

DVD format will make this documentary more accessable and affordable to all.

If they can figure out how to release Deep Throat on to DVD, I know this historical American master piece can be released also. Then it can be placed on sale at your site or for rent at Blockbuster.",1149206400,19,570,4.66

You will experience the persecution and the victory achieved by Blacks in America.  Many of the people who survived the civil rights era are interviewed and allowed to provide a modern day perspective.  Some of MLK's closest friends give you insight on MLK.
