2315301,5,B0009RQRD8,I found these workouts on youtube. They became my favorite dvd. I own. Great workout and have a great time doing it. Have tons of energy afterwards. One of Billy's best in my opinion. Ive only done the basic training though.  Ive watched the ultimate and still waiting a little bit longer before trying it. Looks challenging and want to make sure I have the basic workout down first. Love this so much I had to own. Afraid it'd be taken down on youtube and wanted to have in my own collection,1360368000,,492,4.3478260869565215
2315302,5,B0009RQRD8,"This is exactly what I expected from Billy Blanks! It's tough, it's high impact, and it's fast paced. Results already have started showing after only 2.5 weeks!!",1360108800,,161,5.0
2315303,4,B0009RQRD8,"I have this two-disc set. Billy Banks Ultimate Boot Camp is both good cardio and good strength training for me. It's a little less girly than a lot of my videos, as it doesn't include dance steps. And it's harder than any of my other videos. In fact, it's the only one of my videos that I have to drop out of for the last few reps sometimes. BB has enormous upper body strength, much more than I. I use just regular fitness bands, using the lighter gauge in the set on my left side, and that works fine. It does have some high impact moves, including jumping jacks, which I hate, but I really like the kickboxing moves. There's some floor work, even rolling on the floor between pushup sets, so make sure you're ready for that, and have something to protect your knees for some of the floor work. The ab work is brutal. I can't get halfway through, and I'm the only woman in my kickbox class that can do all the ab work there, so I think it would be hard for a lot of people. Not, of course, the extremely ripped people in the video, though.",1231200000,,1041,4.1840796019900495
2315304,5,B0009RQRD8,"I've been doing Billy Blanks' videos on and off for about 5 years, and faithfully now for the past 3 months. I am now a college student, I played varsity basketball and soccer in high school, and I am still amazed at how intense of a workout Billy can put together. The first few times were quite hard to keep up, and left me sore afterwards.

The Basic Training workout is very good and works the shoulders, arms, legs, and abs very well. The Ultimate Bootcamp workout is my favorite of Billy's so far, and has exceeded my previous favorite ""Bootcamp Elite Mssion 2: Maximum Power"" which is also a great workout. Ultimate keeps you busy the entire time, got sweat pouring down my face during the entire workout, and worked out the exact areas I wanted.

I've found that doing these workouts 3-4 times a week also enhanced my performance in basketball by increasing my vertical jump by a few inches, helping me stay low in my defensive stance, as well as helping me be able to run faster and longer than any of my teammates. It has also helped my hand-eye and foot-eye coordination. I believe that using the bands and focusing on control was beneficial for when I played soccer as well.

Billy is also very encouraging and fun to workout with. I suggest setting up a regular time to do it several times a week, and try to get someone to do it with you too. You will not be disappointed, whether you are an athlete to stay in good shape, or a normal working professional looking to stay in the best shape of your life.",1202515200,3,1517,4.410714285714286
2315305,5,B0009RQRD8,"Ive only done the basic training dvd so far and that was a great workout! I think I will stick with that for awhile before I try the next one. Even if you don't have the bands it is very tough! Lots of cardio, and stretching. Great all around workout!",1194393600,9,251,4.04
2315306,4,B0009RQRD8,"I have several BB series, it's the only exercise routine have been able to stick too - I can't dance worth beans and don't like traditional aerobic programs ! BB is more calisthenics and I've been able to get male friends into it because of that too. This particular series  concentrates on heavier arm and shoulder workout, and I noticed a difference when carrying heavier items I was much stronger in that area. And it's a more intense workout than some previous ones.

Down side: recommmend if you buy this to do it thru BB direct - I bought this series and the newer upgraded BB band set thru a retail store that soon after went out of business - w/in several mos of normal usage both sets of bands busted,  and was told by BB customer service they not do exchanges because it wasn't purchased directly from them. Yikes.",1180051200,4,824,4.48
2315307,5,B0009RQRD8,"I bought the entire set of Billy's Bootcamp tapes and the Billy Bands (it was about [...]) and they really do all they say they will. After a week or two you feel stronger and more energized. I really really recommend these DVDs, especially if you're looking for something to really challenge yourself. When I began the tapes, they was pretty much kicking my [...], but now I can do every single exercise, including squatt thrusts which gave me the most trouble! It still challenges me, but I can't believe how far I've come and how much it has changed my physique! Billy is also a really motivational trainer. I can't wait to try Bootcamp Elite! (Another bonus: after you do the tapes for awhile you can use them about once a week (while keeping healthy eating-wise, of course) and you won't see a change in your results! They sculpt your entire body!)",1161129600,6,853,4.5816993464052285
2315308,5,B0009RQRD8,"I bought this workout pack 2 weeks ago after seeing it showcased on the fitness channel.  I've tryed a lot of workout tapes before and never liked any of them.  This stuff is different.  To start off with, you don't bounce around.  Ladies, this one won't leave your chest hurting.  Every move is very precise.  Second, it works.  My first week, everyday and without the bands (I hadn't bought any yet)I did one of the videos.  I lost 5 lbs, 3% body fat, and 4 inches.  I now have the bands, and the workout is really tough with them.  I can't finish most of the sets with them on so I toss them off my hands when I have to, then pick them back up next round.

The downsides: Billy sometimes says one more set and then starts talking and three sets later you're thinking ""shut up already!""  Shellie, however, does a great job on keeping the count steady.  Next, you gotta buy the bands, and that sucks.  And finally, The one dvd, Basic, is really just to teach you technique and strengthen you enough to be able to do the heavier tapes.  It serves it's purpose well, but anyone beyond that point will think that one was a waste of their money.

All told, I love it.  I'm still losing weight and feeling great and I plan to get more of the Billy Blanks dvds.",1152316800,25,1256,4.254237288135593
2315309,4,B0009RQRD8,"This is not a cardio workout. This is a workout designed to stregthen and build muscle. You can do the workout without the rubber workout bands but if you want a true workout GET THE BANDS. If you do have shoulder problems do not do this workout. Alot of this workout is designed to strengthen you shoulder muscles. I had to stop doing this workout for awhile because I hurt my one shoulder-joint.

Now there are a few minor problems. Number one this workout is an hour long. Unlike previous workouts. So give yourself some time. Number two is that not all of the people doing the workout are doing it right. When it comes to shoulder workouts you should never jerk your reps or over-extend them. Some of the people on the dvd do this. It is very dangerous and could result in a bad injury.

All in all a solid work out. It goes good with a cardio workout. If you do a cardio one day and the boot camp the next you will see some major changes with in a short time. And trust me you'll need the break of a day between doing this workout just to give your muscles time to heal.",1138665600,27,1075,4.188405797101449

2315346,5,B0009RQRD8,"These two dvds each provide a good, hard, workout.  I have tried many workout videos and dvds, and the Billy Blanks series deliver hard workouts without being too annoying and without movements that are difficult to copy.  The workouts work all muscle groups and are fairly fast paced.  I am rating these two workout dvds 5 stars not because they are the best workouts I have ever had (some gym workouts have been better) but because Billy Blank's dvds are the best  workout dvds I've found.  When I try dvds with other trainers, I find that I am usually disappointed.",1425600000,,568,4.64

It's hard to get an hour workout in a busy schedule, but when I get the chance to do this, I feel energized and amazing afterwards.  This is not a beginner's workout and it will kick your butt.  He takes you through the work out at a very rapid pace.",1408665600,,411,4.1

2315353,5,B0009RQRD8,"I started doing Tae-bo after my husband introduced me to it last year. Since then i have been doing it 4-5 days a week every week.
First and foremost, i like that unlike other workout dvds there, tae-bo dvds do not cost fortune at all. They all are at very affordable price. Thats why i was even ready to try this as i did not want to spend a lot of money and then get stuck with it if i did not like it.

I have done by now almost 70% of the tae-bo dvds out there. Today was my first day i did the basic bootcamp and i loved it. I do not have that much of upper body strength so this was a little tough for me and specially when i chose to do it with the bands but as much as it was hurting when i was doing it, it feels really good later. I mean if i did not feel the workout, i know then i did not do it right. This dvd does not come with the band but i had gotten it with the bootcamp live dvd (that dvd comes with the band). If you do not have the band, no problem as you can still do it right without the band. But if you have one, i would suggest you use that for more burn.
At the end of this DVD, Billy Blanks does some abs workout too (some with and some without bands both) so you get to workout all your body parts and thats what i like about all tae bo dvds.
I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking for not just loosing weight but gaining strength too",1403308800,3,1381,3.7620689655172415

2315374,4,B0009RQRD8,"I read reviews about this video being very good for beginners. So, I thought that even with my arthritis and other injuries, I could do this. I've done Zumba and basic calisthenics in the past, but, this video was not for me...at least at the present time. He rapidly gives directions, and very quickly moves from standing position to the floor, then to standing position. This is just too much for my body to adjust too. I have to constantly pause the video and that leads to frustration. I decided that I need a personal workout that gives me the time I need to adjust to dramatically different positions.

However, I highly recommend this video for others that don't have special needs.",1397520000,,689,4.647540983606557

8065861,5,B0009RQRD8,"Billy Blanks has never failed me before!
I use to do his basic training when I was a teenager and I always enjoyed it. Once I fell out of the habit I never thought about him again until I decided to get serious about my health and wellbeing.  I don't have a gym membership and can't justify purchasing one so I resorted to running two miles in my neighborhood everyday. However, I could never remain consistent with my running schedule even though I enjoy running; and what good is enjoying an exercise if it's never done consistently enough to see any results in one's physique? So, when I became serious about exercising I looked up Billy Blanks' video and was please to see it here at such a great deal.
A few tips for beginners:
1) If you have never followed Billy Blanks' routine do yourself a favor and look up his Basic Training BootCamp plan on youtube before buying this set; watch the full 55mins and determine if you're physically capable and motivated enough to do this workout before making this purchase.
2) If you commit to Billy Blanks' regimen be sure to TAKE YOUR TIME and FOCUS on your FORM! I cannot stress this enough! If you are not careful in paying attention to how your body feels in the form you've taken you WILL injure yourself. On the subject of form let me present three additional pointers:
2a) Don't over extend your punches or ""snap"" your shoulders during any of his arm exercises.
2b) Mind your kicks; it is possible to over extend your kicks and hurt your knees.  The best advice I can offer in this point is to be sure to control the kick from your thigh rather than kick with all your might from your knee.
2c) If you suffer from IT band pain (or any other exercise induced outer thigh pain) be mindful of how low you squat during the ""duck walk"" segment of the Basic Training BootCamp video.
3) Once again, I want to stress you take your time and build yourself up to Billy Blank's workout. Speaking from experience, I have only been doing the Basic Training video. I do a repetition until the muscle burn is uncomfortable and then allow myself to rest a few seconds until the burning subsides...then I jump right back into the repetition. After two-weeks of building myself up to this workout like this, I can see and feel a difference in my body. :) I can assure you that you will too if you mind your diet and workout consistently.",1520640000,,2372,4.450574712643678
