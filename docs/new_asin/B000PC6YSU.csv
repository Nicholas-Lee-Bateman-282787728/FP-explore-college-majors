2816152,5,B000PC6YSU,"While planning a trip to Ireland we watched the episode on Dublin. After seeing the part on the mummies of Saint Michan's Church we knew we had to make that a part of our itinerary. We were so glad we did! It was one of the highlights of Dublin. We even got to go into the crypt and rub one of the mummies fingers for luck! It worked, the rest of the trip was a dream come true. THANKS SAMANTHA!

The rest of the DVD is fantastic also. I am sure we will be using it for research on future travels to Europe.",1229385600,,507,3.9223300970873787
2816153,5,B000PC6YSU,"Samantha Brown has a vast knowledge of the locations she narrates on and makes you feel as though you are right there experiencing the same things she is.  She is entertaining, witty, and informative.  I will continue to add to my collection of Passport to Europe, and hopefully someday Great Hotels will also be available for purchase.  Who said learning has to be boring?",1220832000,2,373,4.796875
2816154,4,B000PC6YSU,"Samantha has a way of letting us enjoy traveling without being there.  As a person who does travel, I will watch her TV shows often to hear her inside pointers.  This CD is both entertaining and educational.",1218931200,3,207,4.5675675675675675
2816155,5,B000PC6YSU,"i really enjoy samantha brown, and i first checked these out from the library before we planned our trip.  when we got back, i bought it because we went to so many of the places she tours in the video.  it was really fun at that point, to watch it and say, 'we were there!'

she does a good job of having fun and being perky without being obnoxious, or overdoing it.",1209513600,8,366,4.055555555555555
2816156,5,B000PC6YSU,"(and boy are her legs tired?)
If you like Samantha, you will love her travel videos of England, Ireland, and Scotland.",1203292800,7,118,4.666666666666667
2816157,5,B000PC6YSU,"I enjoyed this travel DVD, and certainly would recommend it to anyone wishing to travel to Europe, to see things and go to places off the tourist route.  Her Americanism is not annoying, and you do get a laugh at some of her comments.  She mingles with the locals in all regions, takes you to enjoyable places to eat and drink, and talks about the accommodation and gives prices.  She choses the middle to upper types of accommodation in each region, as she travelled in the low season.
I can understand why she was awarded the Emmy for 'Outstanding Lifestyle Directing"".",1193443200,4,571,4.633663366336633
2816158,5,B000PC6YSU,"Brown does it again, brings back familar travel experiences abroad and introduces me to new areas of countries I once explored in person. The UK is a must visit, but buyer beware-the USD to sterling pound exchange rate is a killer!!! Enjoy the trip without leaving your home, cheers.",1191628800,5,283,4.795918367346939
2816159,5,B000PC6YSU,"I have never been to England or Ireland, but this show has made that trip a priority on my list.  The eps ""English Countryside"" and ""Ireland Coast"" are like magical fairy tales.  I've seen probably every ep of Passport to Europe, and these British eps (along w/ Austria and Switzerland) are my favorites.  Samantha as always is a charming host.  Her sense of humor is great and these eps are particularly fun because there is no language barrier between her and the locals.  Every interaction will make you smile and most will make you laugh.  These episodes are whimsical, witty, wonderful...if you are armchair traveling, this is the trip you want to take.",1187481600,29,658,4.778761061946903
2816160,5,B000PC6YSU,"This dvd really fit the bill for me in helping me plan what I may want to see/do in the UK.  Although London itself is huge you cannot really delve into everything that is out there and do it all justice, this gives you a small slice of classic London, some of the big tourist sites, the English Countryside, Edinburgh and Ireland.  The only area I had already visited was Ireland and I think it did a nice job in giving you a small slice of what the countryside looks like, though it is in no way a comprehensive dvd of all areas.

The narrator/traveller, Samantha Brown is charming.  She asks questions you might ask yourself and has a self-deprecating sense of humor and a willingness to try it all.  You can tell she enjoys travel and has a real sense of humor about it.  She often gives her own personal opinion, as when she visits Piccadilly Circus and claims it really is too chaotic and crazy for her, but that is her own opinion.  I like the fact she seems very honest and genuine and it makes watching her adventures that much more fun.

The dvd is beautifully photographed and it felt like a pre-vacation just seeing the sites that I hope to someday see in person.

Overall, a great dvd to give you a small sampling of what the UK offers and a wide range of sites and activities.  I would not hesitate to look to the passport dvds again when researching vacation destinations.",1339804800,,1387,4.3828125
2816161,3,B000PC6YSU,Enjoyable for its entertainment value. Other travel videos give you a different and perhaps better flavor for desired tourist destinations.,1318896000,3,139,6.0
2816162,2,B000PC6YSU,"This is not a serious effort, rather it's aimed at the mass viewing audience and is rather dumbed down.  Brown is more worried about her clothes, the look of a hotel room that no one can afford, or whether someone calls her a ""Lass"" or not, instead of providing any meaningful or useful travel insights.  Entertaining?  Sure.  As much as watching COPS or a police chase on CNN.  Useful?  No.",1290470400,6,391,4.514285714285714
2816163,3,B000PC6YSU,I gave this series to my daughter who intends to take her first overseas extended world trip later this year with her family and she has informed me that most of the scenery was fantastic and most of the travel information semi informative  but there was too much emphasis put on where to get the best wines and eateries. There are better examples on the market for first time travellers.,1271116800,6,388,4.542857142857143
2816164,2,B000PC6YSU,"On this DVD, Samantha Brown offers a great itinerary of the England, Ireland, & Scotland which she visits during the winter but is not nearly as in depth as Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa! Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions. For a more thorough series watch ""Best of Europe by Rudy Maxa"" or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009"".",1265587200,11,910,4.658385093167702
2816165,4,B000PC6YSU,Samantha does a good job in the 20 minutes of each vignette to cover the main aspects of the location she visits. I'm sure that there has to be more for each visit that never makes it to the airing.  Travel channel should consider adding that additional footage.,1246233600,2,262,4.458333333333333
2816166,3,B000PC6YSU,"This dvd shows the pretty parts of the Cotswolds, of London, Scotland and Ireland, but it is by no means an overall or accurate depiction of these sites.  It is further marred by two flaws:

(1) I have to think that the hotels where the narrator stayed gave her free lodging in the best suites in exchange for her rather lengthy and lavish praise of the facilities, the views from the balconies, etc.  Perhaps some viewers are interested in hotel bathrooms and king-sized beds, but I'm not.

(2) Too many guides and docents (and not just with respect to this dvd) feel the necessity to provide snappy patter, little jokes and esoterica, the latter of which is frequently inaccurate.  Samantha Brown would be well advised to contain herself from the ""cute"" remarks.

The scenery on this disc is quite nice, but it would lead the innocent viewer into thinking that the British Isles were a series of postcard views.",1246147200,5,913,4.710691823899371
2816167,4,B000PC6YSU,"I personally enjoy Samantha's bubbly approach to travel.  However, if you're on a budget and are looking for tips on thrifty travel- you might want to look to Rick Steves (his dvd series; or his yearly ""Europe Through The Back Door"" book series).  Samantha definitely indulges in the finer aspects of travel (specifically when it comes to what hotels she stays in).  Despite that, I find her travel series unique and informative.

Now, the reason for my 4 star rating: I've watched this, and the France/Italy DVD with my hearing impaired  grandmother.  Sadly, there was NO closed caption, or even subtitles for her to read!  I'm pretty certain that the episodes that air on the Travel Channel are CC; and subtitles are pretty standard on all DVD's.  Anyway, I just thought I'd mention this for those hearing impaired folks who are contemplating on whether or not to purchase this.",1242950400,7,880,4.859060402684563
2816168,1,B000PC6YSU,"This DVD spent way too much time on the woman narrating and not enough on the sites. I guess that would be OK if you wanted to buy a video of her, but I was expecting a video of England and Scotland.  Also, I found it strange that she was saying that one of the places she visited in London she normally wouldn't go to because of safety, but why would she include it on her video. I  would shop around for a better video guide.",1241654400,10,427,3.953488372093023
2816169,4,B000PC6YSU,"I bought this DVD to use as a supplement for my foreign foods unit when I had to be gone and needed something easy for a substitute to do.  Unfortunately, I couldn't use it because the host very much focuses on drinking lots of beer : ) and it just wasn't appropriate for a classroom.  Other than that, I think all the episodes are really cute and this DVD would be fun to watch for anyone planning a trip to Ireland, England or Scotland.",1236470400,2,438,4.2023809523809526

8190499,3,B000PC6YSU,"This review only pertains to the two London episodes. Those episodes were not as bad as her Paris episodes (which were an epic fail). However, I felt that she only covered a small portion of London. It's impossible to see all of London in a week, but she could've done a better job.

She starts her tour of London in Trafalgar Square. Samantha then headed to the iconic Changing of the Guards ceremony. Many seasoned travelers think this is touristy, but if you've never been to London before, you want to see this. Samantha gave good advice on vantage points for the ceremony. Samantha also said that there were more royal guards at St. James Palace, which was useful advice. However, Samantha talked too much during the ceremony (her lame attempts at humor are an annoying distraction throughout the DVD).

Samantha took a London black cab. The cab was spacious and ornate. The cabbie was a friendly and informative man. He told her about a good fish and chips place. The fish and chips that Samantha bought looked delicious. Samantha ate it in the cab, which I felt was tacky.

Samantha stopped by the House of Parliament and explained that Big Ben is name of the bell within the tower, not the entire structure. She also stopped by Westminster Abbey, which is a beautiful Gothic church.

No Samantha Brown visit to a foreign city is complete without her getting wasted. She visited a pub. I learned that unlike in America, Londoners are allowed to drink alcohol on the street.

In the other London episode, she visited the Burlington Arcade, which is a glass enclosed shopping center. Next, she visited Harrods. It is the most impressive store I've ever seen. It looks more like a museum than a store. It puts Macy's Herald Square to shame. After her visit to Harrods, she walked along the River Thames and passed by the Tower Bridge. Samantha explained the difference between the Tower Bridge and the London Bridge (the London Bridge is NOT the big, medieval-looking bridge. That's the Tower Bridge).

Samantha rode the London Underground. It is a complex system, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The carriages (trains) were small, but nice. Later, Samantha rode the London Eye. The views are impeccable.

At Leicester (lester) Square, Samantha purchased theatre tickets from TKTS. She said that purchasing from TKTS saves people 50% off the cost of tickets at the theatre box office.

Samantha passed by Piccadilly Circus. Like Times Square, it is a major hub with large neon billboards. Samantha didn't like the area. She felt she would be mugged. I found that hard to believe since it is a densely populated downtown area.

Samantha stopped by the Madame Tussauds wax museum. It was not my cup of tea. I would've preferred she visit the British Museum or Science Museum. After a visit to the Notting Hill Portobello Road street market and an Indian restaurant, she concluded her trip at the Tate Modern museum.

This DVD showed many popular attractions in London. Nevertheless, much of London was missing. In a 45 minute episode, you can only show so much of London. I wish she spent less time giving commentary about each hotel she stays at and more time actually exploring the city. Still, this DVD is worth purchasing. If you want a more comprehensive DVD about London, purchase Globe Trekker's Ultimate London.",1359849600,,3330,4.826315789473684
8190500,5,B000PC6YSU,"I purchased this product for my trip to London and Paris 2012.  I am the type of traveler who enjoys touring cities and interacting with the locals, as well as, staying at high end hotels, to B&B's to Spa Retreats.  Samantha Brown's Passport To Europe was a great resource to to turn to in showing me how to get the best value for my dollar.

Secondly, Passport to Europe educated me on the best hotels and views London and Paris could offer.  The CD showed me great tips on transportation, tours, shopping (and how to haggle in Paris!)and the best restaurants to frequent during my travels. Samantha is upbeat and honest in her reviews.  I would highly recommend this CD to everyone.  P.S. We covered every landmark and restaurant Samantha displayed on her CD.  Thanks Travel Channel...",1344038400,,787,4.700729927007299
