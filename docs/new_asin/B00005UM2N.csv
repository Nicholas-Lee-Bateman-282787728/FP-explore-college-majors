7954828,4,B00005UM2N,"Jerry Lee 1969 in Canada. I can't agree with anyone who writes a bad review of this DVD. Of course Jerry is better in 1983, any good artist improves as time goes on. Yes, the sound and picture are not top-notch quality, but neither was Woodstock and most rock'n'roll movies of that era. Don't put the 2 film makers down - they were the only people attempting to capture the history of this event. They were doing SOMEthing, and obviously had a limited budget - again - compare it to ""Woodstock"", ""Celebration at Big Sur"", ""Montery Pop"" etc.  The history and the fun that was documented is what's mainly important; if it's the only existing film, why would anyone expect it to be technically perfect/complain about it?! The sound and picture of this product are on the same level of these other maverick films, and the DVD editing and mastering is GOOD.  This was the golden era of Rock music, before it became a widespread big contrived formulated corporate commercial buisness (that it became in the 70's, and still is - run by lawyers, etc.). Jerry puts on a good show here, and his band is tight.  The audience is fun to watch, and The Killer's sense of humor is there as usual.  This DVD is worth the price alone for the added clips of 50's and 60's young people dancing and enjoying the music, and the clips about the late 1950's anti-rock music campaigns.  Fun DVD. Buy it, enjoy it.",1272153600,,1389,4.51792828685259

7954830,1,B00005UM2N,"Talk about a rip-off. Knowing Pennebaker and Hegedus were behind this I wasn't expecting much. But how could I have known it would be this bad? It's only 60 minutes. Anybody who's interested in Lewis is going to want more than 60 minutes devoted to his life and music. Man, have some charity! Who did they think they were marketing this documentary to, if not to his fans? Nearly half this piece of crap showcases him giving a minor performance at Toronto's Rock 'N' Roll concert in 1969. These lazy hacks conducted no interviews -- not with him or with his admirers. His richest period creatively (1963-1975) is barely even covered (unless one counts his relatively dull Toronto performance). His most electric country and rock recordings get no attention. You hear the same boring songs that are always associated with Jerry Lee -- his overplayed Sun recordings. (These famous Sun recordings account for roughly 5 percent of his best stuff.) What about ""Corrina, Corrina,"" ""What'd I Say,"" and -- most importantly -- all his masterful live performances where he takes any old song and totally makes it his own? None of them are here.

And what's with the subtitle? One would assume that this bio is one in a larger collection. Well, it isn't.

The only reason this documentary was made was so Pennebaker and Hegedus could use Lewis as an archetype to drape their own tired observations over. I can't stand garbage like this.",1106784000,14,1425,4.812244897959184
7954831,5,B00005UM2N,"I purchased the DVD last week and I wasn't disappointed (maybe slightly as it could have been longer) it features the killer on top form, i have other documentaries of him and this one features stuff i have neverseen before. It has the Steve Allen Show (Whole Lotta) but apart from that I haven't seen any of the other clips. I thought it would be more of a documentary, but it is just videos of him singing his songs. There could have been more of him doing the Granada TV special, as the full version  is something I really would like to own. To anyone who is interested in finding out about the killer, or to a fan who hasn't got this then my advise is to go and get it, nice one.",1035936000,15,683,4.135338345864661
