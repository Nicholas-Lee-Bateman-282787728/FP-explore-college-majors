2518621,5,B000EGZ7WG,"For the people who do not know, Film Movement is independent movie company that brings compelling story from a different part of the world every month.  I have seen many films from this company and so far have not been disappointed at all. ""Hawaii, Oslo"" movie is one of the best I have seen.  It is a story of many people whose lives, actions and caring about each other intersects all their lives in a matter of a single day.  We learn the fate of a young couple and their newly born son, destiny of two young boys without mother whose father dies, story about a mentally disabled man who under pressure and stress deals with it by running.  In order to see how are they all connected with each other and how their actions aftect their seemingly unrelated lives, you must see this movie.  Once you see it, you will be glad that you did.  Definitely a great movie for people who do not mind wonderful foreign movies with subtitles.",1199059200,9,932,4.421052631578948
2518622,5,B000EGZ7WG,"By now, most everyone has heard of the book or movie entitled 'The Bridge of San Luis Rey.""  This is a Norwegian movie much like that old story.  I wasn't too impressed with the recent ""Bridge"" movie, but I really liked this Norwegian movie.  It has a little bit of everything - humor, tear jerker, babies and two young boys, mystery, romance, family problems, and even mystical elements.  The amazing thing is that they are all woven together with extremely unusual mastery for a movie.  It even has a surprise ending that, even though you see it happen in the beginning of the movie, you don't realize it until the climax!

The production quality and the acting is every bit as well done as the best from Hollywood.  I have over two thousand DVDs, mostly dealing with kids or movies I think kids should see, and this movie certainly comes in the top ten percent in story, production quality, acting, human interest, and just about every other category you can think of.  The only bad language comes from a very hurt, angry boy of about twelve.  The only drawback for many viewers is that it is subtitled; but if you are used to subtitles you'll hardly realize you are reading the dialogue.  If you haven't experienced the amazing quality and stories of many foreign films, this one would be a great one with witch to begin watching them.",1168560000,27,1339,4.588235294117647

2518626,4,B000EGZ7WG,"The movie is practically devoid of any laughing moments--both for the actors and the viewer. The storyline, the long dark shadows, the muggy weather, help create an unbearably oppressive, depressing mood. Overriding all is a mystical element that drives much of the story. There are persons who appear and reappear in the story who seem superfluous beyond a point--e.g., the black girl. But they are all present for the last mystical scene. Did I ""enjoy"" the film? No. Would I have been better off not having watched it? Perhaps. Still, it had a strong impact on me. 3 1/2 stars.",1472774400,,579,4.8
2518627,4,B000EGZ7WG,"Very well acted.  The blond boy with a mohawk was amazing.  Direction and screenplay were also first rate.

2518642,4,B000EGZ7WG,"There is something very special about Scandinavian cinema.  Hawaii, Oslo is no different.  it is not the best Scandinavian film, but it is exceptional and has a very compelling storyline.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this film.",1356307200,,236,5.0
2518643,4,B000EGZ7WG,"Probably a 3.5 star.

Not paying attention to the release date I felt a heavy legacy from Paul Haggis's ""Crash"", but reading about it after I noticed they were both released in 2004, so no such legacy exists. Still, ""Crash"" is a worthwhile comparison in that both movies feature multiple character arcs that intersect in a somewhat forced narrative, ultimately colliding for the story's conclusion.

People tend to love or hate ""Crash"" and those sentiments will probably extend to Hawaii, Oslo. This movie adds an overtone of something otherwordly, or fantastic, but that element is not essential to your like or dislike of the movie.

It's a challenge to try and present so many story lines and still give us enough depth to become invested, and you'll see in the criticisms here that many people had exactly that problem. I would argue Haggis does a far superior job of providing depth, mostly due to a script that wastes nary a word. The script here is not as deep or profound, and that left me emotionally detached. Both movies, by design, use massive doses of coincidence to keep the plot moving, again a possible irritant.

The rapid fire scenes take away from the experience as well--instead of scenes that grounded us and gave us meat on the bone as it were, we're pinballed from one to the next; and I'd be able to understand this approach if the goal was disorientation, but the effect felt more like a director trying to get a lot of information out and running out of time.

Still, overall it's a solid effort and worth a viewing.",1347753600,,1542,4.675276752767528
2518644,5,B000EGZ7WG,"Wonderful movie,really really great !Thank you. Hawaii Oslo is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. I'm looking forward to more movies out of Norwey.",1334707200,,168,4.451612903225806
2518645,3,B000EGZ7WG,"This is a remarkably well constructed movie that is fascinating to watch yet somehow manages to fall flat. The many characters race constantly around Oslo on an atypically scorching summer day (nobody seems to walk there, regardless of the heat and sweat, or to drive slowly) on their various frantic individual quests, briefly intersecting or passing each other unknown and unknowing, until they all come together magically in the end.

As others have already said, there is much in this movie that is derivative of earlier movies, but a good movie does not have to be innovative. However, it does - for me - almost always have to make me care about the characters, and that is what this one failed almost completely to do.

I cared about only one of the dozen or so main characters scurrying and caroming around the city like pinballs, and he was the least frantic, the most unassuming of them all: little Magne, the younger (and quieter) of the younger pair of brothers, played with exquisite, tender understatement by Ferdinand Falsen Hiis.

Magne was like a small but solid rock in this swirling storm of a movie, and it would have been been crushed under the weight of its own overwrought melodrama without him. To use a contrasting metaphor, he is like the gravity that keeps the universe from spinning out into nothingness.

Erik Poppe gets one star for choreographing this frenetic dance, and Ferdinand Falsen Hiis gets two stars for holding it together just by being in it. He makes it worth watching. ALL the adults are just too frenzied to either believe or care about.",1309996800,4,1581,4.78021978021978
2518646,3,B000EGZ7WG,"Some months ago I started watching a bunch of releases in the ongoing library of foreign and indie movie releases from Film Movement, and this is another one I picked up just the other day.

""Hawaii, Oslo"" (124 min.; originally released in Norway 2004) brings an ensemble of characters and story lines that are interwoven throughout the movie, although the common ground is a character in a psychiatric hospital. For whatver reason, the movie could not grab my attention and captivate me. I was watching but felt removed from it, and never emotionally invested in the characters or the overall story.

Of all the Film Movement releases that I have seen, ""Hawaii, Oslo"" has been the least interesting to date, from my perspective. And I do realize that these perceptions are quite subjective. This is not a bad movie obviously, but it didn't do it for me, unfortunately.",1297468800,2,869,4.864864864864865

2518649,2,B000EGZ7WG,"If you are entranced and enthralled with the supernatural in life, you will take to this mildly strange Film Movement Hawaii Oslo, which takes place in Norway.  There is no going to Hawaii folks!

The subject is a compilation of several stories that somehow interconnect.  The  focus is on an orderly, Vidar, in an institution/hospital?  who has premonition powers, the supernatural.  These powers come to him in his dreams.  Another bizarre situation is a woman who has intention to commit suicide and saved.  From this, you have two unruly abandoned young brothers whose mother was the one who  attempted suicide.  The older brother is clearly into early stages of criminal behavior, not surprising with absent parents.

A young black girl is another spiritual person.  There is also Leon, the runner, who literally runs at marathon speed through the streets when he is bothered.  Asa is his girlfriend, who supposedly saved Leon from a Wave machine, whatever that is?!

Here's where the Hawaii comes in.  A prisoner, Leon's brother, is granted a pass to be with his Leon on his birthday.  However, Leon's brother pretends he has been in Hawaii doing business instead of being in prison.  Leon now, too, sports a new Hawaiian shirt with tags from Norway.

Wait, there is more....  A couple has a newborn baby, and the main character Vidar from the institution, predicts to the father that the baby will not live.  The baby will live four days due to a heart problem.  The father needs to pay for the baby's operation, so father can't earn the money, therefore has an itching to rob a bank, but suprisingly, quicker to the punch to rob the bank is Leon's brother  the prisoner.

I am quite surprised that this movie has garnered the awards it has, because I found it unbelievable, but how can you believe in the supernatural anyway?  There were too many stories folding, too many characters, the entire mood was depressing as their lives were filled with running away, tragedy, despair, desertion, misfortune, poor choices, stupid reactions, too much for me!  The film was long but yet slow, drawn out and confusing!!

This film was about as bad as the Short Film, an amazing contortionist pig!  Rizzo",1290211200,2,2202,4.849462365591398

2518651,5,B000EGZ7WG,I can advise everybody to watch this film; I've seen it before at a Film Festival in Rotterdam and love it since that time. Nice to have it at home now.,1254355200,,152,3.935483870967742
2518652,4,B000EGZ7WG,"Just finished this film and I must say I was quite impressed. There's no singular protagonist, it's one of those ensemble pieces in which all these various, seemingly disparate characters all tie together more and more throughout the film. An element of mysticism pervades the storyline, primarily through the character of Vidar who may not be what he seems. Is he an angel sent to earth to save Leon from himself? The film leaves that up to the audience, you be the judge.

The film starts off with Vidar who's a ward at a mental hospital, and it's his job to look after Leon. Leon's condition is never quite explained, but it's some type of severe angst, perhaps xenophobia, it's hard to say exactly what, all we know is that he fears people to a certain extent and deals with it by running away. Vidar has a dream in which Leon's killed after he escapes the mental hospital, so when he wakes up, he fears that it's real and does what he can to prevent it from happening.

Then we're introduced to two other characters who are having a baby, Frode and Milla, who were in Vidar's dream, but they're a real couple who have a newborn baby in the ambulance that Vidar sees killing Leon. After they arrive at the hospital, they receive the terrible news that their baby is born with a virtually inoperable heart condition, and the only place that can perform the surgery is a private clinic in the states. There's only one major snag, the operation costs $150,000, something which they can't afford. From there on out they struggle to come to terms with their predicament and go through various scenarios of how to best deal with their options.

After this we're introduced to a couple of brothers who are seemingly just juvenile delinquents that are spraying graffiti on walls around their block. Along comes a beautiful blonde who's on her way to meet Leon, her former boyfriend who is now institutionalized. The boys steal her purse and run away, but se grabs the youngest boy by the arm and doesn't let go and follows him home to get her purse back from his brother. When she comes to their home, she finds out that there's a good reason for their miscreant behavior. At the same time all this is occuring, there's a newspaper delivery girl who finds a sick cat and an unconscious woman who's apparently overdosed on pain medication, she calls 911 and the EMT personnel show up to take care of the dying woman. The EMT guys are the same ones who drive the ambulance that kill Leon in Vidar's dream.

The last major character the story introduces is Leon's brother, Trygve, who is a prisoner that gets a temporary visit to see his brother on his birthday. He's a pathological liar that does everything he can to get his way, although he genuinely cares about his brother and wants to help him out the only way he knows how, with brute force and money. A primitive man, but not without love and compassion.

Without giving too much away, all of these characters' lives intersect each other at several times in the course of the film, without knowing who everyone is nor what impact they have on each other, but their thoughts and actions have a tremendous effect on one another. The movie is powerful because of the performances more so than the story itself, but that's not to say that the story isn't poignant in its own right. A highly untraditional narrative reminiscent of the Oscar winning 'Crash', but it sets itself apart by making the story come alive through its idiosyncracies, those of the characters and their unique bond to each other, and those of the story and how it somewhat sporadically weaves its tale. It doesn't really play by any regular rules, some parts are left ambiguous on purpose, partially so that we as the audience don't dwell on the unimportant and rather focus on the poignancy of the characters' plight, but also for the effect of making us think more about the interconnectedness of human beings, the world we live in and what it means to exist, what is truly important, what is life and how do we measure its significance. At first I was a bit skeptical and almost didn't see it through to completion, but I'm glad I stuck with it because the journey was worth the price of admission, it left me thinking about these issues and that's a rare feat with today's films in general.",1227312000,15,4313,4.588845654993515
8109628,2,B000EGZ7WG,I always give movies at least 30 minutes of my time to engage me or entertain me.

8109632,5,B000EGZ7WG,"Multiple dramatic stories are as intricately and precisely interwoven as a fine tapestry. And that complex process appears effortless, thanks to the writing (Harald Rosenlow Eeg) and directing (Erik Poppe). The acting is stellar, as are the photography, editing, music, and all filmmaking disciplines.  I'm not a fan of the kaleidoscope, which appears several times;  it feels incongruous, and the transitions are so right without it, but it may serve to reflect the changing patterns in the story. Vidar, the lead (Trond Espen Seim), clairvoyant, psychic or divine, or all of the above, anticipates and reports what's coming , but we don't know when and how, because we're thrown off one scent as we're distracted by another. It's even hard to characterize one as the lead because there seem to be as many as there are subplots. The casting and quality of acting are first-rate.  Among the characters are: Leon (Jan Gunnar Roise), a vulnerable resident of a psychiatric facility, the all-seeing, all-knowing Vidar,  on staff there;  2 neglected young brothers, a couple giving birth in an ambulance; an escaped criminal; an abandoning mother; a lovely young girl who intercedes, connects, and sings like an angel.  How the diverse stories intersect is adeptly accomplished, but what is more stunning is the seamlessness and fluidity with which that occurs. This model of multiple related storylines is not new, but the finesse of and surprises in this one did generate a few involuntary wows. Bravo!  Highly recommend.",1479254400,,1519,5.1755102040816325

The words are spare, the story is told through events- forgot after a couple of minutes that the film was subtitled.  Very subtle, for me one of those movies that insinuates itself into your heart seemingly through osmosis.  I had chills throughout, not knowing exactly why, and then lost it entirely by the end.  For me, highly symbolic of something very profound and precious indeed (love, among other things), but I won't spoil it for you.  Loved this so much I purchased after watching.
