5889401,5,B00E3VFULQ,"this is a little different to the traditional productions, but I found it utterly enchanting. It makes a real story out of what can feel a bit disparate, through the use of dream sequence, and the dancing of all was exquisite. This is my favourite Nutcracker out there right now.",1425513600,,279,4.6

5889403,5,B00E3VFULQ,"If you love ballet, you'll love this production.  The dancing is superb.  Apparently those that rated it two stars didn't notice the different title and have little or no tolerance for the unfamiliar.

I have six versions of the traditional Nutcracker, all with their slight variations.  It was refreshing to see it with non-Petipa choreography.

The adult Clara is danced by Anna Tsygankova, who also danced the title character in the Dutch National Ballet's Giselle.  She was very good in Giselle, but her dancing in this production was much more impressive.  It was also nice that the child Clara so closely resembled the adult.",1388016000,13,631,5.009615384615385
5889404,2,B00E3VFULQ,"The ballet and or orchestra are excellent, however the storyline is butchered and ruins the production. Many of what I consider to be the classic parts of this ballet have been altered or left out. I was disappointed with this version.",1387065600,2,235,4.7560975609756095
5889405,5,B00E3VFULQ,"This production of the Nutcracker from Amsterdam ballet company features Matthew Golding (Prince), one of the best dancers in the world. This fact alone makes it a not to be missed event. James Stout (Nutcracker) proved to be a young dancer who raised by eyebrows on several occasions. The production itself is quite spectacular, with lots of theatrical effects and surprises. Personally, I did not quite get reworking of the second act divertissement, which is very elaborate but a bit too mental. Overall, very strong and interesting production - must see, especially since it is on Blu-ray. Get a cheap Blu-ray player, if you still don't have one.",1382400000,10,650,5.027777777777778

This disc was issued not long ago at more than twice the price. My well received review for that release is copy/pasted below. Many may find it even more tempting at the lower price now being asked.

Previous release's review

This version of the Nutcracker Ballet by Wayne Eagling and Toer van Schayk was created as long ago as 1996 and has been a popular and regular part of the Dutch Ballet repertoire ever since. It differs from the Petipa based versions in several ways as described in some detail below and which may or may not be a problem for non-Dutch purchasers.

The setting is placed in Amsterdam in 1810 rather than a small German town. The time of the action is on the eve of St. Nicholas rather than Christmas Eve. This is because there was no tradition of giving Christmas presents in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 19th century. Neither of these changes seems to me to require very much adjustment on the part of the viewer - just a little flexibility, even though the use of ice skates for some of the initial dancing outside Clara's house may come as more of a surprise! It reminded me of my eldest daughter's experience of living in Holland several years ago where temporary outdoors skating rinks were a regular feature of Dutch winter life.

More importantly there are major changes to the 2nd act where, instead of being set in the Kingdom of Sweets, Clara dreams that she has been transported to a land through a magical lantern where people from Clara's life and the 1st act party reappear. These also arrive through the magic lantern lens which forms a central part of the backdrop scenery. The travellers include the Mouse King whose curse, when killed by the Nutcracker doll, is cancelled thus enabling the Nutcracker doll to return to its former role as a Prince. The result of these changes is a much closer story link between the two acts but at the expense of the more familiar character dances. Instead, the same musical sequence is used for alternative character dances with quite different choreography and which I personally enjoyed very much. The concept of these significant changes is significant and will be a major factor for future purchasers to consider.

The scenery settings are sumptuous apart from the correctly conceived and somewhat austere setting of Clara's own home which is contrasted with the party setting of act 1 and the magical setting of act 2. To my eyes it all seems totally acceptable for Amsterdam in 1810 and also visually attractive. The same can be said of the costumes throughout. The dancing as performed by Anna Tsygankova as Clara, Matthew Golding as the Prince and James Stout as the Nutcracker is expertly done and the choreography is both interesting and delightful in my opinion. The corps de ballet are of the same high standard as are all the other highlighted members of the cast such as the Mouse King, his entourage and the various party guests and family members.

The music is well played by the orchestra under the baton of Ermanno Florio and this is well presented in clear, full sound in both DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo. The imaging is crisp and precise without any evidence of movement blur. The camera work provides a satisfying balance of close detail and more panoramic views.

There is a 27 minute bonus feature which focuses on interviews with the choreographers, the dancers and provides plenty of backstage footage. This is an interesting bonus and is well done as an illuminating addition to the performance of this production.

I and my wife enjoyed this production very much indeed. We both found it to be a refreshing experience to be enjoyed as an equally satisfying alternative to the more traditional Petipa-based versions or the Peter Wright Royal Ballet version for example. Much will depend on individual purchaser's responses to the overall concepts of the Dutch setting and the use of a magic lantern as a sort of time machine to link the two acts together into more of a continuous story line and as described above.

Provided that this necessary flexibility to the production can be achieved I would suggest that this is a very worthwhile and enjoyable experience and would expect it to give much pleasure to many future purchasers.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

Retirement Home Residents LOVE this Blu-Ray, especially those with a Dutch Heritage!
It is brilliantly done, with a huge Canadian Content, from the Conductor to one of the Choreographers to two of the Male Dancers, all of whom are interviewed in the Bonus Documentary. It is a pleasure to see an alternative Cultural Setting, with Sinter Klaas and Zvart Piet doing their Dutch thing! (Is Piet in Blackface, or is he actually Black? Hard to tell.)
Nice Review, Ian, thank you! (U.S. review)

An interesting Review with lots of useful detail - thank you , Ian! (U.K. review)

5889408,5,B00E3VFULQ,"Moving my previous review to this new issue ~ at this price do not hesitate to purchase! I can't believe this performance only has one review ~ it should have hundreds ... all glowing. While my passion for ballet has never dimmed, long, long ago had my desire to see yet another Nutcracker ~ I do not know what possessed me to purchase this video; perhaps the previous excellent review or the notion of a dutch update. Am I ever glad that I did. This production is simply breathtakingly beautiful, charming and sincere. No changes that make any true alteration to the story, but changes that actually make one think a little deeper ... the Land of Sweets may appeal to children, but honestly that syrupy sweetness stood in the way of many a good Nutcracker production. I can't speak enough of the beauty of the set design and direction, both in their simplicity and ability to evoke a familiarity that draws one in ... genius work! The early frozen canal and skating interlude / entrance stands out as a highlight as does it's simple begining set in a bathroom (!? - it was touchingly sweet) - everything just works. The dancing is superb, all leads even down to the mouse king exceptional - the conducting masterful, delicate and sincere - I'm not sure I've ever heard it's score played better - I think it also a compliment to it's unique staging and direction that lends one to better 'hear' the story. The High-Def filming and sound are superbly mastered, making it's viewing even more the treat. As someone who in most every aspect possible is a traditionalist, I can't recommend this production more heartedly. Before last night I mostly likely would have told you I'd never sit down and watch the Nutcracker again ... Now I can tell you, this will be coming out every year at Christmastime (or St. Nicholas Eve) to set the mood for the season. I adored it. I believe you will as well.",1451088000,3,1891,4.5811209439528024

5889411,2,B00E3VFULQ,"Beautiful music, beautiful dancing, but not the traditional Nutcracker.  My five-year-old was gifted this in preparation for attending her first Nutcracker ballet performance.  We settled in to watch it, and I noticed subtle changes in the first act, but the story was there and she was falling in love.  And then they enter the lantern and the second act begins, and by the time a green guy with horns joined in the dancing, my daughter was officially freaked out and declaring she does not want to go to the ballet in two weeks.  I have not seen the Nutcracker in years and thought maybe I had just ignored this dark act in past performances, but after reading the Amazon description of the DVD I see now that the entire second act is changed, the Land of Sweets and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy omitted.  Again. this performance is still beautiful, but not the right version for my five-year-old daughter, and not reflective of the one will be seeing live in a few weeks.  So, if you are looking to expose your small children to a classic holiday performance, this may not be the one to start with.  Thankfully, we found the San Francisco ballet's version for rent on Amazon, and will try it again.",1448668800,,1202,4.562790697674418
5889412,3,B00E3VFULQ,"Up front let me state the Royal Ballet version of this ballet is my absolute favorite.  That said, I was looking forward to seeing this.  I like Matthew Golding and am really coming to appreciate Anna Tsygankova as a beautiful dancer.  But the production left me cold.  I was okay with the first act but thought the second act over-thought and, in some cases, down right weird - the Arabian dance in particular.  I have to admit I've never seen the Waltz of the Flowers done with such blah costumes and the choreography in that looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute.  It won't be one I keep in my DVD library",1448064000,2,629,4.379310344827586
5889413,4,B00E3VFULQ,"This is an interesting, modernized version - to some extent - of a perennial holiday classic.

Anyone knowing the more-traditional choreographies/stagings of this work may be pleasantly surprised or unpleasantly shocked by the proceedings. Yes, all of the big solo moments pretty much follow the traditional balletic script. It's in the ""set-up"" pieces and a couple of the set pieces that the innovation is apparent.

The video is super sharp with beautiful colors. The audio is very good if not of demonstration quality.

BTW - the ""exclusive bonus feature"" on this BluRay has nothing to do with The Nutcracker. It's an advertising reel featuring highlights from 50 other Arthaus video productions that you may want to buy.

Still, recommended.",1445990400,,745,5.235294117647059

8600768,5,B00E3VFULQ,"An unusual European staging of Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" ballet production.  The sets and costumes, both designed by the production designer, are whimsical and inventive. The choreography very imaginative and well danced, by a diverse unique cast of performers.  The theater pit orchestra becomes a minor role in the DVD presentation, adhering faithfully to the Tchaikovsky score.  The battle between the specialty costumed evil Mouse King, his army of mice, and the Nutcracker's fairy-book brigade of inept militia is very amusingly choreographed.  Snowflakes interrupt the battle, with the battle continuing after the waltz interruption has concluded, leading into the snow forest of dreams.  Act II unfolds in a very imaginative celluloid environment.  The specialty dance performances are unique in choreographic spins, lifts, jumps, and stage motivational movements.  A brilliant adaptation to satisfy!",1514851200,,931,5.851851851851852
