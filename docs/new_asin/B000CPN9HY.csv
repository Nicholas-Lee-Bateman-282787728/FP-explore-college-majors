8100185,3,B000CPN9HY,"I was just a little disappointed in ABC's production of Oklahoma vs Texas: College Football's Greatest Rivalries. The actual production itself was adequate, but the host, John Suanders, knew little if anything of the rivalry. Where was Keith Jackson or Brent Musburger? There were a few inaccuracies as well as a few butchered names. ABC gets a ""D"" on this one.",1342310400,3,361,4.934426229508197
