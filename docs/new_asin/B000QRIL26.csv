8221984,3,B000QRIL26,"I haven't heard much of anything about Nadia Comaneci since she defected to the USA back in the late 1980's, so I was glad this DVD was available for purchase.  Though Nadia is one of those kinds of people who will always remain a mystery, in this interview you will discover that she is married to Bart Conner and co-owns a gymasium in Norman, Oklahoma.  She and the interviewer watch a video clip of of her 1976 Olympic performance on the uneven bars and she provides her analysis of that as well as her floor exercise routine.  There's also a bit where she reads an excerpt from her childhood diary where she discusses how hard she trained.
She also touches on her life behind the iron curtain and her escape.  Though this DVD is less than an hour long, I thought it provided some good information about Nadia (since there's not much out there anyway) but I think Nadia will always be the kind of person who will leave you feeling as though you want to know more about her.  That's just who she is.",1198108800,5,1001,4.389189189189189
