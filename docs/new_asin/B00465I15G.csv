4264332,5,B00465I15G,"The spark of an idea for the greatest of all cop shows took hold in the fertile mind of actor (and later writer/producer/director) Jack Webb when he played a nerdy forensic scientist in the 1946 cult classic ""He Walks By Night.""  That creepy film noir was based on the true story of a serial killer with a genius IQ on the loose in Los Angeles, and the police department's dragnet that finally cornered the killer in the huge sewer system under the streets of the city.

In 1949, Webb developed his first ""Dragnet"" series into one of the greatest radio shows ever broadcast with superb scripts, acting, and sound effects. From radio, Webb took Dragnet to television in 1951 and the series enjoyed eight years of well-deserved acclaim from its faithful fans, law enforcement agencies, and many other groups.

Dragnet ended its initial run in 1959, but it returned in 1966 with a highly-successful NBC made-for-TV-movie. Dragnet, the new TV series, started in mid-season as ""Dragnet 1967"" (so viewers would know that this series was all-new shows). Dragnet 1967 was a hit, and returned in the 1968 season as ""Dragnet 1968.""

This brings us to the ""Dragnet 1968, Vol. 1"" set produced by Shout! Factory. The set contains the first ten episodes of the 1968 season out of 28 episodes produced for that season. This set does contain some of the 1968 season's best episodes, and also serves as an introduction by Shout! Factory to their new DVD season sets of Dragnet.

The season opener ""The Grenade"" is about a teenager who throws acid on the back of another teenager in a crowed L.A. theater. The smooth-talking kid who threw the acid manages to get himself released into his parent's custody. Later that night the parents discover a stash of weapons in their son's bedroom along with live grenades and call Sgt. Joe Friday and his partner Bill Gannon (played by Harry Morgan) to come over and investigate. Friday and Gannon track the kid to a ""record party"" where the kid is holding all the party-goers hostage.

Some other classic episodes in this ten show set are ""The Shooting Board"" where Friday goes into a laundermat to buy a pack of cigarettes out of a machine and walks into a robbery in progress. This is followed by a shoot-out, and later Friday has to prove that he was returning fire after the robber shot first.

Another great episode is ""The Big High,"" but every show in this set is worthwhile and fun to watch. The picture quality of the shows is great and so is the sound. Some of the color appears to be a little muted in some scenes, but, for the most part, the colors are bright.

Shout! Factory deserves a big pat on the back for bringing the great Jack Webb's 1960's Dragnet series to DVD for everyone to enjoy. And remember: ""This is the city, Los Angeles, California. My name's Friday, I carry a badge...""",1341360000,3,2824,4.645290581162325

4264334,4,B00465I15G,"My wife and I enjoyed this, to some extent, but not as much as the ones from the fifties. I cannot understand why Henry Morgan was chosen as the sidekick. He is very dull, adds nothing to the show, and looks very old and emaciated here. He was much better playing seedy gangsters in previous decades.",1434844800,,300,4.375

4264339,4,B00465I15G,"I always loved Dragnet.  Why do they call it Dragnet Volume 1 when there is no Volume 2?  wish they would bring this back.  I know it wouldn't be the same without Friday.  I am a fan of law enforcement shows.  I am sure they could make a new series just as Jack Webb produced it.  Oh I would just love it.
