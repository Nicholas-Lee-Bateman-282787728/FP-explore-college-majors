1419798,5,B00005B1YW,My granddaughter loves watching these two cartoons featuring the mischievous animals in Beatrix Potter's imaginative world.  I look forward to adding more to her collection.,1357516800,,173,5.92
1419799,5,B00005B1YW,"I had this video on VHS, way back in the early 90's for my kids. Secretly, I watched it too from the doorway or across the room ( my usual fare was more along the lines of ""TERMINATOR"" ). One day, not too long ago, my wife was reminiscing about those days and wondering if we still had that tape. I pointed out that even if we did still have it, there was no way to play it anymore as our last VHS player was retired about 10+ years ago, and it would need to be available on DVD if she ever wanted to see it again (That's when the proverbial LIGHT BULB lit up ! ). Yup !!! There it was on Amazon. It now resides, side by side with TONS of ACTION flics, Loads of Drama, and a Whole universe of Sci-Fi... It's serene, sweet and Delightful at ANY Age !!!",1326585600,,751,3.915032679738562
1419800,5,B00005B1YW,This is just excellent entertainment for young children.  I really consider the video a collectible.  I can walk out of the room and be confident that there is no inappropriate content.,1216598400,3,185,4.935483870967742
1419801,5,B00005B1YW,"This is a boxed set containing two DVDs - one contains The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs Tittlemouse & The Tale of Pigling Bland, and the other DVD contains The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or Roly-Poly Pudding & The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-Duck. A value buy indeed [and you can even get them cheaper if you go to stores like Half-Price Books where I got mine].The animation is superb - it's like Beatrix Potter's illustrations have been brought to life, and the effects are simply enchanting. I also like the introduction bit to the actual stories - there is an actress portraying Beatrix Potter, in period costume, painting on a hillside with a magnificent view...it starts to rain, and she scrambles for her things before heading home. The home scene is equally enchanting as there is a fire burning, and the actress sits down at her desk [with a real rabbit as her pet] to write a letter to her relative. I thought the whole production was of high quality and well-done, and of course the tales themselves are true to the spirit of Beatrix Potter's stories of little animals in situations of mischief, danger, and general merry-making. A wonderful collection for Beatrix Potter fans, and little ones [my three-year old loves them!].",1211673600,,1249,4.73394495412844
1419802,5,B00005B1YW,"While the stories are old and known to most children, this presentation on DVD creates a whole new world of wonder. The narration is superb and the colorful animation is beyond exceptional. Viewing this with children is a rewarding experience for the adults, as well, since one is easily mesmerized by it. I recommend this highly for all age groups as a special introduction to the B. Potter collection, or as a treat for one's self!",1193443200,3,433,4.7105263157894735

7936262,5,B00005B1YW,"This video has been around for a long time.  My oldest daughter LOVES this movie.  She watched it incessantly, as a child.  Now that she is older she wanted to revisit it, and show it to her younger sisters.  It was difficult to find this story on DVD.  I  had searched for it on Amazon several months ago, but it was very expensive.  Last month is popped up as a recommended item, when I signed on.  It was as a reduced price, so I purchased it right away. My daughter was thrilled to have this movie again.  Thank you for providing this version in DVD format.  All the Beatrix Potter stories are illustrated and so wonderfully narrated.",1466985600,,638,4.3760683760683765
