8168053,1,B0007XG3N8,Not good!  Period theme but too far out and stupid for me.  I bought it because Fay Spain was in it and her performance is brief and an insult to her talent.,1405382400,,157,3.875
8168054,1,B0007XG3N8,"the most terrible movie i have ever seen with absolutely nothing

interesting to see except poor rita hayworth ending her career in such a soft-porn totaly crazy end of sixties movie...the movie looks like they made it with a hand-camera...why did they put this movie on dvd ? we are still waiting for classics like blood and sand, salome, trinidad and tonight and every night instead !!!!",1127260800,10,389,4.8059701492537314
8168055,2,B0007XG3N8,"Some 35 years since its brief release it is unclear why Rita Hayworth chose to appear in ""THE NAKED ZOO"". What is clear is that the film is very poor. Utterly directionless, with no real storyline (although a twist in the final scene!) and shot in ""softporn soft focus"", it really ISN'T the place to start your Rita Hayworth DVD collection! ""THE NAKED ZOO"" is more a curio from the Love Generation and certainly ain't no ""GILDA""!

For Rita Hayworth completists only.",1121299200,9,466,4.682926829268292
