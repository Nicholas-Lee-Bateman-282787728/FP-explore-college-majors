594273,5,6303201806,"Modigliani takes a look at the life of the artist, Modigiliani. He was a rival of Picasso. The film captures the amazing era of artistry in France that the director compares to the age of Rock and Roll in the 70s in the US.  Andy Garcia gives a captive performance at Modigliani. He captures the heartache that drives Modi to paint in the competition. A great film for any art lover or just someone who appreciates a great film.  It explores beyond the painting into relationships and religious bigotry.  Highly recommend!",1124928000,7,522,4.714285714285714
594274,1,6303201806,"I couldn't disagree more with the only other review of this abyssymal video.  I don't know what that person was thinking, and I blame them 'for every penny' i wasted on the this joke of a documentary.  For one thing, it's part of a series, so there was no info on the soundtrack or the production (which to some people  are essential).  There being only about six photographs of modigliani in evidence, the directors of this crudfest use them over and over in a million different ways.  This and the deadpan narration do anything but justice to such a great man.  He'd turn over in his grave if i gave it anything more than a sixteenth of a star.  Don't buy it.  It's a complete and total waste of time and money.",976233600,5,713,4.348484848484849

594494,5,6303201806,"Andy Garcia is perfectly cast as Modigliani, a bohemian artist living in the outskirts of Montparnasse with his artist friends including Picasso. Perfectly talented, he shuns the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie preferring to befriend people in the streets. He is often without money and struggles making a living painting portraits of women with elongated necks, sculpted faces with empty eyes. He tells his girlfriend that he will paint the eyes once he can ""see the soul"". Modigliani is dashing and charming, it's no wonder many women fall for him and want to be painted by him. Jeanne who leaves her conservative Catholic upbringing only endures painfully what it is to love such a man.

Modigliani is beautifully told from the point of Modigliani, the artist. One can get an intimate glimpse at the lifestyles of the struggling artists back in those days, some of whose names are titans in the art world today. I really felt like I could get a better understanding of Modigliani's passion, his struggles both as a man and as an artist.",1470787200,3,1036,4.886363636363637

594595,4,6303201806,"As other reviewers have pointed out, there are some historical inaccuracies in this telling of the story of Modigliani and Jeanne Hebuterne, although  the general background is well-researched and portrayed in many realistic details.  Some of the intentional errors probably derive from the need to compress the complex story into such a short time span and reduce the cast of characters  it was Zbo, not Picasso, who accompanied Modigliani to meet Renoir, and their encounter was quite different from the way it was portrayed in the film The trip to the south of France happened before Jeannes baby was born, and Mme. Hebuterne came along too.  Missing altogether is the character of Andre Hebuterne, a chief player in the real story as it was he who  introduced Jeanne to the art world in Paris and encouraged her , at least at first, to develop her talents as a painter.  He was also, supposedly, present when she fell out the window, and later played an important role in protecting, for better or for worse, Jeannes memory from gossip and scavengers by locking up her artworks until he died. The portrayal of Jeannes father is a bit unfair  in real life, he was not that cruel or condemning  although he was aghast at his daughters choice of mate.  The two principle characters are not quite on target.  Andy Garcia, although his acting improves in the latter part of the film  is a bit too beefy physically to resemble Modigliani, who was a specific Mediterranean type  compact , slim and yet solid, also he plays Modigliani too much as a buffoon, when he would have been more an ironic harlequin  but there are some moments when he manages to give us a convincing performance.  The film continues the myth established by Andre Salmon and others, that Modigliani was drunk 99% of the time, which Jeanne Modigliani and later scholars have questioned.  The lovely Elsa Zylverstein  was a good choice for the  female lead, but looks older and more mature than Jeanne actually was. The script makes her out as a victim, which perhaps she was in part, and doesnt give us any sense of her defiant nature. In this version, as in the previous Les Amants de Montparnasse, we don't get much sense of Jeanne Hebuternes real character.  She was a rebel, extremely creative and unconventional, deeply attached to her brother and to her family in general, and mesmerized by Modigliani.  She was a promising artist herself  -- she and Modigliani sometimes painted the same subjects in their studio and she had a dark streak, prone to silence and depression.  None of her real personality comes out in the film. (Curiously, in the scene when Jeanne visits Zbo, there is a painting in the background resembling one Jeanne painted herself)  Despite this all, the film is worth seeing and has some unforgettable, poignant moments. The photography and score are excellent, and the supporting cast is brilliant Omid Djalili in particular as Picasso,  Frederico Ambrosino , who plays Modi as a child.  The film picks up in the latter half, and there is an exciting sequence showing the painters at work preparing for the Salon which is masterfully edited to show us the tensions and breakthroughs of creating art.  Still Modigliani, so wrapped in myth as the self-destructive genius, remains a  mystery at the end of this film.  The bitterness of failure and ill-health, his strong sardonic streak, along with the tiredness of the last months are missing from Garcias portrayal, although he makes a good try. Ultimately Modigliani is an enigma:  how did he see himself?  Well never know. All we can do is accept him and love him as he was, as Jeanne H. did till the end.",1444348800,,3654,4.792332268370607

594926,4,6303201806,"You really don't have to know art to appreciate this movie. Andy Garcia has this ability to play romantic souls in any movie and he captures the essense of the drug and drink-addled tormented man that was the painter Amedeo Modigliani.

The movie also is able to immerse the viewer into the bohemian art world of Paris in the 1920s (we get Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Renoir, etc., filling out the tableau). The feud between Pablo Picasso and Modi is an interesting teleplay within the love story between Modi and Jeanne. The confusing thing about their feud is Modi's work (that which you see on the screen) is nothing revolutionary when looked at through 21st century eyes. Basically, the guy drew nudes and portraits of people with giraffe-like necks. Picasso, on the other hand, was a genius. Maybe you had to be there to understand why Picasso loved Modi yet the two were like oil and water.

The only extra is a seven-minute featurette which helps explains the storyline a bit more and gives you an idea what the director wanted to say.

Even so, I felt the flashbacks to Modi's youth and the placing of a young version of Modi within scenes where Andy Garcia communicates with his younger self do not work at all. The ""Madness"" scenes were also too contrived. Oh, look, there's Modi smoking in an opium den--how decadent are his hallucinations.

I wanted a fuller explanation as to why this Jewish Italian man was so tormented in his adult life that he destroyed his life through drink and drugs. I get he was frustrated at his inability to sell his art but he also did not ""play the game"" as Picasso was able to do. I get that Jews were persecuted at the time. Yet, through it all, I did not quite understand Modi's decision to ignore his own child and the love of his life in the first half of the movie.

All in all, it at least made me want to look into finding a biography on Modigliani and that's more thanks to the basic story and Andy Garcia's performance than the questions left unanswered by this movie.",1322524800,,2022,4.528767123287671
594927,5,6303201806,"Modigliani asks Jeanne, ""Is this how you see me""?  She answers ""it is how everyone sees you""... But then we find this is not Modigliani's true life story - chez tragique!  So what?  Any portraitist of his caliber would be honored to be the subject of such a uniquely crafted work of art.  Watch it for the sheer layered beauty dripping from every scene, cherish it for an authentic taste of the bizarre Bohemian lifestyle of early 20th century Paris it depicts, but buy it and add it to your permanent collection for Art's sake.  You won't be disappointed.  I don't wish to bore anyone by summarizing the story line here, as it is an effortless delight to experience it for oneself.  There is something very important embedded in the screenplay and interpreted brilliantly by Andy Garcia.  It has to do with the film's unique portrayal of the transcendent beauty of life, even one as tragically short and imbued with suffering as Modigliani's.  The keys to a true appreciation for the film's depth are to be found in 1  Dedo  2) the felt hat 3) Jeanne's sketch of the artist and 4) Modi's words when he is laid on the cart in the snow... ""it's wonderful"".  Does this film really count as ""art""?  What does all of this have to do with J.D. Salinger?  ""I know this much, is all,"" Franny said. ""If you're a poet, you do something beautiful. I mean you're supposed to leave something beautiful after you get off the page and everything.""

All we are presented with is one embarrassing cliche after another...and at other times we are fed historical inaccuracies that border on offensive!
The scene where Picasso is jauntily driving a car across the french country side is HILARIOUS! ( He never drove.) In fact the entire Modigliani/Picasso rivalry thing-the thrust of this film- is just so wrong.
The film also imposes a revolting Disney like sentimentality  through out. I'm a fan of Andy Garcia (8 million ways to die) but this movie is so bad and hammy it's ruined my view of him as a serious actor.
On the plus side there is a scene with an aged Renoir that works and the female lead and costumes are beautiful.

Artists in any medium get into a zone of inspired creativity which makes any and all sacrifices for their chosen field acceptable. Garcia, as Modigliani, enacts that so well while painting the important painting in the story, that I think anyone who has never experienced that ""zone"" could understand it from watching him - not the other artists shown painting, but just him - throughout the creation of that piece.

A visual artist friend brought this DVD over, along with another fictionalized version of Los Angeles skateboarding in the 60's.  As with the Modigliani movie, it was all cliche', trash talking, drugs, violence, and general soap opera.
Modigliani, the movie, could have been a really interesting movie if the writers had made it in documentary form as Dog Town the skate board documentay movie was, which was great, with actual photos of the
subject individuals, places where they performed, etc.  But no, they had to trash it up with over-dramatized versions of all the characters, unrealistic ways art shows work, etc.
  Recently I watched the Clint Eastwood movie on Johnny Mercer; in documentary form.  It is wonderful, with great historical photos of the people in the creative part of popular music from the 30's through the 70's.  Johnny Mercer apparently was a mean drunk, but not self destructive like Modigliani.

Andy Garcia is simply superb as the troubled Modigliani. I have seen nearly all of his films and this is, by far, his best performance.  He IS Modigliani.

The resulting film, in spite of the title character being masterfully played by Andy Garcia, is predictable even to those who have never heard of Modigliani or ever seen his work.

His development as an artist, by way of example, is completely ignored. The viewer, therefore, is never quite sure whether the sympathy the film builds for the title character is warranted or not.

The acting is brilliant and the story masterly told. It is so gripping seeing how hard life was for this artist. But also interesting to witness the feud he and Picasso were having. Tragedy, love and rivalry are all themes in this film. Living in total poverty and having suffered great loss, one can wonder how anyone can survive and also stay sane. And perhaps it wasn't possible.

The film is about Amedeo Clemente Modigliani's (July 12, 1884 - January 24, 1920) life as an artist in France in the beginning of the 20th century. He was an Italian artist of Jewish heritage and was practising both painting and sculpture. The film tells about his relationship with Jeanne Hbuterne who loves him so much that she can't live without him and because of that has to make inhuman sacrifices. And her father disapproves the affair so much that he commits unspeakable acts and makes their life even harder. It shows the rivalry between Modigliani and Picasso. And how he never in life gets the recognition he deserves, his disappointments and hopes to succeed. How he never gives up. And the tragic death of this great artist.",1237161600,2,1260,4.7534246575342465

It's always irritating to me when fiction is passed off as biographical.  If you use the man's name, use the man's life.  If it's a life worth documenting, then it's a life worth documenting accurately.
I'm all for a measure of creative license.  Certainly, some is necessary in a feature film format.  This one went beyond.  Even the art was fabricated.  Not just reproductions of existing paintings, but paintings that don't exist (i.e. Picasso never painted a portrait of Modigliani).
There are a number of biographies and a documentary about Modigliani if you're interested in his real-not-hollywoodized life, and work.  Heck, read wikipedia.  You'll learn more about the man.",1228435200,,842,5.087591240875913
594968,5,6303201806,"The question is asked of the artist, Modigliani, by his lover, Jeanne Hebuterne while the two ride a streetcar in Paris.  Moreover, it is an appropriate one considering Modigliani's life.  He sleepwalks through life mostly oblivious to opportunities for exaltation and abasement alike.

Although the artist is dying of TB, he continues to drink, smoke, and take opium. He is also blind to Jeanne's unhappiness. Their baby daughter is taken under order from Jeanne's father, by the French equivalent to Child Protective Services, and placed in an orphanage. Modigliani does nothing to reclaim the child although Jeanne is heartbroken.

Modigliani's attention focuses mostly upon his rivalry with fellow painter, Pablo Picasso.  The enmity is returned four-fold. Both artists fence throughout the film.  Picasso is portrayed as narcissistic and loutish, yet brilliant and well respected throughout the French artistic community.  It galls Modigliani that his lover actually implores Picasso to show one of his rival's paintings so that the couple will not starve.  To complicate matters further, Picasso uses Jeanne as the subject in one of his paintings.  This rightly infuriates Modigliani.

The film, although slow-paced, is wonderfully cast and acted.  I could find no weak performance anywhere.  The challenge scene in the Salon de Artistes is pivotal and although there is very little dialogue, riveting. The denouement at the exhibition, while triumphant, is tragically juxtaposed with scenes from a brutal beating.

One element I greatly adored was the soundtrack, especially the music we hear while Jeanne and Modigliani dance down the street in the dark. The scenes, we see them twice, are magical.

595021,4,6303201806,"A contemporary and antagonist of his contemporary Pablo Picasso, Amadeo Modigliani (1884-1920), an Italian Jew, makes his mark in pre-world war Paris, an avant garde painter caught up in the heady bohemian atmosphere of a turn-of-the-century city. Barely able to scrape a living together, Modigliani is a tortured soul with infinite curiosity, painting the visions in his head, certainly as groundbreaking as those of the larger-than-life Picasso. While Picasso is the darling of Paris, Amadeo's days are lived in the shadows, a man given to the excesses of drink and drugs to ease the pain of his existence. When he meets his muse in Jeanne Hebuterne (Elsa Zilberstein), the work flows from his brush, a distinctive style that rivals that of his nemesis, Picasso. Indeed, the two painters are much alike in their assurance, although Picasso is much more pragmatic, a crowd-pleaser who disdains poverty in pursuit of art.

Unfortunately, Modigliani's life is too short, his brokenhearted muse inconsolable, left with a daughter and another baby on the way, disowned by her rigid Catholic father. The loss of her lover is indeed tragic; as she says to Picasso after Amadeo's death, ""At the end of your life, you will say his name, Modigliani"" (In fact, it is said that this is the last word Picasso uttered). French society only belatedly applauds the talent of this iconoclastic artist, a shabby painter who dances in the snowy streets of Paris to music only he can hear, shadowed by the boy he once was. Played out in vignettes of childhood memory, the agonies of failure and the natural rebelliousness of a man who cannot fit into society's expectations, Modigliani spirals through the years carelessly, driven only to paint, to dream, to seek oblivion, to paint again.

What I find particularly striking about this film, despite the many criticisms, is Garcia's ability to capture the essence of the creative spirit, unfettered by society's dictates, in fact, unable to perform responsibly. When he fails to meet the standards of a family man, or even to make a viable living, Modigliani escapes into a haze of narcotics and alcohol, the need to disappear married to his artistic genius. What appears pitiful, a man squandering his talent, is familiar to such a man, his inner visions demanding to be brought to life. It is not surprising that Modigliani hurls towards death, helpless in the face of his own self-destruction. It is in his nature, torment built into his psyche, creative demons unleashed.

In sharp contrast, the sensitive love story between Amadeo and Jeanne Hebuterne reveals the depth of his compassion and curiosity, the gleam in the actor's eyes speaking to the profound absurdities of his life. As Modigliani informs Jeanne, ""When I know your soul, I will paint your eyes."" Indeed, it is her eyes that haunt in his final portrait of his muse, a woman who turns away from child and family to be with the man who has so deftly captured her soul. It is often difficult to comprehend the creative impulse that leaves artists on the edge of decency and acceptability, ever pushing boundaries in a quest to feel the breath of God. It is this arrogant, yet heartbreaking quest that Garcia portrays so brilliantly, his appreciation of Modigliani's spirit that lifts the performance- and that of the talented Elsa Zilberstein- above the script and director's deficiencies, riding on the musical score and stunning cinematography to remind us of the price of genius.

595023,3,6303201806,"Amadeo Modigliani (1884-1920) was one of the true artists of ""The Lost Generation"",that particular group of Bohemian writers,painters,sculptors and ""artistes"" in general, who flocked to Paris after WW1 in particular to live out their tragedies and triumphs with affairs,drinking and drugs in what was to become known as ""La Vie Boheme"".There, their art flourished and their lives were cut tragically short by the excess and nonchalant attitudes towards life...life that was to be lived to its fullest.

Unfortunately, Mick Davis' tragically unfocused screenplay and lack of directive skills, blinded by his own sincere passion on his subject,cause his film MODIGLIANI to wander aimlessly, introducing many subjects and persons, but never squarely focusing on or fully developing any of them. There is no doubt that Andy Garcia (Modigliani) and Elsa Zylberstein(his lover Jeanne) have done as good a job as possible in their roles. Each summons up moments of passion and tragedy as some of their story is told. However, at the commencement of the film, there is a disclaimer that the majority of what we are about to see is totally fictitious and that is where MODIGLIANI falters. Davis invents a rivalry between Modigliani and Pablo Picasso (a well acted part by Omid Djalili) and the rest of the Bohemian artists. If the film had perhaps put it's attention there it might have been more successful; but this piece of fiction serves to only confuse the love story of Amadeo and Jeanne. There is also the subplot of Jeanne's parental disapproval of her relationship with Modigliani that is thrown in to further muddy the waters along with the Catholic/Jewish problem of the two lovers. Add in numerous flashbacks and the young ghost of the child Modigliani and before you can say VOILA, you are thoroughly confused and frustrated.

Unfortunately,Davis' film never arrives to any sense of greatness about the artist nor any semblance of the real Bohemian life style. Oh, it's all there, but that is where the problem lies. There is too much crammed in, and not enough for you on which to hang your hat.

The supporting performance of Miriam Margolyes (LADIES IN LAVENDER, AGE OF INNOCENCE) as Gertrude Stein is as always genius work from this woman who deserves larger roles.

595026,4,6303201806,"I'd give this movie an award for the best imperfect movie I've ever seen or the most impressive movie that has grown on me as I watched it or the movie with the most clichd ridiculous first hour that gradually picked up its momentum and become a film of rare beauty and incredible power. As the title suggests, this is a film about time and life of one of the most charismatic Artists of the last century, Amedeo Modigliani (1884 - 1920). Last April, I visited a wonderful exhibit of his works in The Phillips Collection at Washington DC that hosted nearly 100 of his paintings, sculptures, and drawings on loan from U.S. and international collections. Modigliani's style is so unique and striking distinguished by strong linear rhythms and simple elongated forms that it takes only seeing couple of his stunning, sensual and aesthetical portraits to never forget him. His name, ""Amedeo"", has such a beautiful and sad meaning, knowing the story of his short life. ""Amedeo"" means beloved by God, and he sure was, talented, charming, and charismatic. But as the saying goes, the ones whom the Gods love die young. Modigliani health was very poor, and his life style did not help it. He died from tuberculosis and meningitis when he was 35. His lover, his muse, and the mother of his daughter, 21 year old Jeanne Heubeten who was pregnant with their second child by the time of Amedeo's death, did not want and could not survive him. On the day following Modigliani's death, she threw herself from the window on the fifth floor and killed herself...You may say, ""How melodramatic"" but life sometimes is more dramatic than any work of art or literature.

The casting of 49 year old Andy Garcia as 35 year old Modigliani seems a little strange but Garcia did his best working with the material. There was a moment in the movie when he addresses someone, ""What is the matter with you?"" with such obvious Brooklyn accent that I felt like watching ""Godfather, part 4 "". Actually, most of the dialogs in the first hour or so were rather unintentionally funny. It seemed to me that the director tried different approaches to his film. Modigliani came from Italy - we see many times the parade of clowns on the streets of his native Livorno as the recurring image that could've came from Fellini's films. Then, film looked in Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin-Rouge"" direction with the songs and music from different epochs (and I said to myself, please, no). Davis also compares Modigliani's life with that of another Amadeus, struggling genius - child from 18th century Vienna -the film brought a Mozart / Salieri theme with a successful and rich fellow painter who comparing to Salieri happened to be a very talented Artist himself - Pablo Picasso. So, for the first hour, the film struggled (almost as much as its protagonist) but then, something happened. The film's creator realized that the Artists are interesting not only because of their personal problems, weaknesses, struggles, preferences but first and foremost because of their talents, of their abilities to create, to look at the world like no one before them did, to capture their impressions in the forms and images that even after they are long gone make our hearts beat faster, make us say, ""This is beauty, this is poetry, this is perfection"". The scenes of incredible power just come one after another, the scenes with few or no words spoken at all. Among them, Picasso's and Modigliani's visit to one of the titans of 19 century, August Renoir in his country mansion. Renoir was shown as the old, wheel chair bound man who had to be spoon -fed by his nurse but who obviously had sharp mind and more wisdom than both Picasso and Modigliani together. Later, there was a long scene showing young painters - Chaim Soutine, Maurice Utrillo, Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, and Amedeo Modigliani working on their paintings for the Grand Prix de Peinture, the yearly art competition at the famed Salon des Artistes. Close to the movie's end comes my favorite scene - the opening of the Salon with the presentation of each painting - there is no rivalry, no competition any more - each work of art shines and every artist is happy to admit the talent and uniqueness of his fellow competitor.

So, what do I think of ""Modigliani"", the movie directed by Mick Davis? I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to others. Andy Garcia, who is not my favorite actor, won me over with his performance in spite of the problems (many) with the script. I've been always interested in the period of post War World 1 Art history when everybody who was anybody tried to be in Paris, the Art Mecca for many generations of Artists and the film's depiction of the Modigliani's contemporaries was interesting and made me want to research more about them. I'd like to see more movies with the actress Elsa Zylberstein who played Jeanne - her melancholic beauty, grace and talent are undeniable and helped to make the movie based on the Artist's life compelling, convincing, and remarkable.

P.S. According to Pablo Picasso's personal physician, the Artist who had survived Modigliani by more than 50 years, whispered his name on his deathbed.

But at least it had the decency to say it was a 'fiction loosely based on the events' at the very beginning. My main problem with Andy wasn't so much his age, (That 'Picasso' didn't look like any Spaniard either!)  but rather that he was a tad too 'coherent'(but charming all the same) through most of the movie to be Modigliani ;O)  ..As for Picasso,  I saw nary a trace of the real man anywhere in this film.  (though found the actor playing the 'name' to be funny in parts anyways..) Historically, they were not rivals. Picasso actually rather liked Modigliani (when he was sober anyways) and respected his art. But found him way too self-destructive to associate with him at all closely.  But despite all this the movie, though a mess in parts, also had some lovely moments, and I found Elsa Zyberstein to be very lovely even though the script really didn't give her all that much to work with. And I also found the part with all the artists in the 'throes of creative ecstasy' for the art contest to be kinda interesting (& unintentionally perhaps a little hilarious as well..  I ought to try throwing my easel, and raising my hands up in the air when I paint sometime.. )
I have to admit, the last section where the thugs/thieves were beating on Modi and trying to take his marriage-license away.. almost had me laughing with it's 'tiny-violin all-too melodramatic moment'. If they were REAL thugs, when they saw the license - they would have helped him up, dusted him off, and wished him the 'Best of luck with that..'  LOL sorry.. couldn't resist! ;O)

595079,1,6303201806,"""Modigliani"" (2004) is a self-indulgent, pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist. Writer-director Mick Davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work. Ironically, the viewer has a better understanding of Pablo Picasso than Amedeo Modigliani. Despite his boundless enthusiasm, Andy Garcia is simply too old for the title role. An irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate.",1137024000,17,460,5.880597014925373
595080,4,6303201806,"""Modigliani,"" a 2004 offering starring Andy Garcia, is one of those historical/biographical films that so invests the viewer with a sympathy for and interest in the central character, that it is a sad disappointment to learn that most of what one sees on the screen is untrue.

True, a disclaimer in the beginning warns the viewer that this is a work of fiction, but as with so many Oliver Stone ""docudramas,"" there are no clear indications where history ends and fiction begins.  In real life, Amedeo Modigliani was a painter and a sculptor.  He bounced between France and his native Italy as his ever deteriorating health dictated, the deterioration caused by a life long tubercular condition, fueled by booze, drugs and (if the film is to be believed) chain smoking.  He had a very public affair with a well known bisexual writer, but later became smitten with a local Parisian girl, with whom he took up and lived out the remainder of his short life.  Yes, Modigliani struggled for most of his life.  Yes, he lived in the same post-WW I Paris as did Picaso.  Yes, he died young, at 35.  And yes, Jeanne, the love of his life, did take her own life, and that of their unborn second child, upon his death.  But the Modigliani we meet in the film is not this man.

Perhaps the reason for this was screenwriter Mick Davis' need to collapse an entire life into a film lasting only 127 minutes.  Perhaps Mr. Davis just used the historical highpoints as the inner structure for the story he wanted to tell.  Or perhaps he just could not resist the familiar and by now trite tale of the doomed artist achieving his greatest triumph just as his wretched excesses finally overtake him.

The resulting film, in spite of the title character being masterfully played by Andy Garcia, is predictable even to those who have never heard of Modigliani or ever seen his work.  Certain central characters -Jeanne's virulently anti-Semitic father, is a prime illustration- and the parts they play in the film could have easily been excluded in favor of greater exploration of the historical Modigliani.  His development as an artist, by way of example, is completely ignored.  The viewer, therefore, is never quite sure whether the sympathy the film builds for the title character is warranted or not.  Until the end, the film begs the question of whether Modigliani was any good as an artist...or not.

These things said, the film does have much to recommend it.  Beyond Garcia's performance, the decadent excess of post-WW I Europe has not been so well captured since ""Cabaret.""  The score is both bold and enticing.  The fevered scenes leading up to the film's final moments truly capture the creative frenzy that great artists experience as genius takes over from rote.  And the film does succeed in making the viewer believe that he or she is actually seeing this pivotal point in Western art very much as it must have been.

Still, it is saddening to realize when the film ends and the lights come on that what one has viewed was more Hollywood than history.  When Disney's ""Pocahontas"" was screened for a huge outdoor crowd in New York's Central Park, one reviewer wrote that she had to point out to a friend who was totally taken with the film, that the Disney version of the story was glaringly historically inaccurate.  Faced with the fact that actually history was much different than what the film depicted, the friend made a choice.  Referring to the film, she reportedly said, ""Well, I like THIS version better.""  So it may be with Modigliani.  It may not be accurate, but viewers may like the film much more than they would the actual facts of the man's life.",1133827200,63,3657,4.716535433070866

The cast of artistic characters was fun, too - though I think the depiction of Picasso and Gertrude Stein were way off the mark.

But, the movie is terribly melodramatic and takes huge liberties with the true story. And, it is very invested in perpetrating the ""great artist must be miserable"" myth. So, watch it, enjoy the depiction of Paris, but take it with a grain of salt.",1131753600,7,679,4.467741935483871

Not only was it worth my time, but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion wasn't looked fondly on.

Everything about the movie is amazing, from the sets to the acting. I feel this is one of Andy Garcia's best films in some time, not only is he convincing, but he fits the part of Modigliani better than any other actor could. They focused the movie around his rivalry with Picasso, which I find to be one of the most interesting things about it. You don't only get an insight into one artist, but many. You see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world.

Modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl, who's father didn't want her with the struggling painter. The story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period.

Overall this was a great movie, and I would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out. You won't regret it, it's probably one of the best movies of the year.",1129680000,8,1293,4.247967479674797

The depiction of the religious problems that kept Modigliani and his lover apart was heartbreaking. And their struggle to keep their family together against all odds was amazing. I also love seeing the relationship between Modigliani and Picasso, which was definitely a rivalry if I ever saw one. I had never beena aware that Modigliani and Picasso were completing against each other for almost everything, and it was interesting for me to see how they played that out in the film, whether or not that's actually how it went down in real life.

I thought this movie was brilliantly acted and touching. I'm really glad I sat down and watched it and I definitely recommend it.",1129248000,9,1044,4.730769230769231

The answer is yes to all of the above..I thought this was one of Andy Garcia's best performances and I loved the depiction of the cadre of artists that were Modigiliani's contemporarys..Will definitely be looking up the actress that plays Jeanne- Enjoyed the history, the art, the location, and the compelling story based on this artist's life..",1128816000,6,493,4.732558139534884
595085,3,6303201806,"MODIGLIANI is a difficult movie to review.  It has some very strong features such as the cinematography that captures the artsy feeling of Paris 1919 and, despite excesses, manages to create some visuals of hallucinations and the wild madness of painters painting canvasses; a rather complex peak into the lives of several of the more revolutionary artists of the time; and a substantial feeling for the interchange between artist and model. The main problem with the film is a script that is banal, limited in historical validity, and concentrating on a single rather silly motif of a painters' competition.

Amedeo Modigliani (1884 - 1920) was a Sephardic Jew from Italy who moved to the mecca of Paris to create his brilliant portraits and sculptures of nudes and extended neck women and girls.  His genius lay in his unifying the spiritual Eastern iconography (tribal art and Judaism) of his heritage with the Christian (read Catholic) traditions of the artists with whom he associated which resulted in his creations of the female nude from a feminist cultural perspective.  What this film delivers is a rather annoying portrait of a young consumptive artist who drank and drugged himself to death at a moment in his career when renown was just beginning.  The reasons for his place in art history are merely hinted all for the sake of the Hollywood biopic.

Andy Garcia plays Modigliani with a modicum of lan and a plethora of bad traits.  The lovely model Jeanne Hbuterne (Elsa Zylberstein) who was the subject not only of his portraits but the mother of his illegitimate child and  his live-in paramour is a bit long in the tooth on suffering, though despite the fact that Zylberstien is hampered by both a weak script and limited acting, she does have an uncanny resemblance to Jeanne.  The artists with whom 'Modi' works include a strangely miscast Picasso (Omid Djalili), Chaim Soutine (Stevan Rimkus), Maurice Utrillo (Hippolyte Girardot), Diego Rivera (Dan Astileanu), Zborowski (Louis Hilyer), and the strangely non-effeminate Jean Cocteau (Peter Capaldi)! Dealer Max Jacob (Udo Kier) and Gertrude Stein (Miriam Margolyes!) are thrown in with the harlequins and 'Modi's' child spirit Dedo (Frederico Ambrosino) for atmosphere.  The storyline is  one that could have easily been told in the requisite time frame but MODIGLIANI taxes the viewers' attention for over two hours.

So aside from a visually exciting experience there is really very little to be learned from this liquor and opium soaked consumptive noisy melodrama that could have been about any one of the artists involved in the story.  The genius of Modigliani is barely tapped.  Grady Harp, October 05",1128556800,21,2679,5.100686498855835
595086,5,6303201806,"This film takes you to Paris in the early 1900's, and offers a beautifully done rendition of this troubled, but brilliantly talented artist's life. Andy Garcia gives a stunning, dramatic portrayal of an artist driven by poverty, and struggling to match the success of Picasso and other artists of that period.

The lack of recognition for his work continues to drive him further into the darkness of drugs and alcohol.  His one saving grace is the woman who loves him unconditionally, and makes sacrifices of her own to be with him.  This film was rich with dramatic performances and real-life settings. Great movie!!",1128211200,3,617,4.970873786407767
595087,3,6303201806,"The life of Amedeo Modiliani was once filmed in ""Les Amants de Montparnasse"" (1958) starring Grard Philipe (directed by Jacques Becker).  This newer picture is, unlike the previous one, more about the portraits of ""Ecole de Paris,"" group of the artists living in Paris before and after the First World War.  And in the center of the beautifully shot film, we see Andy Garcia playing the tragic hero Modigliani.

Many critics, perhaps too harshly, criticized the casting -- Cuban-born Andy Garcia playing Jewish Italian Modigliani -- and their complaint is understandable, if not totally fair.  How many people (including me) did know real Modigliani's biographical background?  Moreover, see the DVD cover (which shows his Modigliani sitting on a chair and holding a cigarette) which is based on the real artist's photo that exists.  I have seen the latter, and, well, Andy Garcia is not that bad.  These days his career has been ailing, even his fans must admit, but that does not mean he cannot act.  Yes, he can.

[NEEDS A SIMPLE STORY] So why three stars?  Two reasons.  One, the film lacks the center.  So many things are put into the film (especially in the first half) -- about his childhood, his love Jeanne (played by Elsa Zylberstein, quite good), his conflict with Jeanne's father who doesn't approve of his daughter's relationship, the rivalry with oafish Picasso, etc.  If only director Mick Davis concentrated on telling the love story with Jeanne, or the love-hate (mostly hate) relations with Picasso, Modigliani of this film would have been more three-dimentional, more realistic figure.  As it is, in ""Modigliani,"" Andy Garcia's titular artist is shown as perpetually drunk guy who has nothing to do except making fun of the others.  Though his behavior may be historically correct, it is hard to follow his self-destructive actions for more than two hours.

Besides, (here's my second quibble) the story tries to include too many characters -- Maurice Utrillo, Jean Cocteau, Diego Rivera, Moise Kisling, Gertrude Stein (played by Miriam Margolyes), and don't forget his meeting with Renoir.  Even Modigliani's childhood image (alter ego?) appears to teach a thing or two to adult Modi, but that only makes the film run longer than it should (about 126 minutes).  The cultural references are certainly informative, but the film is, and should be, about Modigliani as its title suggests.

Good things about the film are its beautiful photography, which often gives feelings as if we are looking at classic paints at museum.  The images are breathtakingly beatiful, and so is the accompanied music.

The film gets better as it goes on, but has too many elements for any director to handle, and Mick Davis handles them often clumsily, sometimes with cliched storytelling.  Perhaps it's not the actors that are real problem here; it's the director who could have made a better film with a simpler approach.",1128124800,16,2920,5.052192066805845
595088,5,6303201806,"What a beautiful film. Modigliani captures the excitement that the art community held during the era of Picasso and Modigliani. I did not know about the bitter rivalry between Picasso and Modigliani when I saw this. Andy Garica gives another one of his stellar performances. Along with the great cinematography, the music in the film is just wonderful.

This biography film is one that shouldnt be missed. It will leave you with so many emotions because of the great story and the wonderful characters.",1124928000,9,502,4.976190476190476
