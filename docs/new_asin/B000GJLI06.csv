The kids hide her in the house at first ,too cute, and then when she's caught out she tells the real tale but in such a way as to gain sympathy. He thinks she's homeless but the kids are behaving around her instead of acting like little monsters for a change so he offers her a job to help with the kids and cook. There are plenty of opportunities for this very cute couple to fall in love. The adversities they use  in this version are that he is going to lose the factory if he doesn't get the loan back to evil Big Business Guy who's daughter want's him for her own. Juhi is falling in love with him and he doesn't have any choice but to break her heart , or does he ?  Enjoy this very well acted and actually stands up to the test of time family film. : )",1339372800,,1278,4.217213114754099
8133235,4,B000GJLI06,"This is about a guy (Aamir Khan) who is happily a student when his sister & brother-in-law's deaths leaves him with the care of their small garment factory, house and 3 spoiled children. He is an honorable man and moves to do the best with his change of direction. Enter a vivacious but slightly mischievous young woman (Juhi Chalwa) running away from home and an arranged marriage her father is trying to force with a mincing effeminate man of her caste. She hits it off with the kids immediately. The guy doesn't know where she has come from but takes her in to deal with the kids. However he is the object of a scheming rich girls plans to marry him. The factory is at the mercy of her scheming father too and he wants to have the factory for himself. Even though love is blooming between Aamir & Juhi her father won't accept his different caste and prefers to disinherit her....

This is one of those typical Bollywood light melodramas/ romance/ 'family movies and stands well in that genre. It is a little dated in look in a little lesser film quality and some horrific Western fashions adopted at that time (Juhi looks like she's dressed as a doll at times!) I was a little concerned the movie initially may be dominated by kids pranks but they didn't dwell on the kids as a problem feature after all.

The focus is on Aamir and his connection with Juhi. This works really well. There is good chemistry and they are both interesting actors with a good range. There is also the connection between Juhi and the kids - also well done. Then the support actors complete the ensemble. I don't relate to the music of that era much but it was interesting enough to watch as the song & dance interludes added to and deepened the emotional content being conveyed.

Elsewhere on the Net this tends to consistently get above average and that's where I'd put it too.

One comment:my DVD (and obviously some belonging to other reviewers) didn't have subtitles listed in the opening menu. In fact the English subtitles are there and can be accessed from your remote control if it has that feature e.g. as a subtitle button or on a display one. Alternately you may be able to play it through your computer through a DVD program and select the subtitle option. This is obviously a downside for a DVD but it may not limit you if you know to try this- and the movie is worth the journey.",1246492800,,2374,4.475750577367205
8133236,4,B000GJLI06,"I'm not Hindustani.  But this movie and most of the Bollywood movies make me so jealous that I'm not!  I LOVE HINDI FILMS...(or BOLLYWOOD movies!)  If you haven't seen any..you are in for a treat.

The dancing, the singing, the costumes, the actors...marvelous!

Sometimes the style may be a bit hard for Americans to take....because they are often not ""realistic"".  But I LOVE the way they highlight love and family.  So many of the joys of life and the virtues that make life worth living...these are in these movies!

Bollywood people really know how to make movies.  Hollywood movies could only dream of coming EVEN close!  The actors are handsome and absolutely entrancing...and the actresses are the most beautiful in the world!

This movie is SO sweet... Aamir Khan is so darling...he plays the part so well!  It's a bit of an older one...but I love it!  Good insight into how things go on over in India.  Such lovely people.",1170460800,4,932,4.74375
