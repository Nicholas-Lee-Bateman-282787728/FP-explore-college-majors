4463248,2,B004SK8528,"A car heist film out of Canada here that really tried to impress with the cast of Sutherlands, Romijin and Greg Germann (Ally McBeal fame), but in the end it fell short in being anything worth recommending.

Sutherland's son plays the ex-con who tries to find a straight way to live but finds out he is an artist instead. Donald plays the crime boss, Romijin the art gallery cougar,  and everyone else chimes in on standard supporting roles. But Germann took the cake at providing the worst overacting in the film as a flamboyant art buyer, to such a point it was funny how bad he would get.

The picture quality is average to horrible a few times (including washouts and bad focusing). The sound is off in a few sequences, but the worst mixing is during the sex scene with Romijin (she was horribly faking it and the voiceover moaning and screaming sounded like they were remixing a bad 70s skin flick - even though nothing gets shown here).

A commentary for an extra, English with subs in same. Maybe a light Sunday rental with no replay value.",1307836800,2,1047,4.523809523809524
4463249,3,B004SK8528,"""How does a guy like me wind up in a place like this?""  When Vince is released from prison he thinks he is free.  After a run in with crime boss Kranski (Sutherland) he is forced to do one last heist before being allowed to move on with his life.  Caught between being an artist and a thief Vince has to decide what life he prefers.  This was actually a pretty decent movie, but it did tend to drag in parts and the love story aspect of it seemed unnecessary for the most part.  There is not much new in this movie that has not been in hundreds of other movies, the big heist is pretty much a direct rip off of ""Gone in 60 seconds"".  It's not bad but after that movie or ""Italian Job"" or the Oceans movies this one is a re-hash but not as good.  Overall not a bad movie, but nothing you haven't seen before. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will",1307836800,2,868,3.92
8439825,1,B004SK8528,Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen - not even Donald Sutherland can save us from this terrible assault on movie making and the acting profession.,1483315200,,149,4.769230769230769
8439826,3,B004SK8528,"Sometimes you grab a film just on a hunch, maybe an educated hunch but a hunch nevertheless. Sometimes they meet expectations, sometimes not. The latter was the case with the film under review The Con Artist. First off in my reasons for taking a chance on the film ever since he was in the film version of M.A.S.H. I have admired Donald Sutherlands work and I figured the add-on of one of his sons might be interesting. Secondly I figured the plotline might have something to do with con artists, a subject which since childhood when I hung around with my fair share of them (and took a short spin in that milieu myself) has intrigued me. Checking out what is new in conning.

Instead the con artist of the title is an angry, kind of surly young man, Vince, played by Donalds son Rossif who had indeed just gotten out of stir after five years as the fall guy for a car heist gone wrong but who also was some kind of mad monk artist-sculptor. Hence con artist. The problem with Vince when he gets out is that he still owes the head of his criminal syndicate, Kranski, played by the old man, a ton of dough for losses in the botched heist. To get out from under he will have to go back to the old auto theft hustle that got him in trouble in the first place. In his spare time he also fools around with making sculpture-something out of the Louise Nevelson school of taking waste materials and creating something which people will declare is great art (and others will purchase).

Where Vinces big break comes in is when he rams into a high-pressure art gallery owners car and low on dough talks her, Brenda, played by  Rebecca Romijn, into doing the repairs at Kranskis car shop (where legal and illegal things go on). When she see his sculpture sitting in the back of the shop she sees nothing but dollar signs. And so the running battle between a life of crime and high art for Vince gets played out. Along the way Vince falls for Brendas assistant, Kristen, played by Sarah Roemer, after they play cat and mouse about having an affair when from about minute one anyone watching could see they had eyes for each other-big time eyes. After a few falls and a couple of breaks in helping bust up a major car ring heist Vince heads for the high art life-and Kristen. Donald Sutherland wound up with a bunch of slugs in him sitting on his butt on a docked freighter waiting to take his own turn in stir. Maybe he will take up art. Just a so-so film here.",1481760000,,2450,4.344978165938865

8439831,1,B004SK8528,"As they say you can't judge a book by its' cover. This movie is boring and pathetic. Nothing happens. Nothing is of interest. The characters are useless. A sixteen year old high school drama class student could make a better movie. They apparently figured that with Romijn's success in the X-Men films she might carry it through but they only managed to make her repulsive. I watched half the movie and hit the ""eject"" button and now it is either going to Goodwill or even into the trash. Total waste of time.",1437436800,,509,4.543478260869565

8439834,4,B004SK8528,"Modern art is worth what people are willing to pay for it. A dude out of the slammer is unwillingly caught up in his old trade of auto theft. In the down time, he creates welded sculpture from junked autos. An art dealer (Rebecca Romijn) sees his work and sells it for a bundle of money without his knowledge. He prospers and a plot twist allows him to go straight. Nice action with great parallels between modern art dealers and used auto salesmen. Not an intellectual stretch, but fun. A totally different film, but with the same philosophical outlook is (untitled).",1383782400,,568,4.633663366336633
