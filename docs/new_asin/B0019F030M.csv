Being a fan of this show, it hurts to see Paramount rip us off like this. I would probably wait for a while and buy it when the price goes down.",1212364800,32,295,3.8524590163934427
3436395,1,B0019F030M,"Five stars for the show! These studios have some raw nerve! The price on
these sets are now up $10 to $15 per release! Releases that are only HALF
seasons to boot! Worse,think back! Season One had 39 episodes,20 and 19
per half or volume release! In case you don't know,Season 3 only has 26
total episodes - Twenty -Six! That means 13 stinking episodes per volume!
ENOUGH is ENOUGH!Boycott this garbage. This Season Three should be
released as ONE full season or the retail price should be $30 - not $50!!",1212019200,159,505,4.5
3436396,1,B0019F030M,"It remains a shame, and one that hits the Paramount reputation badly, that these DVD sets are being released so slowly and at such a relatively high price. My challenge to Paramount is to publish a schedule of their intended DVD release dates for future Perry Mason sets, and of course to reduce the unit price.",1211846400,31,311,4.571428571428571
3436397,5,B0019F030M,"I'm so glad I held out and did not buy the cheesy 50th anniversary set. I am a big fan of seeing shows in order season by season. I'm itching to get the Twilight Zone, but Perry Mason takes priority. My mom and I love this show - she was a little kid when the series was originally on. We watch Seasons 1 and 2 over and over and we need some ""new"" material. I wish this Seasons vol 1 and 2 thing would stop, but if it's the only way to get the complete seasons, then so be it.

Great show overall - I have seen a lot of shows in syndication, so of course they are the edited versions. A lot of episodes I've never seen since the various ""rerun"" channels seemed to always run the same eps over and over. Ditto with Mission Impossible.

I'm really looking forward to this set - keep them coming!",1211846400,11,793,4.012658227848101
3436398,5,B0019F030M,"Perry Mason is as much a part of American culture as apple pie and mom. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone of any age who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. The television show it spawned was fabulous as entertainment, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows the medium ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered as Perry Mason. It was Gardner himself who picked Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Season three had some great episodes, including a case where Paul was the accused, in a twisty tail of blackmail and murder. Releasing them in half seasons, the first half on volume one, the second on volume two, may indeed be an effective but annoying marketing scheme, but with all the junk out there we're lucky to actually have a few worthy releases such as Perry Mason even available.

Season three, beginning in October of 1959 and ending in June of 1960, is as follows: The Case of the Watery Witness--The Case of the Garrulous Gambler--The Case of the Blushing Pearls--The Case of the Startled Stallion--The Case of Paul Drake's Dilemma--The Case of the Golden Fraud--The Case of the Bartered Bikini--  The Case of the Artful Dodger--The Case of the Lucky Legs--The Case of the Violent Village--The Case of the Frantic Flyer--The Case of the Wayward Wife--The Case of the Prudent Prosecutor--The Case of the Gallant Grafter--The Case of the Wary Wildcatter--The Case of the Mythical Monkeys--The Case of the Singing Skirt--The Case of the Bashful Burro--The Case of the Crying Cherub--The Case of the Nimble Nephew--The Case of the Madcap Modiste--The Case of the Slandered Submarine--The Case of the Ominous Outcast--The Case of the Irate Inventor--The Case of the Flighty Father

This was one of the best dramas ever to hit the air. Seeing it today reminds us just how good television can be, but is often not. It's a bit of nostalgia and a lot of entertainment for TV fans. Fred Steiner's ""Park Avenue Beat"" remains one of the most recognizable themes ever heard. A must for any serious collector.",1211760000,77,2894,4.778
3436399,1,B0019F030M,"Perry Mason is the gold standard for the  ""law"" & ""order"" genre, bar none!

With Season One at 39 episodes I could possibly see the studio issuing two half season releases.  But as the first two seasons are now discounted, as expected, I find it very hard to justify $35 bucks for a 13 episode half season set every 6-8 months.  Many older fans literally may not even live to see the entire 9 seasons make it to release.  The corporate suits at Paramount know exactly what they are doing and I believe they relish in the agony of the purchaser.

The only consumer recourse is to wait them out; very hard to do when you are a fan of quality programming.",1211587200,130,652,4.30327868852459
3436400,3,B0019F030M,"I'm writing this review before the release date. Based on the information currently available, it appears that season 3 of Perry Mason is being released as 2 separate sets, the first of which has a list price of 50$ (Amazon is discounting to 'only' 35). Season 1, released as 2 sets, had 39 episodes in total. Season 2, released as 2 sets, had 30 episodes. I have checked and found that season 3 of PM had only 26 episodes. Do the math!!! The per episode cost is getting very high. I think the prices charged here are out of line -- many series from the 50's appear to be in the public domain. Thus, unlike new series, I don't think it costs the studios a great deal to release sets such as this one, and their prices should reflect this. At the very least, their prices should not be increasing as rapidly as they are. 5 stars for the show, 1 star for the pricing, averages to 3 stars.",1211587200,28,886,4.2485207100591715
3436401,5,B0019F030M,"****** I'm giving this a 6 star review because it has my all time favorite PM episode ""Paul Drake's Dilemma."" However; I am somewhat disappointed that they have gone to the one case 3 flap packaging. This seems to be the trend these days. Yes, I know this is way overpriced for 12 episodes, but to me it is well worth it with the Amazon discount and considering this is my 2nd all time favorite program. Even though I am retired on a fixed income, the price is well worth it since I can watch quality programs and not the vulgar trash that the ""30 something"" TV executives consider ""entertainment"" these days. In addition, it appears that Paramount has moved up their production schedule of PM. Hopefully they have FINALLY realized by the previous PM sales the fact that Baby Boomers have just as much if not more money to spend than the usual youth demographic that the mass media are all so obsessed with these days. At this point I must interject that I can understand why a lot of fellow PM fans are upset about the pricing and slow release schedule. It bugs me too, however; I will continue to purchase each release because I fear that Paramount will see the sales drop so much that they will decide to cease future releases. Then where will we be? Speaking for myself, I would rather pay more than to not have any at all. Just my 2 cents worth fellow PM fans. I rest my case :-)",1210723200,20,1384,4.368217054263566

3436473,5,B0019F030M,"Perry Mason Season 3 Volume 1

These twelve TV films from 1959 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes, usually the Preliminary Hearings, often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. A story adapted from a novel has the year.

3436477,5,B0019F030M,"I really like the character of defense attorney Perry Mason, played by Raymond Burr. He uses intelligence, facts, and truth in the courtroom to get justice for his clients. This is a refreshing sight, compared to the kind of defense attorneys we sometimes see today, who too often appeal to excess emotionalism and who try to get a jury worked up about something without the facts to back up the position. Perry Mason is a character with honor and integrity.

Its also gratifying to see his support team---his efficient, competent secretary Della Street and his resourceful, get-the-job-done private investigator Paul Drake. These characters show what hard-working professionals look and act like. All three main characters in this TV series are very good role models for young people today.

I must say that I also enjoy seeing those big, statement-making cars of the 50s!",1453334400,,873,5.0979020979020975

Once again, this set has the consistent quality of a series in which Perry Mason is hired to prove the innocence of someone who LOOKS as guilt as all get out. The series further does character development, in some ways very subtly. Tragg tells Perry in one epsiode how he believes he is always up to ""tricks"" to get his clients off. In another in which Paul Drake is the the defendent, Berger pauses to look at Drake as each piece of evidence incriminates him further and further. You can tell Berger finds it hard to believe that Drake, who might be working on the opposite side of the courtroom but is a professional, could actually be guilty.

3436660,5,B0019F030M,"this series was very special.  the cast members had such an obvious real-life camaraderie that it made the show much better.  the tension between Perry and Della was so subtle, but so glaring at the same time.  the books portray this very differently, having Perry and Della actually smooching in the car in one story, but i loved how that was only left to your imagination in the series.

if you've never read Raymond's two bios (one a bit slanted and maybe not quite accurate in some places, but in other places, amazingly endearing), then you should.  the section talking about PM will just bring you great insights...and some shocks!  Raymond was really quite a special guy.

this was pretty much the standard that started an awful lot of other crime shows and, although it's from a different era and things have changed alot and we've gotten used to the way it is now, it's still so much fun to watch Perry outwit everyone while barely skirting legality...and looking mighty handsome doing it.  Raymond's sweetness is so prominent in his portrayal of Perry, especially with the elderly, animals and children.

i think those of you who wrote 1-star reviews are unfairly skewing the rating of a quality program.  i agree that it's monstrous how paramount have released these DVDs, but to limit your review to their packaging/price is not right.  how will people who've never seen this wonderful show and its wonderful cast know to even want to watch this when all the bad reviews are not about the show?

yes, it sucks that paramount are ripping us off, but i read reviews on amazon even when i'm not buying from amazon.  i'm not saying you shouldn't mention what a ripoff it is, that *is* helpful info, but at least let that be a small percentage of your review and talk about what you like about the show!!!",1352851200,5,1812,4.660377358490566

Why did this particular DVD set cost twice as much as the others?
I watched it carefully.  Nothing jumped out and bit me, I don't know if
this was the season that won them awards.  ""The Case of Paul Drake's Dilemma"" was an
outstanding episode.  Star Trek's ""Sulu"", starred in The ""The Case of the Blushing Pearls"".
  There are more good episodes with twists on this set.  One thing that I have noticed about
the Perry Mason series is:  Women are dressed skimpy and most of them are fairly beautiful and in
risky behavier for the decade these shows were filmed.  This was the era in television where married couples in sitcoms had twin beds in bedroom scenes, after all.  One of my favorite goofs in the Perry Mason series are the elevator scenes.
One can see there is no gap in the floor, and often, a rug runs right across the floor from hall into elevator.

3436693,5,B0019F030M,"It looks as if most of the people complaining about the price -- rightly so -- bought the DVDs anyway, so I guess Paramount knows what it's doing.  Perry Mason doesn't have the fan base of, say, Star Trek. It's a small demographic. I'd bet that most people buying Perry Mason are over 50 and prosperous, or are buying a gift for someone over 50 and prosperous.  Paramount knows they can pay and will pay, and gladly takes their money.

Everybody likes Star Trek. By setting a low price, Paramount loses money on each sale but makes it up on volume.  Especially when you figure their production cost for the DVD packages is about seventy-five cents per box set.

Ditto for the half-season packaging; if they charged $70 for a full season, they'd lose a lot of business.

Face it -- if they can make you pay more, they will.  It's infuriating, sometimes, but deep down, can you blame them?

BTW -- If I offered you one episode for $2.50, would you be interested?  That's about on par with $35 for 13 episodes.

Also -- thirteen episodes of PM is about 12 hours of viewing time.  For a modern show like ""Gray's Anatomy,"" you'd have to buy 15 episodes to get twelve hours of viewing time. You're getting better value than you may think.",1240963200,,1232,4.455357142857143

With this newest release they have set the standard way back by having those clumsy very easily broken, flopping inner plastic leaves. There are 3 discs in season 3 vol 1, the episode summary for the first and second disc is on the inside front cover, that's fine, but the third disc is on the inside back cover, covering the summary.

I suppose I was ""lucky"" to purchase this half-season for $29.99, but I also wonder what I will have to spend in order to purchase all of the episodes of this iconic television series.

In turning to Season 3, Volume 1, let me state that the DVDs did not disappoint.  As compared to the prior seasons, the screenplays seemed tighter, less contrived and more engaging.  The acting, especially by the core group of characters, continued to be first-rate and flawless.  I sensed that Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale and William Hopper had eased more fully into their characters and they had forged a bond that was seamless and dynamic.  It was truly a joy watching each episode.

Watching Perry Mason makes me realize how far removed it is from the television that is ubiquitous today.  There was a strong conviction then that television was not simply for entertainment,  but that it could uplift and inspire.  This, of course, was the era of Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  Today, television has abandoned that conviction for the mindless drivel that predominates.  While there are pockets of good programming, most of television is reality shows, soft porn and gratuitous violence.",1226534400,4,1314,4.977064220183486

One dud star for CBS/Paramount and (others).

More multi-volume, overblown pricing from Paramount. Buying any complete season (via split seasons) generally will run at least $50.00...for something that should run in the mid thirties (as other complete seasons ""generally"" do).

CBS/Paramount will keep releasing the split season nonsense as long as there are buyers (albeit emotionally based buying based on fear of not getting or having, or ""just gotta have"")...guaranteed. It's a venerable cash cow for them; from a business standpoint, they'd be insane to stop releasing split seasons (they can't stop pinching themselves with joy on all the lemmings going for the bait).

Guaranteed Paramount (and others) will/would stop the nonsense if the cash isn't  ringing...it's all numbers.

Make a statement with the pocketbook/wallet in conjunction with ""we will only buy complete seasons."" It's what's called market demand.

The third season of Perry Mason finds America comfortable with the  lawyer who, to date, has never had to represent a guilty client. Della's relationship with Perry is still ambiguous at best, but the writers of the series are still true to Earle Stanley Gardner's vision.

As always Raymond Burr was surrounded by his excellent regular cast as well as the best old and young character actors of the period. One episode features (The Case of the Blushing Pearls"") young George Takei as a major character. It would be several years before America (and the world) would know him as Sulu on Star Trek, but his voice and mannerisms are unmistakable.

The video quality of the '59 season's production is truly excellent particularly when played on a Blu-ray player. For fans of Perry Mason this is a season worth savoring.",1220745600,3,863,4.74

One week after receivng this volume, I noticed that I paid $6 more for my pre-order than what it was now being sold.  I'm cancelling my pre-order of Season 3 Vol 2 and waiting until the price comes down.  Also, the actual espisodes on the DVD's, is it my imagination or did someone else notice this, that the shows seem chopped off at the points where there would have been commercial breaks?

I decided to return this set and asked for a refund. I hope Paramount uses better quality DVD's for the next season.",1220486400,6,817,5.08955223880597
3436776,5,B0019F030M,"Having just watched all 12 episodes of Season Three, Volume 1, and also having purchased and watched the four previous half season Paramount releases, I will say without hesitation that Season Three, Volume 1 is hands down the best set of episodes released so far.  The quality plots, clever twists and courtroom drama are outstanding throughout the vast majority of the shows. I've been a longtime Perry Mason fan and in my opinion this is when the series was at its best.  In the later seasons leading actor Raymond Burr starts to put on a lot of weight and looks tired and in the several last seasons appears openly irritated and burned out, which he later admitted had to do with the decline in the quality of scripts and hectic pace of the weekly productions.  The later shows also loose Lt Tragg (Ray Collins) and is replaced by a lifeless police investigator named Andy.  An interesting event that happened during the '59-60 season was that William Talman who plays Hamilton Burger was arrested in March of 1960 for hosting a completely nude drug party.  CBS decided to fire him on the spot but Burr headed a boycott to reinstate him and CBS quickly capitulated.

I'm almost 50 years old and started watching reruns on local TV in the late '70s and early '80s and then tried to build a VHS library from TV broadcasts on the Hallmark Channel about 7-9 years ago and found out to my major disappointment that only about 40% of the episodes were broadcast before they started re-running the same old episodes again.  Then about 5 years ago I found that Columbia House was offering three episodes per month on DVD at $25 a pop which was highway robbery, but I did it anyway (long story short, they stopped after 23 DVDs when Paramount announced they were releasing the entire series and I sold off that Columbia House set on eBay and recovered 85% of my money).  So I'm looking forward to obtaining the entire 9 season collection.

I'm very aware of the controversy regarding the price and partial releases.  Who doesn't want them faster, cheaper and in complete seasons?  I agree with a prior reviewer.  I can live with this price (which now is $29.99) if they'd only release them in complete seasons on a faster schedule. In the bigger picture, the set averages to $2.50 per 52 minute episode, which is a bargain compared to paying $10 for an older 80 or 90 minute movie from that same era. The video transfer and restoration of these nearly 50 year old episodes is out of this world, which undoubtedly has a lot to do with the higher cost and slower scheduling.

Finally, for those misguided people who out ignorance or stinginess are pondering outsmarting Paramount by buying those complete DVD sets (which are ILLEGAL, low quality, copied from VHS tapes with commercials and many times non-functional, very limited life, bootleg DVDs) offered on various websites, go to Bill Storrer's website (Google: Bill Storrer Mason) and you'll find a long list of complaints pertaining to being ripped off by these pirating miscreants.

The graphics on the DVDs have been pared down to a solid industrial gray and the episode descriptions are obscured by the DVDs affixed to the case interior.

Alf was realesed to DVD in a DVD Box Set that Originally said

ALF, The Complete Season 1, It showed a Run Time of 620 Minutes.
What Lionsgates Neglected to tell buyers is that these are the SYNDICATED verision. AKA-Reruns that are shown on TV. The reason they gave for doing this, They bought up the syndicated versions because they were cleaner than the UnCut originals and they didn't want to take the time to clean the UnCut originals.
And the actual Run Time is really only 500 Minutes not 620.
That's a 120 Minute difference or 2:00 Hrs..Some of the episodes seem confusing because specific parts are gone.
Watch Season 1 Episode 1 The Pilot. If it starts with Willie and Kate in the garage sitting at Willies radio, it's Syndicated. The Original Uncut version of this episode started with a Pan of the back yard with Willie and Brian and was close to 26:00 Minutes in length. The DVD episode in only 22:00 Minutes, Maybe. It's missing nearly 2 1/2 to 3 Minutes of footage.
Watch the episode called--Try To remember, where ALF hits his head on the side of the bathtub. Wrong, In its Original version, ALF Electrocutes himself in the Bathtub while simulating a Whirling Hot Tub with Kates Electric Mixer. ALF walking into the living room with his Fur Smoking is Priceless. If you watch the part where Lynn says to Willie...

Dad, ALF hit his head on the Bathtub and lost his memory, If you read her lipps she actually says, Dad, ALF got Electrocuted and lost his memory.

Or something to that effect.

I took my ALF Box Set back to Wal-Mart and told them i wanted my $35.00 back. They told me they had a policy about Opened merchandise. So i Blew up and told them the following...
Selling this DVD with the word Complete on it was False Advertising and if they didn't give me my money back i was going to go to every News Channel and News Paper. I got my money back within 2 minutes. They also pulled The ALF series off of their shelves.

I do agree it's an awfully high price but many TV shows have stopped being released after the first few seasons because the studios can't make money on the releases.  So I'd rather they price it to make sure they make money and keep releasing the rest of the seasons.",1217030400,7,476,4.363636363636363

However, after reading several reviews, I checked and sure enough, Paramount has raised the price AND cut a disc from the set.  What were they thinking?!  I immediately canceled my order.  I would rather own the set, but until Paramount stops playing these games, I'll be happy just to Netflix them.  I sincerely hope Amazon tells Paramount they are both losing sales because of this.  Maybe Paramount will get a clue and lower the price.  I expect it's too late to add the fourth disc.",1217030400,10,591,4.615384615384615

Look at the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart Shows, both widely accepted as two of the best comedies ever on commercial TV, both stalled from further releases at the fourth season mark.
Of course the other side of boycotting, as has been suggested in more than a few reviews here, might just make it easier for Paramount to stop releasing them at all if no one's buying.
There are certainly more important things in life to worry about, but it's a shame to see something of such high quality being so poorly handled.",1216598400,18,790,4.676258992805756

Thus far, I have purchased the lousy half year Perry Mason sets.  They beat the episodes I recorded from Hallmark TV with 8 minutes cut-out from every episode.  But, at this price, it is an easy no deal call.  HBO is also infamous for over pricing their DVDs, but at least they are using some of the DVD revenues to offset the original production costs.  For Perry Mason, revenues are all gravy.

I have learned one thing about DVD pricing over the years, if you wait long enough, these over-priced sets are put on sale at the steepest discounts.  I am waiting.",1215993600,20,571,4.4326923076923075

We all know that the series is great and we all know that they could be released in full and at a fair price. Evidently we the consumer and fans know it yet somehow the powers that be don't know it and as a result no one wins. Well, actually we the fans win because we have found our own power with a conscious vote of... ENOUGH! And, of course, in reality the powers that be know we are going to buy and if they can find consumers that won't wait them out, they will keep on doing what they keep on doing; making as much money as they can possibly make. Shall we, as consumer's, continue to feed the greed? That is the only question we need to ask ourselves. If we are willing to do so, then we have no right to complain.

That the market for this material is out there, but not huge, and those interested must put up with the ticket price?  Do you think hordes of DVD buyers under fifty are rushing to buy these classic TV shows?  Please shut-up before you ruin this for all of us.

Although I had pre-ordered this set I've now cancelled the order to protest the price of $70.00 a season. I do love Perry Mason and only wish the studios will take heed. Even though $50 a season would be expensive it would most definitely be more in line. To think Murder She Wrote is less than $40 a season as well as Matlock & Magnum PI, there is no reason to rip off the consumer that enjoys Perry Mason.

The miniseries Centennial is coming out at the same time and it's 6 disks are the same price as this Perry Mason 3 disc set. This is just wrong. As much as I want to see more Perry and Della, I won't be buying this until the price comes way down. The studio really needs to rethink their pricing.",1214870400,26,558,4.175925925925926
3436812,1,B0019F030M,"At $35 to $37 for a full season of Mission Impossible, Paramount makes a hefty profit particularly when you consider that the primary costs are for the discs, case and artwork. At $70 a season for Perry Mason, which is double what they sell Mission Impossible, the studio is simply feeding their greed off of Perry Mason fans.
But wait, there is an alternative.
All 9 seasons, 271 episodes, are now available on-line for a price of from $120 to $160.
I recently saw Star Trek Voyager offered by one of these companies and the picture and sound quality are excellent.
If I'm lucky enough to live another 7 years to purchase the remaining 14 box sets of Perry Mason released by Paramount I would have spent nearly $700!
98% of the comments on this page have told Paramount that we've had enough of the exorbitant prices and excruciating slow releases for Perry Mason.
I and most everyone else who has written comments on this page for the past several months has given Paramount a more than fair opportunity to adjust their policy.
Paramount seems to be tone deaf, Nothing has changed. But for me it has.
So this is to inform you that wish to know that there is an alternative to Paramount's arrogance.
Google Perry Mason and you will find other and better options including the opportunity to purchase the entire nine seasons, legal copies, for under $160. Look for the sites that only sell items that state that these items are in the public domain. They say if you have evidence that they are not then notify them and they will remove the item(s).
I am not telling people to order these items only saying that there are other options from the outrageous prices and slow releases from this studio. Anyone interested in these options should research them on their own and determine the legality and quality before making any decision.
My only intent is to try and help those who cannot afford the money or the wait for more Perry Mason.",1214179200,58,1935,4.611594202898551

I'm not buying, I'll just live with the old VHS tapes I made from the TV years ago.  It amazes me to see how fast Paramount releases the complete episodes of some of the worst shows, yet release of Mason drags on.  They are doing the same thing with the original Gunsmoke.  The first season came out in its entirety, but not season two!  No, they split that in half yet charged the SAME amount as the first season!  I've had it!

Yes, I'm aware that some episodes were not ESG plot-driven, and it is usually apparent........

3436816,1,B0019F030M,"People seem to be jumping the gun on this...but I am going to wait and see if correction announcements are made. At a $50 list price for half a season's worth of episodes, the studio execs would be deemed insane by any court and institutionalized. This MUST be a mistake.

Either the third season of PERRY MASON is going to be released in COMPLETE form for $49.99, or the price HAS TO be revised down.

This is, as we all know, a quality program; the likes of which we rarely see today. However, a list price of 29.99 for half a season is PLENTY for a program whose original production costs 50 years ago were approximately 5% of what a program costs today (programs that are being released immediately at list prices of $59.99 or less for a complete season of 22 to 24 episodes).

Who is getting rich off this? Raymond Burr's estate? Hardly. Barbara Hale? Don't make me laugh. Erle Stanley Gardner's estate is certainly getting residuals, but I doubt if anyone originally associated with the program is getting a cent in royalties.

This means, that unlike currently made programs, where continuing royalty and syndication rights are arranged for actors, directors, writers and producers to continue long after the programs originally aired---costs which have to be considered in the list pricing of any series release, that---outside of the $1 or so that goes into packaging for each unit, another $1-$2 per unit in production costs, and less than $1 in transport and distribution costs (despite rising gas prices), the rest is pure profit for the studios.

This means (IF the $49.99/half-season price tag IS true) that this is one of the biggest rip-offs yet.

But I cannot believe this is true. So I will not rant about a boycott---yet.",1213315200,20,1740,4.764119601328904
