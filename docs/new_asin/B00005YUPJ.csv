1677119,1,B00005YUPJ,"What can I say, this is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  Are you people insane?  Great change of atmosphere? They were in the same damn room the whole time.  Amazing and realistic dialog?  Who talks like this?  No one, absolutely no one.  Why, how, what..that's the whole script.  Why indeed.",1022284800,4,307,4.679245283018868
1677120,4,B00005YUPJ,"In a year that saw Richard Linklater release an excellent animated film-WAKING LIFE, he also released this smaller, but tenacious film-and both are very good. It's hard not to compare this to other single-room films(a very specific subgenre) like ROPE, SECRET HONOR, or maybe COMING APART, but it still holds up pretty well. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are old friends in real life and I think that really helps contribute to this being a believeable and engaging view. It's a really well written film(using Stephen Belber's play), and Linklater gets creative with his two-digital camera set-up. I was suprised that the dvd commentary wasn't really mentioned on the front of the disc(on the back it says ""Production Commentary"").  The commentary features Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke-both have many interesting things to say(although it seems that the commentaries were recorded at different times and cut together). I like this trend of Linklater filming plays. Maybe he'll take an  Altman-like turn and do several more(Altman's play-adaptions are pretty cool-I have to cite STREAMERS, FOOL FOR LOVE and COME BACK TO THE FIVE AND DIME JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN as a few that I really enjoyed).",1019088000,,1204,5.1692307692307695
1677121,4,B00005YUPJ,"If there could be a number eleven on my top ten films of 2001, this would be it. This claustrophobic film, based on Stphen Belbar's Off-Broadway play, features dynamite acting, icluding Gen-X actor and recent Oscar nominee Ethan Hawke's best performance EVER!
Set in a hotel room, 'Tape' revolves around three high school friends(Mr. Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Robert Sean Leonard) who come togther once again ten years after graduating from school and saying goodbye to each other.
The film heats up when an accusation is made: A drug dealer(Hawke) blames his best friend(Leonard)of raping his high school girlfriend and the love of his life(Thurman). You'll have to find out if it is true or not by watching, because my lips are sealed.
Performances like Mr. Hawke's make you wonder if he got his Oscar nod for the wrong movie. Plus, this film has a killer ending. So get off your ass, go to Borders.com, and order 'Tape' today! -James R. Louison",1018569600,8,945,4.839506172839506
1677122,4,B00005YUPJ,"Richard Linklater does more with just three characters in one set that most filmmakers do with so much more. In TAPE he has crafted an often engaging story of three school friends who meet in a seedy motel room. The piece never gets past its obvious stage origins, but Linklater manages quite admirally to keep the dramatic tension up throughout the piece.
Shot on tape, the project has a very cheesy look which makes it seem almost like a surveillance tape. Along with the intensity and rawness of the performances, you feel like you're eavesdropping. While not slick by any means, TAPE is a very engaging work. If you want to see something smart with a bit of an edge, check out TAPE.",1015891200,,686,4.585365853658536
1677123,4,B00005YUPJ,"I saw this movie on the Keene State College campus, and being a film major I can be very critical on movies.  I thought this film to be very clever.  There are only three characters, the film is done in real time (meaning one minute = one minute), and the camera never leaves the motel room that the story takes place in.
  Ethan Hawke is a 28 yr old drug dealer and volunteer fire fighter, and is meeting his friend in a small town to view his friend's Independant film the following day. Ethan tape records his friend admitting that he had raped Emu Thurman's character a decade earlier.  Ethan then calls and invites Emu to the motel room and the conflicts continue to rise until a decision has to be made, friendship or freedom?",1012953600,3,732,4.392592592592592
1677162,5,B00005YUPJ,One of my favorite movies. You won't be disappointed. Linklater is a genius and Hawke at his finest.,1425081600,,100,4.611111111111111
1677163,2,B00005YUPJ,"I know stalling was part of the storyline, but it got old. Really old. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman are great actors and do well in Tape. But the movie itself - the writing and directing - were terrible. Every actor has a film about which they'd like to forget. I think this is one of those for Thurman and Hawke. I wouldn't recommend it.",1395964800,,337,4.2
1677164,3,B00005YUPJ,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who was interested in WW2 Axis apologists, deniers and defenders because curiously, the script gives the film's most important lines to the granddaughter of (""Colonel Baron Friedrich Karl Johannes von Schlebrgge, a German military officer who had become one of the senior Nazi spies in the Americas but who was also jailed by the Nazis for protecting Jewish friends."" - wikipedia entry for Uma Thurman.

The film meanders in private uninteresting to outsider conversation typical of Hawke and Linklater's Dating Julie Delpy films with two members of Dead Poets Society.  I wouldn't say the conversation was interesting at all but I played the film in the background because it also cast Hawke's ex-wife who is very different from a typical Linklater film although I did enjoy the film ""Gattaca.""

Someone who disappointed her and perhaps raped her argues with her that he has apologized repeatedly and her character gets to say something very important about the Axis atrocities - that if you are truly repentant than you are willing to take the consequences and that apologies do no good to the victim and when the wrongdoer then argues that he should not be responsible for the ineffectual healing properties of having made an apology, Uma Thurman responds that that is just too bad instead of pointing out the quality of an apology involves making amends.",1392508800,,1397,5.012931034482759

1677168,3,B00005YUPJ,"This is a good movie with a worthwhile message, BUT it was annoying to watch, AND it was slow to develop.  I almost turned it off several times, but stuck with it anyway.  I wasn't fooled by the drunk routine either. I guess the real reason I didn't turn it off was because I wanted to see where ""The Tape"" was and whether it was a video or audio tape.  It certainly wasn't a very sticky tape.  So if you can hang in there until about halfway through, then it will get a bit more interesting, but not less annoying.  Even so it has a good moral message.",1366243200,,553,4.083333333333333

1677171,3,B00005YUPJ,"Don't view this expected much action. There is none, really. The entire film takes place inside a claustrophic cheesy motel room where Ethan Hawke and a high school buddy engage in a monologue about events that seem to still haunt them 10 years after they graduated. Uma Thurman provides a bit of relief from the tedium about half way through. This is a stage play adapted for the screen, so, as usual, it's all about the dialogue, and the dialogue is pretty good. Not a profound film, but worth a watch if you are in a certain mood.",1324598400,,533,4.448979591836735
1677192,5,B00005YUPJ,"Richard Linklater's best films are mainly about intelligent conversations between interesting people. Tape is no exception. Ethan Hawke, Linklater's favorite protagonist, joins Robert Sean Leonard in a conversation which takes place entirely in a hotel room. The two males talk about their high school experiences. Their conversation seems to reach an impasse when Uma Thurman, playing a high school friend of both, knocks on the door. Then things really get interesting.

1677193,3,B00005YUPJ,"The three stars are for the actors and their excellent performances in this ensemble piece about three old high school pals who  come back together years later for a confrontation over something that may or may not have happened between the woman and one of the men.  Sparks fly and accusations run rampant as the conflict increases in a tiny, crummy motel room.

The camera work is annoying at times with the camera whooshing back and forth and making the viewer dizzy. There are also silly shots between the actors' legs.

Overall, though, an interesting look at the sins of the past and how the repercussions can last for a long time.",1280102400,,637,4.660714285714286
1677194,5,B00005YUPJ,"Richard Linklater has long been known for his knack for getting a lot of a little.  Movies like ""Slacker"" pushed the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, and took your preconceptions and stomped them to dust.  Even his mainstream breakthrough ""Dazed and Confused"" seemed surreally barebones in its structure.  However, with ""Tape"", Linklater took his style to whole new heights of complex simplicity (yes, that was an intentional oxymoron).

Unfolding like a modern day Samuel Beckett play, ""Tape"" revolves entirely around only three characters, and takes place entirely in a hotel room.  The central character, Vince (played brilliantly by Ethan Hawke) is meeting up with two old friends from high school (Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard).  It seems like an innocent friendly reunion at first, but soon it's apparent that Vince has ulterior motives for getting the old gang back together.

For its rather sparse arrangement, this is an intense, intelligent, highly complex, and extremely engaging story.  All three performances are great, but Hawke definitely stands out, bringing such vivid dimension to a highly erratic and delightfully devious character.  This is definitely among the best performances I've seen of his.  It's also worth mentioning that this movie was filmed not in a real hotel room, but on a very convincing soundstage.  To those interested in stage design, the attention to detail here is pretty impressive.

Like most of Linklater's movies, this is definitely not for everyone, but if you dig his style, you definitely need to see this.",1233100800,,1567,5.299595141700405
1677195,4,B00005YUPJ,"The Bottom Line:

Drawing its strength from a performance by Ethan Hawke that's so good it forever made me like him as an actor when I previously hated him, Tape is an ingeniously claustrophobic drama from Richard Linklater.",1230940800,,224,4.894736842105263
1677196,5,B00005YUPJ,"Talented director Linklater dares to sustain a drama on a single dingy set, and thanks to a biting script and superb performances, succeeds. Though Thurman expertly plays the pivotal role of Amy, less a victim than a detached female looking on with bemusement at two ranting males, the show is Hawke's and Leonard's, as the two men wage a savage battle of wits, with life-changing implications. Taut, holding, and clever, ""Tape"" is immensely satisfying fare.",1185321600,2,458,5.12
1677197,3,B00005YUPJ,This film is over-rated at 4 stars.  It starts off slow and eventually gets to something that is interesting.  But it's very pretentious and not very believable.,1170806400,2,161,4.925925925925926

1677199,4,B00005YUPJ,"...well actually the movie only stars 3 people and never moves outside of a hotel room. That may sound dull to most but this film has more tension and powerful moments than most big budget movies. A sharp playbased script about love and blackmail and assorted mindgames are what sets this movie apart from other ""normal"" films. Ethan Hawke is especially electrifying as the manipulative Vincent. Uma Thurman also proves she's a great actress even when she's not Killing Bill. This little gem fell through the cracks and deserves to be discovered.",1140998400,2,546,4.945652173913044
1677200,5,B00005YUPJ,"`Tape' is well written and well directed with first rate performances by Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman, and like

 Hitchcock's `Rope', `Tape' is also set in one room.  But unlike Hitchcock's masterpiece, the room is a seedy motel in Lansing Michigan.  Every inch of space is used - bathroom, beds -- the floor, in one instance during Vince's exaggeratedly athletic pushups, in another, as a fight breaks out just before Amy (Uma Thurman's) entrance; and finally when Vince, John, and Amy gather round a small table to rehash old times and old wounds.

Vince (Ethan Hawke) has come to Lansing either at the invitation of his old high school buddy, or out of curiosity, or simply to get even.

There is no violence and yet violence is at the core of the story.

As tension builds and agendas are revealed we see that there never was any friendship only rivalry, unrequited love, and youth.

`Tape' is a serious and thought provoking film satisfying and beautifully directed by Richard Linklater.  The film's pace never lets up and though the dialogue covers the same ground over and over again it remains fresh coming always from a different point of view -- a credit to the excellent writing.",1135728000,4,1211,4.783653846153846
1677201,4,B00005YUPJ,"At first glance, we wonder why Linklater directed this movie--however--the dialogue is very intellectual and very emotional sort of like Waking Life but in a more ""real"" perspective. It is a a modern tale of morality that asks ""why"" we say and do the things we do and what ""forgiveness"" and ""maturity"" really is. Throughout the film we side with different characters and we're not quite sure who is really ""right."" The film is truly a masterpiece that i would put alongside any Linklater film i've seen. The tension is insane, the twists are great, and the dialogue rivals my favorite dialogue movie of all time--Clerks (which is just as quick and brilliant). Fortunately for Linklater and his fan base..the movie focuses on motives, reasons, and moral philosophy. It is a film that can be enjoyed by both the highly intellectual part of you..and the side that wants to regress. Also, we have 3 characters. I characterize them as Moral..immoral..and The Judge. For most of the film, the viewer almost cannot decide one which one is moral and which one is immoral--the view changes constantly. I can't really express how well this movie was made and it certainly deserves much more recognition.",1133481600,2,1193,4.910891089108911

1677243,4,B00005YUPJ,"This movie must be good if I'm actually writing a positive review..

What if someone told you that an entire hour and a half movie takes place all in one room, a dingy motel room that is. Not only that, it has a total of 3 actors, and one-third of the actors don't even come into the film until the halfway point. So what this means is that for about 45 minutes, you're watching two people talk in one room. No transition scenes or anything like that, no flashbacks, just one room, two people.

Uma Thurman, Robert Sean Leonard, and in particular Ethan Hawke was so believable with the acting that that's all that's needed to make this movie work, since it has a perfect script. This is exactly how people in real life would act and talk. This movie sits at the polar opposite of Hollywood crap. That's not to say there's not certain Hollywood crap I do like, nevertheless, this movie is still positioned in the orientation I mentioned.

I felt more suspense and tension watching them in that little room than I do from seeing most other movies where they're not confined to a closet. Big budget special effect movies can learn a thing or two from a movie like this and how important quality dialogue is to a film.

Asking someone what they prefer between Tape or *insert random mindless summer action flick here* would be a good litmus test to determine whether that person should continue standing in front of you taking your stupid litmus test, or whether you should just shake your head at them in utter disgust.",1122854400,3,1516,4.521897810218978
1677244,4,B00005YUPJ,"I didn't expect to laugh during Tape- a drama about hostility, rape, and fractured memories.  But the dialogue and the delivery of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard as two rival friends frequently had me laughing out loud.  Hawke's character, Vince is such a wonderfully insufferable jerk: coked-out, hostile, santimonious, but oddly articulate and resourceful when he needs to be.  When he verbally batters John (Leonard), his old friend, rival, and whom he accuses of raping his childhood sweetheart Amy (Uma Thurman) you can't help but laugh at his verbal astuteness.  Hawke's performance is awesome- spasmodic and winning and funny.  Robert Sean Leonard has less to do because his character is a more obvious jerk, but he captures his snobby elitism well.  The climax in which Amy enters the claustrophobic motel room that serves as the film's setting, kind of deconstructs, twisting over itself so many times that we stop caring.  But for Hawke's performance and the way he and Leonard interact, Tape is well worth-seeing.",1121385600,,1029,5.162650602409639
1677245,4,B00005YUPJ,"Like ""My Dinner With Andre,"" ""Tape"" is one of those conversation films that zoom by.  It works most of the time.  Director Richard Linklater who directed Hawke in the equally talky ""Before Sunrise"" in 1995 and shared an Oscar nomination with Hawke for the screenplay to its sequel ""Before Sunset"" in 2004 shoots the entire film on digital video, keeping costs down and discovering the cinematic possibilities of low-budget film.  Some of his camera technique of whipping back and forth between the actors is a bit overdone.  Ethan Hawke and co-star Robert Sean Leonard were co-founders of a now defunct New York theatre company called Malaparte and first starred together in ""The Dead Poets Society"" with Robin Williams in 1989.  Leonard also acted in Hawke's debut directing credit ""Chelsea Walls"" along with Hawke's now ex-wife Uma Thurman.  Thurman met Hawke while starring in one of my favorite films about racial intolerance, ""Gattaca,"" in 1997.  So the bottom line is that these three actors and the director have all worked together before, were very comfortable with each other, and it shows on screen.  As Vince, Hawke is not the likeable nice guy that got him his Best Supporting Actor nomination for ""Training Day.""  He's a part-time drug dealer, volunteer fireman, who really hasn't started acting responsibly as an adult.  At least, this is what his buddy Johnny played by Robert Sean Leonard thinks.  Johnny is in town for the premiere of his new independent film at the Lansing film festival and Vincent travels out from Oakland, California to attend.  ""Tape"" really ignited for me when Uma Thurman hit the screen.  She plays Amy who is an assistant district attorney that used to go steady with Vince and made love to Johnny senior year.  Since Thurman appeared in ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and got her Best Supporting Actress nomination for ""Pulp Fiction,"" her career has had its ups like ""Kill Bill"" (parts I & II) & downs ""The Avengers.""  2005 may be her banner year with 5 films out or coming out: ""Be Cool"" with John Travolta, ""The Women"" with Ashley Judd, Sandra Bullock, Meg Ryan & Annette Bening, ""The Producers"" with Nathan Lane & Matthew Broderick, ""Prime"" with Meryl Streep & a cameo in ""Brothers Grimm"" with Heath Ledger & Matt Damon.  However great her 2005 may be, she becomes riveting in this 2001 project. Hawke & Leonard become more interesting with her on screen.  Stephen Belber's one-act play that was adapted into this project shows how some of us grow up after high school & some just move on.  But however that happens, the loves & experiences of those early years have a great impact on how we perceive ourselves & how we approach others.  ""Tape"" is like a walk down memory lane where one does not always wish to promenade.  The ending is a bit open-ended (i.e. Was there an assault or not?) that may drive the more concretely minded up the walls, but has the vague recall of something once true.  A very interesting evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!",1118188800,2,2984,4.844181459566075
1677246,4,B00005YUPJ,"How do you convert a one-act play taking place in a confined space with just three actors into a movie? First, you find three of the best actors you can. OK, done. Ethan Hawke as Vince. Robert Sean Leonard as Jon. Uma Thurman as Amy. Then you build a set that resembles a seedy hotel room from somewhere in Lansing, Michigan so that you can manipulate your two cameras and get excellent framing and lighting that explode your tiny hellish space into a landscape reflecting your exploding hellish dialog. Done. Then you rehearse for a few weeks and let it rip.
And rip it does. Vince is a crazed, drugged out supermanipulative stick of dynamite who sets his sights on his ""best friend"" Jon. Jon is an indy filmmaker in town for a film festival in which his latest masterpiece is being premiered. Amy is the girlfriend they ""shared"" way back in highschool. In the course of 83 minutes, the viewer gets completely into the heads of these three people. And what is it all about? Jealousy? Saying you're sorry and really meaning it? Even understanding the nature of your offense? And who offends who in this melodrama? Very interesting questions all around.
This chatty theatrical film is well worth watching because not only is the dialog snappy and nasty and clever and engaging, but the acting is superb. Robert Sean Leonard probably has the most difficult part as the man of ""reason"" who must apologize for his irrationality, or does he? And Ethan Hawke is flying through his role as a physical and mental menace, while Uma Thurman brings a delicate but dangerous presence into this explosive mix.

Thank goodness I did.

TAPE is a wonderful thriller in the sense that there is no music, no change of setting, but simply the characters, Amy, Vincent, and John. You have these three and their words. No change of costume---these three virtually had nothing to work with but their chemistry with one another and their absolute superb acting abilities. The ending is rather ambiguous, and leaves you wondering exactly what DID happen.

There was tremendous acting and energy in the film that made you almost forget the dinginess of the setting.  When Uma Thurman blew in, it was like a breath of fresh air.  Although the juxtapositioning of the actors was good when there were two in the room, three really brought out the  film's artistry by the careful use of limited physical space. I also loved the projection of a drug user/seller with a brain--albeit, a slightly twisted one. Unfortunately, I thought the ending was too contrived and trivialized.  I would have preferred an ending where the characters all learned something from the experience.  It was such an opportunity to show how rape can really traumatize but Uma's flip and secure attitude about the experience projected an angry view that didn't scratch the surface.  I hope Linklater brings these three back together for another similar type film--but fully tackles the issue next time.",1112832000,2,1013,4.958579881656805
1677249,5,B00005YUPJ,"3 great actors. Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman star and act it all out in a small motel room...their main subject...a tape. What evolves is a merry go round of confessions, denials, and what did or didn't happen 10 years ago in their senior year of high school. Clever writing keeps this movie and watchers on their toes endlessly anticipating the outcome, the truth, and the characters true nature.
This is what movie making is all about. All you need is a camera, and not a fancy one at that, a good script, and two...or even better three great actors and you have yourself a very entertaining indie film.
It goes to show you don't need high tech graphics to lure in the attention of movie lovers. Dialogue is key and Tape goes all the way and brings us honesty ( Uma Thurman's pained face and tearful eyes ) reaction ( Ethan Hawke's flawless portrayal of the guy who never grew up ) and redemption ( Robert Sean Leonard's realistic depiction of an accused man going the extra mile to argue his way out of problem ).
All of this movie is worth the time, only 83 minutes and not a second wasted.

Will we see these fine actors in more great roles to come?",1111536000,2,1175,4.389908256880734
1677250,5,B00005YUPJ,"This is a great little movie with a surprising turn of events. As I was watching this movie I felt like I was seeing a play which is perfectly accurate because this movie is based on the stage play of the same name. All of the three actors do a fantastic job with their roles and this little movie is worth watching for the acting alone which is superb.

Ethan Hawke is excellent as Vince the dope dealer and dope user who first confronts Johnny (Robert Sean Leonard)about the possibility that he date raped his girlfriend in high school played by Hawke's then wife the very sexy and talented Uma Thurman (who is wonderful as Amy, the girl that Johnny supposedly raped).

I won't say anymore and I'll let you decide for yourself. I was very impressed with this movie and is a shame that it didn't get the kind of acceptance when it was first release. I don't remember seeing this movie released in theatres. Again, if you don't get anything out of it which I'm sure that you will see it for the acting which is superb by all three actors. I love a movie that has great actors in it. To me that is what is all about the acting. DON'T MISS THIS ONE.",1108512000,2,1147,4.28110599078341
1677251,4,B00005YUPJ,"This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not.  When the final credits rolled, rather creatively at that, I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater, or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film.  I could not decide.  I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine.  While it was a very interesting audio commentary, it only provided more indecisiveness.  After thinking about this for two days, I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing, there has to be something spectacular about it, and there was.  After two days I was able to put my finger on it.  You had a very chilling story, a deeply disturbing confession, a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman, and then there was Ethan Hawke.  I put him aside because it was his acting, his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection.  Let me explain.

This is a story, that on the surface seems small, is very large in structure.  While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences.  From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies, we never really know anything about him.  Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single, but we never really get to know Ethan's character.  This is what muddled in my mind for those two days, I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was.  Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious, or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted.  Who knows?  I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince.  We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this self-appointed villain, or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose.  Instead, what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him.  Here is what I could hear: ""Ok, Ethan, your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave, do whatever it takes"".  Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot.  Does this make sense?  I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room, but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told.  I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer, but this story needed a hint.  It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation.  I felt Ethan held us back from learning that.  Someone else in the role may have done better, but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.

As I said before, Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders.  I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work, but his true acting ability really came forth.  The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of ""husband and wife"" away while working with Ethan.  I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape, but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate.  The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering.  I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created.  Outside of Ethan, they did a great job.

The story was a very tight story.  I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room.  I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle, but Stephen Belber (who also wrote the play) did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters.  Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament.  The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera.  Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts.  I thought this was annoying at times, and quite dizzying.  It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story.  That is my only critique of Linklater's direction, which was nearly flawless.

Overall, this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element.  It took me a while for me to realize this, and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind, but that is the nature of this film.  It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends.  I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed, proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material.  Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene, while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired.  I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role.  Either way, this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100% pure acting.

1677272,5,B00005YUPJ,"With the acting expertise of only three actors and entirely set in a motel room, Richard Linklater presents an awesome adaptation of this one-act play. Linklater does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and psychological drama in the motel room as the characters become sucked in by Ethan Hawke's character and ultimately involved in a triangular struggle of mental manipulation, control and competition of authenticity.

Once you get beyond the claustrophobia of the room, the viewer is then subjected to a form of mental claustrophobia. At times, it was very frustrating to see each of the characters struggling to communicate with each other. At times it seemed like they were all talking different languages to each other or weren't truly listening to each other. At other times it seemed as if each character simply had their own agenda. The movie makes it clear that we sometimes create our own mental prison. There were quite a few times, when the tense dialogue and emotional frustration between Hawke and Leonard got so uncomfortable that I wished Leonard's character would have just left the motel room...but then we would be left with no film! Ironically, his character has a few opportunities to leave, comes close on another occasion and on yet another occasion where he actually does get out the door, shortly returns!

The movie develops even further when Uma Thurman's character enters the room.  Tape does an exellent job at illustrating how one event can be perceived and interpreted differently by three individuals, each with their own emotional issues and baggage and individual ideas about how the world works, or is supposed to work. Is there one absolute truth or is each truth in the mind of the individual?

The dialogue between Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman works well in vividly illustrating how the human psyche deals with intense feelings of envy, jealousy, pride and guilt. The acting of all three is magnificent.

Ethan Hawke's acting seems effortless in this film. In my opinion, this is one of his best roles and acting performances.",1105401600,2,2106,5.040229885057471
1677273,4,B00005YUPJ,"This movie with three actors in a seedy hotel room seems useless and inane at first but if you hold out until the end it is well worth considering.

Vince (Ethan Hawke) is found in a seedy hotel in Lansing whooping it up and slamming back a few cheap beers while clamoring about in his boxers. Soon an old friend Jon Salter (Robert Sean Leonard) appears and the story begins. These two ""friends"" discuss old high-school days, mistakes and regrets leaving the audience to wonder about their supposed friendship. An explanation arrives when Amy Randall (Uma Thurman) knocks on the door. Be careful what you wish for sometimes old memories are better left behind!

Ethan Hawke is eerily great in this role as a crazy, drug induced loser looking for answers about a past he can't seem to leave behind. Robert Sean Leonard is the subdued maturity of this film with his character seemingly capable of leaving a secret long in the past until the error of his ways comes back to haunt him. Of course Uma Thurman is wickedly brilliant as the supposed victim who turns a new leaf and leaves a few surprises. As with most independent films the writing and direction is fantastic in this film but the budget is shot! Some scenes are filmed irritatingly like an amateur videographer with far too much movement for the eyes to bear but other than that it moves like a staged dramatic play.

1677274,4,B00005YUPJ,"Alright, I'll just let it fly right now: I don't think I've seen a movie since Dead Poet's Society in which Ethan Hawke doesn't kinda blow. He's not so believable in Linklater's Before Sunrise, got undeserved acclaim for Training Day, and pretty much destroys the art of acting in Taking Lives. So it was a nice surprise to see him not suck after Linklater's fascinating, superbly acted (holy crap, I just said that about an Ethan Hawke movie) Tape, which needs about 20 minutes to get its look-at-me-I'm-a-badass-indie-film-shot-on-DV-with-cool-angles attitude out of its system. But after that, whoa boy. The film takes place entirely in a low-rent motel room where Hawke is staying; his high school pal, played by the underappreciated Robert Sean Leonard (the guy who blew his brains out in DPS), drops by and before you know it, it's less high school reunion and more Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. You see, Hawke's Vince exposes a secret from Leonard's Jon's past and a cunning game of psychological hot potato begins. What impressed me the most about Tape is how it defied my expectations at every point that the movie turned - there are more twists in it than a Hollywood thriller, and the movie becomes so engrossing at points that interest becomes giddiness. But the best thing about Tape is how well its actors (including Uma Thurman, who drops by in a pivotal role) navigate the facial and verbal expressions that would accompany such an encounter. For a low-budget indie that could have been pretentious and silly, this movie is so well-nuanced and executed it'll have you clamoring for more in its all-too-brief 84 minutes.

This movie about three high school friends of ten years prior, who have some very unresolved issues, takes place in just one hotel room. It is so real that you feel like an eavesdropper. I really can't stand about 95% of the movies made in the last 15 years, with very few exceptions. I don't ""get"" the stars. I am SO sick of Tom Cruise's,  Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson's, and Julia Roberts trademark smirks and quirks (aren't we CUTE?""!) that they have marketed into  ridiculously lucrative careers of boring movies that are interchangeable and unmemorable. I tend to put all the actors of today down. Watching Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Robert Sean Leonard, as in this fim, makes me realize that I am sometimes wrong in my summation about the actors of today. They are so astoundingly real, that I can't honestly be objective about the storyline of this film, because I was so impressed by their performances. They are among the best actors of today. I recently discovered Uma Thurman, later than everyone else, in ""Hysterical Blindness"" on HBO, and was just amazed at her performance. I happened upon that film, as with this one, by accident. That she not only stars in this film, but, co-stars with such an incredible actor, Ethan Hawke, who also happens to be her husband, well, let's just say that it's a most wonderful discovery for me. It drew me in in the first minute, and, never let go until the end. I realize that these actors have all been around for a while, and certainly I am ""late"" in discovering their talents. I guess I need to open myself up to some more recent flicks. It's just that, when I do, they are almost always just plain lousy.  These three actors make this film  one of those  rare occurrences of being overwhelmed by real, unaffected talent. There is not a hint that they are ""acting."" What a pleasure to, finally, observe art, not just phony box-office garbage. I could drone on and on, just repeating myself, so, I'll stop. I just highly recommend this movie to anyone who is as hungry as I am for an intelligent, non-special effects, skilled film that totally involves you. I really need to watch it again, as I was so caught up in their portrayals, I'm sure there's some things I missed. I am now a ""fan"" of these actors, if you want to call me that. But, I don't want to know anything about their personal lives. I don't want to watch them on ""Entertainment Tonight"" or read about them in ""People"" magazine.

1677277,5,B00005YUPJ,"...in this fascinating movie.  Not often can a director pull off an adaptation of a one act off-off Broadway theater piece into a full feature movie yet Linklater manages to do just that. So did the actors; all three roles required intelligence, emotional sensitivity and instinct that one certainly does not expect from Hollywood  icons. In some way this film is already (as it should be) a classic. Myself  I  kept being reminded throughout of Bergman (& Uma certainly made me think of Liv Ullman).
I was also reminded of high school, its pressures and bittersweet romances that can never be forgotten and that, for better or worse, defined life paths for many of us. The first love, the first rejection, the first true friendship...  Linklater shows that  these can coalesce, blend, and differentiate in an elaborate dance of memories and emotions.  What is free will? how do we define ourselves? what is self-respect and how does it stand up to emotional revelations?  Why would one want to stay and face the demons from  one's past rather than flee into the oblivion of worldly ""success""?  These are all issues  Linklater and his actors distill into a bewildering and intoxicating beverage that makes for fidgety yet irresistible viewing.
A lot  in this movie (like in any good theater) is left unsaid; in other words, it is left to be conveyed by actors'  body language and energetic tone of their emotions.  They succeed spectacularly. This movie should be a required part of curriculum of every acting school worthy of its designation.

Tape is directed by Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Waking Life) and stars Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman. They are the only cast members of the film and the entire feature takes place in a single motel room.
The film was shot on digital and the opening sequences had me dreading yet another movie that is to showcase the direction and film quality with no real plot. I could not have been more wrong.
There are very few films that can be carried merely by the dialogue of the actors. Tape is one of them. As the credits started rolling, both my husband and I were sitting in awe with our mouths hanging open. And the amazing thing is, while I knew what was happening and even predicted the ending, I was still completely captivated as I watched it unravel.
It's very realistic in presentation. Though by the end, you still don't know what the true reality of the film was. But I think that's how it's supposed to be. Very reflective of life. The difference between true fact (if there is such a thing) and the perceptions of the people involved. The effect that intention has on a situation.
I highly recommend this movie, especially if you liked Before Sunrise and Waking Life. Though beyond being based on dialogue, Tape is in a league of its own.",1062028800,8,1358,4.457831325301205

Just don't expect any big screen histrionics and be prepared for incessant chit-chat with lots of ""Why?"" and ""WHat?"" and other logic-numbing trivia, and you'll do fine.
But first, the good. Really, hats off to Hawke and Therman (and that other guy) for having the courage to do something like this, all in candid videocam, warts and all. Sans any make up, sans any Gattaca-style golden Fuji reel etc. Just raw dialog between old friends, about an old grudge, in a shoddy motel room.
The whole movie veers around a lot of talking in circles, friends questioning perceptions of each other over a shared girlfriend fling in senior year over a decade ago. Frankly, this would have been ok in a theatrical production, but this film errs with its painful camera moves, for e.g., frequent switches to and fro faces of people standing opposite each other, which means you get treated to a lot of viewpoint swings.
Secondly, and more importantly, a little bit of unpredictability would have been nice. Anyone with a couple of brain cells could have figured out what was to happen 15 minutes ahead, which is not exactly a very favorable point for a movie.
For a full grinding hour, Ethan Hawke and Bob Leonard keep exchanging grinding blither blather, until Ms. Therman slides into the picture (what a respite!) and makes things a little interesting. I cannot imagine any other actress making the theme more watchable than she does, a simple twitch of an eye from her speaks volumes.

7957171,5,B00005YUPJ,"Trying to understand what makes Tape so fantastic is rather difficult... or rather easy!  I remember watching this movie 10 years ago but I obviously didn't understand the elaborate nature of it back then.

It's about two guys who were once high school buddies (Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) who get together in a hotel room (where the entire movie takes place by the way) and they have a long-winded *extremely* elaborate discussion about what happened the night Robert apparently dated and raped a girl (Uma Thurman).  They talk about drugs and several personal matters for the first 20 minutes, until the conversation heats up about the girl.  Then it gets serious.  Keep in mind the entire movie is NOTHING but one long conversation between two/three people.  That's all it is.

This is a SPOILER but Tape is one of those movies where I can't help but reveal some key twists.  Ethan actually tapes the entire conversation right down to the confession by Robert.  This is because Uma used to be Ethan's girlfriend, and 10 years later he's still bitter about the way their relationship ended.  This means Ethan comes across like a jealous drugged up scumbag.  Sort of hilarious that he's drugged and yet able to speak so coherently and intelligently.  He can convincingly question and respond to everything Robert says the whole time.  But hey, only in Hollywood right!  Obviously the two aren't friends anymore if Ethan's going the extra mile to get a confession out of his ""friend"" and record it onto tape.

The acting is *amazing*.  If anything a storyline like this reveals what happens when a simple conversation can turn into a complete monster of contradictions and lies with a desire to be vindictive.  Proof that a simple display of words can result in mental torment and constant emotional changes.  A story like this shows how easy it is for one person to interpret another's actions (and words!) as something entirely different, and that contradicting oneself is very easy to accidentally do when confronted with a personal issue.

When Uma enters the picture, well the final 30 minutes are beyond brilliant.  Some of the best writing I've seen in years.  Due to the extraordinary acting abilities by all three actors/actresses, you really get a feel for what makes rape such a terrible thing, and how discussing it can be mentally painful for the victim and mentally painful for those seeking an apology (but realizing they're not going to get one because they messed up).

With that in mind, and I'm NOT defending the rapist here, but you'd think Uma would be at least a little forgiving since it happened 10 years prior and that high school kids can be total jerks at that age.  On the flipside, Robert should have tried apologizing many years earlier even if he knew the outcome wouldn't be a sincere apology, and knowing that you can't fully correct a mistake of this magnitude.  Then again until he found out the conversation was taped, he didn't exactly seem apologetic now did he?

Because of the powerful acting, you get a feel for the consequences rape can have many years down the road.  Most women won't forget when it happens to them and why should they?  I'm surprised Robert didn't pick up on Uma's behavior.  She was obviously mocking rape because she was trying hard for 10 years to completely forget about the traumatizing ordeal and pretend it never happened.  That seemed obvious based on her body language and facial expressions.

But SPOILER!  Uma gets the last laugh.  I won't reveal how it happens, but she wins.  She wins in a clever way that puts both Ethan and Robert in their places.  Seriously there's so many ways to interpret a movie like this.  I haven't even scratched the surface perhaps due to my own limited interpretation.  One of those movies where it's fun to read other people's thoughts and reviews because I'm sure everyone has their own way of interpreting this story.  I never even mentioned that Robert presents himself as a smart logical guy despite the crime he committed.  One could interpret this to mean he's full of crap, and that siding with the drug addict seems totally appropriate in this case.  Incredible job by the movie writers!

With that said, if you desire a setting that takes place in numerous locations besides a hotel room you'll probably be disappointed in that regard.  But the movie is clearly trying to emphasize an extraordinarily moving storyline with a hard-hitting message above anything else.  Strongly recommended.",1441670400,,4511,4.850785340314136

7957174,3,B00005YUPJ,"This movie gets 3 stars only because Robert Lenard's acting was excellent and very believable. However, there is a monster flaw in the story line. Ethan Hawke's character didn't discuss the rape with Uma Thurman's character in the first place, there wouldn't have been any reason for Hawke to suspect his friend of any wrong doings in the first place. Thurman's character even says to Hawke when Lenard leaves the room for a few minutes that there wasn't a rape, so why would Hawke have had a suspension in the first place, 10 years after high school?",1435276800,,551,4.690721649484536
7957175,4,B00005YUPJ,"Great movie, it all takes place in one room. You will have to be in the mood to see this film, if you are not, you will hate it. Mid tier Linklater.",1426118400,,148,3.65625
