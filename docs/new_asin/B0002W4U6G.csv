2128580,3,B0002W4U6G,"I thought this movie has a good plot (a little simple, but I'm not watching it for the plot) the women are beautiful, also because I'm a guy I liked it that they didn't show a lot of man flesh.  Nicole Sheridan makes a good Jeannie, the only thing is I got peterbed that Alexandre Boisvert (Major Nealson) didn't use her to her true ptential.  They don't let you do that, but I though the movie was worth three and a half stars--if for nothing else Nicole Sheridan.

In short, I liked the movie, but if I were in his place, exspecally after I found out about my girlfriend, I would have had more fun with her.",1126915200,10,609,4.188034188034188
2128581,3,B0002W4U6G,"The worst thing is the parody isn't as imaganative as I would have expected it to be or even hoped for [being they got the bottle right at least] the master was handsome,the genie was way too dumb even for tv standards and her male genie friend could have been more animalized with his performances. the plot started really interesting but failed the moment the master got home with the bottle. if you're going to make light of one of my favorite tv series-at least drive it to the edge with some flair as a producer. But it was cute in it's own way for parody - if you're a ''i dream of jeannie''fan,you'll understand.",1112832000,10,619,4.391304347826087
2128582,2,B0002W4U6G,"This movie could have been so much better. The original TV show is ripe for parody, but the script writer(s) failed to make an effort. This movie is nothing but soft porn scenes held together by a minute or so of pointless dialogue. There are a few attempts at humor, but nothing to justify buying or watching this movie. Hey directors, if you're not going to attempt to get your actors to act, you might as well make a XXX film instead. This movie is DEFINITELY not worth the money.",1110758400,32,483,4.377777777777778
2128583,4,B0002W4U6G,"This was a great idea, showing how ""I Dream of Jeannie"" might have been had it been on the current Playboy Channel instead of network television back in the 1960's.  I thought Nicole Sheridan was perfectly cast as Jeannie.  She's got a beautiful face and a smokin' hot body!

I didn't care much for the story, however, and I really didn't think much of the several guy/girl scenes in this one.  On the other hand there were also a couple of girl/girl scenes, and one of them was really hot, or at least started out that way.  Let me explain...

Jeannie (Nicole Sheridan) is out on the street searching for her master.  She's wearing her sexy genie outfit, and suddenly an SUV pulls up alongside her.  Inside is an attractive brunette woman who asks her if she needs any help.  When she replies that she's looking for her master, the woman opens the passenger door and tells her to get in, which she does.  The very next scene shows Jeannie in a downstairs dungeon, bent over at the waist, her arms manacled in front of her, and her gorgeous behind thrust out, being spanked and fondled by this same brunette woman who asks her, ""Who's your master now?""  I thought it was a very erotic moment.  But once the two women start having sex together the woman forgets all about Jeannie's sexy butt which I thought was a shame.

Still, it was a great scene while it lasted.",1105056000,15,1365,4.455645161290323
2128584,4,B0002W4U6G,"If you were a fan of the old TV show, you may have wondered why Tony always pushed Jeannie away.  Well so did Fred Olen Ray.  Now he has done something about it.

Two new Genies are ready for their first masters.  But when they see the old folks they have been assigned two, they decide to lose their innocence with one another, a crime that results in them being imprisoned in a bottle and a small chest.

2000 years later a US Army officer on a UN mission (plenty of political satire here -- sorry Dave) finds the containers after blasting a mountain.  The Arab he is helping makes the sign of the Cross (?) and runs, leaving the officer to take the objects home with him.

Once home, his fianc offers herself to him even though she had been saving herself.  Turns out Tony is set to inherit six million dollars (inside joke time) and she and her father want to get their hands on the money.  Well, the other genie gets released and the plot thickens as greed rises until the film reaches its climax.

This time we have a reason for Tony to push Jeannie's favors aside, he is trying to be true to his fianc.  Fred Olen Ray and his wife (the producer) provide a commentary track for the first time.  A small photo gallery is also included.  The acting is pretty good for this sort of fare with the male Djinn offering comic relief and plenty of one-liners.  Nicole Sheridan stars in the title role and is the most revealing of the actresses.  All in all a pretty good example of soft-core parody.",1104883200,52,1497,4.315412186379929
2128585,4,B0002W4U6G,"The Erotic Dreams of Jeannie is, you guessed it, a softcore parody of the ""I Dream of Jeannie"" television series. This was my first Retromedia title, so I didn't know what to expect. From the description of the release I was a little worried that I wouldn't get too much actual softcore. Fortunately, that wasn't the case, and what they advertise about the release isn't really what ended up on the DVD: ""Full of parody, political satire, and hip insider humor ..."". Okay, I can agree on the parody, but political satire? Hip insider humor? I must have missed that part. ""... a laugh-filled special effects-laden spoof ..."". Now this is accurate. There were many places I was laughing at the pathetically bad special effects that were used.

But, on to what counts. This video delivered nicely in the sex department. There are six sex scenes. Three are boy/girl, two are girl/girl, and one is boy/girl/girl. All the women were gorgeous and included pornstar Nicole Sheridan and softcore veteran Beverly Lynne. There were two other women who were also very attractive. The sex was decently explicit and filmed well. The sounds of the actors were still audible during the scenes and all scenes went to completion.

Extras included a still gallery and a commentary track from a couple of people involved in the movie's production. I listened to a bit of it, and it sounded interesting, so I'll probably go back later and listen to the whole thing.

This is a good video, but Retromedia could have done better. The actual movie only ran about sixty-five minutes. But in order to pad out the runtime to make it appear like a full length film, the opening and closing credits are stretched out to run as long as they possibly can. There was plenty of opportunity to fit in one or two more sex scenes. They also need to advertise their product better. Like I said before, it isn't very clear that this is a softcore video, and I can imagine people passing it up because of that. I also had no idea that Beverly Lynne was in this video until I watched it. She's a softcore hall of famer. Why they didn't have her name on the outside packaging is beyond me.

For the price, this is a good release and I recommend it. I'll probably be checking out other Retromedia releases, but they aren't going to achieve the distinction of studios like Playboy or Surrender unless they improve their quality and value. They've got some beautiful women and talent, they just need to use both of them more effectively.",1099180800,197,2493,4.659090909090909
2128600,3,B0002W4U6G,"This is one of Soft Porn's that is shown on Cinemax and Showtime now and then. It's one of the better ones that are more than R but not really a X movie. If you like the corny sexy soft stuff you will like this one. It has some nice girl & guy stuff and some girl & girl too.
 But, as in a R movie you won't see any Pink, penetration, or full frontal male nude either. If your looking for explicit X rated or stronger you won't like this one.",1203379200,3,442,3.8043478260869565
2128601,2,B0002W4U6G,This movie blows!  Not in a good way.  At least the cinematography is good.,1200182400,,75,4.285714285714286
2128602,5,B0002W4U6G,"This whole series of films from Retromedia, of which ""the Erotic Dreams of Jeannie"" is one, are actually great fun to watch and much better than I expected out of this type of movie.  They are soft-core porn films, so there are all the expected nude scenes with beautiful women, love scenes, fake sex scenes, and so forth.  Nothing new there.  They are very much soft core, so they have none of the explicit hard core type shots, which makes them more viewable by a general audience (these are movies that my girlfriend would sit and watch with me and enjoy).  But what makes them interesting is that they actually have a great tongue-in-cheek sense of humor about them.

The films don't take themselves too seriously or try to be something other than what they are; which is refreshing.  In many of these types of movies, the ""movie"" is usually some really bad filler that tries to just fill in the gap between sex scenes.  Not so in this series of movies from Retromedia. The ""filler"" in these movies is actually fun to watch just on it's own merit.

The cast in this series of films, which for the most part carries over from film to film, such as Nicole Sheridan and Evan Stone, are obviously having fun doing what they're doing.  I was immensely surprised and impressed by Evan Stone, who is a hard core veteran, and the sense of humor and Jim Carrey-ish physical comedy that he brings to these films; who knew?.  He's just great fun to watch.  Nicole Sheridan, as well as being just beautiful to look at, also is clearly having fun playing some of the silly roles that she plays in the series, such as Jeannie, the ghost in the teeny bikini, and so on.

I would highly recommend this whole series of films.  ""The Erotic Dreams of Jeannie,"" The Bikini Chain Gang."" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful,""  ""Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet,"" ""Ghost in a Teeny Bikini,"" are all part of this series with much of the same core cast (a few actors differ from film to film).  When watched as a group of films together, with the core cast moving from one silly premise to another, you can see the great sense of humor of the cast that comes through time after time.",1188777600,6,2165,4.459390862944162

2128606,4,B0002W4U6G,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was pretty bad but it was still fun and very erotic! Unlike Surrender, they do not dub over the love making scenes with sound and you can actually hear the skin slap together and the ladies moan. There are two decent lesbian scenes (though they lack in comparison to the final scene in Femalien). The one where Genie is chained up had a lot of potential until the goofball male genie interupted their ""fun."" In fact if not for the male Genie, I would have given this sucker five stars!!!",1143763200,11,527,4.443298969072165
