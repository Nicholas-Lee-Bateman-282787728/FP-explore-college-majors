8164724,4,6303973205,"In terms of letting you see what the speaker was really like as a speaker, this is one of the very best Speeches Collection tapes.  If you're a student of rhetoric or public speaking, it's fascinating because Carter was  both a terrific and a terrible speaker simultaneously.  You certainly can  see how Ronald Reagan was able to clobber him.
Specifically, what you  can see in this is Carter's tight logic and clear reasoning (from premises  that he should have established, not assumed, as every rhetoric teacher  from Aristotle to Toulmin would have told him) and his dour, over-serious  delivery.  His case is often good, sometimes brilliant, but his failure to  connect to the audience, either in delivery or in establishing common  ground,  is a deep and constant problem.
Nice long uninterrupted cuts  from many speeches, most of it drawn from network feed, so you're looking  at what the country (or the crowd around Carter) saw, not at what the film  editor thought was sexy.  Speeches of historic importance, all  well-represented by clips long enough to permit some real study,  include  the Inaugural, the human rights address (at the ceremony marking the 30th  anniversary of the UDHR), the last part of the Panama Canal treaty speech,  the ""Energy Malaise"" speech (compare it with Reagan's inaugural  if you want to see why Carter wasn't re-elected), and the Farewell.  Possibly Carter's best speech, ever -- the speech given just before  departing to sign the Camp David Accords -- is represented in  full.
Several interesting oddities round out the tape; Carter liked to do  policy-wonking out in public, and there are some interesting  samples.
Excellent for study; the only reason I give it four stars is  that the speaker himself sets a bad example.  Study him to learn how to  construct a tight case -- and how NOT to present it!",952732800,7,1849,4.928338762214984
