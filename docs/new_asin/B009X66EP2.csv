She loved the animals and seeing them ""talk"" and I loved that it was a wholesome yet entertaining movie for her to enjoy. I'll check out the other ""Adventures of Bailey"" movies in the near future.",1369180800,3,292,4.232142857142857

After watching it with the whole family we found it to have a very sweet story line with animal and human actors to add to the fun.  The script has a lot of funny lines that make you chuckle.  The bad guys are actually quite charming.  Loved the different breeds of dogs and how they performed with each other and with their humans. ""Adventures of Bailey:  A Night in Cowtown"" will definitely be watched over and over.  I would highly recommend this movie to all ages.  Looking forward to the next one!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Bailey-A-Night-in-Cowtown/dp/B009X66EP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Bailey: A Night in Cowtown</a>",1369094400,3,769,5.752212389380531
