8282416,5,B001B9R610,"I found this DVD to be an excellent introduction to the basics of ground fighting.  It starts with reviewing  the basic positions that a ground fight can occur in and then moves on to teaching you several escapes and submissions from those positions.  Everything is backed up with clear and concise instructions, close ups, reviews, and tips.  The author even provides drills for you to practice what is being taught.  An excellent value for the amount of material presented.

If you're looking to understand what is involved in ground fighting, this DVD should be your first purchase.",1266710400,,585,4.979381443298969
8282417,3,B001B9R610,"THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, IT GOT HERE RIGHT AWAY. THIS DVD COVERS ONE MOUNT ESCAPE AND ONE GUARD PASS THE REST OF THE DVD IS MADE UP OF EXCELLENT TRAINNING DRILLS. THEY GO INTO THE SIDE POSITIONS AND SHOW ONE OR TWO TECHNIQUES. WISH I HAD READ THE EDITOR REVIEW BECAUSE THE DVD REALLY IS FOR NOVICE THAT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT GROUNDFIGHTING AND IS FIGHTING ANOTHER NEWBIE THAT IS THE SAME SIZE, WHO IS NOT REALLY WILLING TO FIGHT (I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAST REVIEWER WAS TALKING ABOUT). ALL THE HEADBUTTS, FISH HOOKS, BITES AND GROIN STRIKES THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A REAL GROUNDFIGHT ARE NOT HERE(PROBABLY BE ON ANOTHER DVD IN THE FUTURE)BUT IT DOES TALK ABOUT EYE GOUGES. YOU COULD GET A LOT MORE INFO IN LESS TIME WATCHING YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON ""GROUND SELF DEFENSE"" BUT YOU WON'T GET THE DRILLS (THIS IS WHAT IS MOST VALUEABLE & YOU WON'T FIND ON YOUTUBE). THE END DEMONSTATES MOUNT SUBMISSIONS THAT YOU WOULD LEARN YOUR FIRST DAY AT A UFC OR VALE TUDO STYLED SCHOOL/DOJO IN YOUR AREA. THE DVD IS SHORT AND I WISH THEY HAD INCLUDED SOME REAL FIGHT FOOTAGE TO SHOW THE TECHNIQUES APPLIED IN ACTION. IF YOU LOOKING TO DESTROY A GRAPPLER OR SKIP THE GROUNDFIGHT SO YOU CAN GET BACK UP QUICKLY CHECK OUT PAUL VUNAK'S DVD CALLED ""ENIGMA"" (SEE THE YOUTUBE PREVIEW).",1262217600,,1256,4.465217391304348
8282418,5,B001B9R610,"I had no idea that a majority of fights end up on the ground, and then its the survival of the strongest and heaviest... unless you know what this DVD has to offer!

Like all the other Contemporary Fighting Arts products, this DVD shows you what really happens in a groundfight, and how to counter or implement techniques that can save your life. I have referenced this DVD to friends and no one ever denies that these techniques are powerful and effective, even for a smaller guy (5' 6'', 135lbs) like myself.",1214265600,2,510,4.543478260869565
