8276989,2,B001AD6UJQ,"I remember full supporting programmes in cinemas. And have a great fondness for second feature films. Even some of those I cringed at at the time. Many can now be enjoyed. However there were also those little films that were skipped. Missed by arriving after they had played. Staying instead longer at home. Or calling into a cafe,coffee bar or pub.
This is such a film. With the below parr picture and sound quality. Do what I should have done. Pass.",1344297600,2,451,4.580246913580247
