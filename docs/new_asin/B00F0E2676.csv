5962159,5,B00F0E2676,"I attended the world theatrical premiere of ""Submariners"" it was a new perspective on a subject that has had many documentaries on the machine. ""Submariners"" focuses more on the men of the Silent Service with raw interviews of submarine veterans. There is a sprinkling of patriotism that I think reflects the attitudes of all veterans who sacrificed in one way or another. Many of those interviewed were members of Tennessee United States Submarine Veterans Inc (USSVI) chapters which increased my interest being a Tennessee resident. Captain Anderson who was featured in the segment about the USS Nautilus and what it went through in several attempts to sail under the North Pole was a Tennessee resident and served after the Navy as a US State Representative from 1965 to 1973. A little Chicken Soup for the submarine veterans soul.

5962160,2,B00F0E2676,"A very disappointing video. Besides the horrible, grating background music that plays over a lot of the dialog, the commentary by the group of ex-submariners is pretty awful. Plus, the set-up scenes are a joke in terms of faithfulness to how submarine operations actually happened. If this is the best video about cold war submarines, then I fear we've failed in documenting our history and experience. I had hoped to have my wife watch this video so she could gain some insight into what I experienced during six patrols on a boomer, SSBN-609(G) 1976-79. I'm not even going to show it to her. It's that bad.",1456617600,4,608,4.745283018867925
5962161,5,B00F0E2676,Have not finished it yet but I have enjoyed what I have seen.  I am a former submariner.,1437091200,5,88,3.888888888888889
5962162,5,B00F0E2676,"This submarine documentary is without a doubt, the best I have ever seen.  The production quality, the interviews, the way it was all put together is excellent.  From the point of view of the submariners themselves, there are some incredible stories along with the documentary itself.  I hope Tony has plans for doing more of these, he did an incredible job on this.  If you don't have your copy, you need to get one today.  It should be part of every submariners video library, every author who is thinking about writing a book on submarines, and especially for submarine researchers out there.",1379116800,2,595,4.794117647058823
5962163,5,B00F0E2676,"This 4.5 hr, 2-DVD set is well worth twice the price ! Mr Rollo has done a superb job of capturing not only the history and culture of the submarine service, but also in presenting the human touch through interviews of submariners who served. Both adults and children will be drawn into this expertly-told story, and leave with a greater understanding of the world of the Silent Service.
Makes a great gift, too.

8611068,3,B00F0E2676,"This Documentary brought back a lot of memories..I served on a Diesel Electric Boat Submarine (the Razorback SS394) which was commissioned in 1944 and mentioned in this film.  I joined the Submarine Oct 1960 after graduating from Sub School in New London, CN. I qualified (received my Dolphins) on the Razorback April of 1961. I believe any viewer would find this film informative and well worth the purchase price.
On another Note: The Razorback is now moored in North Little Rock, AK on the Arkansas River and serves as a maritime museum. Please go visit this fine Lady, she is in excellent shape and everything is original and in working order. You could even make arrangements to do a sleep over on the boat. If you would like to see and hear her do an engine start..the video is posted on Utube.

8611069,5,B00F0E2676,"I served and qualified on a diesel boat in the 1960s.  Most popular books and movies about submarines are pure BS because the real stories cannot be told.
This excellent documentary takes the general audience about as far as they can go without the smell, and that (along with The Submarine Cheer) is an acquired taste most sand crabs, skimmers and airedales would find unbearable.",1464220800,,381,4.861538461538461

8611071,5,B00F0E2676,This is a documentary about the men and the submarines they served on.  It shows the different submarines from the early diesel subs to the nuclear subs.  A lot of interviews with men that actually served on them along with short videos from different submarines.,1458000000,,263,4.822222222222222

8611073,4,B00F0E2676,"I had the pleasure of attending this film's premiere in Murfreesboro, TN. I found it to be an interesting look at the commitment that these men had to their country. I enjoyed seeing the footage and knowing it was the ""real deal"".  I hope people will take time to view this film as it offers a glimpse of the ""Silent Service"".  Havin actual submariners speak about their experiences added to the authenticity of the film. As a former teacher, think it would be an excellent tool to use in the classroom.",1456876800,,503,4.516483516483516
8611074,5,B00F0E2676,"My husband and I went to see this documentary.  It was wonderfully wrote, with many interesting and informative stories from those who served.  For anyone interested in the history and mystery of the secret service of Submariners, this is a great movie to see.",1456876800,2,260,4.886363636363637
8611075,5,B00F0E2676,"Saw this outstanding documentary on the Submariners and not only learned about their lives but I now have a new respect for the men who man these subs.  Not only the isolation they feel but being away from their families with no contact has to be rough.  These men learn to depend on each other and are responsible for the protection of our country in ways we will never know about.  If you ever wondered about the lives of the submariners, you must see this film",1456790400,3,463,4.3604651162790695
8611076,5,B00F0E2676,"Saw this in a theater and really enjoyed it.  I've always been impressed with the Silent Service and this documentary highlighted the skill, bravery, and dedication of this elite branch of the Navy.  One of the things that really struck me was the fact that one mistake could cost the lives of everyone on board...these crews had to be perfect in everything they did.  That perfection came through endless practice.  What a great message to give to all of us in anything we attempt.  Humbled that we have such incredible people serving our country in such an unheralded way.",1456790400,5,574,4.757575757575758
8611077,5,B00F0E2676,The men of the silent service was a very noteworthy statement. Not knowing anything about  submarines I really enjoyed the movie and how it showed the relationship the crew has with a each other. Also submarine  history from diesel to nuclear was very interesting.,1456790400,3,264,4.9772727272727275
