5079127,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Yanni is one of the truly musical wonders, bringing us such a beautiful music, live from El Morro's Castle at San Juan, Puerto Rico. All the music/songs are amazing, especially the new ones from his new album ""Touch of Truth"". Like always Yanni brings us a magical concert at exotic environments like the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Only thing i missed was not listening to ""Santorini""'s opener which was performed live at the concert, but excluded from the DVD. Santorini is Yanni's trademark, no matter if it is an old song, it was part of the concert, don't know why it was cut from the final product, but that doesn't take away from the excellent musical performance Yanni has accustomed us to deliver. A must!!",1334793600,3,720,4.722222222222222
5079128,5,B007DIZQQ0,"International concert and artist Yanni and his orchestra demonstrate once again they are a leading team of the best musicians worldwide who are prepared to light up the night sky and take the world by storm. In the case of Yanni and the orchestra's recent live concert event at the historic El Morro fortress in Puerto Rico, the saying ""take the world by storm"" holds two meanings. The Oceanside concert venue of Castillo San Felipe del Morro citadel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, presented a challenge for the team by the inclement weather, typical for the historic El Morro coastal locality. It looked as if a miracle was the only hope for the final evening concert scheduled for Saturday night. As it turned out, a windswept atmosphere became a dramatic, silver lining for the ultimate Yanni concert experience.

Yanni-Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico turned out to be an intensely glorious concert event for fans of the international concert artist Yanni, and his sensational orchestra, who are unquestionably, a quality group of the best artists worldwide. If you have ever had an opportunity to attend a live Yanni concert firsthand, or have watched a televised live PBS concert, then you know each and every concert performance is special, regardless of the venue or historical significance. For over 30 years, Yanni has made his presence known as a leading international concert artist with around one billion admirers. A single concert event, Yanni Live at the Acropolis is the top fundraising program for PBS, which had an astounding 500 million television viewers from 65 countries. The Taj Mahal in India and The Forbidden City in China concert are more examples where PBS viewership reached a television audience of 250 million people.

One might consider Yanni a professional music entertainer, which is true, but only half of the story. There is intensity about Yanni that is profound. One can sense his genuine love of music, and the passion in which he brings inspiration to an audience every time. There is no doubt Yanni and his orchestra love to provide the concert of a lifetime for an audience, regardless of the concert location, or a venue's historical significance.

Solos by the best artists worldwide are a central attraction during the Yanni-Live at El Morro concert, and every concert performance. It is hard to find the right words to express the quality with each vocalist, and the orchestra. Using adjectives like sensational and spectacular only partly define the superior excellence of the entire orchestra. Every member in Yanni's world-class orchestra give a performance that can only be described as stunning!

Yanni-Live at El Morro concert opens with two songs from Yanni's newest album, Truth Of Touch (title song), then a boldly intense song from Truth Of Touch called Vertigo, with duel improvisational solos by Yanni and keyboardist Ming Freeman. Next song on the concert set list is The End Of August, a fan favorite piano and violin piece featuring Samvel Yervinyan and complete orchestral back up. The beautiful violin solo by Samvel Yervinyan is deeply moving, like the touching song that seems to hold new meaning, The Rain Must Fall. Yanni's wonderful piano performance precedes a dynamic bass guitar solo by Gabriel Vivas, and breathtaking violin solo by Mary Simpson.

Felitsa is the song Yanni composed, and dedicated to his Mother Felitsa Chryssomallis. By design in composition, Felitsa is a poignant song with verses of piano and violin duet backed by full orchestra. It is a wonderful arrangement many recognize within the first few notes. The bold refrains of Voyage mark the return of another song from Truth Of Touch, which has stayed in the Top 10 Billboard Chart since released in 2011. Composed for the Hidden City concert in China, vocalist Lauren Jelencovich gives a stunning performance in Nightingale, in time with impromptu solos from orchestra members. Backed by keyboardist Ming Freeman, along with percussionists Yoel Del Sol and Charles Adams, harpist Victor Espinola gives the instrument with origins dating back to 500 BC, a contemporary makeover by his fiery playing technique during Harp Solo.

Vocalists Lisa Lavie and Lauren Jelencovich amaze the audience with their duet and solo talents in Ode to Humanity, and during up-tempo, contemporary song Niki Nana, featuring brass specialists Dana Teboe on trombone and Jason Carder on trumpet. After a standing ovation, Yanni addresses the audience with a heartfelt narrative of the ongoing challenges facing humanity prior to the concluding, full orchestral song, One Man's Dream.

It's clear the Yanni team demonstrate once again they are prepared to ""take the world by storm"" and be victorious. Leave the firework display up to concert attendees who enthusiastically brightened up the nighttime sky by showing their admiration for music celebrity Yanni, and his select team of music professionals. The extraordinary live concert show at El Morro that almost never was to exist is soon to be available on CD and DVD for 2012.  Review from NewAgeMusicWorld.com.",1334275200,40,5077,5.1454545454545455

Very relaxing and full of entertainment.

Yanni ALWAYS delivers his best to his fans ans is one of the most generous entertainers to his fans!  His music has no boundaries; no language barriers, which is why he and his music is accepted around the world.

In an front row and in my own country. An inexplicable journey to a realm of peace and music. Is a great feeling to have this piece on my collection. Yes it was raining but no one left the premises of El Morro.

5079173,2,B007DIZQQ0,I really like Yanni's music however this is short only about an hour perhaps it is weather related.  Poor overall quality music reproduction.  It does not have a high def soundtrack or uncompressed stereo soundtrack which is really standard  for a blu-ray concert title.  It does not make much sense releasing this as a blu-ray title.  I liked the music 4 stars as a dvd with a typical dolby digital and digital stereo soundtrack.,1428364800,,430,4.756756756756757

I look forward to watching this DVD many more times in the near future.,1395964800,,284,4.549019607843137
5079226,5,B007DIZQQ0,"This is a Great Concert.  Having been to PR several times, was great venue for a concert.  Love his music.  Have most of his albums.  This my second concert tape of his",1395619200,,168,4.15625
5079227,5,B007DIZQQ0,Yanni is a splendid composer. He tries to impress with every new piece that he compose. His grace and charm are contagious,1394150400,,122,4.590909090909091
5079228,3,B007DIZQQ0,"I don't need to say much more than the above.

His two previous live productions were almost impossible to beat.
This one was just mediocre.",1392768000,3,140,4.6
5079229,4,B007DIZQQ0,Liked it but it is not as good at the Mandalay bay concert.  Mandalay Bay is much more upbeat .,1392681600,,95,3.75
5079230,4,B007DIZQQ0,I never like all the songs on any CD or DVD I buy and this was no exception. I like the songs featuring Yanni on the piano accompanied by violins and cellos. There were 4 of these songs on this DVD and they were all superb which made it well worth the purchase.,1391299200,,261,3.943396226415094
5079231,1,B007DIZQQ0,I received a defective CD as well as a second CD which was also defective.  I don't want to try a third.,1389052800,,104,3.727272727272727

5079235,3,B007DIZQQ0,"The DVD just ended in the middle of a song. The quality was not all that good. I have all of Yanni's DVD's, and was very disappointed in the quality of this one. I thought something was wrong with my DVD player because the disk just stopped. Tried it again and it was the same thing.",1379376000,,283,4.071428571428571
5079236,5,B007DIZQQ0,Uplifting and engaging. The setting was marvelous and the music even better. I would recommend this to Yanni lovers everywhere.,1378944000,2,127,5.4
5079237,3,B007DIZQQ0,"You will find the music in the concert good if you're a Yanni fan. I found this concert too sober, lacking oomph. The number of musicians seemed inadequate compared to the 'Yanni Live -The Concert Event', which was outstanding. Also, I wish he spoke little bit about the history of El Morro (which is a World Heritage Site) and the significance of holding his concert there. The bluray quality was great. Bottomline - buy this bluray on sale only",1376956800,3,446,4.658227848101266
5079238,5,B007DIZQQ0,"What can I say?  He is one of my perennial favorites.  The numbers on this album have all been done before, but, he is able to put a fresh spin on them and make them sound new.  I did love this album.",1376092800,,200,3.7142857142857144

5079240,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Finally, someone who isn't bound by the strictures of the so-called 'music industry'.  He composes the stuff he wants, records it and sells it.

To a LOT of people!  He must be doing something right.",1375488000,,199,4.628571428571429

5079244,5,B007DIZQQ0,"The music on this dvd is beautiful.  The dvd is absolutely breathtaking.  If you get this dvd then you must get the cd (Yanni-Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico) so you listen to his music anywhere.

If you love Yanni's music, you'll love this dvd!",1371081600,,243,4.355555555555555
5079245,5,B007DIZQQ0,I have been a Yanni fan since 1995 and I think this concert is the best I have seen since live at Acropolis in 1994. You can witness some of the best musicians in the world doing larger than life things like Mary Simpson's solo in Rain must fall.. A must watch for any Yanni fan,1371081600,,278,3.982142857142857
5079246,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Another live music video at historical sites follow up some of Yanni's previous works: The Acroplis (Greece); The Forbidden City (China) and The Taj Mahal (India) on the ""Tribute"" video.
All are excellent.

Everyone needs to hook up their DVD / BluRay to their stereo to fully enjoy these type works (or use a ""Home Entertainment Center"").  It's easy and well worth it.  Makes going to the movies mostly obsolete, and music videos are not generally available through this venue anyway.",1371081600,,485,4.962962962962963
5079247,5,B007DIZQQ0,"This is great Yanni and different too. I missed Pedro Eustache, but the brass section did well at playing is part. This is a super clear and clean recording on blu-ray, much more so than Yanni Live the concert event.  It was still Yanni at his best with a new twist to the music. I had to watch it twice to fully appricate the greatness of this concert.

I highly recommend this Concert.",1368921600,,387,4.287671232876712
5079248,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Another Yanni hit.  Though we felt some of the music was done with a little more body motions than was needed, the music over rode it.  The harp player is awesome.",1368489600,,163,4.225806451612903
5079249,5,B007DIZQQ0,"I love Yanni his music is very soothing to the soul , I only wish the add had been clearer because I can't play it anywhere except my TV or portable player.",1368057600,,156,3.90625

5079253,5,B007DIZQQ0,"I bought it because the concert was in ""El Morro"". I don't followed Yanni's music but the concert is great and the view even better. A bought the blu ray version and the visuals and sound is perfect. I recommended it for people who are Yanni's fans or like me who are from Puerto Rico and want to see El Morro at his best.",1365638400,,322,4.046875
5079254,3,B007DIZQQ0,"I am a huge fan of Yanni, but as a matter of fact he is Greek, unfortunately he does not choose Europe for his concerts...
As far as his releases I guess sound quality would be better.
If let's say Sony Entertainment had released this Blu-ray, it won't have 448 Kbps Dolby Digital audio only.
It would be at least 640 or Dolby True-HD even DTS HD-Master audio...
18.5 Gig of data only in a Blu-ray... peace of cake for the rippers and copiers...
I want MORE SOUND quality from Yanni. After all he is the expert of this field...",1364601600,3,527,4.28
5079255,3,B007DIZQQ0,I guess I was a little disappointed with this video after watching the one from Las Vegas he did in 2006 at Mandalay Bay Resort. I enjoyed it though especially the two women vocalists.,1364428800,,184,4.4411764705882355
5079256,3,B007DIZQQ0,"On the positive, the picture and sound quality are excellent.  However, this concert does not feature any unique instruments, or the occasional house-rocking selections that are usually found in his concerts.  Overall, this  concert takes on a mellower easy listening theme.  It's good, but more subdued compared to his Acropolis, India/China, and Las Vegas concerts. It's not quite what I expected - the softer side of Yanni for sure.",1363824000,,435,5.260869565217392
5079257,4,B007DIZQQ0,Having been to El Morro I could imagine exactly what the concert would be like--amazing to say the least.  The music was very appropriate and moving.  My only dislike was that it seemed shorter than other CD concerts of his that I have bought.,1363737600,,243,4.5
5079258,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Yanni has been one of my favorite musicians since I ran across him many years ago. I started watching when it first came out on laserdisc. I wish I could see and hear his music in person, but someday I'll attend his concert. This Blueray is awesome to watch over and over. I even had the DVD version and that too was enjoyable to watch. I'm glad this came out on Blueray and I look forward to seeing more of his concerts debut on Blueray discs.",1363651200,,444,4.174418604651163

5079262,2,B007DIZQQ0,"The quality of the picture was not there, and is missing some songs from the list on the DVD.
I understand that Yanni and the musicians had to deal with the bad weather in Puerto Rico, but this concert shouldn't have been produced and sold.",1360972800,,240,4.355555555555555
5079263,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Loved it just as much as his first blue ray ..Yanni

5079268,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Great Concert!  Yanni keeps reinventing himself with beautiful music, great performers and incredibly beautiful sceneries. Super Concert night with quality, emotion, and joy!  Though he repeats songs from other concerts he has different performers that do a great job. And El Morro in San Juan Puerto Rico is a great stage, full of history and beauty.",1358294400,,351,5.25
5079269,5,B007DIZQQ0,I love the man and his music. I wish it were more than an hour. Yanni has gotten older but who hasn't but he still makes magic with his music.,1358035200,2,142,3.7666666666666666

5079271,4,B007DIZQQ0,"I love this DVD, but I dislike nightingale. The reason is the nightingale must be accompanied by Chinese flute or flute. If no flute in nightingale is just like no violin or cello in orchestra.",1357084800,,193,4.542857142857143
5079272,5,B007DIZQQ0,Yanni is simply a master not only as a musician but as a writer and a magnet for insanely talented musicians.  His enthusiasm and soulfulness of his music is incredible.  I really enjoy his concert DVD and would like to see a show should he come round my way.,1356912000,4,259,4.26530612244898

5079286,5,B007DIZQQ0,"While not as good as his Acropolis dvd (still my favorite), this one is made up of beautiful music in a beautiful location.  You couldn't ask for anything more.  Yanni's new songs are wonderful, and the artist singing Nightingale is superb.  Almost makes you cry.  I also ordered his new cd and am very pleased with all his new collaborations.  For awhile there, he seemed to getting off the track but he's back!  I can highly recommend this dvd and his new cd too.",1350777600,,465,4.476190476190476

5079288,5,B007DIZQQ0,Amazon Service & Delivery ... Great! Product ... Original! Personal view on Yanni at El Morro ... Yet another twist to his creative presentations. This is more relaxed and cruisey but so good. What a trip this guy has been on. Newly found by me but four concert DVDs I now own. El Morro at the price was a steal!,1348876800,,312,4.216666666666667
5079289,4,B007DIZQQ0,"Having just seen Yanni live at the Santa Barbara bowl in July 2012, I was eager to see how the recent El Morro DVD compared (December 2011). The selections were mostly the same. But even so, my wife and I enjoyed this DVD immensely, much more so than either the Tribute (Taj Mahal) or Acropolis DVDs. They are much older with standard 4:3 picture and sound to match. This one is 16:9 with good quality video and very good sound (see below), especially considering the outside weather conditions.

The audio mix is as good as any I have heard before, even the LIVE blu-ray.  But isn't that sound a little TOO good? It sounded pretty 'studio' to me. The rarity of shots of musicians finger action on their instruments combined with the out-of-sync A-V shots that WERE visible makes the sound mix rather suspect.  The clincher is the vocal chorus(!) on Ode to Humanity; was that the audience singing along?? I don't think so.  Taped? Overdubbed? Punch-ins?  I hope not, but I don't have any other explaination that fits.

Since Amazon didn't grace us with a listing of the selections on the disc, here it is: Truth of Touch, Vertigo, The End of August, The Rain Must Fall, Felitsa, Voyage, Nightengale, ""Harp Solo"", Ode to Humanity, Niki Nana, and One Man's Dream. Yup, only 11 selection, probably due to the poor weather and the resulting one interrupted performance to take the recordings from.

I wish that Yanni would draw from his many, many past compositions and produce concert disks with only ""not on concert disc before"" selections.  Although this one has less repeats than usual, there are still a few that are already on previous concert discs.

The Puerto Rico ""special"" (travel promo) by Yanni really isn't too bad (it's short at least, and heartfelt). He's been coming there for leisure for 25 years!? There are just too many glamour shots of El Morro and golf courses, and not enough of the island's other attractions.  Not his fault however, but perhaps he'll want to review the next promo he takes part in.

These are all minor quibbles however.  This DVD is highly recommended over all other Yanni DVDs except the blu-ray version of Yanni-Live (Las Vegas).",1348012800,2,2171,4.74468085106383

They actually love to play along with their imaginary instruments, they are 3, 5, and 11. Its amazing to see how my kids appreciation for good music has increased after discovering Yanni for the first time, and this concert at ""El Morro"" is the best ever in our Yanni DVD collection. So natural, so encouraging. Thank You Yanni for being such an example for our youth. My kid's dream though is to meet Yanni in person and play  Felitsa with him, so they just starting learning violin.",1346716800,,578,4.5576923076923075

5079293,4,B007DIZQQ0,"Excellent DVD. And thanks Yanni for pricing it so fair- I've given away four of these as they are affordable. When Yanni gushes about Puerto Rico, basically what he says I agree with. Truly a special place to visit. USA, you know so little of PR, and like Hawaii, a special place and culture. The concert was filmed very well. Sound is great. Definetly worth viewing MANY times. I'll give more of these away!",1344816000,,408,4.527027027027027

5079295,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Yanni has performed at historical sites of great significance: the Acropolis of Athens, the Taj Mahal, and the Forbidden City.  This time was in an unlikely place:  El Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. There, informally dressed musicians faced a mostly formally dressed audience. No matter, it was love at first sound. With his usual dynamism, mastering of the e-keyboards, and contagious smile, Yanni easily conquered the audience. It was more than just flirtation. It was open seduction; and the audience participated earnestly.  The audience reacted enthusiastically to his every move, on hearing the first notes of favorite Yanni melodies, and the skills of instrumentalists that brought their instruments to their highest point performance. The ""Niki Nana"" by the two gorgeous vocalists was the crown of the concert; it brought the fortress down. The DVD covers only eleven numbers, compared to ""Yanni Live at the Acropolis"" with fourteen. No matter, it is worth the price. In sum, it was a charming show.

5079300,5,B007DIZQQ0,"Even though there were songs that were also in other concerts, we enjoyed them all over again in this one.  Yanni had a terrible time getting the DVD made since it rained for two days cancelling parts of the concert.  By the thrid day they were able to finish the recording process before a live audiance.  Having struggled with the weather the performers were determined to turn out a great concert and it shows in their enthusiasm and the quality of their performances.  I highly recommend this DVD to all that love Yanni's music.",1335830400,2,532,4.627659574468085
