2467816,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Yes, it's full of crude and sophomoric humor. But that didn't stop me (and everyone else in the theater) from laughing out loud at several scenes. It's not high-brow and it doesn't pretend to be. See it if you need some cheering up and aren't easily offended.",1131062400,2,259,4.531914893617022
2467817,3,B000CPH9Q6,"Waiting is just one more in a series of crude comedies this year meant to gross us out, push the envelope of disgusting sex humor, and prove that Hollywood can't imagine anything original anymore.  These movies include Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo, The Bad News Bears, The Forty-Year Old Virgin, and The Wedding Crashers, though the latter was somewhat original and less offensive.  It's about the young staff of a restaurant and their pranks, shenanigans, and misadventures on the job.

As a comedy, it's about average, but the vast majority of the humor either depends on sophomoric sex gags or juvenile earthy gags.  At least it made me laugh at a few of them, and if you like that sort of gross humor, you'll probably laugh a lot.  Plus one character has a funny speech at the end that's not so typical.",1130457600,,809,4.709219858156028
2467818,3,B000CPH9Q6,"I had a very mixed reaction towards this movie. Some parts grew very boring and some parts were very funny.

The boring parts dealt with, well, the characters!! Each character has their own characteristics and flaws and I just thought most of them weren't that interesting. Some characters in the film have funny traits like one guy who works at the restaurant (Shannigans) can't urinate in a public restroom b/c of his shy bladder. All the characters just mope around complaining about personal problems.

One character (Justin Long from Dodgeball) is sick of working at the restaurant and wants a successful life and the two main characters (Ryan Reynolds and Anna Farris) just argue about their past relationship in how Ryan's character, Monty, just wants to sleep with high school girls. This all gets really repetitive and uninteresting.

But don't worry!!! This movie has its hilarious moments. On the lighter side of the humor is Ryan Reynolds. This guy has a natural comedic talent. He has quick, sarcastic one-liners that put a smile to your face. Ryan is really funny in small doses. Dane Cook is the highlight of the movie has one of the chefs in the kitchen. His psychotic, loud style of humor is just what this comedy needs to kick it up a notch.

I must warn you! This movie has some very gross moments. From male/female genatialia to messing around with customer's food, it can be a little too much for some. If you like gross-out humor, this will surely satisfy your appetite.",1128988800,,1492,4.793774319066148
2467819,5,B000CPH9Q6,"I've been looking forward to this movie for quite a while now. I was a waiter for a year and a half at a small pizzareia in New Jersey, and although I left almost two months ago, I still have the battle scars and war stories. So, tonight, me and my friend (who is a cook at a restaurant, but not the same one) went to see it, loving comedy, and both being restaurant vets. Man, are we glad we did! ""Waiting..."" delivers!

As you've probably guessed (or found out) by now, the movie revolves around the day in the life of a group of employees at Shenanigan's Restaurant (similar to a TGI Friday's/Ruby Tuesday/Applebee's/etc.). It mostly deals with the waiters, including Monty, the more popular one, Mitch, the clueless trainee (who is hilarious in the end - not giving it away but watch!), Serena, the sassy waitress, Naomi, the irate one, et cetera. This movie also features Dane Cook, Luis Guzman, Dave Koechner, et cetera, playing great, hilarious roles.

Not only is the movie very funny and well-written, but it has so many truths about the restaurant world. Think that incredibly rude lady complaining about the steak in the trailer (you have to see the whole scene in the movie to get the full effect, heh) is over the top? Heh, no, sadly, not really. Now do you see what waiters/waitresses have to put up with? Other truthful parts in the movie is Justin Long confronting a cheapskate hillbilly after getting a crappy tip (wish I would've had the guts to do that back then), and oh man, I can sympathize with the cooks in the movie when the idiot comes in two minutes before closing. (I always had the same reaction too, haha)

Also worth noting is Dave Koechner's character Dan, as the bumbling doofus manager type. Man, that part was played to a T! He reminds me so much of this [jerk] manager I used to have when I worked at A&P a couple of years ago.

In closing, ""Waiting..."" is everything it's cracked up to be and more. If you are or ever were a waiter/waitress, DEFINITELY see this. If not, see it anyway so you get an idea of what they all put up with. Maybe now you'll think twice before deciding to get uppity and send your steak back [evil grin].",1128816000,4,2167,4.45088161209068
2467820,5,B000CPH9Q6,this is the funniest movie i think ive ever seen in my entire life,1128729600,5,66,3.7857142857142856
2467821,5,B000CPH9Q6,"I'm sure anyone out there who is reading this has had a job they absolutely hated. We all have, and ""Waiting"" is just the film to represent our frustration with our everyday lives in boring and dead end jobs. The movie has more than enough laughs to offer, as well as a few crude moments, and a great cast, which features the likes of Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder), Anna Farris (Scary Movie) and Justin Long (Dodgeball), to support the overall story line.

""Waiting"" is centered around a group of employees who work at a Shenanigans restaurant. You have Monty, the ladies man with a twisted sense of humor, Dean an employee who's not sure of what he should do with his life, Serena a sexy waitress with an attitude, Naomi, a schitzophrantic waitress, Calvin the whipped lover, and Mitch the new guy, as well as a slew of other well liked comedic personalities such as Dane Cook and Andy Milanokis. Mitch is the newest employee at Shenanigans, and it's Monty's job to get his accustomed to the workplace. Mitch quickly learns what Shennagins is really about; girls, the (...)game, and doing rather absurd things to the customers food. The main character of the movie Dean, is feeling trapped by working at Shennanigans and feels he should be doing more with his life after learning from his Mom that his highschool classmate Chet has just graduated college with his bachelor's degree (and they were in all the same classes in high school). To make matters more difficult Dean has been offered a job as assistant manager and has to give his answer by the end of his shift. The movie follows the cast in a typical day of work, and hilarity ensues. The entire cast is absolutely hilarious, whether they're dropping a customers food on the floor and playing the five second rule, or having sex in a bathroom stall. There's really nothing this movie doesn't touch as far as disgusting humor goes, so if you're easily offended, this is not the movie for you. However if you're a fan of obscene comedies with great jokes and a likeable cast, then ""Waiting"" will probably be one of the funniest movies you see this year.

I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who likes to laugh at a movie. Once again you can't take this one too seriously. If you do, you're missing the real fun and beauty behind it. So check this movie out, it's definitely worth the $6.50, or however much movie tickets cost these days, and you'll be more than entertained by the laughs. Mitch's ""explosion"" speech at the end of the movie is reason enough to check this one out. What are you ""Waiting"" for?",1128729600,5,2569,4.619256017505471
2467822,5,B000CPH9Q6,"The movie is about a bunch of employees at a restaurant and the goings on at the restaurant that they work at. Ok, i'll admit that there really isn't a plot. There really is no beginning, middle, and end. Not really. Its just a day in the life of a waiter.

Suprisingly though, I absolutely love this movie. I think it is the funniest thing that i have seen in such a long time. I did like both The Wedding Crashers and The 40 Year Old Virgin, but i'm sorry to say this movie is funnier.

Yes, a lot of the characters a type based, but they are almost all entertaining characters at that. Sorry, to say though, there are two unlikable characters one played by that MTV guy Andy something and his co-busboy. They are plainly just not very funny at all. Luckily, they are rarely in the movie at all. Besides them, the other characters are great. There is the sexpot, the smartass, the philosophical guy, the pervert (ok, in this movie, perverts), the jackass boss, the struggling guy, etc. And all of the characters are pretty well done (except for the previously mentioned. All of the characters have at least one specific quirk about them my personal favorite being a dominatrixy waitress who will make you leave the theater with a really interesting image.

This movie is NOT for everyone though. The theater that i saw it in had a little girl in it about 8 years old. I thought that was a crappy thing to do on the parents part because this movie has a lot of sexual, crude jokes. Funny ones at that, but not one for kids. Also, people who don't like raunch will not enjoy it either. But yeah, this movie is hilarious and i highly recommend it.",1128729600,7,1646,4.390163934426229
2467823,4,B000CPH9Q6,"I found many similarities between the characters in the film and the people I work with. Everyone has a person who thinks they know it all, a smart-ass, a cursing-machine, a so-called ladies-man, the flirt, etc. We have many instances with irritations on the job. We've met customers who you hate, love, mean, friendly, and always wanted to say something to them, but risked losing their jobs. Sometimes a job is all you have.

Many critics call this an immature, gross-out snore, but I call it a hilarious, gross-out reality. Maybe some of the things don't happen in the restaurant, but we will think twice before insulting or harassing the waiter.

Waiting has a cast of young comedians who know how to have fun. Ryan Reynolds plays his usual Van Wilder style sacastic character, Anna Faris is the girl looking to help, fans of Dan Cook will love him as the cook. The rest of the cast represent parts of the ""Office Space"" characters. The movie definitely has its gross-out moments, but the dialogue is hilarious.

If you liked films like Van Wilder, Office Space, and American Pie, you will love this film. This will become a cult classic next to Dazed and Confused. This is a movie to watch with your friends as there are many one-liners. ""Welcome to Thunderdome, b****!""",1128643200,,1275,4.7342342342342345

2467838,2,B000CPH9Q6,"What a waste of a great cast!  I rented this not expecting much, but this really disappointed.  I like ""dumb"" humor, and don't mind tasteless humor, but it needs to be, well, humorous.  Not to my taste at all.  Anna Ferris barely appears, Ryan Reynolds is wasted, Dane Cook seemed to have fewer than a dozen lines, Wendy Malik is in one short scene, Justin Long is engaging as ever but even he can't make this part much more than his staple ""I'm-a-Mac"" character, and John Francis Daley does what he can by playing a younger, dumber version of his character on ""Bones.""  These are all credible and talented actors, and they do what they can with the dismal material in this movie.  Maybe if I'd ever worked in a restaurant I'd find this funnier, or at least funny.

The extras included with the film far exceed expectations (which were sort of low). And the commentary version is pretty decent.

Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. I will admit, my rating (4 stars) is probably inflated, but I really feel it's more than a 3 star film.

Bottom line: it's not for everyone. This definitely caters to a specific group (those who have worked in food service industries will especially relate to the topics and humor of this). So, be advised. If you have any doubts, you should at least check out some references online (I myself prefer wikipedia).

2468138,2,B000CPH9Q6,"It's amazing to me to find movies that really have no story. Flicks that have such miniscule amounts of plot that you wonder why they exist. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (still had charm); ""The Strangers"" (all-around terrible); and this piece of garbage. Any of the following spoilers belong to such an absent 'story' that they hardly qualify as spoilers.

So, it's a main problem here: this just ends with no type of resolution. Mitch (John Francis Daley), the trainee, becomes accepted at the end...so that's SOMETHING, but as for the main person in the 'plot', Dean (Justin Long) doesn't take the assistant-manager job. Instead, after thinking of Bishop (Chi McBride)'s advice to create his 'own penis-showing game', quits waiting tables at SHENANIGANZ and merely reveals to his buddy Calvin (Ryan Reynolds) that he doesn't know what he's going to do now. They just go back to the party and that's all.

A large part of this mess deals with 'The Game' and how all of the supposed non-gay waiters/food-preparers take part in exposing their genitals to an unsuspecting employee. Depending on how they show the package, you get to kick the other person in the arse a certain amount of times. True, I did find this funny in the explanation by Raddimus (Luis Guzman) to trainee Mitch, but then the game was used too-often and wasn't humourous.

The 'ladies'? Well, I couldn't stand the foul mouthed one who's real-name I don't remember or care to know of. At least 20-something Calvin had a moment of so-called maturity by not diddling the 17yo and chosing to wait until she was 18 in a week...but that's not enough to rate this movie more than two stars.

Direct to DVD sequel? Afraid so. Who was really waiting for that? Many years ago, I did see it for some reason and I don't remember a single thing from it. I do recall that it had nothing to do with this and was a waste.

There were very-few positives here.

- Mitch was cool and the movie would have had less-appeal to me if it wasn't for him; his expressions were giving me the most-laughs

- Raddimus' voice was neat

- the gross 'special care' in preparing the food of the jerk woman-customer was still a bit funny

- the pair of white gangsta-wannabes who loved cursing and getting high from various drugs
like it was their job ---- oops....my mistake: nothing positive about them & they are equally annoying as the foul-mouthed 'lady'

So, I unfortunately watched this flick recently for the second time. How do I feel after giving it another try? As ""Dean"" said when starring alongside Bruce Willis ""Live Free Or Die Hard"": 'What sucked then still sucks now.' and 'It's like having a pinecone shoved up my arse.' Now that I think of it, at least Calvin would have probably liked that since he spoke of sticking his finger there at a time when he felt 'squirrely'.",1437782400,,2816,4.670707070707071

Yes, the jokes are repetitive and sophomoric. That's the entire point! The life of a server in a casual American restaurant is repetitive and sophomoric. You go in day after day and deal with the same moronic customers who don't tip. The managers are all barely functional losers who couldn't cut it in a real job.

I'd give it 4 stars for the movie. I'd give it 1 star for the disc. The movie was very pixilated in the beginning, had to stop it because we couldn't even watch it so who knows if the pixels continued throughout the movie. It is full screen despite what the description says. And, someone placed a tape along the binder saying it was wide screen which again, it was not.  I feel as if I was sold a pirated movie.

This is that stop people in the front of the house make while they are deciding what they want to be when they grow up.  When it comes down to it, it's also the story of the BOH'ers if what they would want to be IF they grew up.

As one who has spent more years than many in the BOH in both indies and chains, I vouch for the silliness, stupidity, and, occasionally, the deep insightful people this world of late nights, early mornings and never ending adolescent pranks.  Waiting does a great job of explaining something to those who think there's nothing to the job.",1418428800,,716,4.32089552238806

I have a close friend who is a master chef & we've watched this movie together & he assures me this movie is ""dead-on"" to what working in the food industry is like.  Although humorous it gives you somewhat a sense of appreciation to the grunt work the service industry is.  Overworked & underpaid & rarely appreciated.  Service with a smile, no matter how bad a day you're having.  A comedic look at it all, but sometimes you just may want to be a little nicer to the one serving your food.  They may not get it right every time, but they are trying.  You have a right to complain, but there's a right way of doing it w/out coming off like a jerk.  It may be a matter of having your food spit on, or worse!  Also in this economy, just because someones waiting tables, doesn't necessarily mean they don't have bigger dreams too.",1382054400,2,900,4.309523809523809

It has a lot of great comedic actors (or just comedians) that were early in their careers (Ryan Reynolds, Dane Cook, Justin Long, Ana Ferris) and if you ever worked in a restaurant this movie will really speak to you.  However my issue with product is weird.  I would like to note that this is the ""Unrated and Raw"" version of the movie.  That being said, at the end of the movie during the rolling credits, Andy Milinokis' (no idea how to spell his name) character, who is a thugged out white kid, raps and it is actually a good song but very vulgar.  Yet ""some"" of the curse words are dubbed over with silence.  Again I said ""some"" meaning that the entire song is not censored just some of the curse words and some points.  I just found it really weird considering this is ""Unrated and Raw"" and yet their is cursing still throughout the movie and even during the song at the end.  It just really ruined the credit rolling scene since it is just randomly silent througout.",1378944000,,1066,4.348484848484849

After viewing the video and getting tired from laughing so much I can say, YES! IT'S ALL TRUE! IT IS REALLY LIKE THAT!. Speaking as a former professional server, I'm sure this film will open the eyes of (and perhaps frighten) restaurant patrons. It was all familiar to me, from the examples of customers the servers love--or, love to hate, to the behavior of the manager, and onward to the realtionships and personal lives of the employees. Did I enjoy my job and have as much fun and frustration as these workers? Yes, and if you ask anyone who has worked this type of job and seen this film I'm certain they will give you the same answer. I'm not going to be specific in the review because to tell anything about the situations you will see is to spoil the surprise effect of seeing what goes on while you are eating your meal. When we sit down and are served, the type of service we receive is always one of the topics of conversation. This movie reveals what is said when the people being served provide the topic of conversation for the servers. Watch the special features too, because you'll learn about the writer/director. He was a server and uses examples from his experiences. If you decide to buy this video, read this review again before you watch it.

If you haven't seen the film, it's pretty great overall. Certain aspects like the smoking inside the restaurant cause it to feel dated for me, but overall it's funny and Ryan Reynolds is great.

Video Quality:

The problem with the blu-ray is that it is among the worst quality blu-ray transfers I have ever seen. I only watch new films on blu-ray at 720p, and even at that resolution a high quality blu-ray looks stunningly different than a standard dvd.

The video quality for this blu-ray is awful, instead of the picture being crisply detailed, it's like there's a filter that muddies and softens everything, literally. I would rather watch the DVD transfer than this blu-ray, and this is certainly not worth the additional money over the DVD. If you have any doubt, rent the blu-ray first, and then make your decision. Not a good transfer at all.",1311724800,4,859,4.74496644295302
2468432,1,B000CPH9Q6,"I couldn't finish it.
I was really excited to see Waiting, too. This type of comedy is right up my alley. But the dialogue was not funny in the least. From the start, Ryan Reynolds sells this game to the new guy where you have to show your genitalia to another employee and make them look. And if they do, you get to kick them in the rear. Are you laughing yet? Because this joke was sold for at least 3/4 of the movie (that's as long as I lasted).

The jokes were laid out in a way to make sure you'd get the joke. No subtlety at all...which completely kills the joke. The PITA customer said the food has been horrible the LAST FOUR TIMES she's been there. And the obvious answer to that is, why do you keep coming back? The problem is, she emphasizes the LAST FOUR TIMES, because the writer/director wants to make sure you don't miss the joke in there. They're dumbing down their comedy which makes it much less funny. This is done throughout the movie.

So what you have is Ryan Reynolds as the star of the movie, who is a natural at comedy but has no good dialogue to deliver. You've got the guy from Ed and one of the crappier Die Hard movies as a depressed kid because he was a high school honors student but too lazy to use that to his advantage, and the good looking girl that loves him. Apparently he's not dorky anymore.

After about 45 minutes or an hour of enduring this thing, I'd had enough and decided to turn it off and watch some Arrested Development instead, since I was in the mood for something funny. I don't need a comedy to be hilarious in order to hold my interest, but I need it to at least be interesting.

By all the 5 star reviews this movie received, maybe you'll find this one funny like they did. Although I can't imagine why or how.

By comparison, I'd give 5 stars to The Hangover, American Pie (only the first one), Pineapple Express, 40 year old Virgin, and Role Models. 4 stars for Clerks, Chasing Amy, Stepbrothers, Undercover Brother, and Hot Tub Time Machine.",1311120000,,1998,4.289124668435013
2468433,3,B000CPH9Q6,"I enjoy films like Waiting because they appeal to me and those of us who have served others. I was a supermarket cashier for 5 1/2 years. Anyway, the movie's appeal about the day at Shenanigans (which reminds you of a chain restaurant like T.G.I. Fridays etc.) and an eclectic group of characters.

I assume this movie was rated R or should have been for language, sexual references, etc. This is an adult movie or for those who can stomach penis jokes etc. But this 2 disc set offers plenty of extras which shows the development of the film process. This film took years to make mostly of raising money.

This two disc set spares no expense in showing out-takes, deleted scenes, and the making of the film. Maybe it's too much for a 90 minute movie that might be a cult hit. I don't know if it's reached cult status like Office Space yet but it might be there eventually.

I am giving the 2 disc set three stars because mine wasn't rated R on the box and that's important to us out there. It's still a good bargain and they should make more movies like this about working class people who have dreams and aspirations of higher purpose.

The cast was excellent with Ryan Reynolds leading the pack. Anna Faris is fine. Alannah Ubach is my favorite as high strung Naomi. Luis Guzman is always hysterical. William Koetchner should have his own sitcom by now and others.

The film was done by a first-time film director who worked in a restaurant. I give him plenty of credit for fulfilling his dream but the jokes were a little x-rated at times especially with the sick game they have in the film that I won't write about here. This film is definitely an acquired taste for those who like bathroom humor.",1309996800,,1701,4.456591639871383

2468440,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Synopsis:  The film centers around a day in the life of the waitstaff of Shenaniganz, a fun All-American restaurant similar in theme to a TGI Fridays/Applebees style restaurant.  Everyone has a tale to tell.  You have the hopeful Dean (played by Justin Long), who is being harassed by his manager Dan (David Koechner) to accept a promotion despite weighing his options to continue a career in food service; all while maintaining his relationship with Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday).  There's also the sarcastic Monty (Ryan Reynolds), who does what he can to maintain his edge as the ""cool, cocky"" worker at the restaurant.  The wise dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride) does what he can to offer advice that would be counter-intuitive to the antics that Raddimus (Luis Guzman) and Floyd (Dane Cook) cook up in an effort to sabotage the restaurant's customers (and their food.)  Serena (Anna Faris) does what she can to hold down the fort while the alcoholic Naomi (Alanna Ubach) and the neurotic Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict) have their issues become the problems of everyone else.  Will the gang get through their day unscathed?  Will Dean make the decision to stay as a manager or will he move on with life?

I had to see the movie a few times to be a fan, but push comes to shove this wasn't that bad of a movie at all.  There were a bunch of comedians who were very much able to make the movie funny and a great supporting cast to help carry the story from point A to point B.  It's not the most high-brow movie in existence, but it's still a decent time and worth watching.",1265414400,,1569,4.628158844765343
2468441,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Few movies drive home a point as sharply as this one does. Yep, I will never, ever be mean or angry with a waiter or food preparer again.

""Waiting"" is definitely one of those F*** Bomb a minute, gross out sexual humor sort of movies.  But what makes it stand out from the majority of these usually brainless and nearly unwatchable movies is the sharply written script by first time writer/director Rob McKittrick.  McKittrick knows his subject, as he was writing from personal experience.  The characters are well fleshed out and recognizable, and the dialogue is quite funny and intelligent.  The ensemble cast - Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, and Justin Long among them - do a great job.

As others have already mentioned, ""Waiting"" is like ""Office Space"", in that it is a movie focused on one peculiar micro-culture of our modern society.  Instead of Cubical-ville, the characters live in the world of those familiar chain restaurants with the ersatz instant ""history"" and ""character"" stuck to the walls, where the waiters gather at your table to sing ""Happy Birthday"".  Think T.G.I.F. or Bubba Gump, more upscale than Denny's or Carrow's, less upscale than Macaroni Grill (the local one here has someone, usually the head waiter or a cute girl, sing ""Happy Birthday"" in Italian, as an aria).

And, I now appreciate so much more the budget steakhouses like Ponderosa/Bonanza that show you the cooks grilling the steaks right in front of the customers.  Great idea, all restaurants should do that...

Yes, this movie is what happens after the ""coming of age"" movie, when the kids leave the comforts of home to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives.  Have you noticed how the people in these sorts of jobs are usually young, usually turn over constantly?  It's a way station in life, the entry point into the cold, hard, realities of our fiercely competitive society.

2468444,5,B000CPH9Q6,"For what it is, Waiting is a perfect movie. It's outlandish comedy. Are there obnoxious people in it? Of course, but there are obnoxious people in real life, and it feels good to laugh at them once in a while and maybe see a little of yourself in an obnoxious character. Could it be more clever? Of course, but in a movie like this, too much cleverness would be too clever by half. For those who would want or expect more cleverness, have you never acted ridiculously silly and thoroughly enjoyed yourself? How would it be if, after your silly jag, some nitwit says, in all seriousness, that you could have been more clever? Neither is this film ""formulaic."" The story is structured around employees at a restaurant, so yes, it dishes out jokes you would expect. But then, a concert pianist is formulaic for performing the standard repertoire.

Like any good ""teen angst"" movie, this one has something to say to ""grown-ups"" and parents as well. It's just that everything is exaggerated to the point of absurdity, which makes it ""safer,"" perhaps, for us to think about the underlying messages. Oh yes, there are messages in this story, even if it doesn't take itself too seriously.

2468448,3,B000CPH9Q6,"Obnoxious people doing obnoxious things.  There, that's WAITING.  Featuring a day in the life of the restaurant Shenanigan's (a fictitious chain based on any number of eateries we all know and love), the viewer is witness to the antics of its screwball staff as they interact with one another--but even more importantly, with the restaurant's unsuspecting patrons.  Accordingly we get the typical sophomoric hijinks:  From scratching dandruff onto a steak sent back for more cooking, to a nonsensical initiation ritual for new employees.  But hey, some of it's funny, some of it's lame--all of it's forgettable.

An obnoxious film should have an obnoxious cast, and here WAITING doesn't disappoint.  Ryan Reynolds as a snooty waiter (who gets the film's best line:  ""Never [tick] off the people handling your food."") is as good as obnoxious gets.  Other cast members include Luiz Guzman, John Francis Daley, Dane Cook, and David Koechner.  Come on, that's like the Obnoxious Hall of Fame.  Disappointments include Anna Faris, who doesn't get to show off her considerable comedic talents, and Justin Long, who needs to quit with the pity party and grow a pair.  And if he did, the cooks in WAITING would no doubt be serving them at the buffet.  Bon appetit.

Apple computer lackey Justin Long does surprisngly well here too as the ""hero"" of the story who realizes this day that his life is slowly wasted there. Alot of other familiar faces spring up here too, and for the gross-out scenes, yes they will teach you not to anger your waiter until AFTER you've eaten. Mildly amusing while not a total gut-buster, gets a whole point for the plentiful bonus features and very inventive menus.

Overall, I think the movie was a B-. The plot revolves around the life of the staff of a Bennigans-style restaurant, called Shenanigans. Every character has their quirks and back stories. There is no real romance in this one, so if you are get this one hoping for a love story, don't.

The main issue I had with this movie is that it really does not go any where with the plot. What you basically get is a few days in the lives of the employees at the restaurant.

Some of the humor is a bit crude, some of it is gross, but you can easily identify with the characters that are played by some of today's most recognizable comic actors.

If I happen to a catch it on TV I won't watch it again. This story centers around a restaurant names ""Shenannigans"", I'm surprised Hannigans or Bennigans didn't sue them considering what is done to the customers food. Actually maybe they did and I didn't hear about it. Teenagers may find this very amusing, until they grow up and someone does it to their food. I was once a Maitre D' so when I caught a bus boy spitting in the potato salad, the rest the staff didn't think it was funny and he was immediately fired.

2468466,1,B000CPH9Q6,"With the film Waiting, I thought I had ordered a humorous and raunchy farce.  Instead, I was served an assortment of shallow, uninteresting one-note characters prepared with a tasteless glaze of sarcasm and covered in a mound of genitalia references.

This supposed comedy was dull, dreary and, worst of all, not funny.

Otherwise talented actors, Anna Faris, David Koetchner and Wendie Malick, are wasted in thin characters with nothing funny to say.  Luis Guzman is the only one able to generate any laughs.

Some compare the film to Clerks.  The only real comparison is that the writer of Waiting seems to have lifted the character of Jay from Clerks and split him into the two busboy characters who attempt a pale imitation of Jason Mewes.

If you feel you must watch a movie that spoofs the banal and corporate theme restaurants, watch Jennifer Aniston's scenes from Office Space.  You'll laugh a lot more and save yourself over an hour's worth of time.",1194307200,5,958,4.87037037037037
2468467,5,B000CPH9Q6,"There was ""Clerks,"" and ""Office Space,"" and now this.  While there have been many insider looks into the ironic, satiric, just plain funny twilight zone that is American lower class work/job experiences, few come close to the above mentioned films.  While I could relate much more to the clerical-oriented ""Office Space,"" I'd bet this film does for the restaurant industry (and ""service sector workers"") what ""Office Space"" did so well for me.  But I could relate to this almost as much.  It's all just done so surprisingly well.

While ""Office Space"" dealt with distinct and very different ""work-place"" clerical/office environments and characters usually found in both, this movie deals with the food-service industry, especially that within the more seemingly affluent types of establishment culture.  Still, despite the expensive looking and seeming quality dining experiences this film's dining business dishes up, like former treatments of this general theme, we eventually learn that perhaps one should eat out less frequently than they do, if ever.  And if THEY (those who prepare and deliver your food) dish it up at such rather upscale places like ""Shenanigans"" in the movie, you may want to see this great film before treating anyone in such a place with anything less than respect and a good tip.  From now on!

There are so many players here that it would be nearly impossible to straighten them all out and comment individually without writing a few thousand words.  Throughout however, it really doesn't matter.  Virtually every character and the actor or actress playing them, do a first rate job.

And the script and direction doesn't hurt.  While one or two characters stand out, and at times present either comic relief or that of a more serious message about the human corporate working environment and the ever increasing need to always try to get ahead, the entire acting staff give first rate performances.  From the smallest part to the majors.

The script is tight, very tight.  There are so many lines, so many situations involving so many different types of people, but while some of the humor may be childish and cheap, everything and everyone is believable in a way and it all works as a whole. Especially for anyone who has ever worked in any office or other consumer serving field.  This points to many rewrites, but that's a good thing here, a great thing.  As well as the superb direction, fast, furious, and quick-paced, and completely suiting the general ideas here, without drifting too heavily into perhaps more downer, if realistic modes.

Regardless of this film's seeing almost anything corporate, low-paying job-wise as existing in some bizzaro world (which it actually does), despite some excessive misdirections and plot diversions, anyone who's ever held such a job in any way close to what this film constantly and cleverly shows, will find a lot of value here.  Anyone actually who has ever held any kind of struggling, office or ""service"" job, should love this.

While the film rarely takes a breath from the continual bombardment of jokes, hit and miss, but mostly hit, throughout, and has only as a side story a more slightly more serious take on one of the employees and his own personal existential angst, even this aspect fits in beautifully, and with the film's fast onslaught of funny tidbits everywhere, even more serious turns only compliment the loads of humor to be found here.

There are plots and subplots all along the way, and all interesting, some of them seeming to even demand whole films of their own.  For anyone who has seen this and liked ""Office Space"" and/or ""Clerks,"" and liked this, or loved it as I did and do, this is a most definite buy, as it moves so fast with so many subtle lines and situations and interractions, that it demands repeated viewings to collectors with the money to add truly a special and totally unique modern workplace ""screwball"" comedy to their permanent DVD collection of totally cool flicks.

I only started watching this film without much expectations, on cable on demand, simply from the brief description of what the movie was supposedly about.  Amazingly, I watched it through without hardly a break or pause, and never ever reached for the fast forward button.  This is a really funny and at the same time, fairly deep comment on ""working-class"" America in a dining establishment, and while a lot of it seems a bit stretched as to believability, most of it does not, and for me, I'll forever think twice before ever eating out at a seemingly upscale such place.  Let alone one of the fast food outlets.

Ryan Reynolds plays Monty; a smart mouthed waiter at a chain restaurantwhp provides many of the best quips you'll hear in the film. Along for the ride is his best bud Dean (Justin Long, the Mac from the Apple and PC commercials, and soon to be seen in Live Free or Die Hard), former flame Serena (Anna Faris); and plenty of other loose cannons and jokers who all hate their job equally.  There's not much of a story, and what there is of it is nothing we haven't seen before, but Waiting's unabashed ludeness and hilarious gags (flashing each other their genitals may sound like it'll get tiring, but it only gets funnier) make it worth seeing for alone.  The cast, including Luis Guzman, Chi McBride, David Koechner, and the frequently annoying Andy Milonakis; are very funny, and Reynolds in particular is hysterical.  All in all, Waiting... may not be anything we've seen or heard before, but it's a surprisingly good and very funny slob comedy that should be checked out at the very least.",1171497600,2,1144,4.7

2468480,2,B000CPH9Q6,"It's hard to believe that ""Waiting ..."" is billed as a movie. Most movies have, oh, a plot. But who needs a plot when you have penis jokes?

A shameless excuse to stir together a group of stagnant character archetypes and low-brow one-liners (mostly involving sex), ""Waiting ..."" has a pretty specific target audience. I guess I wasn't in it. And I'm not sure that those who ARE in that target audience (13 year old males) would (or should) be allowed to watch a film that involves frontal nudity, underaged sex, and the consumption of pubic hairs. If, somehow, a prepubescent male gets his hands on this flick, I can guarantee him a good time.

God help him, though, if he identifies with any of the characters, none of which seem like anything resembling normal. There's the too-cool-for-school Monty (Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds), the stoner bus boys (Milonakis and Kasch, who also perform a moderately amusing music video over the credits), the controlling manager who has made his failure a badge of honor (David Koechner playing David Koechner), and, of course, a cadre of vengeful and horny cooks (Luis Guzman and Dane Cook actually do a pretty good job of embracing their poorly drawn places in the film). Chi McBride (I, Robot) is the pontificating dishwasher, Anna Faris (Scary Movie) is the slightly slutty waitress, and Justin Long (Dodgeball) gives us the closest thing to a story arc with his Dean, a 22 year old who is already suffering a mid-life crisis, God help his whiny soul.

It's really just another day in the life of a ""family"" restaurant. This one is named, appropriately, Shenaniganz, and it features, as Moe of the Simpsons would say, ""a whole lotta crazy crap on the walls"" (including a clever Rube Goldberg-esque contraption designed to pour beer into an empty mug; it's demonstrated after the final credits roll). In-between dealing with rude customers and training a newbie (a mostly mute John Francis Daley), the male members of the staff entertain themselves with a game that involves flashing their genitals at other waiters and winning, in the process, the right to kick the others in the butt. No, I'm not kidding.

This is the best that first-time director/writer Rob McKittrick could come up with, and although his love of this debut film is obvious on every juvenile frame, it doesn't translate into much more than people being crude and crazy. In a long personal note during the credits, McKittrick thanks one friend for reading over the script and ""showing me where the conversations were contrived."" Ha ha. The conversations. Right.

Some critics have compared this movie to others like ""Office Space"" and ""Clerks,"" but I think that does all of them a disservice. Those other films were trying to break new ground. This one knows its small redundant path and walks it with pride. Those others had witty, snappy dialogue. [...]. Those others had pretty clever plot threads.

It was not the movie's fault, I was grossly sleep deprived at the time. It is hard to imagine that I was able to fall asleep considering how hard I laughed through the first 30 minutes. All I can say for sure is that I had to see the rest if the beginning was that funny.

I've now seen the entire movie and it was funny. I laughed hard and often. I don't recommend the movie to you if you fell in with those who criticized Napoleon Dynamite for its lack of plot. You would be similarly disappointed with Waiting. Sure there is a moral dilemma in which one waiter is entrenched, but the rest of the movie is just about daily shenanigans of a few angsty employees of the food industry.

If you are naive enough to believe that restaurant dining is 100% clean and healthy, you may want to avoid seeing Waiting as it is an over-the-top portrayal of how sometimes a disgruntled server and/or cook will take a few inappopriate measures to get even with an annoying customer.

Ryan Reynolds gives a solid performance that, while not his best, goes to great strides to typecast him as the nearly past his prime big man on campus; a part he played perfectly in Van Wilder.

The game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on. If you're a rude anus of a customer, don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will. It pays to be polite and tip well, especially if you are a regular.

Chi McBride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great, and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus.

All in all, based on personal experience, the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan's Steak House. Sure, the characters are over the top, but they are based on people just like some I've known.

The movie follows one day in the life of a kitschy, Chili's or Applebee's-style restaurant known as ShenaniganZ, and the various personalities that work there. Every hilarious situation that a typical retaurant might have is shown, from bitchy customers (who then get ""very special"" treatment of their food) to busboys who are gangsta rapper wannabes, to a waiter who has a phobia of using public restrooms, to a waitress who yells at the top of her lungs at every little thing that ticks her off, to perhaps the funniest long-running joke in the movie, the infamous ""penis-showing"" game, where the cooks attempt to display their genitals to unwitting fellow employees as part of a point system. Contorting the genitals into various shapes, like the ""goat"" the ""brain"" and the ""batwing"" earn you extra points.

Just non-stop hilarity, with all the typical customer archetypes represented as well - the bitchy woman, the redneck hick, the foreigners who pretend that they don't speak English or understand American tipping ettiquette, to an old classmate who drops in to taunt his less-successful former chum.

2468492,1,B000CPH9Q6,"Workplace comedies are something that strike a chord in us all -- most people have held less-than-glamorous tuition-paying jobs, and sometimes resented the people we have been forced to deal with politely. No tips. Annoying coworkers. Twerpy customers who just don't get it, at all.

That's the main idea of Rob McKittrick's ""Waiting..."", a pale imitation of Kevin Smiths' breakout film ""Clerks."" It could have been a delightful comedy in the vein of ""Office Space,"" but alas, we get a pale, rather cliched comedy with a few gem-like moments.

Mitch (John Francis Daley) is starting his first day on the job at Shenanigan's, and he rapidly learns that the ropes are tangled and grubby. There's a philosophical dishwasher (Chi McBride), a smart-aleck, the nice guy with issues, a snarling dominatrix, and a sexpot waittress. And that's only the beginning...

Though Shenanigan's seems normal, there are drunken parties, crazed employees, and food seasoned with dandruff. With disdain for the customers and for each other, the employees spar, stare, and make jokes that will instantly offend gays, women and people with Down Syndrome. Can Dean (Justin Long) manage to get a decent job, or will he sink into the mire of Shenanigan's kitchen?

Anybody who has ever worked a minimum wage job like this will know that it's a gold mine for comedy. I myself have fond memories of a coworker going ballistic when a customer demanded that she spread the cream cheese for him. Unfortunately, that kind of delightful comedy isn't present. Instead, we get armpit-noise-level stuff -- bodily substances being spread on food, and so on.

Even crude films can be funny... but this one isn't. It's just moronic. McKittrick tries to spice it up with stuff like the ""Penis Game"" and workplace Lolitas, but it's a bit like trying to rescuscitate a week-old dead moose. Even the name of the restaurant is lame -- okay, Shenanigan's, we get it. The place has shenanigans. It's not really very funny anyway.

The characters are all cliches of the slacker worker, and they are so uniformly nasty that you really hope they rot behind those counters. It's a credit to the actors that they manage to inject any humour at all; Daley of ""Freaks and Geeks"" fame is the most entertaining character of all, and the only one that shows a spark of life.

The only thing that could be as bad as working at Shenanigan's is watching a gross-out comedy full of obnoxious stereotypes. You won't laugh. You'll just leave feeling bitter and queasy.",1153267200,5,2507,4.912529550827423

Take a day in the life of a restaurant(Shinanigans, and if there is no Shinanigans where you are just imagine that its an 'Applebees', 'TGI Fridays' or even 'The 99') and all all its employees, including cooks, waitstaff, management, busboys and how they relate to one another.  Whether it be personal or dealing with each other according to the company politic Including promotion, employee to employee relations. Training Videos, rude customers, cheap customers..and employee retribution including the cardinal rule--Don't mess with the  people that handle your food.  This movie does for restaurant life like 'Clerks' did for conveniance store life.  The characters are colorful, the situations outrageous sometimes crude and disgusting, it almost makes you never want to eat out again.

Ryan Renolds stars in this with Anna Faris, and Justin Long.  There are many other supporters in this that are just as funny.  Although I liked this film, I feel Renolds is limited with his talents. I felt watching him in this film was like this; Ryan Renolds plays Van Wilder, plays Monty-the character in Waiting. Anna Faris I feel is just a supporter even though shes pictured on the cover of the movie.  Luis Guzman is hysterically funny with the new trainee in this film, telling him of the never ending battle for all the male employees to expose themselves to one another. Crude humor at its best.

The acting, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all great!

In short, Waiting is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely put you in a good mood!  Strongly recommended to those that are working or have worked at restaurants.",1152835200,,569,4.53921568627451
2468495,5,B000CPH9Q6,"Waiting:

This movie got off to a really slow start, and I almost turned it off.  Almost.  Curiosity kept me watching, and I'm glad it did.  I was told this was a good movie, but that it would change the way I view dining out in restaurants like TGI Friday's, Ruby Tuesday and the like.  I didn't let that stop me though!

What I shouldn't have done, however, is sit down to watch this movie only hours after going out to Friday's for lunch.  All through the movie I kept going over our experience in my head trying to remember if I noticed any of the behaviors that were portrayed in this movie.  Thankfully, I didn't, and we are always nice to our servers, and tip pretty well!  I've seen and heard of things being done behind the scenes in restaurants to people's food, and I can only hope that that sort of thing is strictly reserved for those customers who deserve it...

I loved the story, if you can call it that, and I really like this style of movie.  I recommend it to anyone who likes movies about nothing, but that are actually about something, but that you don't have to take too seriously!  Aside from being forced to replay my most recent dining experience, I didn't have to think at all while I watched this movie.  That's always a plus!

Also, I loved the ending for this movie!  I only just rented this, but now I think I'm going to have to buy it...",1151539200,2,1368,4.2684824902723735

2468497,5,B000CPH9Q6,"If you've ever worked in a restaurant, even for a brief period, you will appreciate this movie. If you have never stepped foot in a kitchen or put on an apron and waited tables, you really need to take a look at the way things are. ""Waiting"" delivers an excellent portrayal of what it is to be a restaurant worker. As someone who has spent six years of his life in restaurants, I can tell you first hand that this movie hits the nail on the head.  From the toilet humor of the back-of-the-house to the intolerable demands of waiting on needy people, newcomer Rob McKittrick covers every aspect of the job. Coupled with an outstanding cast and enough jokes to fill a healthy appetite, ""Waiting"" is possibly the most underrated (but soon to be classic) comedy of the new millennium.

Now, if you haven't worked in a restaurant, I should warn: you really won't find this movie that funny. And on that note, I don't find this to be the funniest movie ever. Where I got my satisfaction was in the story and how real the characters and situations are. ""Waiting"" is as true to life as a restaurant can be, even with some characters that seem truly absurd. The restaurant itself, ""ShenaniganZ"" bears a striking resemblance to chain restaurants in the vein of Applebees (and no, it's not the same restaurant from ""Super Troopers"") and is a character all itself. As authentic as it could possibly be, right down to the cheesy nostalgia pieces on the wall. The cast is a varied and brilliant one, with Ryan Reynolds and Anna Faris taking the reigns, among Justin Long, Luis Guzman, comedian Dane Cook, a pre-fame Andy Milonakis, and Jordan Ladd, among others. All are spot on in their roles, and I swear, all of these characters are true to life, right down the gang-banging busboys.

The movie could be compared to other on-the-job classics like ""Clerks"" and ""Office Space"" and it definitely deserves it's rank among them. ""Waiting"" is the only movie I've seen that entirely revolves around restaurant work and it is pretty spot on. Don't be fooled: This isn't a ""teen movie"" or just a ""potty humor"" movie. No, it goes far beyond such gimmicks. ""Waiting"" is simply a movie for those unfortunate enough to get trapped in the restaurant world. From the good times to the downright awful, this movie is so good that it hurts.",1149465600,4,2312,4.634146341463414

If you want to turn your brain off for over an hour and laugh at gross-out comedy and twenty-somethings complaining about their lives (while at the same time enjoying their lives thoroughly because of excessive amounts of alcohol and late night parties), then you will enjoy this tongue-in-cheek movie. Although the storyline is one that is used over and over and over again - in this instance, a guy graduating from college who is working at a restaurant sees someone he went to school with who is much more successful than he is, causing him to question his job at the TGI Friday's type restaurant and in turn his life path - the movie puts together a new spin on some often tired jokes. More than anything, the movie reminds all of us that you should never ever insult or piss off the people who handle your food. Who knows what they'll do to it.",1148515200,,968,4.505681818181818

The ""grossness"" of this film didn't bother me but rather the immaturity and trite humor that seems to be apparent in every one of these ""teen movies""...It's as if they give middle schoolers the task of writing the scripts. It's just annoying beyond belief. I'll admit the only reason I actually decided to watch this movie and rated it 2 stars was because Dane Cook was in. I figured, being a huge fan of his comedy, that this one might actually make me laugh..WRONG. He barely had any parts, and those were the only parts that were funny. But they were few and far between. I also want to note how cheesy Ryan Renyolds charcatar was..I cant quite pin if it was his acting or what, but it was painful to watch. I hope the adults who enjoy this grow up and quit laughing at ""wee wee"" jokes.",1146787200,5,853,4.371069182389937
2468501,3,B000CPH9Q6,"""Waiting"" kept me waiting for a long time.  I kept waiting for it to become something more than just another second-rate comedy attempting to play to young adults.  It has a decent cast, with a few notable exceptions.  Justin Long, Anna Faris, Alanna Ubach and John Francis Daley are all fun to watch here.  Daley nearly steals the show with his ""new guy"" persona, Mitch.  Long is torn between becoming something special or just sticking it out at the local eatery.  Faris redeems herself from the ""Scary Movie"" franchise and Ubach, though she has very little to work with here, does the best she can with her tired, overworked and slightly psychotic character.

Those were the good characters.  The bad ones are what make this flick almost unbearable at times.  Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds.  Give his character Monty a gun and partner him with Wesley Snipes and you have his character from ""Blade Trinity.""  Slap a slab of pizza in his hand and you have the character he played in that ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Parlor.""  Drop him into your local university and sidle him up to Kumar and you have ""Van Wilder.""  Reynolds was pretty funny the first couple of times I've seen him pull off this gig, but he's really starting to wear thin.  I haven't seen him in ""Amityville Horror"" yet, so hopefully he does a better job in that.  Another annoying character was that of David Koechner's Dan, who is, much like Reynolds, basically the same character that he plays in all of his other films.  The worst in the bunch was the completely unfunny Andy Milonakis.  Whoever thought that this dude is funny should be dragged into the street and shot.  Milonakis is absolutely not funny, and his little video at the end is hideous.

So why give this flick three stars?  For the simple fact that Long and Daley manage to hold their respective stories together long enough to make this film remotely interesting.  You can actually relate to Long's character who is desperate to break free of his monotonous life, and you can feel for Daley as he tries to make it through ""first day jitters.""

In all, I wouldn't recommend this flick to folks who enjoy their humor with a little depth to it.  If you thought ""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" was the funniest thing in the world, breathe through your nose long enough to rent this mildly funny flick.",1146614400,,2371,4.619617224880383
2468502,4,B000CPH9Q6,"It would take a strong script to not be overshadowed by such a diverse cast of distinctive actors, and this movie doesn't have it. That's not a terrible thing though, it's still a fun watch, just more memorable for the cast than the script which doesn't seem to have much of a story or many truly distinctive lines or moments. It's a day-in-the-life type thing with sloppy structure/editing where all attempts at character development seem to be immediately abandoned. In one scene Reynolds' lack of sexual prowess is dramatically revealed, the movie then just continues as if it never happened, he's still the cool guy, so what was the point of the scene? They should have either developed the characters more fully and made it stick, or just made them completely one-dimensional. The indecisive jabs at character development were the most annoying thing.

2468506,3,B000CPH9Q6,"This is one of those pointless, day-in-the-life-of-a type of movies, and while it does offer some big laughs, it lacks a heart. Raunchy comedy was done much better in ""The Wedding Crashers"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". But analyzing this film on its own merits...

Ryan Reynolds has the perfect face of a snarky jock-type frat boy who's just enjoying life as he works as the top dog waiter at Shenanigans (a not-too-subtle jab at the actual Bennigans). His facial reactions, dead-on Forrest Gump impersonation, and comments make this film better than it is. I haven't seen Van Wilder except for the trailer, so it looks like he's playing a similar role. He better watch out for his career choices, because he could easily get stuck playing the same ""big man on campus frat boy jock"" for the remainder of his career.

The rest of the actors are cardboard cut-outs. There's a waitress with anger management problems; a flirty underage waitress who loves to come on to older men and get them into trouble; comedian Dane Cook plays...get this: a cook! The restaurant manager is a balding middle age man with no friends to speak of so he tries to get socially involved with his much younger employees. I actually thought that was true to life, as several managers of restaurants I've worked in certainly fit that stereotype.

My favorite scenes were ones with the two white, dishwashing bus boys who act more like rapping b-boys. One of them, T-dog, even has his hair in cornrows. They are often found rapping and throwing insults like a rap star. The rap played during the end credits is hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing. The lyrics are downright funny, even if a bit misogynistic, but who cares?

What I love most about this film are the jabs at various customer types who are extremely picky about the way their food is prepared (if a person is that anal retentive about their food, they should never eat in a restaurant), those who don't leave big tips, those who overtip, and the various ways waiters and waitresses flirt with customers in order to garner a large tip. While I'm certain that servers at restaurant deal with difficult customers through the passive-aggressive practice of messing with one's food, I thought those scenes went too far for my taste. If anything, it serves as a warning to difficult customers, but I certainly hope that no waiter/cook would ever do that to a polite/considerate customer. It's the most unethical thing one can do to deal with a difficult customer.

What killed the film for me was the stupid game they play. While I'm sure it happens in any industry with immature men who think such things are funny, I just thought they wrapped the whole film around it, taking away from the things they could've and should've shown. However, to the filmmakers credit, the end scene is brilliant and some of the funniest I've seen. Still...I subtract a star for making that game the running gag throughout the film.

This is okay to see once, but not to own or ever see again. For raunchy good fun, I'll stick with ""The Wedding Crashers"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""...two movies that deliver even bigger and better laughs and a more interesting storyline to match.",1145664000,5,3197,4.730700179533214

The star of this feature is Ryan Reynolds. Well let's be honest does anything really star Ryan Reynolds. Put it this way he has the most dialogue. Reynolds plays a hip cool waiter and his routine gets old about half way through the picture. He's like a cross between a young Chevy Chase and Val Kilmer,sorta funny but kinda creepy at the same time,especially while hitting on the underage hostess(yeah, our hero). The real laughs come from two other castmembers. Luis Guzman does a good job as a degenerate cook who comes up with ""The Game"" that is played by most of the males at the resturant. This sport is the funniest thing in the movie,but it is rather filthy and decorum prohibits me from explaining it here. I was most impressed by Alanna Ubach who plays a bitter,foul mouthed burnt-out waitress(I thought only cops and bomb squad members got burnt-out,but I didn't write it so don't blame me).She steals every scene she speaks in and some where she doesn't. She is a gifted actress with excellent timing who rises above the rather thin script and competent directing. In truth the directing is actually pretty good. In fact there is a very nice long shot in the second half of the movie with most of the cast handing off to each other,proving somebody knew what they were doing. I'm not saying its Henry taking Karen to the Copa in Goodfellas or anything,but it is kinda cool.  There are a good amount of chuckles in this movie,and a couple of belly laughs.

It's freaking hilarious, foul, filthy, disgusting and an amazingly accurate portrait of how it is to work in the food industry. ""The Game"" could probably never happen in the real world anymore but I can recall a time in my younger days when such stuff would definitely have flown. It's an absolute HR nightmare.

It becomes a bit tedious at times and some of the dialogue was just a little bit off. Ryan Reynolds is great, but playing basically the same character as in Van Wilder. Luis Guzman is hilarious, especially his first scene where he explains how to expose your bag of nuts for extra points.

There are much better films such as ""Office Space"", ""Van Wilder"", ""Harold and Kumar"" and ""American Pie"", but this film is still worthy, especially if you actually are a waiter or waitress.",1141430400,,638,4.696428571428571

2468529,5,B000CPH9Q6,"Waiting is a raw, uncut, raunchy comedy about what really goes on behind the scenes in the resturaunt industry. Ryan Reynolds plays Monty, a prankster whose goal in life is the score with as many hot chicks as possible while working minimum wage at Shenaniganz resturant. Dean (Justin Long), Monty's best friend is a hard working, solid kid who wants more out of life than just to work as a waiter for the rest of his life. When Monty is told by his boss Dan (David Koechner) to show the new guy Mitch (John Francis Daley) around the resturant Monty shows him what it's really like working at Shenaniganz. At the same time, Dean is trying to get in a serious relationship with his on and off girlfriend Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday) while her best friend who also works at the resturant Serena (Anna Faris) gives her some tips about men.

It starts out with a regular joe who is into parties and is not taking too many classes at a college. At the same time he works at a resturant named ShannanegianZ. And believe me they never stop. They don't call it that resturant for nothing. Everything depicted in this movie is spot on true. I used to work at a resturant so I know. You got your typical flashy hostess, the overachiever full-o-bull boss, the anger management waitress, and the edgy hyper-cool waiter: Monty.

Not only does the movie rock like no tomorrow but it also features:

TA-DA! DANE COOK!!!!!

They pull out all the stops with this movie to ensure that it is a laugh and a half. I watched this with my buddies and we could not stop laughing. And I mean 'oh, man. I can't breathe' laughing.

Also on this dvd is a telecaster comentary, where they draw on the screen pointing out several different things in the background. I don't think that's ever been done before.

they also have hilarious outakes and deleted scenes.

Final Verdict: ""This is the new CLERKS of 2006!!!""

2468531,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Taking it's cue from Clerks, Waiting... is a movie about a day in the life of the employees of the restaurant ShenaniganZ. This movie is filled with plenty of obnoxious characters, cheap laughs, and no story at all, but still, it's a hilarious movie nonetheless. Not a lot can really be said about this movie other than that, had a story actually been put into the setting and characters of Waiting... it would have been terrible. Instead, we get endless fart jokes, a lot of mature situations, with a little (or a lot) of bush. The cast, while not filled with superstars, has a lot of well-known actors and actresses, which seems to validate this ridiculous attempt at film-making. All I can really say is that this movie has to be seen to be believed. And once you see it, you'll never eat out again.

This movie is especially good for fans of Kevin Smith movies, as it follows in the same vein. It also compares well to movies like Old School, Office Space, or Anchorman, so if you liked any of these movies mentioned, chances are you'll like this movie as well.",1140825600,15,1065,4.518134715025907
2468532,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Waiting is better than any documentary you'll ever find on an in depth look in restaurants. It will tell you everything that can possibly happen to your food and the people that work there plus a behind the scenes look on the cooks. Besides being funny waiting teaches a few lessons that need to be known by anyone who eats food handled by others. I can't stand going to a restaurant with someone that is rood to the waiters because just as said in this film Don't Mess With The People Handling Your Food.

Waiting will have people who have worked in the food industry laughing until they cry, anyone that makes sure they are nice every time will be thanking god, and the ignorant ones changing their attitudes and wondering what gross things they've already eaten. The film is definitely not as funny the first time as it is the second because after a while of wondering if anyone's ever done these things to your food you start to feel comfortable.

let me tell you up front, it does not dissappoint, in the least!!

even though i never worked in a restaurant, i have worked in the service industry, where you have to paint on a smile every two minutes, deal with idotic, absurd demands, and humble yourself before all...

man, this movie had me ROLLING!!!  i saw in a bit of myself in mitch ( except for the 'goat' lol)  and in other characters as well..the timing of the jokes was great, and after multiple views, it hasn't gotten old (yet)

although, i must admit, ryan reynold's monty was the exact same character he always plays, i have NO problem with that... he was the main reason the piqued my interest...

the dynamic between entire cast is tangible, and had a sense of unity and high morale, even though the job itself was thankless  ( as bishop points out)

luis guisman as ratimus , to me, was a show stealer, and mitch's soliloquoy at the end was PRICELESS!!!!",1140652800,2,1018,4.45945945945946

2468536,4,B000CPH9Q6,"I will never bitch at any individual at a restaurant again,  be it dishwasher or waiter!!!!!!!!!!! After seeing this I'm not so sure I even want to eat out ever again.....Anyway, Ryan Reynolds continues his excellent performances, he is really an amazing comedic actor, period. I have now seen him in Blade 3, Buying The Cow, Amityville Horror, and now Waiting, and the guy steals every scene he is in. His newest movie Just Friends comes out March 7th and you can bet I'll be there Tuesday morning to pick it up, if only for Reynolds. Now back to Waiting, the plot is quite simple, the daily rituals of six or seven 22-25 year olds working at one of the hottest restuarants in town. Ryan Reynolds plays Monty, the 'leader' of the group if you will who is assigned to train Mitch (played amusingly by John Frances Daley, I know, I'd never heard of him either) Even before Mitch can get a word in edgewise, Monty stars telling him about the penis game, which is brutally funny, this is a constant running joke throughout the entire movie, if you can get any of your male co-workers to look at your 'package' you get to kick them in the ass anywhere from 1 to 3 times depending on the severity of the penis position, but first YOU have to call THEM a fag, interesting huh?

Reynolds is letting jokes and disses fly here and there every 5 seconds, and to tell you the truth, almost all of them hit, he is so naturally funny and easy-going and his delivery is almost always perfect. Justin Long (remember him? our Jeepers Creepers boy?) plays Dean, Monty's best friend and roomate, and he at 22 is already having a midlife crisis, his mom tells him about 1 of his high school buddies who just graduated college and his getting this amazing high-paying job, implying that Dean is doing nothing and that he is still a waiter at 22. So naturally, Dean is a wee bit depressed and is not sure what he wants to do with his life. He has some genuine hilarious moments when he and the manager are 'chatting' about him becoming assistant manager.

Another great character is Serena, played by Anna Faris (she of Scary Movie 1,2 and 3 fame) She has a on again off again thing going with Monty and when they have a huge arguement in front of the whole staff about there sex life tears will come to your eyes, it's very funny. Dan the mangaer (David Koechner) is a real sleaze, and he is constantly hitting on the 17-year old hostess Natasha played by Vanessa Langies, she leads him on inviting him to a big party but giving him the wrong address sending him to a disgruntled redneck customer who happens to open the door in his tidy whities screaming ""did ya bring my gift certificates?""

Dane Cook and Luis Guzman play a couple of the cooks and they are drop-dead funny, during a scene in which a really bitchy lady sends her steak back and the things these two add to 'fix' the problem is not only a complete riot, but disgusting and also scary as hell, thus my claim in the first sentence of this review!!! Ya know it's funny, people consider this movie a box office flop, and true it only grossed 16.5 million, but it cost a whopping 1 million to make, I don't know about you, but I'd take that return on any investment in a heartbeat.

So yes, a rather simple plot, but with all the great jokes and the great performances, you really won't mind much. If I had to give it any complaints, it does have the incredibly lame and unfunny Andy Milonakis, he and Max Kasch play a couple of whipped cream sniffing, wanna-be brother bus boys. It's a little funny at first, but it gets real stale by the end of the movie, and if you watch the very funny outakes on the DVD skip the one with them freestyling, it's just wrong and over-the-top vulgar. The performance by Alanna Ubach as Naomi, an extremely stressed out waitress, while over-acted and in your face, is precious. And just remember this advice 'Don't #%$%@* with the people who bring you your food'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

acting......4 stars, Reynolds, Faris, Long, Dane Cook and Alanna Ubach are all perfect, they draw alot of laughs

directing.....3.5 stars, I'm thinking with this crew, this was pretty painless to make, alot of joking around I bet

special effects....N/A

comedy rating....4 stars, Alot of laughs to be had, and while it is gross, it's just the one scene and it's not as bad as everybody is saying

quality.....3.5 stars, Surprisingly poor audio, had to really turn it up loud, minimal grain. decent colors",1140048000,,4462,4.5111386138613865
2468537,4,B000CPH9Q6,"Last night, a friend brought over Waiting which I'd been wanting to see since I'd first seen the previews. I can't stand to go to the movie theater anymore to shell out a lot of money only to have some jackass blab on their phone the entire time. I figured I'd run out and rent it this weekend, but at last my wait for Waiting was finally over. And it was worth it! I'm a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds, plus Waiting had been described to me as Office Space for the restaurant industry. Despite never working in food services, I had an absolute blast watching this movie. It was such fun and proves that in any work environment, you always have some games you play to make your job less awful. I'd never work in food services, and I'm not saying that to put down anyone that does...I have a great respect for those who do because I'm far too clumsy not to drop plates of food everywhere and far too forgetful to remember orders. I'd probably be most like Naomi's charcter if I did work in that industry. My hat is off to the hard-working people in this industry.

Waiting takes us through a day in the life of the employees who work at a restaurant called Shenanigan's (which looks like a Bennigan's) as Ryan Reynolds' charcter trains the new guy, Mitch. Since I don't work in this industry, I found it interesting to see things from the perspective of all the employees in the restaurant. The cooks who just wanted to go home. The poor waitress who had the mean, nasty lady. It makes me quite happy that I always treat the people who wait on me with respect.

So, if you enjoyed Office Space, or you have worked in a restaurant, I suspect you will like this movie most of all. Anyone with a sense of humor will surely enjoy this as much as I did. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 though just because one of the cooks (the really ugly one...I forget his name) has this stunningly beautiful girlfriend in the movie and it seems very unlikely a girl that looks like that would even give a guy that looks like that the time of day. However, my friend who brought over the movie used to work in food services years ago and he said it's not all that uncommon to see something like that. Whatever. Just enjoy the movie and remember to always be nice to the wait staff!",1140048000,,2255,4.266355140186916
2468538,4,B000CPH9Q6,"A MUST FOR FOOD INDUSTRY WORKERS WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR!! Okay, this movie is more like 3 & 1/2 stars, good not great. Main plot revolves around a new employee, Mitch,  who just got introduced to his new job in Shenaniganz, a popular restaurant.  He gets oriented in the job by Monty, (van wilder) who teaches him bizzare methods of ways to cope with the stress  (showing off the goods and if someone looks you kick them in the nads kind of thing).  There are some subplots such as Dean and his failure to become anything and just can't take waiting tables anymore.  What makes the movie funny are the way the waiters act with their split personalities from the kitchen to the floor is so much the way it is in real life.  Don't cross the waiters or you might get some extra unsanitary gifts in your food. Many people may find this movie offensive and not very funny for its crudeness.  People in this business will love it for the irony and reflections of the characters of themselves.",1139961600,,985,4.4088397790055245
2468539,3,B000CPH9Q6,"Waiting is basically Clerks but with a restuarant and gross out humor. Still though, it's a really entertaining movie due to the cast. I thought Ryan Reynolds made a mistake going back to gross out comedies after showing he can do more. Critics who hated this movie would say he made a mistake doing this movie but to me I'm not sure why they didn't like this movie. If they loved Clerks, then why not Waiting ? We get an understanding that...you shouldn't mess with the people that wait on you because they're friends with the cooks. Who will spit in your food among other things. Hell you might not even wanna go to another restuarant after seeing this movie.

  Still though it's hilarious with a talented cast. Anna Farris is even better here than she was in any Scary Movie film. Usually she doesn't mind just poking fun at herself for a few laughs but here she shows she can do more than that. She outacts Reynolds in the scene where they're arguing over his skills with woman since she's an ex of his. Still though, although I usually disagree with Richard Roeper, Reynolds is pretty much the new Chevy Chase. He has the same facial expressions and same personallity. Which would probably make him perfect for the Fletch sequel or remake that has been talked about for years now. I never really thought that Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers, Dodge Ball) had any talent either until I saw him in this. He's good as Reynolds' bestfriend who doesn't want to work as a waiter his entire life. Luis Guzmn (Traffic, The Salton Sea) as a weird cook and Chi McBride (Boston Public) as a cook full of wisdom that nobody wants to hear are also good as always. A friday night with a few friends and some beers and Waiting and you'll have the time of your lives... Hell should even enjoy it without the beer lol.",1139788800,,1804,4.4939024390243905

It seemed like its really not a movie but small vignettes tied together.  sure, one scene led to another but overall it seemed very predictable and at times boring.  The movie tries way too hard for humor with shock value and unfortunately for the viewer-goes nowhere.  I love gross humor like anyone else but this movie did not work for me.  the characters were typical and uninteresting.  the trailer was much funnier and basically it showed you the funniest moments. in the film those scenes came into the movies first 15 mins!!!!.  the rest of the movie went down the drain.  this is one restaurant worth closing.",1139702400,5,659,4.769911504424779

The depiction of the various characters at the dinning room and kitchen is very realistic. It deals with bad/bitchy/cheap/flirtatious customers, retaliations from the waiting and kitchen staff, the feud and sexual encounters within the staff members all served up a very dirty, shocking, and hilarious experience. Overall, I think the whole sexual activities that take place in behind the scene is a bit exaggerated. This film has so many funny dialogues and the ensemble cast all have their share of comic moments.

2468543,3,B000CPH9Q6,"Reading reviews of this slight little 'comedy', it seems the positive accolades come primarily from people who have been waiters: that is a good thing because it means writer/director Rob McKittrick managed to duplicate the experiences 'behind the scenes' of our eating establishments with authority.

But a film that is self-absorbed about the manner in which a disparate group of young people spend their boring lives avoiding adulthood in a restaurant, aptly named Shenanigan's here, is a National Lampoon type potty mouth series of one liners that has little to recommend it unless you've experienced the life of a waitperson.  The glimmers of light that manage to come through are due primarily to the easy nonchalance of Ryan Reynolds' acting.  Otherwise the 'storyline' is a gaggle of gross-out in jokes that after the first fifteen minutes become numbing.

It has been stated that this is a potential cult movie and supposedly that puts it in a class with 'Harold and Maude' (not in the same class at all!), the 'Rocky Horror Show', etc.  There must be an audience for this type film because they just keep grinding them out.

Most of the movie lacked a decent plot and was just full of freshman [...] gags over and over again.  I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you want to see a funny movie that is similar to this, but that's hilarious all the way through, go with Clerks.  For more comedy movies, I recommend Kevin Smith's movies, such as Clerks, Mallrats, or Dogma.

The way that the restaurant, the employees, and the customers were portrayed was absolutely perfect.  I've never actually been a waiter, but all the stories I've heard from friends have been exactly like the ones portrayed here on film.

The movie basically relies on disgusting gags to get most of the laughs, but there are a few more insightful moments, especially at the end.  This movie was a lot more intelligent than I was expecting it to be.

All the employees have their own funny characteristics.  David Koechner is every manager you've ever worked for (""the difference between ordinary and extraordinary....is just that litte extra""), and I truly hope that the portrayal of the chefs wasn't based on any true story, though I have my suspicions.

I worked as a server for about a year and change, and this is exactly what my life was like in that time period (minus the show your johnson game). I've never laughed as hard as I did watching this movie. It captures exactly how annoying and mean customers can be, and how naive they are to think you won't mess with them back. I mean obviously you can't yell at them or anything, so of course you mess with the food! And this movie shows this perfectly (and admitedly much more drasticly than real life). But as Ryan Reynolds character says (and its true) ""Don't Mess with the people who handle your food."" Its just not smart. So funny.

Words honestly can't even begin to describe just how realistic and funny this flick is.

2468549,4,B000CPH9Q6,"It has to be said. This kind of comedy is not my forte but many of my acquaintences advised me to watch this movie and I duly followed their advice. Having discovered the wide and varied universe of food places in the American North East it is quite amazing the similarities one finds when watching this cautionary tale. Having worked in retail management for some years now I also had a vested interest in watching this movie.

This is very much a comic docudrama. From the outset when the stage is being set and the characters introduced, some stereotypes are sketched in and these will be instantly recognisable to anyone who has worked in the food or retail sectors. And that is just the employees. What is established is a scene in a life sized soap opera with drama aplenty and where every detail is magnified out of all proportion. We follow the trials and tribulations through a section of a working week while the melodrama plays itself out. The most interesting aspect of it all is the treatment meted out to the unpleasant customer who has no respect for the efforts of the staff and who takes saditic delight in their total humiliation. And, as we all know, the customer, it is said anyway, is always right. But, as it is written, ye shall reap as ye shall sow, which leads to consequences.

Waiting paints the work in a restaurant as being self-centered and introvert. The manager feels macho and powerful yielding his capacity to hire and fire over the employees heads whilst they all realise that the restaurant is small fry (no pun intended). His feeble attempts to engender some motivation through the shift huddle make the whole ide rather stupid and pointless although that little scene is being played out in numerous stores at least once a day across the wide sweep of the land. People and their own ideas of their self importance are the concern of waiting and yet there is a camaraderie which transcends feelings towards each other. There is a team spirit which carries them through any crisis. Of course, the composition of the team changes relatively frequently and new members are initiated into the team or are rejected.

One of the things I most liked about this movie is the way I could identify with many of the characters within whether employee or customer and some of the inanities which are a central part of the retail life.

For those readers who have only experienced such life long skills that they may have learned early in their careers, this is a movie to look back on with some nostalgia. Remember that person who was a feeble tipper and the retribution that prevailed upon him or her; or remeber an experience you had in a restaurant...

2468552,5,B000CPH9Q6,"Probably the most realistic depiction of what this industry is really like behind the scenes. Most of the people serving your food are similar to these characters in so many ways.

The movie is raunchy, it has foul language, it references sex and body parts multiple times. It deserves its R rating. But I garauntee you'll be in pain from laughing so much.",1138752000,3,356,4.650793650793651
2468553,5,B000CPH9Q6,"If you've ever worked in a restaraunt..or ate in one for that matter...you should see this film!

Ryan Reynolds is an absolute gem, this guys is going to have a long career.  And the rest of the cast rounds out a rowdy bunch that we've all worked with before at one time or another.  This would make a great TV series, like Alice on crack.

The only grievance I have is Luis Guzman.  He's not funny at all.",1138579200,,406,4.153846153846154
2468554,5,B000CPH9Q6,"In a year of 365 days, I waste around 70-90 hours watching films with limited humor and those that try hard to induce a laugh or two out of me. Comedy is a genre that is flawed with movies that might seem funny only to a certain age group (American Pie for mid-teens,American Pie4 for pre-teens,Meet The Fockers for Yikes,etc) It is with some happiness that I bring to your knowledge that WAITING has to be the most unapologetically funny film I have seen for this year,2005

Waiting has several funny charaters with dialogues that'll entertain you all throughout the duration of the film. The film is based on a resteraunt which I'd dare not spell. The humor is original,reasonable quantity of skin is on display, the language is untamed which makes it more funny and yet there's a goodboy feel about the direction which is quite inexplicably intriguing towards the end.

In few simple words, WATCH ""Waiting"" because it is simply funny,original and (almost)applaudible.",1138147200,6,970,4.872727272727273
2468555,3,B000CPH9Q6,"Dean (Justin Long) is about to start another long day as a waiter in Shenanigan's (think TGI Friday's) when he realizes, after hearing news that a high school classmate is now an electrical engineer, he has had the same dead-end job for four years.  His friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is showing a new trainee, Mitch (John Francis Daley), the ropes on being a waiter in the restaurant.  He places the utmost importance in schooling the fresh recruit on a particular game the staff is passionate about (this involves exposure of a body organ which I will not identify and starts with ""p"" and ends with ""enis"") to pass the time away.  Monty also introduces the trainee to the rest of the staff.  Head chef Raddimus (Luis Guzman) and his girlfriend/bartender Danielle (Jordan Ladd), busboy/stoners (Andy Milonakis and Max Kasch), wise man dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride), the eternally cursing waitress (Alanna Ubach), shy urinator/waiter and 'too niceguy' Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), the too-beautiful-to-be-working-here-and-knows-it waitress Serena (Anna Faris), and the underage hostess (Vanessa Lengies) comprise some of the crackpot staff.  All led by the trying-to-be-hip manager Dan (David Koechner) who has placed his job on an incredible pedestal.

As soon as the concept of the film becomes apparent, Kevin Smith's Clerks comes to mind.  It seems that Randal and Dante's convenience store adventures were a clear inspiration to filmmaker Rob McKittrick's Waiting... (the wannabe rappers/stoners/busboys... Jay and Silent Bob, anyone?)

The cast plays their limited characters remarkably well, to the film's fledgling credit.  Ryan Reynolds, however, is beginning to seem like he acts the same in every film he's in.  Like a less motivated Jason Lee.  Much kudos goes to Dane Cook and John Francis Daley who brighten the screen at the exact moments when you need a gasp for air because the movie was beginning to drown.

That's right.  The film loses steam very quickly and has a coal replenishment far too few times.  Granted, the parts that made me laugh made me laugh hard but the rest of the flick seemed to drag on and on.  Plots and sub-plots are only mildly entertaining and only a few of them receive their justified conclusions.

If anything, you do leave with a little more respect for your humble waiter.  It also reinforces a cardinal rule: Don't mess with someone who handles your food.

It was a valiant effort and a noble concept but for all it's bravado it was clearly apparent that Waiting... was a freshman film.  But it shows McKittrick's promise as a filmmaker.  For now, however, if you feel like frathouse humor and silly, crude funnies, see it.  Otherwise, don't expect the smarts and charm of Clerks.  Steer clear.",1137801600,2,2748,5.073496659242761
2468556,5,B000CPH9Q6,"finally there is a movie out there that i can really relate to. working in a restraunt you really do have to deal with those kind of people. customers forget that we're people too. so please. when you go out to eat. don't be a jerk, becuase you're not gonna get anywhere and by the time you leave, i promise, all the workers will know what an ass you were. so don't break the one cardinal rule.",1137542400,4,394,4.12987012987013
2468557,5,B000CPH9Q6,This movie is hillarious as usual for a Ryan Reynolds flick. I laughed all the way through the film and it made me realize it is best to be kind to your waiter or waitress! Definitely a movie worthy of purchasing. I know I will!,1137456000,2,228,4.088888888888889

2468559,5,B000CPH9Q6,"I've been seeing the reviews others have written calling this a ""gross-out film with no plot""

This movie is a ""slice of life movie"" about a regular resturant and its staff. I've worked in resturants for 18 years and this movie is right where it should be. If you have ever worked in a resturant, you will find yourself saying ""I know that person"" or even ""I've said/done that before""

Everyone who hasn't worked in one before is not going to be able to get past the gross parts, or the penis jokes, or a dozen other ""in"" jokes that long term food service workers are laughing their heads off while you look confused or offended.

In short, resturant people will love this movie, everyone else, may just enjoy, or be offened by it, but remember, these are the types of people preparing you dinner.",1133136000,3,797,4.482758620689655
2468560,5,B000CPH9Q6,"I, like others who have written reviews on this movie, have had my fair share of crappy jobs. 5, to be certain. And EVERY LAST ONE has been in food service... God knows I'm sick of it.

When I saw this movie in theatres, I knew within the first five minutes that I'd be buying it as soon as it hit the shelves.

This movie just jumps out and grabs any who have ever walked the plank and decided to work at a restraunt. 2 of the 5 illustrious jobs (to be far, I move a lot... I haven't gotten fired) I've had so far were in restraunts, and no job is quite like a restaraunt job.

As one reviewer said roughly ""the whole character development was just them moping around about their personal problems."" From experience, this makes up for 95% of conversation at any crummy job. And 97% of that conversation is about their crummy jobs, and how much they suck.

This movie had so many non-stop laughs (albeit many were resulting from sophomoric jokes) that I am awaiting the DVD's arrival so I can hear what I missed from the audience laughing over other jokes. By the end of the movie, you really feel for the characters... you just pity the poor souls working a double, waiting on ignorant jerks who never tip over 10%.

If you've never been a server, or a buser, or a dishwasher, or a host(ess), or a restaraunt cook, you still might find this movie funny. But if you have worked one of the aforementioned jobs, WATCH THIS MOVIE.",1133136000,3,1427,4.329588014981273
2468561,4,B000CPH9Q6,"This movie was not anything like I was expecting.  It was a totally different movie with many parts that were so gross that you couldn't help laugh.  It also played on the fact of what real people working in a resturant do doing their time.  It was great.  I will admitt there were a coupld times when I was bored but over-all this movie is funny and keeps it coming with the raunchy jokes.  If you perfer not to think about private body parts or hear about sex, then I suggest you don't see this movie.  It is on the edge raw but in a funny, crazy way.",1131667200,6,553,4.074074074074074
