5000834,5,B006KN7ERS,"I was a bit torn choosing between Felix's Flexibility DVD and the ones Alethea Austin has available (I need both, right?).  However, I'm glad I got the Felix one.  I've heard that Alethea's are more specific to back and legs and that her stretches use the pole.  Felix's covers the whole body and all the moves are off the pole (so you can watch it someplace else besides your pole room).  I'm not sure if I can remember all of the sections offhand, but they include glutes, hamstrings, back, splits and straddles, shoulders, and wrists.  I was afraid that Felix might not have enough splits stretches given all of the other parts she covers.  However, there are plenty and a lot of them were new to me.  I really appreciated the shoulder stretches because that's the part I neglect the most.  With this DVD, it's easy to skip around to what you want using the chapter selection.  The ""extras"" section on this one has additional stretches you can do.  This DVD relies on a lot of visual cues vs. talking.  I don't mind at all, since I think I'm more of a visual learner.  Felix seems kind of hyper during the warm up, which isn't bad, but it's different than the slow warm-ups I usually see on other peoples' DVDs.  She busts out some crazy mountain climbers! Something I did not know about the DVD before buying was that Felix sometimes utilizes a resistance band.  I happened to have some, but it might throw you off if you weren't prepared.  Lastly, each stretch is done at your ability level.  She offers variations to make things easier/more difficult.  I noticed that on move variations, Felix sometimes used yoga blocks, but you don't need yoga blocks for the basic stretches.  Felix holds each stretch for 30 seconds on the video, but she says that you can do each one up to 2 minutes.",1330560000,48,1793,4.5327102803738315

5000838,3,B006KN7ERS,Good stretches but there are no instructions so you just have to watch her and mimic what she does.  You've been warned.,1409788800,2,120,4.454545454545454
5000839,5,B006KN7ERS,"I love this DVD set!!
So far I have watched the beginner DVD, the one about stretching and a little bit of the floor work.

I really love Felix, she has done a great job with this. She explains well, takes the time, and then does the move two times for you to watch before moving to the next one.

I was a total beginner starting on her DVDs, it is easy to follow and I have learned a lot already! Love it!!",1406160000,2,407,3.891566265060241

5000841,5,B006KN7ERS,"Love these series.
The way it is broken down to how you grip the pole and how to hold your body to perfect the move has been extremely helpful for me to get certain moves and tricks down which I was struggling with before I had those dvd's.",1403481600,,240,4.020833333333333
5000842,5,B006KN7ERS,"I actually bought her entire DVD series from her site. I love this because if you ever wanted to get your split or get closer to your split or even start doing over splits you will if you stick with the stretches in this DVD. Luckily I'm a naturally flexible person, but I had a hard time getting  flat to the floor and my Right split was just horrible.  With in 2 1/2- 3 months my left was flat and my right was closer to the floor I had like maybe 3 inches to go. I had to work on the right extra and now I'm down on my right working to get it nice and flat and I'm working on my over-splits.

There is a lot of stuff in here for back flexibility as well. BUT BEWARE!  The warm up is KILLER!  I mean you are moving from move to move and then you realize, Holy Crap this is still just the warm up!  Trust and believe you will get super warm. You will be breathing a little hard and possibly sweating. I love it I recommend it to anyone that is patient and will stick to the goal cause it won't happen overnight, BUT in one session you'll notice how you can stretch a little further. Just remember to relax and breath.",1400630400,,1118,3.96875
5000843,5,B006KN7ERS,I use this DVD maybe once a week along with some other stretching on my own and my flexibility has went up SO much. I got my side splits a lot faster than I thought I would and I've seen a lot of improvement with my center splits too.,1393804800,2,234,3.795918367346939
5000844,5,B006KN7ERS,"I was concerned after reading a few of the more negative reviews, but I must say I adore this set. Felix gives instructions in a way that does not make you feel stupid, and that are easy to follow and understand. She even explains how to really polish your dancing down to the little things like how you place your hands, or what way you place your feet. Artful, informative and entertaining. 10/10 This will really help me get to the level I want to.",1393286400,2,451,4.317647058823529
5000845,5,B006KN7ERS,"Fabulous introduction to the art of pole dancing, this single set will be all I ever need to meet my goals. Great instruction!",1392681600,,126,4.521739130434782
5000846,2,B006KN7ERS,"There are so many reasons to like this DVD: relaxing, soothing music; simple but luscious sets; Felix Cane is adorable and has a great voice and lovely vibe that I could totally spend an hour with ... BUT, man oh man, the cuing is TERRIBLE (and the warm up has no cuing at all!). Stretching exercises require very specific body placement and she gives very little description and/or feedback about what each area of your body should be doing what. This is especially frustrating (and dangerous) when doing stretches that require you to have your head down. Often in these situations she doesn't cue when she changes position and so you have to keep looking up at the TV to see what she is doing. This takes your body out of alignment and is a great way to get hurt. I've watched it once and probably will never watch it again. Too bad. Felix, this DVD has so much potential, but please go back and re-record the cuing!",1389657600,17,918,4.470238095238095
5000847,5,B006KN7ERS,"Just what I expected, The DVDs arrived on time. Felix teaches you with a lot of details so is easy to learn with her. Love it",1385251200,,125,3.8461538461538463
5000848,4,B006KN7ERS,"I want so bad to give this DVD a 5 star rating!  There are some fabulous stretches in here, things that you simply do not find on other DVDs.  If you get through the entire DVD in one day, there shouldn't be a muscle in your body that hasn't been stretched in every direction.

Felix is very good at explaining how a move should be done, and gives easier and harder moves for a lot of the stretches.  The set is clear, so you can see what is happening, the camera is almost always focused where it should be.  The music is great for stretching, though it is very soft so sometimes I'm not sure there is music playing, but that might be because I'm concentrating very hard on what I'm doing.  I like that you can pick and choose which parts to stretch in each session.  There are just so many good things to say about this DVD!

However, along with the good also comes the bad.  The warmup section does not have a voiceover, nor is she giving instructions, so there are times you are not facing the screen and she's moved on.  The same issue happens with some of the stretches.  There are stretches where you are literally face down on the floor and she does not que you to switch sides, get up, NOTHING.  Her queing tends to be very good on the first side (if it's the type of stretch you do left and right), but then for the 2nd side she says nothing at all, and since you frequently aren't looking at the television, you have to guess when it's time to switch.  It's frustrating enough to deduct one star from the rating.  For the price, these errors should have been caught.  Had it just been one or two times, I would have kept this a 5 star rating, but some of these positions you cannot do properly and watch the television to make up for the bad cues.",1384905600,12,1758,4.205970149253731
5000849,4,B006KN7ERS,"This is good for a total body stretch.  The music is a bit cheesy.  There is no consistent indication of switching positions so you have to keep an eye on the screen which can take away from the stretch, so have a timer and the remote ready.  I do like how their are different levels of difficulty that are suggested. Overall, this is a solid stretch routine.",1384732800,,359,4.3283582089552235

5000852,5,B006KN7ERS,"I love, love, love this dvd!!!

The warm up before the stretches definitely give me a nice work out and the stretches are amazing.  I have been doing this a couple of days throughout the week and I can tell a difference.  My body gets looser each time.

5000854,5,B006KN7ERS,"I have not watched all the videos but the stretching video is great. I also watched through the intermediate video and honestly I just love to watch Felix Cane she is an amazing artist. Everything she does is so smooth and that is what I hope to learn from these videos. I can do much of what is on them but I need a lot of improvement to make them look beautiful. I did not watch the beginner video but I would advise a beginner to take it easy and start with the first video because the intermediate video assumes you have a basic knowledge.

I am sure anyone who would like to learn pole dancing will benefit from these videos but they are also great for people that need to improve or advance the skills... or in my case become a little more graceful. I think a lot of people might feel like the videos are a little advanced when they watch a pro you just have to remember she has been doing it for a long time and it will take time to acquire the level of grace and flexibility and strength. Go at your own pace and master a few things then move on the the next thing.",1380499200,7,1073,4.085308056872038
5000855,5,B006KN7ERS,"I think this is a really good quality video set. She teaches a lot of moves and has good instructional technique. She starts at very basic levels and each move builds upon one another. She shows different variations on a lot of the moves so that you can incorporate your own style or learn how to work the move into a routine. She doesn't just show you the move, she shows you the move with good technique (for example when to arch your back, lowering or raising your hips, and proper angles and placement of body parts). She doesn't just gloss over things or assume you caught everything. You can adapt the moves for professional performance level dancing or for the bedroom. Felix cane really teaches you how to perform rather than just show off tricks. The set may seem pricy but it is a really great value compared to other videos. Most pole instruction videos are around $25-35 per dvd and there are only 10 moves. Her dvd's have over 40 moves per dvd plus routines. Note to beginners, always do the full warm-up before starting. you will thank me later.",1378252800,4,1059,4.520833333333333

5000857,5,B006KN7ERS,This video definitely can be used by anyone looking to stretch and become more flexible.... you don't have to pole dance to utilize this video in the least bit. I will say it will probably take some time to get to where Felix is body wise but still this video is just so rad and totally worth the money. I'm buying the other 3 after i've mastered the beginners foundations and am able to completely do the splits!,1376611200,3,413,4.3076923076923075
5000858,2,B006KN7ERS,"Bottom line up front: By the time you're strong enough to do most of the moves you probably won't need the DVDs.

I think some background on me would be good in case you're in my position.  When I bought the DVD set I had been taking pole classes for about 7 months and was going to graduate in a couple of months.  I'm not very strong in the arms and I could barely invert (had to kick into it), so I bought the DVD set hoping to improve my inverts and learn some new moves/floor moves.  I thought there was some interesting stuff in the beginner set, but I knew most of the moves, however the intermediate set was too hard.

Things you need to know:
1. This is NOT a work out.  There are no strength exercises to help you gain strength to perform moves.

2. She assumes a baseline of strength.  For example the beginner DVD teaches the tuck spin/cork screw/cradle spin  (different names for it).  The reverse grip is very hard for firs timers and you can hurt yourself doing it.  You really need to build your forearm strength before doing it. Also the first DVD shows prepping for invert  from the ground and the second DVD goes right into invert and complicated inversions, which may lead someone to think that learning from the ground will get them to invert.  You need to practice pole holds and do core work to invert properly.

3.  Someone mentioned a routine at the end.  It's like a 1.5 minute mini routine with crappy elevator music.  All she does is dance and does not do a step by step so you can learn and practice.  You would have to pause and memorize it.

4. Although she does not explain her routine she does do a good job explaining how to perform the moves.  So if you're a strong pole dancer you will probably like the DVDs.

5. My recommendation is only get this is you're a pretty strong pole dancer so you don't hurt yourself trying something.",1373414400,53,1867,4.322766570605188
5000859,5,B006KN7ERS,"I've only watched the intermediate DVD and a little of the stretching DVD so far (received it yesterday in the mail) but already I love it! The instruction is good. I'm taking an inversions class at a local pole studio so I'm not a beginner, but watching her instruction has helped me improve some of my more basic moves, and there are moves on the DVDs I haven't tried yet. I'm very excited to try the whole DVD set.",1373414400,2,417,4.291139240506329
5000860,5,B006KN7ERS,I had practiced four times without previous experience and I can performed the first cd. Moves fast into inverts but it is assumed we have worked strong muscles by regular workouts like push ups and one can lift our bodies at ease. Pole dancing is a strenuous workout but in time and practice can be done. Excellent instructor and lots to do per cd,1372982400,,348,4.453125
5000861,5,B006KN7ERS,I am amazed at the video quality! It is not like any workout video I have ever seen. Her voice is very pleasant. I also take class twice a week but even if I didn't this would help allot,1372896000,,186,3.7948717948717947
5000862,5,B006KN7ERS,I purchsed the Pole Dancing Video's for a friend of mine. The video's present moves and techniques in a easy to understand way. The video's are great.,1372377600,,150,4.592592592592593
5000863,5,B006KN7ERS,"As soon as I received this DVD, I grabbed my mat and tried it out. It started off very promising and I was enjoying the workout. About five minutes into the disc, it began to freeze. For the next 10 minutes it froze several times, and each time I had to stop and restart the disc for it to continue to play. At around the 16 minute mark, it froze once again, so I decided to stop it, remove it and re-insert it, however the disc would not eject from the player. I firmly believe that the disc is the problem and not the player. When submitting my request for a refund, there was a troubleshooting link on the page which specifically addresses the freezing issue, so the manufacturer is well aware of this problem and still sells the disc. Very disappointing.

After purchasing another disk, I must say that I am very satisfied with it. It plays with no problem and the stretches are really helping me increase my range of motion as well as helping to alleviate aches and pains. I love it.",1372204800,,988,4.34054054054054
5000864,5,B006KN7ERS,I love Felix Cane. I have learned a lot from these videos. I wished there were more combos and routines at the end. And some of the stretches are too advanced for my skill level. But I can work on that. Totally worth getting the box set all at once to save money. I think I might get Althea's or Jamilla DeVille's videos next for a little variety.,1370304000,,347,4.117647058823529
5000865,5,B006KN7ERS,Good for any dancer or for someone that wants to be more flexible. Just have to put in the time.,1369440000,2,96,3.85
5000866,5,B006KN7ERS,"I purchased Felix Cane's DVD series in particular because of her extensive dance background. Since I also have 18 years of ballet under my belt, and understand that ballerinas prioritize form & safety prior to trying 'tricks', I knew Felix's DVD set was the way to go. This series is really beneficial for those who want to learn tricks at home safely and beautifully. She focuses on form, flexibility and artistry so that the moves are performed correctly and beautifully. Who would want anything other than that?! Personally I found the 'beginner' DVD to be too easy for my taste, but it is very useful for those who need to learn the basics from a safety perspective (correct placement of hands to prevent injury, and basic spins, etc.). The jump from intermediate to advanced in the DVD series is very large.. and you're learning HER moves the way SHE performs them in her competitions, so the advanced DVD is very difficult. But if you practice the moves in the way she instructs, anyone can learn the moves (intermediate moves, at least) with enough determination. Awesome DVD series! 5 stars! :)",1368144000,2,1102,4.8052631578947365
5000867,2,B006KN7ERS,"I'm taking pole classes and I'm about to graduate. My studio is very limited on what it teaches and they have not done a good job of teaching us how to transition, smooth our moves,walk gracefully, or do interesting floor moves.  Don't get me wrong we were taught stuff, but it's very basic.  I've searched through youtube and have seen people at my level doing much more fluid movements so I decided to get the Felix Cane box set, and this video came in it.  Originally I was just going to buy this DVD, because I wanted something to help me be more graceful, but I'm glad I got the box set.

This DVD does not really show you how to do anything.  She has a bunch of tips (most of which I already knew) on how to choreograph a routine.  She does talk about proper toe point, posture, ways to position your hand, the best position for poses (sideways to the audience), and how to create long lines.  Other than that you won't learn any new tricks, transitions, or floor moves.  Therefore I suggest people get the box set because the set has 5 (I think DVDs) and it ends up being cheaper.  Plus you won't feel like you got ripped off.",1367539200,11,1133,4.28169014084507

I love this dvd she explains every move and how to execute the moves smoothly and as sensual and slow as it should be. She also explains to build your strength and take your time, its not intimidating at all Im a thick women and it makes me feel sexy and confident, I recommend this series to anyone and everyone.

Felix Cane, has great tips, and she explains all the moves very well and in detail.  I have purchased Alethea Austins new and old instructional DVD sets, but comparing the two, Alethea's are lacking the professional standpoint which Felix demonstrates in her DVD set.  I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about pole fitness classes, this would be a good place to start, I would recommend it also for the advanced as well, I am advanced and have learned a lot of cool things from these DVD's that I didn't know of before.",1362268800,5,818,4.5

The stretching one is really great, and is broken down by parts of the body (glutes, wrists & shoulders, splits, etc).  Each stretch is fully explained, and she gives modifications for many of them as well.  The floor work video includes cute spins around the pole, and other floor work.

I saw the youtube's videos from Felix and found she has an amazing Flexibility dvd, but I wouldn't stop there. Saw the box set and thought it would be amazing, and it is. Really down to earth, you can follow her sweet voice explaining the positions in a very easy way. I loved the Flexibility DVD and am amazed with the whole box set.

This set may be good for a pole fitness enthusiast who has a decent understanding of pole mechanics but I don't recommend the set for beginners or advanced dancers. It seemed as though it went from way too easy in the first 2 disks to extremely advanced in the final disk. Perhaps if you're well trained already the Advanced DVD would be worth purchasing alone, but skip the full set. As for the Stretching DVD, there are far better one's out there that are better in both routine design and in verbal directions.",1433635200,3,715,4.59375
8500199,5,B006KN7ERS,"Videos like this are better as a supplement to in person training. This set is great for reference or exploring new moves and is well organized. However,  if you hoping to start from scratch, it will be difficult. As previous reviews state,  a perquisite of strength is assumed. This is normal. If you are a complete novice,  work on strength training and stretches first and attend classes. Feedback from a live person and also spotting will help you learn safer and better. This video set is fantastic if you have that knowledge base. Also when you first try inverts,  be sure to have a spot or begin by solidifying your chopper. It's also good to begin virgin to decrease reliance on grip products as too much can hinder you and tear your skin off on moves like death drops or ones with many transitions if you apply to not vital areas.",1430524800,,839,4.5364238410596025
