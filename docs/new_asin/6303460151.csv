660236,1,6303460151,"Anymore, when the name Robert Altman is raised, a bored lull enrapts the room--Pret-a-Porter is no exception.  This time Altman takes the audience on a two-hour tour of the pretentiousness of the fashion industry.  With no  apparant plot, the all-star cast is reduced to small talk (a key element in  any Altman film).  The mediocre and sparsely placed comedic moments are not  enough to keep the viewers attention for the duration of the film.  The  high point of the film came from Bassinger's deliberately bad southern  accent as she narrates this tale of sick photographers, perverse fashion,  and the effects alcohol has on two complete strangers.",927676800,3,652,5.066037735849057

660308,4,6303460151,"Hey, I aint no haute couture guy, I aint no fashionista. Dont give a damn about Pret-a-Porter or Seventh Avenue. Only time I was on that latter street was to score some righteous dope from a foxy ready to wear model that a friend of mine knew and who was foxy in other ways too. Hell growing up I was into flannel shirts (brown checkered ones), black chino pants, uncuffed, cool in my circle then as against nerds who wore cuffed pants if you can believe that, clunky work boots and midnight sunglasses wore especially after midnight. Not much more differently than I am attired these days except when for professional reason I suit up with the rest of the nine to five crowd.

Yeah, I was a faux beat guy, emulating Alan Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and the crowd a little after their time but before the hippie garb of my own generation took hold. That garb of mine which drew mostly weird stares in high school and few dates from girls except the ones who wore all black and were as alienated as I was, would translate not too badly in the later counter-cultural fashion statement. A time when lots of off-beat stuff got a reprieve for a moment before the world went back to business as usual and us, most of us with it.

So that is the sum of my fashion statement. Except I know what I like, know what I like when it comes to movies, you know films, and so if I see the name director Robert Altman attached to a film then I am in for a look almost despite the subject matter. Despite the fact that this film, Ready to Wear something of an oxymoron if you ask me if you looking even as a goof into the world of high fashion, deals exclusively with the going and coming during the annual Paris fashion week.

The fact of the matter was in grabbing this one an all-star cast, an ensemble all-star cast as was Altmans favorite way to address some subject he was interested all the way back to his classic Nashville and before, also made me inquisitive. Such old (okay, okay mature) stars as Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastrioanni as head-liners, young ones like Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts early in their careers and a whole whos who of middle-level Hollywood film names added to the pot. Of course the plot line in this one as in many of Altmans films (that Nashville again being an early model) is a throw away as he is looking at the foibles of whatever cultural gradient he is taking aim at. An alleged murder of a high ranking bureaucrat in the fashion industry by Marcello raising a red flag, a false red flag as it turned out in the end, was the vehicle used by Altman to take a slice of life look at the very high end of the fashion industry, the place where price does not matter, is not even mentioned in gentile society as long as people, the right people look in the right way. High fashion has gotten so much play lately, is in  with its own series of reality television shows showing a candid world how pieces of cloth get turned into, okay, okay beautiful if in some cases off-the-wall clothes.

Along the way there are many sub-stories, some rather mundane like the wife of a retail buyers shopping spree. A few worthy of note like the race between three high-powered fashion editors for a well-known fashion magazines over acquiring a certain highly regarded fashion photographer and how he turned the tables on all three, a fling between Tim and Julia who wind up never leaving their hotel room the whole week and watching the thing on television between bouts of love-making, and the various sex-apades of the well-known designers and their consorts and lovers running the gamut from assumed heterosexual love to the well-known gay life epidemic in the industry and everything in between-and outside.

Of course there was that silly over-riding faux murder plot that was so much hot air but the real star, the real story here is the incredible efforts necessary to produce high end fashion. That and the intense competition among the designers to be the new next best thing the thing that women talk about over lunch or at the water cooler although stuff they are very unlikely to buy whether they could afford to or not. This old beat flannel shirt, chinos, work boots guy has to admit that while some of the fashions might be over the top some of them are really works of art. This confirmed to me that the trend toward showing fashion trends past and present in art museums is the right move. If you like Robert Altman films or like high fashion this one is for you.  And no I still aint no fashionista-okay.",1463356800,,4525,4.464328899637243

It has some kind of story which is irrelevant, and many vignettes, or cameos, joined together in some slightly coherent manner, which again, doesn't really matter.

Looking at beautiful women is hardly a chore, and there were some genuine laughs along the way.  The film editor (whoever that was) had the most difficult job, and handled it magnificently.

660313,5,6303460151,"Im actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the Ready To Wear (Pret A Porter) and Im glad to have bought it. The movie opens with a big-time fashion mogul unexpectedly dying. You actually see the people who were actually in contact with him minutes before his passing, however even the nature of his death at first poses a mystery. The fashion  moguls death is a big deal because of the wealth and power that he had in the fashion world. As commonly known, there are a slew of famous actors, actresses, celebrities, and models in the film (which could take up the length of another review) such as Sophie Loren as Isabella De Fontaine, Julia Roberts as Ann Eisenhower,Kim Basinger, Cher, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christiansen, Terri Garr (I recently seen her in the Michael movie), Tracey Ullmann and as I said before many more famous people featured in this film. One must have an open mind because of the love scenes that are in this film. For instance, there is a hilarious scene where the characters of Cort Romney (Richard E. Grant),  and Cy Bianco (Forest Whitaker) are caught by their lovers in a makeshift city bus in the middle of a fashion show when they also see that their lovers are also involved with each other (not so much just a love triangle but whatever it is called when four people are involved). There are also pop culture references in the film such as when three of the characters are introduced as employees of British Vogue, Elle, and Harpers Bazaar.",1438732800,,1483,4.634980988593156

660372,3,6303460151,"A complete hodgepodge of intersecting and interwoven and conflicting storylines make up the lavishly entertaining yet uniformly mediocre `Pret-a-Porter', a film that has charm and pizzazz and yet lacks a lot of everything else.  With an inspired cast that makes the most of their character's bounty of wit and sarcasm, `Pret-a-Porter' feels like Robert Altman lite, capitalizing on his obvious signature construction and yet failing to feel inspired.  It's fun, but shallow, and while it tries to give the faade of something more, it is nothing more than just that; a faade.  In a world obsessed with fashion and reality shows like `Project Runway', `Pret-a-Porter' may find a nice audience in the here and now, but it has about as much substance as those reality shows as well, so if you want to look at pretty clothes and catty people, this will make your day.  An insightful satire, this is not, even though it wants so badly to be.  Forest Whitaker and Kim Basinger are best in show here and deliver hilarious supporting roles that are bound to steal your attention.

I did not want to give it a ""1"" rating but had to chose so I could give my review.  The very first scene had me wondering if this would be worth watching, no it wasn't. Sophia Loren dealing with doggie doo is NOT funny. I do not know why movie producers, et al. seem to think using bathroom behavior and vulgar language is appealing/funny to movie/TV viewers. The story line never made it as funny and all the above ""1 star reviews"" have stated it quite well. To see the models parade naked was a shock and just more tasteless writing and acting . Naked in the media (movies, TV, newsprint) is not pretty nor entertaining!!  The Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Kim Basinger, Linda Hunt, Marcello Mastroianni et al. characters were hideous and the acting was clumsy. Well, for what it is worth, all of the acting was hideous and clumsy. I never got the plot of the story. I do not keep up with directors, producers, writers only recognize certain actors.

660454,4,6303460151,"If you're a longtime fan of Robert Altman's comedies  ( ""M*A*S*H"" is a good example) then ""Ready to Wear"" should satisfy .
Altman has always been a ""Hit n' Miss"" director ( much like Woody Allen) even to his supporters.
""Ready to Wear"" is often silly, then subtle and at times almost surreal and much of it's success as a ensemble comedy can be attributed to the all-star, international cast.
So, if you enjoy Altman's brand of off-beat filmmaking ""Ready to Wear"" should fit like a glove.",1359072000,,488,4.609195402298851
660455,3,6303460151,"Although it is seemingly another delightfully aimless stream-of-consciousness all-star cast of Altman frothiness -- this time centered around the inanity of fashion week and all those who continue to make it happen -- this film was, in fact, created for one sole purpose, and that was to push for more stringent pooper-scooper laws in said city of poop/fashion lights. Apparently, still fashion and poop and poop-fashion reign supreme in Paris. Also, Altman is dead. So, really, nothing much good has happened since this film was released.",1313884800,,539,5.27906976744186
660456,5,6303460151,"Robert Altman (1925-2006), a very productive US director, liked crowds and handled meandering and interlinked stories very well. Prt--porter (1994), a  fashion show for ready-made clothes, plays in Paris, immediately following his The Player (1992) and Short Cuts (1993), both five star cases as well. Prt--porter, like most of his films, is ideal for Altman's favourite technique of cameo appearances (Harry Belafonte. Paolo Bulgari. Naomi Campbell, Anello Capuano  and many more), with a host of international stars, models and designers. The film may be best known for its many cameo appearances and its final scene.

It is quite obviously difficult to do justice to all and everybody, so the (US) National Board of Review gave its 1994 Award (""Best Acting by an Ensemble"") to - all and everybody: Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Kim Basinger, Chiara Mastroianni, Stephen Rea, Anouk Aime, Rupert Everett, Rossy de Palma, Tara Leon, Georgianna Robertson, Lili Taylor, Ute Lemper,  Forest Whitaker, Tom Novembre, Richard E Grant, Anne Canovas, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Lyle Lovett, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Linda Hunt, Teri Garr, Danny Aiello, Jean Rochefort and Michel Blanc.

Apart from, a bit like film-in-film in Truffaut's La nuit Amricaine, the many fashion shows within  fashion shows add to the turbulence of the movie, it has a hilarious self-parody by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, which, like so much in this movie, is originally triggered by lost (actually: misplaced and later found) luggage. Labiche and slapstick rather than communication and comprehension, nutty like Jerry Lewis, but a lot more refined, I needed two viewings until I was ready for my third, where I finally got the whole story together. And had a big, long laugh. Not all Altman is five star to me, but that which is, is hall of fame quality.",1313107200,2,1885,5.266666666666667

Personally, I enjoy it - Robert Altman can do good satire, and this is a good one. Sure, you'll probably have to watch it several times (and possibly even do some studying) in order to get all the various jokes and scathing comments about the fashion world and about Paris... but it's fun.

There's a lot of serious talent in this film - Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Kim Basinger, Stephen Rea, Rupert Everett, Forest Whitaker, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall... the list goes on.

While it seems to be primarily a murder mystery set in the world of high fashion, it is a lovely satire on the industry itself, and what people find acceptable. The end sequence with the ""emperor's new clothes"" fashion show is highly enjoyable in itself - not just because of the nudity, but because of what it says about the fashion industry.

Considering that the fashion industry is all about labels, the all-star cast is very appropriate, including:  Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Linda Hunt, and Lyle Lovett.

The story's parallel to the confusion prevalent in huge expositions, such as fashion shows, etc.  We have murder, nudity, sex, and gossip--all the tender morsels the news feeds on.  If you're a fashionista or someone who loves poking fun at the world of design, you're probably going to love this film.

Not everybody likes modern art.  Some people like something more traditional.

It is visually alluring while poking gentle fun at everything that comes within its scope, from the omnipresent dog poop on Parisian sidewalks to grand hotels, journalists, editors, purchasers, and, of course, fashion designers. Sophia Loren shows that one of the most beautiful women in the world can remain gorgeous long past the time most of us have stopped looking in the mirror; Julia Roberts, arriving in a wine stained ""greatest mom"" T-shirt, gives a superb performance as a classy alcoholic; Marcello Mastroianni looks suitably sinister, worried, sweet, and down-home in turn, lurking around every corner and wielding a mean handheld sewing machine ;-), and Kim Basinger is the TV anchor we all love to hate, but with a difference...

Aside from visual feasts the movie depicts this lifestyle in a honest way, kinda like how Office Space depicts the office life.  One scene is when these two ladies who are staying next to each other talk to each other politely as they walk each other to their hotel rooms.  When they arrive at their doors they bid their farewells and then one goes to the left and the other to the right, and as they both turn the doorknobs they both discover that the doors are locked.  AWKWARD!  well the awkwardness is depicted beautifully as they both utter polite laughts he he... if you are incapable of appreciating that then you're right, you might be too shallow to enjoy this movie!

-Sophia Loren who I've never thought to be all THAT is in this and has a fair share of camera time, and BOY did I just change my mind!  It seems she is gorgeous now that she's old but I never really saw it when she was young.  Kim Basinger admires her jewelry :-).
-Cameo by Cher (she gets interviewed)
-Jean Paul Gaultier is in it (he gets interviewed)
-There are scenes of Paris shopping in it
-There is are cute dogs (although in the first scene, S. Loren shakes her dog a little but I'll just think she makes up for it)
-I could go on and on!!!  If you are attracted to the title in the first place, WHY WOULDN'T you like this movie??  O!  Just thought of something:

Barbara Shulgasser's writing is wonderful, and if it has been chopped up like cole slaw by Altman's fitful direction, and by the generally improvisatory style embodied by Kim Basinger's steamrolling fashion reporter, it is still Altman who gives the picture its life, its joie de vivre.  And the fantastic outfits are to die for, each one crazier than the last.

Sophia Loren is so over the top in this one role that retrospectively her entire career takes on a veneer of camp Carlo Ponti could never have intended.  If she was Elton John her sunglasses couldn't get any vaster, like two TV screens perched on her nose, and her breasts bobbing like apples in the tub of her sausage cased cleavage deserve equal billing with Mastroianni, who perhaps overdoes his sad sack clown persona.  Together they're not so much fun as you'd think, but she's great.  Is there any black satin left in the world or was all of it used for her widows' wear!

My favorite, Anouk Aimee, gets all the drama parts.  Why didn't Altman use Anouk Aimee more, she is simply the most striking and hawklike actress who ever lived!  She and Rupert Everett as her avaricious son are playing out whole 3 decker Balzac novels with their back and forth, their mutual accusations of greed and contempt.

OK, there are some inanities to READY TO WEAR, and I'm never sure if Forest Whitaker isn't laughing up his sleeve or revealing new previously unknown dimensions to his private life, but all in all it is a movie for the ages, and my favorite by Altman (except for NASHVILLE and A WEDDING).  Maybe its angle about fashion being stupid is itself pretty banal, but you know, I just don't care any more.  If it's on, I'll watch it all the way through and I'll cry when it's over, just like Julia Roberts pretending her lost luggage hasn't yet been delivered to her closet.",1178064000,11,2115,4.5488126649076515
660593,1,6303460151,"Ok the title of my review may seem odd, but if you ever see this movie you will understand.  I tried as a test of wills to watch this movie from beginning to end on at least 3 occassions and I found my self at some point or another contemplating the universe and life in general. I would then snap back to the real world and realize i had missed some half hour or so of the film. So if you are in need of sleep or want to contemplate the sound of one hand clapping this movie is for you",1148601600,4,486,3.8118811881188117
660594,5,6303460151,"This is one of my favourite films.
Many of the critics of this movie missed the point. This movie is not about plot or characters. Robert Altman does what movies are for; he takes us to another place.
What Altman does is give us a vivid impression of the incestuous whirl of the fashion world. His world is populated by both real designers (as ever spotting them is half the fun). and wonderful performances such as Richard E. Grant as a male Vivienne Westwood.
The movie also effectively transports us to Paris. And yes, Paris really is covered in ""Dog Poop"" (they were Paris jokes, not Poop jokes).
I think that many of the jokes about Paris, may have gone over the heads of US movie critics who have not set foot outside LA and New York.
One of the reviews of this movie described the fashion shows as ""pointless"". They were pointless in the same way a Monet is pointless; they were in the movie because they are beautiful.
To summarise, if you love Paris and you love fashion, you will love this. The closing credits of a montage of Issey Miyake and other fashion shows set to Grace Jones' ""La Vie En Rose"" is worth the price of admission alone.",1051401600,43,1149,4.4245283018867925
660595,3,6303460151,"I really had hoped this movie would be better. There really wasn't too much of a plot. There certainly are cute elements.

I can't really say a whole lot for the movie--Sorry:(",1017878400,2,240,4.738095238095238
660596,2,6303460151,"Whilst Prt A Porter might be taken as a sly dig at the Paris fashion industry, its appeal is probably limited to those it satirises, that is the designers, models, buyers, journalists, and other hangers-on.
Someone close to the world of these famous designers with their peculiar costumes and logos might get every one of the jokes, references, and even know that some of the real-life people the characters are based on.
The problem is that this world is an exclusive one. Whilst This Is Spinal Tap and The Blues Brothers satirised an industry and an art form known to many, the Paris fashion scene is available only a select few. For an object lesson in how to spoof the fashion business without alienating the general public, see Absolutely Fabulous.
The impressive roster of actors in the film (Sophia Loren, Lauren Bacall, Richard Grant, and Julia Roberts to name but four) and the directorial talents of Robert Altman are really wasted on a movie that is of such limited appeal.",1001289600,14,984,4.794117647058823
660597,3,6303460151,"And that about sums up what I have to say about ""Pret a Porter"". Worst part: Julia Roberts (I wish the rest of America would get wise to her lack of talent). Best part: Seeing Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni reunite. Marcello was her old beau, and now they have a second chance at love, about 40 years late. I laughed out loud at their scenes, cursed the darkness that is Julia Roberts.
Try on ""Ready to Wear/Pret a Porter"" and see how the fit suits you.",999648000,16,460,4.2988505747126435
660598,1,6303460151,"When ""plot-less"" movies come out now and then; Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"", or Fellini's ""Amarcord"" some of these films work (like the two I mentioned) but some don't. When you make a career out of making films like that, like Altman has, your films usually become hit or miss. Movies that are structured like this can be praised or criticized for the same reasons. Either you can enjoy some of the bits, like the acting between certain people, and think some scenes work and some didn't, but you still enjoyed yourself. Or the other way to look at it is; you didn't like the fact that there's no central charcaters, no real relationship between the viewer and the actors involved. And, it doesn't feel ""complete"".  Now, I'm not a really big fan of Altman's. I'm just starting to get into his films. Some of his movies work like ""M.A.S.H"", and ""The Player"", and the more recent ""Dr. T & The Women"". Others don't work as well such as ""Popeye"", what was he thinking!! And this film. The real problems with this movie are the fact that number one it carries no energy. It just lags around, trying to pick up some steam only it never does. The characters are not real at all, but, I'll excuse that because after all this is a comedy. Are the characters in ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Scary Movie"" real? No! The movie takes on more that it could handled. There were certain things that only could of made this film work. Like the whole story involving Rupert Everett (Jack Lowenthal) selling his mother's Anouk Aimee (Simone Lowenthal) fashion company. They could of been negotiating and Simone doesn't like what she's hearing and starts yelling as loud as she could while the models are on the runway. That could of been funny. But no time is paid to that part of the story. It's one scene. In one short scene they talk about it, and we never hear them mention it again. Then there was the fashion editors who wanted to get a photographer. They could of worked a lot more on this part of the movie. Or the stuff involving Sophia Loren (Isabella da la Fontaine), Marcello Mastroianni (Sergio) and Jean-Pierre Cassel (Oliver de la Fontaine) if they would of work it so what happens, happens while the show is going on, that could of been interesting also. But the script by Altman and Barbara Shulgasser barely touches these themes. Too many scenes don't work, it just becomes boring after a while. For older movie fans, try to remember those all-star cast movies of the 60's. Where there wasn't really a plot, but, it was all just an excuse to get a bunch of famous people in a movie, think about ""What's New Pussycat"" or ""Casino Royale"". That's sorta what this movie is like, without the laughs. We see a lot of famous people like Kim Basinger, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Terri Garr, Danny Aiello, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Lyle Lovett(Why is he even in this?  lol), Forest Whitaker and Laren Bacall(!). And if you were to ask me why. I wouldn't be able to answer you, there're just there to be there. The movie also has a score by Michel Legrand (Watch What Happens, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?). Really bad movie by Altman, truly one of the worst movies of the year it came out.",991612800,9,3190,4.536458333333333
660599,1,6303460151,"My patience with films and filmmakers is high, regardless of length or pacing.  I watched the five-hour version of ""Fanny and Alexander"" in one afternoon with considerable pleasure.  Conversely, I've sat through incredible stinkers to the last frame, hoping for some worthwhile glimmer that never came.  With a director as demonstrably talented as Robert Altman, it seems impossible that he could create a film sufficiently awful to send me running from the theater in mid-movie.
But he did.
""Ready to Wear"" is unbearable.  Painful.  Unspeakable.  There's nothing here except a colossal waste of talent.  It's not bad in the right way to be unintentionally funny, and God knows the intentional ""comedy"" isn't funny.  Stay far away from this cinematic torture.",984441600,13,759,5.266666666666667

There is a dozen endings that don't make much sense and there is a whole lot in between. With about  a hundred characters that do, or do not have anything in common it gets to  be just a little bit confusing. I had to watch this three times, before I  could keep track of who was who. Think of the Ten Commandments but then  with all the extra's playing parts compatible to Yul Brinner's and you get  the idea. Altman tried, but this goes nowhere, with perhaps one in every  ten plotlines holding any interest. 'Shortcuts' was a hundred times better.",950140800,4,673,4.387096774193548
660601,2,6303460151,"Robert Altman's indictment of the fashion industry has a few high points---the parody of ""Striptease"" with Mastroianni and Loren, photographer Stephen Rea's hilarious ""revenge tactics"" against  three fashion editors, and the subplot wherein reporters Julia Roberts and  Tim Robbins find themselves stuck in a hotel room together and spend the  whole weekend making love---(not a bad predicament for Robbins's  character!!).  Unfortunately, Altman fails to develop any of his subplots  or characters fully, and the remainder of the film is ersatz and boring:  lengthy, pointless scenes of runway models that serve no purpose other than  conveying the ""feel"" of the fashion world. A few plot points make  little sense... watch it and see if you can figure out why Marshall Fields  tycoon Danny Aiello winds up in drag! According to Julia Roberts in an  interview, Altman and his cast had a heyday making Pret-a-Porter, and  that's obvious from the resultant picture.
