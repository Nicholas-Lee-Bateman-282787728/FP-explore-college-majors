1729593,4,B000068V9U,"This Australian film is a truly touching film regarding love and human passions.  Thandiwe is a lovely Ugandan student in an all-girl's boarding school in 1965, and she has to deal with both the blatant racism she's confronted with and the political turmoil in her country.  Danny is an Australian at the all-boy's school across the lake whom she develops an interest in, and then a relationship.
This film is about a lot more than clumsy sex among teenagers; it's about loss, honor, repression, and desires.  It is indeed a very moving tale.  And it features an early performance by Nicole Kidman in which she does a far better job than her later work.",972691200,5,653,4.701754385964913
1729594,5,B000068V9U,"A wonderful, wonderful coming-of-age story of teenagers discovering love.  I've never understood why this movie was not more popular.  But if you've never seen it, the video gives you an opportunity to make up for what you  missed out on.
Other reviewers have described the plot accurately; it  remains only for me to say that everything was done beautifully in this  movie.  One tip: If you're an adult, DON'T watch this video with teenagers  in the room.  They are too immature, and they will spoil it by giggling and  sniggering at the most moving and sensitive scenes.  But DO see it!",964396800,2,588,4.732673267326732
1729595,4,B000068V9U,"Don't let the title fool you.  Although this is one of the sweetest movies you'll ever see, it is no beach blanket bingo for bimbos.  This is an Aussie story of teen love set in 1965, heroic as only teens can play it.  It is fun to watch, authentic and original at the same time, a coming of  age flick in the English boarding school tradition of ""Dead Poet's Society""  (1989) and ""A Separate Peace"" (the novel, not the so-so movie).  Noah  Taylor stars as Danny Embling, an outsider who reads Sartre and Camus while  satirizing the school's empty traditions.  Across the lake is the girl's  school where Thandiwe Adjewa (Thandie Newton), daughter of the Ugandan  ambassador, is learning to meld with the Aussie pale faces, including a  gifted pre-Hollywood Nicole Kidman.

Thandie Newton and Noah Taylor, as  beautifully directed by John Duigan, are the reasons this film is so good.  She has a fearless integrity about her that overcomes the prejudices of her  school mates.  He is wise and brave at a hundred and twenty pounds.  She  too is ultra sophisticated.  She even met Sartre.  This is a story about  the love between two outsiders who, with their strength of character win  over not only their classmates, but the audience as well.  Imagine  teenagers as witty and poised as say Eartha Kitt and Gore Vidal, and you  get a hint of how it's played.

Nicole Kidman as the snobby Nicola  Radcliffe (the name says it all) manages a subtle supporting role with a  diamond-in-the-rough kind of charm and just the right touch of on-screen  growth.  The scene where she shares her stash of vodka (or perhaps a clear  fruit liquor) with Thandiwe Adjewa is beautifully turned by Director John  Duigan.  Also excellent is the hotel scene where the adults are revealed as  intrusive in the extreme.  I like Danny Embling's line as he deadpans to a  re-robing Thandiwe, ""They're all funny, aren't they?""  Yes, those adults  are a little peculiar.

This is not unflawed, however.  The ending,  despite the rousing music, seemed a bland washout, leaving us with a sense  of disappointment.  And I thought the first love scene with the two  ""touching"" was a little unreal.  I mean he might have kissed her!  There's  a limit to how great a coming of age, boarding school movie can be,  especially when the adults have only scarecrow parts.  Nonetheless  ""Flirting"" is a confectioner's delight, and one of the best coming of age  movies I've ever seen.

1729596,4,B000068V9U,"Too tired of Hollywood's overdone coming-of-age fused + love themes? Well, Flirting, despite its superfluous title which almost misled me, is a complex film with a heavy touch of sincerity and authenticity.  One of  those rare films which really give the audience a creepy sensation of  gaping at characters' on-going lives as if peeping from the small window of  a dark room, the main ""flirting"" grows between 2 misfits from 2  worlds as distant as an all-boy school and an all-girl school sitting  across a lake.
Wonderful acting here by Noah Taylor who breathes the  air of a stuttering outsider--Danny Embling, a much teased ""geek""  who finds solace in mental superiority in a conformitist boarding school  setting. Also, before moving onto bigger things such as Beloved, Thandie  Newton portrays a fiery Ugandan beauty very much ostracised by her racist  surroundings. What nourishes the feeble threat that first hold the two  lonely hearts together is their shared vision of intellectual, political,  as well as sexual freedom. An odd romance springs between the two as they  carry on subtle flirting on debate teams, across the lake as DAnny rows to  another midnite rendezvous, and eventually an exploration of the body that  is by no means marred by its intensity.
Certainly without the banal  lightheartedness of jovial teen movies made too frequently in the U.S.,  director John Duigan masters the art of manipulating an audience in this  1991 film, also featuring a young Nicole Kidman, brilliant in her pivotal  role of a supressed head girl carefully protecting the fragile young love  she senses Danny and Thandiwe. Dark and deep into youthful souls, Flirting  brings to mind serious matters such as Uganda's Idi Amin years.  Our  star-crossed young lovers never whisper the sweet word ""love""  into each other's ears, yet through every touch and every glimpse, the  audience is led into a sweet realm of love in its purest form w/out being  tainted by physical emphasis, but rather decorated with lavish strokes of  reality--Danny and Thandiwe's compromise between lust and respect.",948153600,9,2097,5.142433234421365
1729597,5,B000068V9U,Thandie Newton is a great actress.  She stole the show with her performance as the only black in a predominately white environment. Her character couldn't isoloate herself from the rest but she couldn't let her  guard down.  I hope to see her in more films.,916617600,,257,4.666666666666667

1729609,4,B000068V9U,"Adjacent boys' and girls' boarding schools in 1960's Australia are exposed as lonely for those unwilling or unable to fit in.  Teachers are barely able to prevent chaos, therefore getting kids to treat each other kindly is far above their expectations.  It's easy to believe a scrawny smart boy would sneak off to see the smart African girl.  Both despise the petty cruelty and pecking order of the athletic kids.  Nicole Kidman was too old for this film but parlayed that into being a sort of ""unofficial administrator.""  Naomi Watts was even better as an unspoiled introverted beauty.",1390176000,,586,4.938775510204081
1729610,5,B000068V9U,I saw this film in the theater when it was current and have loved returning to it over and over again. It stars Noah Taylor and a young Thandie Newton as they navigate first love at two private schools acrooss a lake from each other in Australia. A young Nicole Kidman also plays an important role. It is the sweetest story without being at all soppy. I've lent this film to many friends and it never fails to get a great response.,1369267200,,431,4.2682926829268295
1729611,4,B000068V9U,"The film is set somewhere in Australia in the mid 1960's.  I don't think it was mentioned where, but it was filmed in New South Wales.  There is an all boys school and an all girls school separated by a small lake.  We've seen this set up plenty of times before thanks to Hollywood's obsession with teenage sexual hijinks.  In this case however we get a sophisticated coming of age story involving 2 social outcasts.  Noah Taylor is terrific as Danny who is a sometime stutterer but rebellious and very smart.  He is smitten by Thandiwe played by an 18 year old Thandie Newton in her first film.  Thandiwe is from Uganda but is living at the private school while her dad and step-mom work at a nearby university.  Naturally, she's an outcast as she is the only person of color in the school.  Racism isn't overplayed in the film but it's still there.  The real controversy is the lengths the budding lovers go to see each other.  The romance is gentle and exploratory as is their first attempt at sex.  Hey, it's been a long time but it seemed very authentic and sweet.  The film is directed by John Duigan and is the second of a trilogy.  While it certainly stands on its own I'm going to search out the first one ""The Day My Voice Broke"".  Also look out for Naomi Watts as one of Thandiwe's few friends and Nicole Kidman as Nicola, a sympathetic upper classmen.",1320019200,,1363,4.417670682730924

1729614,2,B000068V9U,Young Thandie and Nicole in a boring movie.  If you are collecting movies about either actress leave this one out.  I would have given it one star but seeing the two acting together is a two star novelty.,1237420800,,204,4.342105263157895
1729615,5,B000068V9U,"""Flirting"", John Duigan's sly yet tender 1991 'Coming of Age' comedy is still, a decade and a half after it's release, one of the better teen comedies ever made, and is even more enjoyable today, as a showcase for future stars Nicole Kidman, Thandie Newton, Naomi Watts, and Noah Taylor.

While the elements of the story are familiar (boys and girls boarding schools, separated by a lake...raging hormones...a geeky hero 'proving' himself, romantically), don't be too quick to lump ""Flirting"" in with ""Porky's"" or the ""American Pie"" films. Despite brief graphic nudity, and some coarse humor, the film has a depth that it's American counterparts never achieve, and characters that defy stereotyping. Danny 'Bird' Embling (Taylor) is caned, early in the film, and soon falls for black African girl, Thandiwe Adjewa (Newton), with the 1960s setting providing elements of racism and political upheaval in Africa to the story's mix. The 'virgin queen' of the girl's school (Kidman) isn't as 'full of herself' as an American film might have portrayed her; the imperious facade she presents to the world masks a shy, sensitive teen who hides her sexual curiosity and vulnerability.

With intelligence and respect, Duigan never 'dumbs down' the leads (would a reference to Camus ever appear in an American teen comedy?), and makes the first sexual experience between Embling and Adjewa both naive and sexy, without being overtly graphic. This tastefulness extends to the motel climax of the children's affair; Duigan eschews the quick laughs of ""American Pie II"", focusing, instead, on the very real embarrassment all parties would face, if discovered 'in the act'.

Another 'plus' for the film is the attention paid to the day-to-day activities of the boarding schools; rugby, debates, a school dance, a dramatic production, even the repetitive menu of the school lunch, 'grounds' the film in a reality that makes the characters' reactions even funnier.

1729617,4,B000068V9U,"I'm not sure why many reviewers are calling this a coming of age film.  They seem to me to be already very much of age, perhaps even into mid-life even before reaching university.  Although hers somewhat more than his, their maturity shows in their adult mannerisms and how they don't get defensive in dealing with others.  There's a moving scene between the fathers after the school play when, in an empathic way, one says to the other, ""I'm not surprised (you don't talk about it).  It must be very hard for anyone to understand how tough it was.""

1729628,5,B000068V9U,"Despite the cover art on the DVD case, this excellent film doesn't star Nicole Kidman, although she does give a fine supporting performance -- no, the story belongs to Noah Taylor & Thandie Newton, as the two misfits at two boarding schools in the mid-1960s. And it's a lovely, very funny, poignant story of two similar souls finding one another, and experiencing the joys of first love together. Unlike too many American ""teen films,"" it approaches sex with wonder, bemusement, a touch of uncertainty & and an equal touch of bliss. Loneliness is the undercurrent here, avoided by most of the students who have learned to fit in, but clearly affecting the more sensitive among them. And here's where Nicole Kidman's performance is so good: as an icy upperclass student, she reveals her own insecurities & very human longings in a touching scene of empathy with Thandie Newton, late in the film. In short, a tender & touching love story with two very real teenagers -- highly recommended!",1141603200,8,987,4.880952380952381
1729629,5,B000068V9U,"I rated this movie 5 stars, but like Alp d'Huez in the Tour de France, this is ""beyond category"". This feels and sounds like real life. Don't think cinema ever gets any closer to matching a really good book than this movie manages. I don't know if any of this is autobiographical, but it sure feels like it. Actors only give performances this incredible when the script they are working with is extra special, and this script qualifies on all levels. Can't say enough about the performances of the leads, Noah Taylor and Thandie Newton, the movie hinges on the emotional connection they make and it all works like magic. This is a DVD to own, not rent. You will want to see this over and over again, just like a great book.",1105488000,13,723,4.443609022556391

1729631,4,B000068V9U,"Really a superb, charming, and deep coming of age movie.  When I first saw the dvd box, I had no interest at all to see this.  I thought the cover was sort of tacky and my first impression of the film was that of a corny teen comedy.  Needless to say, I saw this on tv and was really amazed how good this movie was.  Probably the most impressive aspect of ""Flirting"" was the grace of the script and how well all the young actors and actresses performed.  Noah Taylor and Thandie Newton were just outstanding and really believable.  I really enjoyed Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts also in their supporting roles.  It was really great to see all these big names in roles before they made it big.  Much respect to director and writer John Duigan.  Cameron Crowe has stated that Noah Taylor is one of his favorate actors and you can definately see that he has to be a fan of Duigan's too.  I was more amazed to learn that ""Flirting"" was a sequel and even more amazed when I watched the previous film, ""The Year My Voice Broke.""",1073347200,13,1022,4.303664921465969
1729632,5,B000068V9U,"I haven't seen John Duigan's preceding film (""The Year My Voice Broke"") but Noah Taylor was obviously fascinating in ""Flirting"" as a dreamy misfit in a Nazi-like boarding school. Honestly I could hardly relate this British guy to the roles he later landed in such Hollywood movies as ""Almost Famous"", ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"", ""Vanilla Sky""... What an amazing evolution for a versatile actor.
The same fine performance that made this film deserve 5 stars was delivered by Thandie Newton who would also become a celebrity a few years later, starring with Tom Cruise in two blockbuster hits, ""Interview With a Vampire"" and ""Mission Impossible II"" (although her best film to me must be Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Besieged""). Add an exceptionally talented Nicole Kidman who was actually 24 years old when she accepted this role of a teen, and you got a perfect cast to turn a not-so-sensational-coming-of-age love story into a nearly perfect romantic comedy. Oh yes, it should also be noted that Taylor, Newton and Kidman were not the only ones to work their way to stardom since this film was released in 1991. Among the girls of Cirensester school, have you noticed a Janet Odgers? That role was played by a young and pretty Naomi Watts.",1033344000,11,1231,4.923076923076923
1729633,5,B000068V9U,"This is certainly one of the finest examples of a coming of age picture, the first time I saw it I was quite literally shocked in every scene how true to life the dialogue was.  The only place I have seen teen dialogue anywhere near as accurate is in the ill-fated TV drama My So-Called Life.  Though his directing was marvelous, I think Duigan's writing is the most impressive.  Newton and Taylor are spectacular and I have no words for their performances.
I disagree somwhat however with some of my fellow reviewers.  I think the ending is fantastic and hopeful, really a sweet goodbye kiss of an ending.  Also the love scene (where they don't kiss) seems absolutely perfect.  The only reason I think anyone could possibly think it is not just how these things happen has been seduced by the formulaic nature of sex scenes rubber stamped into existence by Hollywood.  The, yes, the genius which it took to write that scene is harrowing.  Knowing these characters, knowing the situation leading up to it, the scene is soft, and delightful.  I am still floored that someone could capture a scene so true that you feel it must have happened to you, and it is one of several like that.  Unlike one other reviewer, I think Flirting is much better at this then The Year My Voice Broke which was very good, but Taylor had not come into his own as a young actor yet.  Also to the person who said teenagers are too immature for this, I disagree.  Some of them?  Sure, undoubtedly.  But to those who love watching the rerun marathons of My So-Called Life on MTV this will come as a breath of fresh air, a sense of relief that Jason Katims isn't the only person in the world who can write teen dialogue.  There is in fact someone much better, John Duigan.
The only bad thing I can say about this film is that MGM marketing should hide their heads in shame for the cover design of both the DVD and the VHS tape.  The DVD in particular is embarrassing.  The fact that Kidman's name and her name alone is the one above the title is shocking even to a person like me who normally doesn't get that upset by unashamed materialism.  Kidman does a fine, unremarkable job as a supporting character.  She's barely in the first half at all and is quite forgettable.  The supporting role of Gilby, Taylor's pretentious friend (played by Bartholomew Rose) is much more worthy of note.
I am so excited that this is coming to DVD (in widescreen no less which unfortunately The Year My Voice Broke did not) I can't express myself.  I know there is a lot out there to buy, a lot out there we want and limited funds but...just trust me and buy this.  If you remember being a teenager, if you remember how hard it was, and the moments that were really beautiful...Or if you simply can recognize the magnificence of the  beautiful, earth-shattering event that occurs when two people look into each other's eyes and really see the person looking back at them....then buy it.

This movie impressively shows how love can overcome the trials and tribulations of adolescents. The supporting cast helped add to this feeling to, with Nichole Kidman providing a realistic but hopeful outlook to support Thandiwe in the decisions she was making. The line that made the movie complete was when Danny was sitting in his room and he thought ""sending love I suppose, the word we never used because I guess we were to cool for that"". This movie is very beautiful and if it wasn't for the abrupt ending would definitely deserve a five star rating, but that's what makes the movie so incredible. It has the ability of showing the hard realities of love, that sometimes unexpected things occur and it's how you deal with that, that determines just how deeply you feel.",1022716800,,954,4.488505747126437

That advice certainly applies to ""Flirting"", the story of an intellectual loner in an Australian boy's boarding school in the mid-1960s and his first romance, with a girl from the girl's school across the lake.  The fact that she is from Uganda, daughter of a prominent political leader, adds additional depth to this story, which is already far better than 99% of teen love movies.  Noah Taylor (as Danny Embling) and Thandie Newton (in her first movie role as Thandiwe Adjewa) are very good in their roles.  Nicole Kidman also appears in a supporting role.
