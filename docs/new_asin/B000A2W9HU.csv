8164740,5,B000A2W9HU,"Just a short review for the moment. If I get just one compilation a year like this I will consider myself lucky. These guys did it right. There are 12 movies, 3 Tom Mix shorts, a vintage interview with both Yakima Canutt and Iron Eyes Cody. And just to make you feel good there's a catchy banjo tune playing during the set-up screens. It has roughly the same tune as the title song in Tex Ritter's ""Hitting the Trail"". A couple of times I've left a set-up screen on just to play the song over and over again.

Some of the movies:

-Valley of Vengeance - another Billy the Kid movie with Billy and Fuzz. I love these movies. Buster Crabbe and Fuzzy St. John always did a good job.

-Dawn on the Great Divide - see my review of that one here at Amazon. It doesn't get better than this.

More soon. Buy this. No, I mean it. Buy it now!
