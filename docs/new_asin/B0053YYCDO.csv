4553089,4,B0053YYCDO,"You should definitely know what you are doing before attempting this DVD. Sadie moves very fast and I was slightly disappointed because some of these moves are not what I would consider impressive since I learned them very early on in my dancing. However, I still feel it was worth the bucks.",1363478400,,292,4.634615384615385
4553090,4,B0053YYCDO,It's a good dvd but if your not already familiar with bellydancing this dvd would be difficult. She goes very fast on explanations and the actual moves. She is an excellent dancer and instructor. I just feel in this dvd she should slow down on the moves and drill with more explanation.,1358035200,,286,4.519230769230769
4553091,5,B0053YYCDO,"Unhesitatingly, I'd say this is a lovely DVD. Great value for money because of all the content it gives you, easy to use because of how well it's structured, and really nice to have because of the variety that's on it.
That Sadie is a wonderful dancer is no secret, even for those who haven't seen her live performances - like me. She's got so many DVDs out that it's also impressive that each has unrepeated intensive content. And she's a great instructor, experienced at breaking down things, giving safety tips and getting the learner to repeat and practice. The one thing I sometimes wish she would be is a little more lightened up and friendly on her DVDs, but that would only be icing on the cake as I wouldn't want her to lose the focused, lets-get-down-to-business approach either.
In this video, Sadie teaches you three ""mini choreographies"". Each is a different type of dance  -- beledi, drum solo, and oriental style. Each of these has 5 combinations, small, but challenging. The structure of this video is so nice that you just click into the style you want to learn that day, select a combo, and learn the breakdown, and then go to the follow along - which you can just loop to practice a million times over. Normally, I like moves to be called out even in a follow-along, but as the combos here are short, there's no real need.
As for the moves themselves, I really like them, but they just are not for beginners. Which is fine as there's enough content for beginners on hundreds of DVDs and actually not nearly enough for intermediate dancers. So, you have to come to this DVD with all your isolations in place, including stomach isolations. There's no breakdown of basic moves here, so you just have to get down to work with the combos.
The combos can be obviously used in your own choreography or to modify into more combinations, but each is nice and typical of the style it comes from.",1346457600,4,1904,4.551020408163265
4553092,5,B0053YYCDO,"I PURCHASED THIS DVD FOR MY DAUGHTER SALIMA AND GAVE IT TO HER FOR HER BIRTHDAY.  SALIMA SAYS, ""YOU GO SADIE"".

SADIE BREAKS DOWN EACH MOVEMENT IN A COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP METHOD AND TIES TOGETHER THE ACTUAL EXERCISES WITH THE DANCE MOVEMENTS BEAUTIFULLY.

MY DAUGHTER IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DVD.

4553093,5,B0053YYCDO,I love this dvd. Each mini choreo is totally usable and relavant to any professional dancer. Not sure it would be good for beginners--probably best for those who already know basic moves. I really like this dvd a lot. I love all of Sadie's dvd's.,1339027200,,246,4.488888888888889
4553094,4,B0053YYCDO,"Each choreography is broken down into 5 sections. She demonstrates the mini choreography. Then goes into the breakdown, then practice. The practice sessions  includes the combo's from the previous sections. For instance when you practice section five you will go over section 1-5, just like her dynamic drum solo. The structure of the dvd is very much so like combination nation. Except Sadie is the only instructor, and she is a wonderful instructor. I felt the instructions were clear, her cuing was excellent and she spent the appropriate time on her movement breakdown. The background looks like a bare version of the background in her ultimate belly dance dvd. No weird camera angles. Excellent lighting- You can see her movements clearly. The sound is clear.  She utilized the time of the dvd well. Sadie is always generous in the amount of information she puts on a dvd, and I must say that hasn't changed. Running time is 80minutes

  I liked this dvd because you get slow moves in her beledi piece, you get the pop and lock moves in her drum solo piece and you get a blend of both of each style in her Oriental piece. I would put this dvd in the  Intermediate, to advanced  level.  There is minimal breakdown and lots of layers {Sadie style layers}. If you are not familiar with her work, you might struggle to get a lot of these layers. There is all new material in this dvd. I have not seen the huge majority of these movements on her other dvd's. So as far as new content there is quite a bit. There is no warm up or cool down. This dvd might best benefit someone who loves Sadie's style, has other Sadie DVD' and would like a nice practice session that strings the movements together after you have drilled, someone who can take a combo or move out from the dvd and apply it to their own dance vocabulary, or all of the above. This is definitely not a one play dvd. The shelf life is good. ""But in order to use it you must be able to take combo's and apply them to your dance vocabulary on your own because the combo's are broken down as if they are apart of a mini choreography"". It does live up to its claim that, the combo's are Sadie's signature Combo's as I have seen her use  most of these combo's plenty of times.

Is this dvd worth almost $30.00 with shipping and handling? I'm not sure. While I do not think this is a must have Sadie dvd, I do think it's a nice one to have. I gave this dvd 4 stars because it does deliver on its purpose,but I am unsure about the price, and as much as I liked this video I think it would have benefited the buyer more if Sadie had made some combinations let you drill them,thenstrung them together into a choreography. Overall I really enjoyed this dvd and am happy that I have added it to my collection.

She uses her last mini choreography in her final performance. It was a beledi piece. I wasn't really a fan of either.

#Update# I notice the price has changed to $17.49 plus shipping and handling. I think that is a good price for this dvd. When I bought it it totalled 27.99. Thus the ""Is this dvd worth almost $30.00"" comment. Now that the price has lowered I definitely give it 5 stars when compared to similar dvd's and for its offering.",1307750400,27,3202,4.363025210084033

8456000,5,B0053YYCDO,"Wow!  What can I say, Sadie is the QUEEN of Bellydance, not JUST drum solos!  Her clear teaching of perfect technique was so much better than any instructor I have had, I learned the moves by just watching a few times!!!! (Intermediate level presently, but can see by her instruction, advanced isn't far away)!!!!  I will be using these combos often and with my own ""twist"", lol.  I would also highly recommend always going back to basics every now and again for reinforcement of moves not done all the time and I love her ""Complete Bellydance Guide"" - a must have for every level!

Even the warm up is good exercise in and of itself.

Thank you, Sadie, for sharing your ""secrets"" for all dancers to become even more beautiful.  Every little tip REALLY sharpens and brightens one's moves while performing, transforming blah to bravo in the same choreography!!!!",1415923200,,861,4.738255033557047
