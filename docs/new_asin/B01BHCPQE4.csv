7634801,5,B01BHCPQE4,"I was beginning to think I would never live to see the day that one of my all-time favorite television shows would finally be available on DVD.  At long last the good folks at Shout! Factory have seen fit to release Season One of ""Lou Grant"" in it's entirely.  This was my favorite show of the 1980's.  You could always count on superb writing and the cast led by Ed Asner was second to none.  The series tackled a whole host of extremely important topics including government corruption, unethical business practices, environmental threats and public health issues to name but a few.  Then there are the ethical questions surrounding the journalistic code that Grant & Co. had to consider when deciding what to publish and when.  I always found these internal discussions to be very fascinating.

A couple of years ago I purchased all eight seasons of the ""Quincy, M.E"". series released by Shout! Factory.  I am pleased to report that I was very satisfied with the quality of this product.  As such, I am ordering my copy of ""Lou Grant: Season One"" right now and hope that the demand will be sufficient to allow Shout! Factory to release all five seasons over the next year or two.  I look forward with great anticipation to enjoying all of these episodes once again after all these years.  Network television does not get any better than this. Very highly recommended!",1461110400,15,1370,4.714285714285714
7634802,5,B01BHCPQE4,"""Lou Grant"" was one of the best TV dramas of its time, so it's an overdue pleasure to see it finally released on DVD. It was the first time a character from a comedy was spun off into a drama, and the first few episodes show the writers working out the details, retaining the characterization (including his sense of humor) while emphasizing his more serious side as a journalist. Even then, the stories themselves were thoughtful & drawn from then-current events. And once the series hit its stride, just a few episodes in, the quality continued for its entire run. In fact, the stories became even more nuanced & emotionally complex as time went by, allowing for character growth, an examination of news & ethics, and a willingness to tackle controversial topics.

Now, as previous reviews have noted, this is just the first season. While I'd have preferred a complete series set immediately, the sad fact is that TV series of real substance are often a harder sell to the general public. So they're clearly testing the waters with just the first season -- and I've already pre-ordered mine to support & encourage the release of the subsequent seasons. I'm hoping we'll see them all released eventually, because this is a time capsule of the post-Watergate years leading into the conservative reversal of the Reagan years -- and unlike so many other period shows that were mainly concerned with fads & fashions, this one was always about issues & ideas. Whether you agreed with their POV or not, the stories always illuminated those issues & ideas, and made the viewer think about them. It was a series with respect for the audience, whose intelligence it took as a given.

I'll amend this review once the DVDs are released, commenting on image & possible cuts (if any). While some reviewers clearly wanted & hoped for a Blu-Ray release, I don't think that's absolutely necessary -- a TV series from that time was hardly HD, and it was filmed to be seen on what is now an older TV set. In any case, I'm simply pleased that we're seeing it at all. For a long time it seemed as if ""Lou Grant"" had been consigned to some memory hole -- it's great to have it at last. Highly recommended for the discerning viewer!",1459382400,15,2211,4.6521739130434785
7634803,5,B01BHCPQE4,"One of my favorite all time series. Having grown up in Los Angeles in the 1950s-1960s I know that many of the stores were based on real events, which appeals to me. Two of my favorite episodes were the one with Margaret Hamilton as the retired journalist, and the episode with the black artist. The end of that one was great.

The episode about a very old murder in a wealthy, land owning family, was based on the O'Neil family that owned the southern half of Orange county (for real - the southern most part of the oldSpanish land grant was purchased from the O'Neil family by the US government to create Camp Pendleton Marine Corp base at the outbreak of WWll - the northern part of the old Spanish land grant became Mission Viejo planned community.) The O'Neil family still does some ranching on the northeast portion of the old land grant.

The episode about a police sex scandal was based on actual events.

Will wait a little while to purchase the whole set, in hopes they will release a single complete series boxed set.",1456617600,3,1027,4.510752688172043
7634804,1,B01BHCPQE4,This is a review of incomplete shows that I have bought and are still waiting for their completion. I really liked the Lou Grant show but until the series is completed I will Not be purchasing it on a season by season bases. This is a show from the 1980's there is NO reason it could not have been offered as a complete series.,1455321600,9,327,4.125

7634807,5,B01BHCPQE4,"I think Shout has done it again.
I was starting to believe that ""Lou Grant"" will never come out on DVD , but I was wrong.
I want to thank you Shout! for releasing one of the greatest TV dramas on DVD
So mark your calendars and buy this DVD then it comes out.",1454803200,16,258,3.7962962962962963
7634808,5,B01BHCPQE4,"This is a great example of how the whole focus of entertainment used to be different. This is a quality show, with quality production values, great acting, and they obviously had a couple of great writers. You will not be sorry. This is a mature show. I'm so happy we can get these older shows as I am prettymuch incapable of watching the garbage they're pedaling today. Each episode is gold here. Topical, inspirational and engaging.",1474156800,9,434,4.723684210526316
7634809,5,B01BHCPQE4,"Unusual for a spin off series to change direction so well. Lou Grant goes from the comedic character from Mary Tyler Moore to more serious here. Excellent writing and acting, most notably from Nancy Marchand. Her role of newspaper publisher Mrs. Pynchon won 4 Emmy awards.",1473465600,4,272,4.934782608695652
7634810,4,B01BHCPQE4,"I really, really like the show which ran even here in Germany in my youth in the 70`s / early 80's. It is fun to watch the show again. Picture and audio of the DVDs are quite all right if you consider the age of the material. The only fly in the ointment is the fact that there are no subtitles. This would have made it easier for me to fully understand everything. This is no problem for native speakers, of course, but for me this is the reason to award ""only"" four stars out of five.

Thanks for bringing these memories back to life!",1469145600,3,536,4.104761904761904
7634811,5,B01BHCPQE4,SO GREATFUL TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS FABULOUS SHOW!!,1469059200,,50,4.1
7634812,5,B01BHCPQE4,"Lou Grant was one of my favorite television shows. I have fond memories of watching it with my family. Memories of certain episodes have stuck with me over the years.

I have watched all the episodes in this season one dvd set on my flat screen HD television.  The picture quality is very good considering the series started in 1977. When I play it in 4:3 picture mode on my television the picture looks the best but there are bars on the left and right sides of the picture. When I use the screen to fit mode  on my television the picture appears in full on my television though it is a tiny bit stretched.  I have been using the screen to fit mode and am happy with picture. The difference is barely noticeable.

The episodes play fine.  I did not notice any scratches or jumps in the video. The sound is excellent as well. Considering the first episode aired September 27, 1977, Shout! Factory did an excellent job with the transfer.

While there is only one cast interview it is with Edward Asner and it runs approximately 26 minutes. As a big fan of the show it was enjoyable hearing Asner talk about the show. I hope future seasons will have interviews with other cast members.

The episodes are not broken up into chapters.  Some television show series will have an hour story broken up into four chapters making it easier to go to a favorite scene. This would have been a nice feature on the discs.

In addition, there are no episode summaries except on the dvd box itself. Before each program there is a preview that was part of the original series but I do wish there was a preview on the discs themselves. I do like the fact that the summaries on the dvd box show the air date of each episode.

Lou Grant remains one of my favorite shows ever. The moment the theme song starts I am transported back in time when I was a young teen watching this with my family.  The episodes still hold up well and are relevant today.

I have watched episodes of other television series that I loved as a teen and the acting and episode plots do not seem as good as I remembered them to be.  The acting and plots in Lou grant are as good as ever.  Some of my favorites in season one are Judge (where a judge is acting strange in court), Sports (where Lou takes on a legendary sports writer over whether a story should be written) and Renewal (where the Tribune tries to stop the destruction of a condemned building because a troubled man, played by Robert Earl Jones, painted beautiful murals on the walls of his apartment in honor of the family he never had.)

I am very happy this series is finally is on dvd. Shout! Factory did an excellent job bringing it to dvd. I look forward to the rest of the seasons.",1468713600,7,2704,4.3353174603174605

7634814,5,B01BHCPQE4,"Might be slightly too funny for reaching Realistic, but it sure is Fun to watch!
And of course, that adorable redhead--who took over from another milder actress after the first episode or so--sure made my heart race.
Tackles every important Problem of the time with astonishing accuracy.  Brave writing and acting.",1465862400,2,314,5.1568627450980395
7634815,5,B01BHCPQE4,"Thanks to Shout! for FINALLY bringing this series to DVD.

An extremely well written (but not *over* written, as per certain far more recent tv news dramas) and well performed series looking at journalism and social and political issues in an engaging and easily accessible way. At the some time creating some well-rounded and lovable characters. Not only that, but there is plenty of humour too.

To those who haven't seen this series, don't think it's dry and talky. It was an important series in its day, and remains as entertaining now as then.

Well done again, Shout!",1464739200,12,573,4.826530612244898
7634816,5,B01BHCPQE4,"Lou Grant has always been one of the best drama series ever made and it is good to see this finally get a DVD release.  I had previously bought the first season on iTunes.  The picture quality on iTunes was reasonable.  The picture and audio on this DVD release, however, is excellent so I would highly recommend it.

Looking forward to the next season and I hope that Shout release seasons 4 and 5 which were not released on iTunes at all.",1464220800,8,440,4.329268292682927
7634817,3,B01BHCPQE4,"This is a five star series getting a three star treatment. I'm one of those who is disappointed that it is finally appearing but without a Blu-Ray release.
To me eyes, standard definition looks terrible on a modern large screen TV. And now that those who want it will have already purchased the DVDs, there is very little incentive for anyone to release it on Blu-Ray.
Like most American dramas of its time, Lou Grant was filmed and edited on 35mm film and is therefore an excellent candidate for HD transfer, just like 35mm movies. A number of shows, including M*A*S*H and Star Trek have had great modern HD transfers from original film.
Too bad we're unlikely to ever see this treatment for Lou.",1464048000,3,697,4.629032258064516
8750112,5,B01BHCPQE4,"I remembered Lou Grant fondly as being a great show, but watching it again shows that this was an outstanding show.  It is surprisingly not as dated as I had expected.  Issues that they covered -- spousal abuse, immigration, women's place in the workplace, etc -- are still relevant today.  It holds up really well.  I will buy all the seasons.",1519257600,,344,4.590163934426229
8750113,5,B01BHCPQE4,"This is so good.  With a few tweeks, it could be a series today.  The acting is terrific, the stories are real sounding and each episode stands on its own.  The DVD is well done and is sharp and not cluttered up with bonus features that aren't useful.

All four seasons now available are good.  Can't wait for the fith and final season which I hope comes out soon.",1509148800,,364,4.217391304347826
8750114,3,B01BHCPQE4,Loved the show at the time and eagerly started watching. Unfortunately it has not aged well at all. This conflicts and plot lines seem thin and inconsequential in this day and age. I wish I'd have saved the money and simply stuck with my memories.,1491177600,,247,4.511111111111111
