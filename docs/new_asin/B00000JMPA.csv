1234515,5,B00000JMPA,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: The Funniest Joke In The World, The Mouse Problem, Children's Stories, Restaurant Sketch, Undressing In Public, the generally superb Episode Five, and The Dull Life Of A City Stockbroker.

1234516,4,B00000JMPA,"Picture and sound quality shouldn't be the reason you are buying this set. The number of episodes per disc (3) is a bit on the lean side as well. But,  if you are a python fan, these sets finally offer a way for the fans to  have all the tv episodes in a medium that will not deteriorate over time.  I'm not going to trifle with reviewing the comedy of Monty Python, because  if you consider buying this dvd you should already know what they are  about. 4 stars because of the sound/video and small number of episodes per  disc.",966038400,2,528,4.23
1234517,5,B00000JMPA,"Monty Python has definitely got to be THE most influential medium for all comedians. Any interviews that I have read of any of the newer faces of comedy have named the Python crew as their biggest influence. As is  mine.
I have been watching Python now for about two years, and I still  find the sketches as fresh as the first time I watched them. Anyone who  hasn't seen Python yet (where have you been?) definitely needs to see the  best comedy of all time!",961459200,2,459,4.364705882352941
1234518,4,B00000JMPA,"Oh God!  When I heard A&E was putting out Flying Circus on DVD I just about lost my cool.  Actually, I did -- I ran around to my fellow co-workers who also like Python, giggling like a schoolgirl.  Anyhow, when  I finally got the sets I wasn't let down.  I bought all sets to date and  have watched each disc at least twice.  You cannot go wrong with these if  you like Flying Circus.  If your only exposure to Monty Python is the movie  Holy Grail then you may want to ease into the series as it has distinctly  British content and is sometimes topical to Brittain of the late 60's and  early 70's.  But if you like Brittish humor this is definitely for you.  Enjoy!",946771200,16,667,4.190476190476191

AM I EVER GLAD I WAS WRONG!  The  timing of the release of these DVD's could not have been more perfect!  The  video quality is excellent, even by 1969 standards.  I never knew until I  purchased this set that there were scenes cut from some episodes, likely to  keep airtimes close as possible to 30 minutes; They are restored here!  Diehard Pythonites would be loonies if they passed on this golden  opportunity to obtain pristine reproductions of perhaps the funniest import  this country has ever seen and heard (of course I plan to purchase all  volumes of the set).

Nicely animated menus with some clever trivia and great  Hollywood Bowl clips.  I have to say, however, the supplements tend to  repeat over the discs, and the grouping of skits around themes is a bit  weak.  But, thats just the icing on the cake were talking about.

1234575,5,B00000JMPA,"This is a collection of the very first season of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Included in this boxed set are: Famous Deaths, Man with Three Buttocks, Flying Sheep, Nudge Nudge Wink Wink, Undressing in Public, Confuse-A-Cat, and Silly Job Interview and that's just the highlights!

These comedy shows aired in Great Britain in 1969 and the humor holds up astonishingly well.  These guys are just as odd now as they were when they first started and these comic riffs rely on universally funny things such as nudity, death, humiliation, insanity, TV programming, government and history.  It's a bit like a medieval morality play gone wrong with young men dressing as old women. Really cheesy sets and totally un-special effects combine with inspired writing and timing to produce something that became a cult classic.",1223510400,5,815,5.112781954887218

1234578,5,B00000JMPA,"OK, now that the DVD versions are out, and the Personal Bests, and the Entire Series', it's unlikely you will want to purchase a puny little set of VHS' of the first season of Tony M. Nythop's Flying Ricsu.  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were doing anagrams.  I meant Monty Python's Flying Circus.  But it's all I have!  So I'm reviewing it.

I love the Flying Circus series.  Aside from Life of Brian, and bits of The Holy Grail, I would pit the series against any of the Python movies.  I think Terry and Michael, and John and Graham, and Eric (the three teams who wrote together or solo as the case may be) were most brilliant doing sketch comedy, and this particular packet shows that they arrived from The Frost Report, Do Not Adjust Your Set, and Doctor In the House hitting the ground running.  It's amazing to realize that such time honored skits as Dead Parrot, Nudge Nudge, and Confuse-a-Cat are all here--in the first season!

One could argue that these Oxbridge thespians were ""to the manor born"", having all been products of either the Cambridge Footlights or the Fringe Festivals.  And that would be true.  However, rather than rest on their laurels and serve up a formulaic comic television show, the Pythons deliberately focused on a stream-of-conciousness style, taking cues from heroes like Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook.  Although there were many TV shows at the time that were tending towards the absurd, there weren't any that didn't have punch lines at the end of skits, and this caused some apparent discombobulation with audiences at first.  Thankfully, however, Python remained popular enough to remain on the BBC for another 5 seasons and in American hearts for over twenty years.

Do yourself a favor.  Even if you have seen all the Monty Python films, even if you have heard some of their records....buy this or another VHS or DVD collection of the best showcase of their patchwork, tangential comedy---Monty Python's Flying Circus.",1155600000,2,1959,4.8059701492537314
1234579,4,B00000JMPA,"I have seen a lot of the Monty Python movies, and until now, I didn't really put two and two together that all of the miscellaneous sketches were part of a TV show.  A TV show that gave them the chance to do the movies.  I got these with expectations that they would be like the movies.  They are much more random and not a ""cult classic"" as I would have figured except for certain sketches that most people know.  But I still loved watching these and getting a sense where they started and where a lot of sketch comedy got their ideas today.  If you are a die hard fan I would get these, I probably won't use my own money to get the rest, but I  would love to get them as gifts, and I will probably be the oddball here.  Everyone I know would buy the whole set outright.",1142467200,,771,4.032894736842105
1234580,5,B00000JMPA,"*Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more!*  If you don't like to laugh than don't buy this box set.  If you don't like dead pets, cross dressing lumberjacks, and funny english comedians, then definitely, absolutely, positively don't buy this box set.",1140134400,,261,4.909090909090909
1234600,5,B00000JMPA,"In 1969, pop culture experienced a sudden earthquake, started by five British goofballs and one American goofball, who created ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" And no, Monty Python isn't a person. Just so you know.

The first two volumes (six episodes) of this skit-filled comedy series, where the insane and surreal are everyday: Picasso paints while riding a bicycle, a dirty fork sets off madness, murder and suicide in a very dramatic restaurant (""Never kill the customer!""), a self-defense course against fresh fruit (""... release the tiger!""), a man with three buttocks, a world full of superheroes where Bicycle Repairman comes to the rescue, and a web of spies, intrigue, and dentistry.

Does it sound insane? Good. These six guys created some of the most unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever, which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to author Jasper Fforde. The first six episodes have some of their most legendary work (""Wink wink, nudge nudge, SAY NO MORE!"") and it only gets better from there on.

And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.

Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Idle not only has amazing comic timing, but he can adjust his voice and body language to... anything, from a fussy sailor to the wink-wink-nudge-nudge man.

But the other actors are quite good too, especially Michael Palin, especially when he's playing someone timid or crazy. And Terry Gilliam created the most bizarre, oddballish  little cartoons, including giant stomping feet, flying sheep, and many other strange things that bridge the various skits together.

This classic comedy series not only became a pop culture staple, but it's still fresh and funny more than thirty years after it was made. So eschew lame sitcoms and recycled reality shows, and check out what real entertainment is about.",1129766400,3,2299,5.0661375661375665
1234601,4,B00000JMPA,"It seems as though the Python troupe was still feeling their way in some of these early shows. Though the good stuff is really, really funny, a couple of the skits--though humorous--simply drag on a bit too long. But overall, this is classic Monty Python; very silly. [wink wink, nudge nudge, know what I mean?]",1126051200,3,311,4.672727272727273
1234602,5,B00000JMPA,"The first half of the first season of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" has some of the best Python episodes ever. I especially liked Episode 3 (""How to Recognize Different Types of Trees From Quite a Long Way Away"") and Episode 4 (""Owl Stretching Time""). While not quite as polished as some of the later episodes, it was all equally funny.
The DVD set looks slightly better than the videos released in 1989 by Paramount. The filmed, location sequences look pretty grainy, but that's how they've always looked. With every episode, there is an opprotunity to jump straight to the sketches, or to read a tidbit.
On the extras front, there's a clip from ""Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" scenes from other TV episodes, biographies, Pythonisms, a weblink, trivia games, and the always excellent Gilliamnations art gallery.",1046390400,3,824,4.978260869565218
1234603,5,B00000JMPA,"Well, they've gone and done it. They put Monty Python's Flying Circus on DVD! Well, what can I say? I am an afficianado of this silly group of English tricksters, and have been since I first saw them on PBS way back in the early 1970s.
This product is a 2 DVD complete set of the entire first year of Monty Python's Flying Circus. For yourinvestment, you get such sketches as: ""Sex and Violence"", complete with ""You Can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and this dead Crab"" sketch; ""The Larch""; ""The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker""; ""Nudge Nudge"" sketch; and many more very silly sketches. I am also fond of the ""It's the Arts"" program, wherein interviewers are alternately rude and kind to the guests, particularly Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson.  Also included on the DVD are the weblinks to Pythonshop online, a ""meet the chaps"" biography section, a Pythonisms Glossary, and Art Gallery of Terry Gilliam, and a preview of upcoming episodes section. Episodes 1-6 are contained on this 2 set of DVDs. I like this format because its less bulky than the VHS set, and is a better value, with 3 episodes per DVD, as opposed to 2 for each VHS tape.
While the first season of Python isn't my favorite, it still is worth the money for the serious Python fan.",1044144000,9,1259,4.595555555555555
