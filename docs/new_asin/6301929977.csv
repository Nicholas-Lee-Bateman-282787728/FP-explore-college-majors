Gives a good review of Rockys accomplishments. I enjoyed it but I'm partial , I love the Rock.

I love Rockys mother.  She wasn't afraid for Rocky. She was afraid and worried about the welfare of the other fighter and his mother.  What a beautiful person Pasqulena was, of which she was one of many ingredients in the formation of the ROCKS Greatness!

It seems like Pasquelina knew how intense and hard her son trained and knew he was in a league of his own, and owned the later rounds, combined with his Susie-Q right hand,allowed him the opportunity to become undisputed and stay undefeated HCOTW",1294617600,,610,4.62037037037037
7817232,5,6301929977,"I feel as a Marciano fan this is a great tape. Yes I would have liked to have seen the fights in their complete form, but this is good enough for me. I would like to let the person know that is looking for footage of the marciano-Ali super fight, U can get the dvd at best buy, or tower records, or if u want U can order it on-line.",1138060800,,332,3.757142857142857
7817233,5,6301929977,"Ok, for all of you people claiming he only fought old boxers, you are wrong. Ok, he had three fights that people critisize him for: Joe Louis, Walcott and Moore. He had to fight Louis because both were looking at a title shot. Marciano almost refused to fight him, as Louis was Marciano's mentor. Walcott was obvious. You can't do much without beating the champion, and Moore campaigned for the Marciano bout. All fighters beat older boxers. Ali fought Archie Moore...he was 19 years younger than him. Ali was 10 years younger than Liston. All fighters have to figt older fighters, otherwise they would seperate weight class as well as age. marciano had incredible punching power, heart and stamina. For those of you who claim he isn't good, you know little about boxing. This video was great, truly showing off Marciano's incredible punching power. Truly, a quality movie if you are a Marciano fan.",1121212800,3,899,4.8441558441558445
7817234,3,6301929977,"Some of the other videos in the Boxing's Best series are flawed by  not enough fight footage, too much time spent on uninteresting interviews, and not enough insight into the lives of the subjects. This one, though, is a somewhat different story. Although just under an hour long, you get some good footage of several bouts that led up to, and including, his dramatic knockout of Jersey Joe Walcott to gain the title, some footage of every one of his title defenses, and interviews with family members and others who knew him, who give some insight into his character and personality. This documentary reveals him to have been a truly modest and decent man. In the ring, despite a height and reach disadvantage against most of his opponents, he had a powerful punch in either hand, good boxing skills, and an iron will. He just refused to lose. A fairly good documentary on one of the greatest heavyweights ever. Hopefully a better documentary about him will emerge at some point, but until then, this one is good for its price.",977702400,37,1028,4.711111111111111
7817235,5,6301929977,"This video is a must for Marciano fans.  Included, in addition to highlights of his classic fights, is rare footage of seldom-seen bouts against Harry Matthews, Rex Layne, and Lee Savold. Rocky is also revealed in several interesting interviews, clips, and plenty of photos.",971568000,13,274,5.2272727272727275
