2376118,1,B000A6T1YA,"This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story.",1171411200,,792,4.14935064935065
2376119,1,B000A6T1YA,"I didn't know that this was a Koontz-based scrapped pilot until I read the last review - which makes it even more disappointing. If this movie doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. This has all the ""drama"" angles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with hardly any action and then as the movie builds to it's peak THE CREDITS ROLL!!!! STAY AWAY, folks. I am a Dean Koontz fan and I'm thinking he had very little to do with this. Parker Posey was the only enjoyable thing about the movie, but people looking at ""the monster"" and talking about him being in a freak show when he just had a little scar on his face - come on, I've seen worse at the swimming pool. This is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back. Frankenstein Unbound was a B movie, but was much better than this.",1169164800,,785,4.171052631578948
2376120,2,B000A6T1YA,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I have always enjoyed Frankenstein's monster.  He probably is my favorite classic horror icon.  I have seen a lot of different Frankenstein films; some of them are cheesy, but fun.  I also have watched different versions of Mary Shelly's book and I enjoy them all, some more than others.  This film's plot takes a kind of continuation of Shelly's novel with some name changes.

First of all it is extremely drawn out.  The plot just drags on with very little action or real character development.  The monster is very basic looking.  He has very little scaring, and is not very big or intimidating.  He is just a basic 6-foot man with semi long hair wearing a hood.  Doctor Victor Helios is an interesting character; basically he has been keeping himself alive for the couple of centuries trying to replace humanity with a superior race.  The monster is his first prototype from the eighteenth century who is trying to stop Helios. The whole idea of this film is pretty original, but it just was portrayed in a very slow and boring way.

 I just had a very hard time making through the movie.  Finally the film just ends and the viewer is left with too many unanswered questions.  What was keeping me from giving this film 1 star rating is other reviewers of the movie stated it was a pilot for a television show that was going to air on USA network but never did and fell through. Finding that piece of information helps me understand why the film just ends without any real closure.  Also the cinematography is done well for a made-for-TV-movie.  But this film just does not stand well on it's own.  The idea was in the right place but it just did not work right at all.",1151971200,7,1724,4.5210355987055015
2376121,3,B000A6T1YA,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...

Marcus Nispel clearly shows himself to be a talented filmmaker with this film. His Frankenstein has all the style of his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Without a doubt, the man knows how to shoot a movie. However, despite the striking visuals, this movie winds up feeling a little vacuous. In a way, the movie itself mimics the creature of its title, being the somewhat half-formed, brainless and empty creation of a brilliant but misguided mind. In this case, Marcus Frankenstein started with good intentions and constructed a beautifully shot film, but neglected to put the brain into his creation. This version of Frankenstein suffers because it teeters on the brink of being unique and distinctive, but never really commits. Perhaps it's because it was made for television, and it's clearly been made with a strong PG aesthetic in mind.

This story is not as much of a straightforward adaptation as a revisionist's version of Mary Shelley's novel. Frankenstein himself is much more like the Terell character in Blade Runner. He's an egotistical, megalomaniacal genius named Helios. Even with its departure from the standard Frankenstein story, this version feels much more in line with the tone and intention of Shelley's novel than most of the past cinematic versions of Frankenstein. Even keeping the tone intact, the story operates on a completely different engine, acting like a version of Seven, with Parker Posey playing the detective who is hunting down one of Frankenstein's psychotic creations.

While I'm on the subject, I need to vent momentarily. Parker Posey really is one of the worst actresses around. I used to like her when she was the quirky girl in movies like Best in Show. But her ridiculous vampire queen in Blade: Trinity and her laughable portrayal of a shotgun-toting detective in this movie have made me lose all respect for her. But not even Parker's silly acting can completely ruin this movie. Although it does feel a little thin at points, this is still an interesting and somewhat new approach to an old myth, beautifully shot and edited by Marcus Nispel... who may be a modern day Frankenstein.",1137369600,2,2168,5.050279329608938
2376122,5,B000A6T1YA,"I wish this pilot had been picked up and made into a tv series, but nonetheless it was a good flick. Based on the Dean Koontz novel it basically deals with the social and religious aspects of cloning and the possible dangers of creating something that may not have a God given soul. The book is better (actually a series of books now) but check out this flick.",1133654400,,360,4.3088235294117645
2376123,4,B000A6T1YA,"This one is a mixed bag; it was intended to be a television pilot -- something we didn't know when we rented it, but figured out pretty quickly. The writing is pretty good, but the cast is what really makes this one: Vincent Perez as the original monster, Thomas Krestchmann as the deranged scientist, Ivana Milicevic as his resurrected wife; and a crew of law enforcement including Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, and Michael Madsen.

Think the old TV show ""Beauty and the Beast"" more than ""Van Helsing."" This was directed by the guy who did The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and produced by Martin Scorsese, so you know it's got style for miles. But when I learned that this was loosely based on a book by Dean Koontz, Frankenstein lost a little of its charm -- which isn't fair, I know. I loved ol' Dean when I was a teenager, but I haven't been able to take his books for years. Maybe I owe him another visit, I don't know.

For all its flaws (pacing, mostly -- and a tendency to fixate on the wrong details), I really enjoyed this aborted TV show and regretted the fact that it never found a home.  But then I found out that it would have aired on the USA network, and I don't have cable anyway.
Ah, well.",1131494400,6,1201,4.352678571428571
2376124,2,B000A6T1YA,"I was kind of upset that Dean Koontz's name did not appear anywhere on this film.  The book was one of the better ones I have read and for the film makers to basically quote word for word from the book without even a mention to Koontz is ridiculous.  They also took out what I thought was one of the best story lines with the other serial killer Roy.  I thought that added a good little side story.  Also, Victor Helios and his creatures were not really explained all that much in the movie.  Randall Six did not appear, and the scenes with Erica weren't that clear.  I don't know, I hope there won't be another movie to tarnish this series of great novels.",1129507200,,657,4.258064516129032
2376125,1,B000A6T1YA,"I caught this when it was first aired like a year ago on tv and I thought it was pretty lame.  ""Frankenstein"" is nto really a good title, as this thing has little to do with any of the actual literature or previous films it shares a name with.

Vincent Perez, who played the Crow in the god-awful ""Crow: City Of Angels"" stars as a Frankenstein monster, kind of, who also doubles as a mysterious informant for a tough/but/pretty cop (Parker Posey) whos investigating some weird events involving a genetic scientist guy.  There's no real ending, since this was intended to be a series perhaps, and the whole thing is just bland and pointless.  Could have been a cool idea, though.",1129334400,,678,4.578512396694215
2376126,4,B000A6T1YA,"First suggestion:  read the book which Dean Koontz and Kevin Anderson wrote after they parted ways with the USA Network.  Then this failed tv pilot will have a little more credence.  It's unusual translation of the much used plot is unique in its conception, and I hope that someone might take it upon themselves to continue, as the book series is quite entertaining thus far.  Parker Posey is good as Detective Carson O'Connor, but Adam Goldberg is miscast as her wisecracking sidekick.  Thomas Krestchmann (so good in a small but pivotal role in THE PIANIST) doesn't quite have the megalomaniac frenzy that's in the novels, but he does an admirable job.  Michael Madsen is more subdued than usual in his role as Detective Jonathan Harker (irony with a name taken from fellow gothic thriller DRACULA).  Vincent Perez makes an interesting Deucalion, but he's not used in the movie very much so far.  The lighting and direction are sharp, and the music appropriate.  I don't know if we'll see anymore in this adaptation, so don't be surprised at the open ending.",1128124800,8,1061,4.85
2376127,4,B000A6T1YA,"The first thing you need to know about this particular ""Frankenstein"" is that it the pilot for an aborted USA Network series based on concepts and characters by Dean Koontz.  However, Koontz and USA apparently came to a parting of the waysd with two significant results: Koontz's name disappeared from the USA project and the author wrote a series of novels with Kevin J. Anderson, the first of which, ""Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book One: Prodigal Son,"" appears to cover a lot of the same ground (but I have not read it and therefore can not speak to specific differences).  This may well be enough information to forestall Koontz's fans from watching this pilot movie and proceeding directly to the novels.  But I like pilots and tend to watch as many as I can because I find them intrinsically interesting.

The premise of this ""Frankenstein"" is basically that Mary Shelley got most of the story right and changed some names.  In the novel Frankenstein brings his creation to life and then abandons him, with the latter being his greater sin for which he and his family must pay.  In this pilot the doctor is now named Victor Helios (Thomas Krestchmann), the filthy rich owner of a biotech company in New Orleans.  Helios has found ways of keeping himself alive for several centuries and has been continuing his experiments with an eye towards replacing flawed humanity with his master race spawned in his company's vats.  Helios even gets to program his creations as he desires and has just come up with a new version of his wife, Erika (Ivana Milicevic).  A good question here is whether ""Frankenstein"" still applied to the doctor, as in the novel, or to his creation, as in pop culture, but it does not matter because both are here.

The first creation is now called Deucalion (Vincent Perez), and while the name comes from classical mythology it is not, as you might suspect, one associated with Prometheus.  As you will recall, Prometheus created the first humans in Greek mythology and the subtitle of Shelley's novel was ""The Modern Prometheus.""  Decaulion, on the other hand, is the Greek counterpart to Noah, who survives the great flood with his wife Pyrrha and repopulates the world.  However, to the extent that he is the first human to have a name in mythology, Decaulion has that in common with Adam as well.  Since Helios (the name of the god of the sun, son of Hyperion) is the villain, that allows Decaulion to be the heroic figure.  This is necessary because there are a whole bunch of Helios creations running around and one of them appears to be a serial killer.

Working on the case are Detective Carson O'Conner (Parker Posey) and her partner Detective Michael Sloane (Adam Goldberg), and once Carson and Decaulion start running into each other on a regular basis you are going to have to make a point of reminding yourself this is ""Frankenstein"" and not ""Beauty and the Beast"" (the Vincent and Catharine one on television and not the Disney musical one that was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar).  This is key because that gives you a better sense of the dynamic of this would-be series than having watched all of the Universal films regarding Frankenstein.  Also involved in the case and its developments is Detective Harker, and since he is played by Michael Madsen you know this is not a good sign.  There is more to the serial killer than meets the eyes, and we find out some interesting things about these creations that would have implications for the series that this pilot never got off the ground.

As much as I like Posey as an actress with strong Independent credibility and Goldberg as comic relief in just about everything he does, they really seem too young to be detectives.  I also have some questions as to how Helios can create enough of his creatures to keep up with the birth rate in New Orleans let along the state of Louisiana, the former states of the Confederacy, the United States, North American, the Western Hemisphere and eventually the entire world, because I tried doing the math and I do not see it working out that way.  The script by John Shiban, who worked as both a writer and a producer on ""The X-Files,"" certainly sets up sufficient premises for an on-going series, but I do not know if it is a good thing when I find myself more interested in the relationship between Helios and Erika than the one between Decaulion and Catherine, er, I mean Carson.

The reason I ended up rounding up on this one in the end is because I liked the look of the film, not just in terms of Leslie Keel's art direction, but also the efforts of director Marcus Nispel.  His updated version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" creeped me out, which is a pretty good accomplishment given more of the jetsam and flotsam out there in the world of contemporary horror films.  Take into account that he is doing this for television (albeit cable) and not a theatrical film and the results are pretty impressive.  There is a great look to the film and Nispel is again working with cinematographer Daniel Pearl to come up with some interesting shots, so if you do not think that style over substance is an inherently bad thing that would be another reason to give this ""Frankenstein"" a try (and if you really want the substance the Koontz-Anderson novels are out there waiting for you).",1127692800,28,5320,4.681330472103005

2376182,4,B000A6T1YA,"Shot originally as the pilot for a never-to-be television series, Marcus Nispel's ""Frankenstein"" is a gritty neo-noir set in (pre-Katrina) New Orleans. Dr. Frankenstein's (He's called ""Helios,"" in this version) quest for the perfect superior creature takes him, and the story, into seemingly supernatural territory, but it's all served with more than a liberal dash of irony. Parker Posey (in a Farrah Fawcett hairdo!) and Adam Goldberg trade off-hand jibes in classic mismatched, cop-partner partner style, Vincent Perez is a moody New-Age Creature of long, long, life, and Michael Madsen (""Reservoir Dogs"") shines as a particularly tormented soul.

2376208,2,B000A6T1YA,"TV Movie, apparently more was planned and this DVD only tells part of the story (based on the writings of Dean Koontz). Parker Posey is a detective who apparently never sleeps, she and her partner Adam Goldberg are investigating some grisly murders and find themselves in the middle of some weird modern-day Frankenstein-ist hijinx. But the movie ends in the middle of everything. I'm sure Koontz wraps up the story delightfully in his books, but the movie viewer is left high and dry. I give it the second star for the cinematography, lighting, and gothic/serial killer mood. But nothing about the characters, up to the point where the movie ends, makes you care what happens to them.",1430611200,,685,4.863247863247863

2376256,3,B000A6T1YA,"Back in 2007, I had got a copy of Dean Koontz' ""Frankenstein: Book 1 Prodigal son"". I had read it about 2 or 3 times, and read at least the 2nd book by the time I heard they made a movie based off the book. It was not long that I got to watch the made for TV movie. The books are great for those who know the original Mary Shelly novel, or at least know the story of Frankenstein, and this is the Networks attempt on making a kind of ""remake of a remake"". In my opinion the books are not really a remake, but a continuation of the original story of the original book by Mary Shelly.

To be perfectly honest, everyone knows that the books are better then the movies. And in this case, it is very much true. It is to my understanding, when the USA network decided to make his book into a ""Made for TV movie"", they wanted Dean Koontz to come on a creative consultant (or something along those lines), but after some disagreements he had with the writers and some other things, he decided to back out of the movie. In my opinion they left out so much in the movie and that is why Dean left the project. In my opinion the movie suffered for it.

The actors in the movie, I thought where great. They worked well with each other, and with the main characters (the real actors) it was evident that they knew how to play off each other. More over, the gentlemen who played the monster, I could not have seen him being played by anyone else, same thing with Victor Frankenstein, or Helios as he is better known in the first book.

The biggest problems I had with the movie is that they left out the first 5 or more chapters, and skipped chapters throwout the whole thing. In doing so, they left big chunks of the character development of the monster, of the detectives and nearly every major character in the movie. Like the fact that in the book, the monster had lived in a Tibetan Monastery for nearly 200 years before he got a letter from his friend and got the tattoo (which is barely distinguishable in the movie) from one of the monks to cover up the burns he had gotten in the fire that took his wife in the original Marry Shelly novel.

Then there is the development of the main antagonist in the movie. In the book, it was very descriptive on what he did to his victims and why he did it. In one of the first chapters he is even introduced in, is where he is sitting on a bench at a park, watching the 2 detectives as they try to solve a murder in the near by lake which is with in the first few minutes of the movie, which is about 4 or 5 chapters or more into the book. In the movie they concentrated on the detectives and never once even suggested that he was sitting right there as they where doing their investigation like Dean did in the book.

I am going to leave it at that, because I do not want to spoil too much for anyone who may be reading the book or may get this movie. Over all in my opinion, the movie was alright, but they did leave out a lot of stuff from the first book.",1388534400,,2989,4.102564102564102

2376290,5,B000A6T1YA,"I watched this on NETFLIX mostly because I'm a fan of Parker Posey and was interested to see her in an action/horror role, so different from her more common quirky, comedy performances. I really enjoyed what turned out to be an unusually intelligent horror movie that, despite it's modern setting, had more in common with Mary Shelley's novel than with any later movie re-telling of the Frankenstein's monster story -- and I found Posey to be perfectly cast for the sometimes dark role of New Orleans cop Carson O'Connor.

On the other hand, the movie (as a movie) had an ending that screamed; ""Insert Sequel Trailer Here"". Also, there were recurring hints of back story suggesting that these would be elucidated in later installments. So where were they? It didn't take much Googling to discover the Dean Koontz connection, followed by his disconnection, and the production of not a series of movies, nor TV shows, but of Koontz ""novels"" (in fact, well-padded novellas, but that's a subject for a different review).

Guessing that there will never be any sequels, this remains an intelligently made, well-written movie with great performances. If you enjoyed the Kenneth Branagh/Robert de Niro Frankenstein, then you will also enjoy this new/old look at a movie stereotype. If you need to fill in those back story gaps, and if you can tolerate Koontz's born again ranting and gun club minutiae, then read the first of his books, but it isn't necessary. To find out how the story might have continued, you could read the remainder of his series, but be warned that, as they continue, the ranting gets worse, and the padding gets thicker. You might find it more rewarding to just use your own imagination to decide what a talented writer, and this perfect cast might have made of this update to Shelley's classic.",1373500800,,1812,4.87987012987013

2376292,4,B000A6T1YA,I have read many of Koontz books and enjoyed this one in book form.  This movie stayed fairly close to the book and made it interesting  very good,1372896000,,146,4.178571428571429
2376293,2,B000A6T1YA,I love Mr Koontz and was horrified that he commissioned this video. Had I seen the movie first I would have been dissuaded from reading the book.,1367280000,,145,4.407407407407407
2376294,4,B000A6T1YA,I am a school teacher and Frankenstein is part of our curriculum. This movie does follow the main points of the Dean Koontz novel which I use in class to convey universal theme and how to keep the integrity of the characters from the Shelley Frankenstein.,1365724800,,255,4.565217391304348
2376295,1,B000A6T1YA,"Yes, the character names are the same and the plot line is similar enough to drive you mad, but the acting and everything else is atrocious. The Deucalion characterization makes no sense at all. Save your money and flee just like Koontz did. Or better yet, read the book which is brilliant.",1362614400,,290,4.596153846153846
2376296,2,B000A6T1YA,"Poorly done.
This first book by Dean Koontz was awesome!
The movie, not so much.

In the book Deucalion is a very large very scary and grotesque man with a very derformed face.
In the movie he is a good looking man with a scar on his face.  ??REALLY??

Just crap.",1358726400,,263,4.117647058823529
2376297,3,B000A6T1YA,"In the tradition of all the movies based on Dean Koontz books this one unfortunately was par for the course.  In general, it's very difficult to do justice to a novel within a 1 1/2 to 2 hour film. Unless you do a mini-series like Stephen King did, but you still can't pack all the details into it.  And yet, like Koontz's other Hollywood attempts, this one is worth watching (if for nothing else) just to get an idea what these characters might look and sound like.  Now I can go back and reread Koontz's Frankenstein series and picture Parker Posey as Carson.

So if you're a big Koontz fan like I am, it's worth at least one viewing.  Compared to the horrible jobs they did with trying to bring The Watchers to the big screen, I'd say they did a slightly better job on this one.  But I think Phantoms was probably the best attempt.

There are so many things that could have been done better in this movie, with minimal effort and expense, but I think that once Koontz dropped out of the project it kind of just got finished in limbo.  The extra effort to make this movie really good just wasn't there.  I was kind of hoping they would have made it into a series or even mini-series, and see if it might have improved as it went along.

I agree with the other reviewers that you should definitely read the books first, and then watch this movie.  If you haven't read the books, you're only getting like one-tenth of the whole story from this film.",1357257600,,1449,4.32962962962963
2376318,5,B000A6T1YA,"I bought the movie because of one reason.  His name is James Purefoy.  I will watch ANYTHING he is in.
His acting is always superb.",1356566400,,131,4.2
2376319,3,B000A6T1YA,"This was a pilot that went bust. I still enjoy it and recommend due to the fact that the cast alone is worth watching. Most of them do not do TV let alone a horror pilot. It is the modern day take on Frankenstein, I have read that Dean Koontz started it all,but I've also read that He was approached by the original author of the pilot to help by writing a novelization to sell the series. I do not know which is true but it adds to the mystery of the movie. Martin Scorcese also was involved as excutive producer.
The movie moves at a good clip and the set up for the shows premise is promising. There is a series of books by Dean Koontz which procced from the pilot and first novel. I enjoy them and rewatch the movie every time i read one. I am sorry the show never came to tv. The Pre Katerina New Orleans was used and they found remarkable places to use which adds a great deal to the atmosphere. I recommend this to any Frankestein buffs I believe you will enjoy it. At this price it is a bargain of entertainment.",1307664000,,1020,4.105
2376320,2,B000A6T1YA,"Save your money, read the book. The movie tried to follow the book but it was so disjointed it made no sense.",1302048000,,109,4.0
2376321,3,B000A6T1YA,"This movie was a horrible representation of the book by Dean Koontz.  I would have to say that Mr. Koontz did a great thing by taking his name off of the movie.  With that being said if you read the book you will understand what goes on in the movie more than a person would if they didn't read the book.  There was so much left out of this movie (I call it a movie because the series didn't go past the pilot) that a reader would be disappointed in the direction that the movie headed.

If I was to rate this as a pilot (because that is what it was supposed to be) I would be giving it a much higher rating, 5 stars would definitely be fitting if it was a pilot.  Since this isn't a pilot anymore I am dropping the rating significantly because of everything that was left out.

The scar on Deucalion face was horribly underplayed.  It looks like a skin discoloration with a couple of scars that one would get from a bike accident.  If a scar like he has makes him a freak well you could of used me without any added effects and I could of passed for Deucalion.  The tattoo was missing which would of added more mystery to Deucalion and probably made him look more scary (which he is supposed to be being the first creation).

If this would be a TV series like it was supposed to be I would definitely be looking forward to watching the rest but sense it isn't a TV series I would not watch a sequel.  The book was amazing and so is the series that Mr. Koontz is writing, the movie is what happens when Hollywood takes something that they think will be good and add their thoughts to it, and the thus coming title is really a mess and looks bad for the book.",1296604800,,1658,4.118012422360248
2376322,3,B000A6T1YA,"This seems to be a part one of a made for TV movie series. A 200 year old scientist is creating a stronger race of humans that appear to have little personality or acting ability. Two detectives are assigned the task of solving these murders with New Orleans as the backdrop. During an autopsy it is discovered one of the victims was one of these super beings.

The ""why"" the monster kills was not really explained, nor do we know how many of these Frankensteins are really out there. The scenes were mostly dark. Monster make-up was light. No nudity or bad language. One sexual scene.

 The film moves a bit slow as it builds up to important action scenes that never fizzle. If you got into the X-Files stuff, this movie might interest you.",1282867200,2,741,4.474074074074074
2376323,2,B000A6T1YA,"About 15 minutes into the movie, I wanted to shout at the filmmakers ""turn on a light already!"".  It is dark.  Even when it's light (outside daylight street) it's dark, like it was underexposed two stops.  My wife and I were trying to place the lead actor, and I recognized his voice, as I could not see his face.

In one early scene, people were talking in a courthouse.  The background was lit, but the people were not, giving them a backlit effect.  The needed key lights or reflectors were simply not present.  Yet it looked like a professionally shot movie, not just some guy holding a camera.  So it was an intentional effect, even to the point of distraction.

The characters were often in silhouette, with parts of a face occasionally visible.  But this effect was carried through to every scene, which debases the effect when they are indeed in a creepy place.  And when it looks like a normal shot except for a missing light on the subject, it just looks wrong and annoying.",1253491200,2,984,4.534090909090909

The way each scene changed it looked as if it was a TV movie, and that a lot of editing had been done to shorten the film.

8075336,4,B000A6T1YA,"This was to be the first episode of a Dean Koontz-written series which, unfortunately, never was made and instead became a series of novels.  Having owned a copy of the novel and seen the movie when it originally aired, I think it's a pity the series never happened.  It looked good.  Dark, foreboding, it's more a police procedural than a horror story, with tendrils of horror.

This time, Frankenstein is called Helios and he's still searching for the perfect creature but now has a network of  his creations, some living almost normal lives but still tied to him.  The arrival in New Orleans of his original creation, now called Deucalion, and a series of gruesome murders bring together the creature and the police detective investigating. The tone is dark but compelling, the characters equally so.  Helios is handsome, cold, and prepared to sacrifice even the wife he loves (and created) when she proves imperfect. Deucalion is literate, intelligent. and determined to stop Helios.

The acting is good, the tone foreboding, the premise intriguing. Nevertheless, since this was to be a series, the story stops short of a conclusion, leaving many questions and no questions. It's too bad the series never was made because if it held to the precepts of the pilot and the novel, it would've been great.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1495843200,,1407,4.878151260504202
