2523105,3,B000EMG90O,"Let's cut out the CB Shuck and Jive once and for all. Many will not like what I have to say, but the Dukes of Hazzard should have ended when Coy and Vance we're even thought about replacing Luke and Bo.

First off, I'm a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard. Season 1 and Season 2 that is. My biggest pet peave is that the ""realism"" died clearly after Season 2 was over. Season 1, filmed directly in beautiful Covington Georiga, not on a Hollywood backlot, simply has a better feeling at being at a real-time locale. The storylines, the writing, the realism of the show simply died. And I am still annoyed by the projector screen backdrops when the actors are driving their vehicles. It looked so much better when they were actually in the car with the camera on the hood of the car. It's those teeny added touches from Season 1 and 2 that are sorely missed.

Season 6 improved on the mark by having a little more serious storylines but it's still not the original Dukes of Hazzard that I love from the '79 episodes. Rosco ruined it for me as his character basically turned into a bumbling baffoon and his stupidity got worse from season to season. Season 6 is certainly no expection.  Season 1 and 2 his believablity as being a dramatical actor was present and was certainly a believeable lawman. Now he just looks dumb on screen. I know they went for the ""comedic"" route as the seasons progressed, but why not stick with what made the original series so great.

Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg) basically got dumber too as the series has progressed. No longer a intelligent criminal politican, he's just another idiot by Rosco's side. I was pleased to see Enos, Luke and Bo return at the end of Season 5, but the storylines of 6 still far short. Storylines, and good script writing is very difficult to do. Think about it, this series has a whopping 140+ episodes in all, so I don't blame the writers totally, it's simply all the good stuff was used up. You'll see it really coming to a abrupt end in season 6 when you watch the episode with the little green men from Mars coming down to Hazzard.

However, fans of the series should probably own every episode. Even though I'll probably watch this collection one last time, I always find myself going back to Season 1 where it all got started. The first 7 episodes are 7 hours of pure fresh fun from Hazzard and defintely shows how the show became so darn popular.",1144195200,7,2400,4.433106575963719
2523106,5,B000EMG90O,the whole gang is back bo luke daisy jesse roscoe and enos are back to burn up hazzard and drive roscoe up the wall my favorite episodes are enos's last chance undercover dukes close call for daisy and a few other good episodes and since this one is coming lets get season 7 the finale out real soon,1142899200,3,299,4.172413793103448
2523107,5,B000EMG90O,"I grew up watching the Dukes when I was a girl in jr. high and high school. Our son, who was born with cerebral palsy and has been in a wheelchair all his life, started watching the Dukes reruns when he was 3 years old, and that was 21 years ago. He LOVED watching that General Lee fly through the air, and took a liking to Daisy too!

This past June, we made a lifelong dream of our son's come true. We took him down to Bristol Tennessee to the Dukesfest and he not only got to sit in the Gerneral Lee for a picture, but he met face to face with Roscoe, Bo Duke, Cooter, Cletis AND got two kisses on his cheeks from Daisy!  Yes, the original cast!  There was nothing in my life that was more special to me, than seeing the look on his face when he saw these idols of his right in front of him, talking to him, taking pictures with him!(except maybe when he met Brett Favre, but thats another story!)

You bet we are getting the 6th season of the Dukes to add to our collection!  There isn't a family show on the air today that is fun like this, and has family values that you can be proud to sit with your kids and watch.

We are headed to Nashville this year for another Dukesfest. Luke and Enos are joining the festival this year, so our son will have the complete set of 8x10's of the actors who are still alive, on his wall to show off to everyone!

YEHAW!!!!!!",1142294400,20,1366,4.055762081784387
2523108,5,B000EMG90O,"When I first found out The Dukes of Hazzard was coming to DVD, I was elated. The show debuted two months before I was born so naturally I missed the first two seasons, finally ""discovering"" the show in Season 3. It was a childhood favorite of mine and I do clearly remember my being upset when Coy and Vance took over in Season 5.

I have been able to revisit the fond memories of my past thanks to Warner Brothers. I recently found some old Dukes memorabilia I forgot I had in a box (a bowl and a plate).

I have the first five seasons on DVD and, come May 30, I'll be able to add the sixth season to my collection. Just hope the final season comes out later in the year :)",1142035200,5,674,4.022388059701493
2523109,5,B000EMG90O,"When John Schneider and Tom Wopat walked off ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" at the start of the show's fifth season over a dispute with Warner Brothers, many thought the show would never recover. Schneider and Wopat were replaced by two actors (Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer) who were forced to basically imitate the characters of Bo and Luke Duke, without making their own mark. The show marched on, and though it appeared to lose some of its luster, all that changed when Schneider and Wopat returned late in the fifth season for a royal Hazzard homecoming.

One of the disputes Schneider and Wopat were having with Warner was the lack of innovative or fresh scripts, and it appears that the writers took this into consideration when creating this, the sixth season, of ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Several of the episodes deal with more mature topics (well, as mature as the ""Dukes"" show goes!), like 'A Boy's Best Friend,' which centers around the Duke boys coming to the aid of an orphan boy; 'Brotherly Love,' which chronicles the return of Luke's long lost baby brother; 'Cooter's Girl,' where the character played by Ben Jones meets his estranged daughter; or 'The Boar's Nest Bears,' where a boy who just lost his father is comforted by the Duke family through a good old fashion basketball tournament, albeit with the interference of Boss Hogg.

I dare say that a few of the episodes are downright suspenseful and edgier, most notably 'Enos's Last Chance,' where Sonny Shroyer's character is chased down by a hit man bent on revenge on the Hazzard deputy. (This is one of my most favorite episodes of the entire run of ""The Dukes of Hazzard."") This season also produces one of those classic '80s 2-part episodes built around a big storyline in 'Undercover Dukes,' which is surely one of the most creative and intriguing episodes of the entire series run, most likely due to the tension that is played out within the Duke family during this episode.  Then there is 'Play It Again, Luke,"" where Luke's former girlfriend, now a rising singer, returns to Hazzard as her manager tries to cash in on her life-insurance policy.

A discussion on season six of this series wouldn't be complete without mentioning the classic episode 'Two Many Rosco's,' where James Best plays a dual role and shows off some of his old dramatic acting skills. And longtime cast member Peggy Rea returns as Lulu Hogg in 'Lulu's Gone Away,' where Sorrel Booke's character of Boss Hogg continues to shine in an episode that shows both Boss Hogg's softer side and grittier side while trying to catch the kidnappers who abducted her.

All these shows still contain all of the lighthearted antics of Boss Hogg and Rosco (who are funnier and cleverer than ever in this season), the warm and down-home charm of Uncle Jesse (played by Denver Pyle) and the sultry sexiness of Catherine Bach, who is still wearing her 'Daisy Duke' shorts during these late-era ""Dukes"" seasons.

It is amazing to see how well the show continued into its sixth season (not to mention rebounding from the overhauled fifth season), and a lot of the episodes found here are incredibly fresher and better written than some of the episodes found in earlier seasons. This season of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ranks up there with the best of them all, and is highly recommended. A big thanks to Warner Brothers for releasing this series in a timely fashion and treating it with the respect it deserves. They don't make good, wholesome family fun shows like this anymore!

Bonus features for this season release feature Ben Jones (Cooter) and Sonny Shroyer (Enos) in a tour of the original Hazzard County, which was actually Covington, Georgia, where the first episodes of the series were originally filmed, and a special documentary on the Dukes' famous car, the General Lee.",1141430400,50,3809,4.83282208588957
2523110,5,B000EMG90O,"I'm looking forward to watch the sixth and seventh seasons. The last season was quite good, really a shame that Bryan and Christopher didn't comment an episode. I think that if Tom and John hadn't returned to the show, those Coy and Vance fellows would have done pretty nice. Remember they were new to the show, but Bo and Luke had four seasons of experience - so thanks for the great job Christopher and Bryan, you took a mission impossible and together with the rest of the crew made history!

Thanks to WB for releasing this season, but please don't wait for Christmas with the last season. And please release Enos - that would be a nice Christmas resent.

Oh yes the review: Just buy The Dukes of Hazzard - The Complete Sixth Season!

Live Long and Prosper

Bo & Luke, the main stars of the show are back for good(after they left last season). Season 6 of Dukes has some really good episodes, ""Too many Roscos"" just to name one. I highly recommend this season to any Dukes fan. One more season after this to be released!!! YAY!!!
