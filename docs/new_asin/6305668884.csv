7894466,4,6305668884,It was a good show but it alluded to history between some of the characters but that was not long enough to go into any in-depth.,1350345600,,129,4.0
7894467,4,6305668884,"I originally saw this years ago, but just the first part. I always wanted to see more and I got my chance this year. This film is very fast-paced and loaded with action but Wild Cardz is very short. Most legitimate anime fans and even the Pokeman-loving types will find something to like in this film.",1084492800,,301,4.392857142857143
7894468,1,6305668884,"My mother bought me this pitiful anime when she went out shopping one day. Liking the artwork on the cover, I decided to watch it. After watching it, all I could think was
""That was the stupidest and most void-of-sense piece of crap I have ever wasted my time to watch.""
There is next to no plot here, but something to do with giant chess pieces invading a card kingdom. It started off looking promosing but quickly became a jumble of nonsense and pointless action which dances across the scene and then suddenly ends. Watching this is akin to seeing a giant squid fly past your window, you have no idea what is was and only leaves you confused.
The worst thing about this anime is that it has no recognizable begginning OR end. I mean I thought that the volume I got was somewhere in the middle of the series. Wrong. I think this whole thing was just made to test animation skills.
Other things that were bad besides what I've just mentioned include the faint audio so you can barely hear what the characters are saying, a character who uses an attack which removes all her clothes, and the black market character who just makes me wince; is it meant to be a racial stereotype?
My verdict: Dont waste your money. I'm glad mine was a gift and it wasn't MY money wasted.",1077580800,2,1269,4.404255319148936
7894469,4,6305668884,"In what I guess is a fantasy kingdom that looks quite a bit like one of our own contemporary cities, the land is protected by four super heroines whose powers are linked with the four different suites of cards. (One woman fights with spades, another with clubs, and so on.) However, the show focuses specifically on one, Jo Diamond. Perhaps if more episodes had been made, as it seems was meant to be the case, future enteries would have had the other three as the center point?
Anyway, in the episode that we get to watch the girls must defeat a gigantic chess peice that is wrecking havoc in the city and is crewed by bad guys. Also Jo is reunited with a guy who seems to be an ex-lover. Unfortunately this is only hinted at and we aren't given much backround information as to their past histories. Some other drawbacks are the Chinese guy, who will be a turn-off for anyone who is offended by Chinese people being potrayed as buffonish steriotypes. (Kind of like Shampoo and the tour guide from Ranma 1/2. Do the Japanese think it's funny to poke fun at the Chinese?)
Still and all, I liked this show. It's got cute characters, lots of comedy, action, and nice voice acting. (I have yet to hear the Japanese voices, but the English ones are quite good. Debbie Rabbai, who does the voice of Female Maze from MAZE, Ayane from AYANE'S HIGH KICK, and Rubette from GOKUDO, is our heroine Jo.) One last thing, though. The end is something of a cliffhanger, in that we don't know for certain if one of the superheroines survives or not.",1071532800,,1533,4.478571428571429
7894470,1,6305668884,"IMHO this was the worst anime i've seen in an awful long time! From what I could make out, four women of the kingdoms card team protects the kingdom and in this case a giant chess peice. From there, it just seemed like a bunch of fast anime scenes and ""Here we go!"" kind of monolog with lots of naughty shots. I would either save your money or rent it but don't waste it buying this.",1002499200,2,383,4.052631578947368
7894471,4,6305668884,"This is a crazy fast-paced anime originally titled Jaja Uma Quartette. The art is very crisp with its bright colors, and the soundtrack is pretty cool. Wild Cardz, is about four women: Coco Hearts, Jo Diamonds, Casa Clubs, and Sunday Spades, who are Crown Knights, protectors of the Card Kingdom. One day, a large white pawn begins to hover mindlessly through the Card Kingdom and destroys everything in its path. The Crown Knights are called to stop the pawn, even though nobody really knows how. Later on, the pawn upgrades to a knight, and black chess pieces begin to enter the fray. Also involved is a Chinese guy with a bad accent, and a semi-mysterious guy wearing blue. If you like obscure stuff like this, then you need this anime.",992995200,3,739,4.6923076923076925
