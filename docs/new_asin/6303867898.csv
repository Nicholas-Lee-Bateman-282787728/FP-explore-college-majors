720107,4,6303867898,"An ambitious waitress  (Constance Bennett) - who works at the famed Brown Derby restaurant - has aspirations to become an actress, and makes it to the top. Bennett gives an excellent performance as Mary Evans, making her turn from ingenue to hardened star fully believable: she considered this to be her finest performance.  As the egotistical, rather decadent film director, Lowell Sherman is fine. This was George Cukor's first big success as well as the first talking picture which took a jaundiced look at Hollywood.  As a footnote, this story, which was written by the once-popular Hollywood columnist Adela Rogers St. John was the basis for the three later versions of A STAR IS BORN. It was supposedly based upon the real life of silent star Colleen Moore and her alcoholic producer husband, John McCormick.",1032825600,11,814,5.014814814814815

7853997,5,6303867898,"What Price Hollywood grabs you from the first frame in one of the most creative openings I've seen in a movie.  Constance Bennett is not only stunningly beautiful, but also an actress with great range and control of her instrument.  Paired with the brilliant Lowell Sherman who was a stage and silent screen star, these two actors play out the story of its title, explored later by Fredric March and Janet Gaynor in A Star is Born and again by Judy Garland (singing the unforgettable song The Man That Got Away) and James Mason.  I purchased a used VCR of the film since a DVD was not available. I recommend it especially historically to see how 'modern' the world of the 20's and 30's was compared to what we think of as 'modern' today.",1411344000,2,737,4.485074626865671
7853998,5,6303867898,"This is an exceptionally fine film.  It is amazing how modern it looks! It has been daringly filmed by one of Hollywood's most sensitive and talented directors: George Cukor.  As a story, it is a very accurate picture of life in Hollywood, the ups and downs of movie folk.  After seeing it, I came to prefer WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD? to the three A STAR IS BORN that came later, although the Janet Gaynor film is also terrific.  Constance Bennett is wonderful in every single frame of the film, and the cast as a whole gives her great support. WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD? has the right balance between comedy and drama and never feels boring. I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the early talkies.",1405641600,,710,4.566929133858268

I had seen this film some years ago and was waiting patiently for WAC to issue this in their DVD series. At last it happened. The film is an early version of what became the Selznick International 1937 Technicolor A Star Is Born with Janet Gaynor. The 1932 film is a fine print and stars Constance Bennett in the lead. Plenty of good outdoor Hollywood scenes to be seen here. A by from the Warner Archive Collection.",1398729600,,630,4.575221238938053

Nice script by Adela Rogers St. Johns.  An early talkie which means some of it very dated but for those interested in the evolution of the story it is interesting to see.",1393804800,2,369,4.492537313432836
7854002,4,6303867898,"Hollywood's endless absorption with itself has been endemic since the very beginning. The silent era looked at itself in films like Chaplin's satirical ""Behind the Screen"" (1916), Hal Roach's ""The Cinema Director"" (1916), ""The Extra Girl"" (1923) with comedy legend Mabel Normand and Buster Keaton's ""The Cameraman"" (1928). There was even an animated short ""Felix in Hollywood"" (1923) which shouldn't be confused with the later ""Daffy Duck in Hollywood"" (1938) or Porky Pig's ""The Film Fan"" (1939). Talkies only increased Hollywood's self-consciousness, and the early 30s had films like Buster Keaton's ""Free and Easy"" (1930), Harlow's ""Bombshell"" (1933), ""The Lady Killer"" with Jimmy Cagney, and Richard Dix in ""It Happened in Hollywood"" (1937).

One of the major early themes was the creation of a new star, illustrated in films like ""Souls for Sale"" (1923), ""Life and Death of 9413: A Hollywood Extra"" (1928), King Vidor's ""Show People"" (1928), ""Movie Crazy"" (1932) with Harold Lloyd, and ""Letter of Introduction"" (1938) with Adolph Menjou.

1932's ""What Price Hollywood"" falls into that genre, with the twist of showing the rise of a new star and the simultaneous decline of an established director.

Constance Bennett (1904-65) stars as the aspiring actress. She started in the silent era and made 50+ films between 1916 and 1966. She's best known for her work in comedies (""Topper""). She is the sister of Joan Bennett and Barbara Bennett.

Lowell Sherman (1888-1934) plays the established director, and it's been said he was playing a self-parody even while it was assumed he was playing his brother in law, John Barrymore. Sherman was an actor in the silent era and transitioned to being a director when talkies came in.  He directed 15 films between 1928 and 1935, specializing in ""women's films"", including Mae West in ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933), Loretta Young in ""Born to be Bad"" (1934), ""The Royal Bed"" (1931) with Mary Astor and Bachelor Apartment""  (1931) with Irene Dunne and Mae Murray.

Sherman's performance in this film is truly exceptional. His final scene is shot in slow motion, reminding one of the Peckinpah stylized photography that came decades later.

This was the film debut of Eddie Anderson (1905-1977), known for his many years playing ""Rochester"" with Jack Benny. Their association began in 1937 on radio.

The camerawork for this film is exceptional given the times. This is due to the skills of Charles Rosher (1885-1974). He was nominated 6 times for an Oscar and won twice - ""Sunrise"" (1929) and ""The Yearling"" (1947). During the 20s he was the highest paid cinematographer in the world.

George Cukor (1899-1983) directs. Cukor was nominated 5 times for an Oscar and won once (""My Fair Lady"") in 1964. He's best known for his comedies ( ""The Philadelphia Story"", ""Adams Rib"", ""Born Yesterday"", ""Pat and Mike"") but was equally capable with drama (""Romeo and Juliet"",  ""A Star is Born"", ""Gaslight""). He's famous for saying - ""Don't just do something, stand there!""

Pandro Berman produced for RKO. Berman was to RKO what Irving Thalberg was to MGM. Under his careful eye RKO produced such classics as ""The Gay Divorcee"" (1934), ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), ""Alice Adams"" (1935), ""Top Hat"" (1935), ""Stage Door"" (1937), ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), and ""Gunga Din"" (1939). Six of his films earned Oscars for Best Picture. `

The film was remade in 1937 as ""A Star is Born"" with Janet Gaynor, Fredric March, and Adolphe Menjou, and again in 1954 with Judy Garland, James Mason, and Jack Carson. The 1937 version was nominated for 8 Oscars and won for Writing and Color Photography. The 1954 version was nominated for 6 Oscars and won Golden Globes for Garland and Mason.

1932 was a good year for films - Grand Hotel"" was the Oscar and box office king, Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (""Red Headed Woman"" and ""Red Dust"") as did Miriam Hopkins (""Trouble in Paradise"" and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") and Wallace Beery (""Champ"" and ""Grand Hotel""). Other notable films from that year were ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Freaks"",""A Farewell to Arms"", ""Scarface"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Tarzan The Ape Man"".

The NY Times said parts of the film ""are very amusing, intentionally, and others are despite themselves. Sections of it are very sorrowful, in the bewildered manner of a lost scenario writer, and yet others are quite agreeable."" They concluded that the film ""is not all bad"" Variety called it ""a fan magazine-ish interpretation of Hollywood plus a couple of twists"".

Bottom line - another ""Hollywood looks at itself"" film, but with exceptional camerawork for the times and an excellent performance from Lowell Sherman.",1330300800,7,4666,5.0090439276485785
7854003,5,6303867898,"What Price Hollywood? has lots of wonderful acting and great drama to keep you interested the entire way through the picture! I certainly wasn't bored. Constance Bennett turns in an excellent performance as a young woman hungry for stardom; and Neil Hamilton along with Lowell Sherman do equally fine jobs of acting, too. The plot moves along at a very good pace; and the cinematography impresses me. The choreography shines as well. I also like the way they used movies in a movie to tell the story what can really go on in Hollywood when the fans aren't looking.

When the picture starts we quickly meet Hollywood director Maximillan 'Max' Carey (Lowell Sherman) who arrives at the famed Brown Derby Hollywood restaurant for dinner. His waitress that evening is Mary Evans (Constance Bennett); and he takes a liking to her--and she does to him, hoping that he'll give her a break into pictures despite the fact that he's rather drunk that evening. Together they go to a premiere of Carey's films; and when Mary hams it up at the radio announcer's microphone everyone across the country wants to know who this mystery woman is.

It isn't long before they find out, either. At first Mary has some trouble figuring out how to act the right way for a scene in one of Max's pictures; but she practices over and over again to get it right. Soon she becomes a huge Hollywood star, much to the delight of studio bigwig Julius Saxe (Gregory Ratoff). At about the same time, Mary meets the very wealthy Lonny Borden (Neil Hamilton) and after they get to know each other they marry with a huge staged church wedding so that Julius Saxe can use their wedding for publicity purposes! This is only the beginning of the price Mary will have to pay for being in pictures.

Tensions heat up between Lonny and Mary; they don't always see eye to eye and Lonny doesn't like that Mary helps Max when he's down and out--and as time passes Max is down and out more and more of the time. Max develops quite a problem with alcoholism; and he can't stop himself even when Mary tries her best to help him. Eventually Lonny leaves Mary after he comes to the conclusion that she's too involved with Max's personal problems; Lonny even divorces Mary not knowing she's expecting their first born child.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Mary be able to get Max rehabilitated and ready to be a masterful Hollywood director once again? Will Julius Saxe take Max back at the studio and let him direct pictures there? And what about Mary and Lonny's child, Jackie (Jackie Paige)--will his birth bring Lonny back to Mary after all? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

What Price Hollywood? is such a good picture that it inspired three remakes all of which were entitled A Star Is Born. This is probably the best version of this tale next to Judy Garland's 1954 musical version. The acting is very convincing and there's never a dull moment. This was also one of the very first films to ever tackle head on the not-so-glamorous problems that occur behind the scenes in Hollywood; we learn that fame comes at a price. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; and people who enjoy classic movies will definitely want this in their collections.",1242691200,4,3267,4.6355785837651124
