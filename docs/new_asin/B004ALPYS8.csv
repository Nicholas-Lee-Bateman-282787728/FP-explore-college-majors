8420448,5,B004ALPYS8,"I really loved this dvd. I just recently acquired a barbell. It was loaded with 20 pounds which felt too heavy for many of the exercises, so I switched off to dumbbells (and fairly light dumbbells, too). You do not need a barbell to do this. I felt it hit all the major muscle groups, was not too long like many dvds are. Lots of balance work, and good core work at the end.",1443657600,,374,4.0675675675675675

8420450,2,B004ALPYS8,"I bought this and ended up selling it.  I wanted a barbell workout but this moved way too slow for me. I think someone who is just starting with weights however may like it.  If you are intermediate or advanced, there are far better choices available.",1391040000,2,251,4.434782608695652
8420451,5,B004ALPYS8,I found this workout refreshing.  It feels as if all of the key muscles get toned and the entire workout is 30 minutes.  It is a great option for a busy schedule!,1372550400,,162,4.03125
8420452,5,B004ALPYS8,"The video is a little slow and if the weights aren't heavy enough, you might not feel you achieved a good workout.  However, if you have the appropriate weights, you will really feel the burn and see results.  This is a good buy.",1297296000,3,229,4.3023255813953485
