2444171,5,B000BWFWG4,"I first became familier with Roswell after purchasing the first season DVD set early last year. Since then I have became one of the shows biggest fans. I was a bit concerned that the second and third seasons would not be as good as the first, but to my surprise they are just as good if not better. Roswell is still one of my favorite TV shows. Season 1 deals more with the relationship/love story between Max and Liz. The second season deals more with the sc-fi aspect while the love story takes a backseat. The third and final season has the best of both the love story and sci-fi story. I have to say I have never cared much for sci-fi series but Roswell is so much more than just that. Like the wonderful first and second season, the third season still takes you on a emotional journey. As you go through each episode you still find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. The sad thing is with the final season the characters are not always hanging out together at the crash down cafe. They are doing their own things which is a bit hard for me because I was so accustomed to them being together, but it was just part of there characters growing up. It was so hard to see the last season of Roswell come to an end. I have discovered one of the best shows with Roswell and highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a great tv show that will inspire and get them addicted!",1138320000,10,1461,4.297101449275362

The love story of two people from two different worlds is amazing the chemistry Max and Liz have for each other is out of this world. The way he looks at her is a way all girls would love to be looked at. Season one was the best one, the cast all amazing.

They did finish the story, the characters were pretty well fleshed out and there was a really good story behind it but, like so many fine science fiction it was not let to run it's course, think Farscape and Firefly.

2444222,5,B000BWFWG4,This is a great sci-fi show.  Liked  rewatching it on DVD.  My only complaint is the DVD doesn't have a play all on each disc so you have to play each episode individually.,1445990400,,172,4.151515151515151

2444224,3,B000BWFWG4,"I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi as a general rule, with a few exceptions such as Star Trek TNG and this show. While I found the stereotypical female protagonist asinine and predictable in very much the same way as I felt about it in, for example, the Vampire Diaries (""oh, she's such a strong person...but also fragile...and vulnerable...but she can kick ass""...OMG GAG ME WITH A SPOON!), I thought this show deserved more kudos than it got. I think it was a bit of hit-or-miss at the time because it wasn't sci-fi enough for fans of the genre, but too ""out there"" for those who preferred a more grounded subject-matter. All in all, seasons 1 & 2 are quite good but the last season, for me, was kind of a waste.",1444003200,,708,4.371212121212121

2444227,5,B000BWFWG4,Roswell is one of my favorite shows.  I've watched all 3 seasons twice and decided I had to have it on DVD so I could watch it again in the future.,1441411200,,147,3.7419354838709675

2444230,5,B000BWFWG4,"I absolutely loved Roswell. It stood out because the characters- both alien and human- acted realistically. The story was believable Sci-fi. Some of the current series are just irritating because it is endless battles, backstabbing, inflated egos, dark scenes, traitors, and characters that switch from good to bad and bad to good.

Each episode added to the background without constantly leaving you with unresolved storylines. I particularly liked that most episodes happened during the day and there was no over-acted emotionalism.",1438128000,2,534,5.592592592592593

2444232,5,B000BWFWG4,"Great series that plays up on the teen romance and drama angle with the interesting twist of some of those teens are from another planet. Compelling story in the first season really draws you in and has you rooting for its characters. The second and third season are just okay but don't let me sway your opinion, check it out on your own. This is one of those series that we come back to after a while to sit down and binge watch for fun.",1435449600,,438,4.1647058823529415

2444235,3,B000BWFWG4,"My daughter talked me into watching this show.  Kinda' immature and sophomoric.  (My wife describes it as a teen age, alien soap opera...probably a very apt description).  Fun to watch, but hard to watch.  Very easy to do something else, something more important, when its on.  Maybe you'll like it, wasn't worth the time for me.",1432857600,,329,4.803571428571429

2444254,5,B000BWFWG4,"Great series! I spent the weekend watching it, then a week watching it again. There are so many twist and turns in it. Wish they would make more. I have lots of family from Roswell so I was interested in the movies. Didn't know so many high school students were so talented. Of course, their stories were taken over by professionals, but the students started it. I had not seen or heard anything actually before about this before other than knowing they were available. Now, I wish I could get my hands on a lot more.",1424908800,,517,4.395833333333333

2444257,5,B000BWFWG4,"For how emotional this series gets, it is amazingly unawkward.  I could knit pick here and there at a few things but in its entirety, the series gets progressively more and more interesting, all the way to the end of third season, where it seems (3rd season) budget is cut, but it does not affect the series in a negative way by the end of 3rd season, it is at it's best and you are hoping for more.  That leaves my major complaint about the series, this series could have easily had 4 more seasons, there are so many elements that it could concentrate on.  However sadly no more seasons, if they ever did a revamp, it might be good, but it would not be same without these actors, playing their respective roles.  The actors in this series really seemed to be absorbed in their roles and all positive effects of that can be observed.  Why is it that all good sci fi tv series come to an early end!!??  Dark Angel Roswell.  If someone out there is listening please make another ""superhuman sci fi series with emotional connection with its audience"" like this with at least 8 seasons with 160 episodes.  The combination is amazing.  By themselves the two parts are usually negligible, but together, in my opinion it is one of the best type of tv series out there.",1423440000,,1261,4.424242424242424
2444258,3,B000BWFWG4,This series was excellent even with the novice actors involved. They rose to the occasion. The story is unique and completely engaging for SciFi fans. They really should have had a longer run but the writing did suffer near the end. Maybe that hurt ratings too much? Now for the 3-star explanation. I started watching this on Netflix and was quickly disappointed that the original music had been removed - no doubt due to the cost of licensing. So I turned to Amazon to find the original DVD's with original music. NOT TO BE FOUND. I can't express how much the mediocre studio music they inserted detracts from the quality of the show. I don't understand why the distributor didn't release a more expensive set of DVD's with original music. I would have paid double.,1423267200,2,766,4.681481481481481
2444259,4,B000BWFWG4,"The big downside is that they changed 95% of the music.  The theme song, for example, is the same.  Season 3, from UPN, looks different than the previous two seasons, from the WB.  The vibe of the show changed then, but it could just be because it was a more mature season.",1422144000,,273,4.211538461538462
2444260,5,B000BWFWG4,I love this show! Everyone I've recommended it to has ended up loving it as well. It's a must watch!,1422144000,,100,4.05

2444263,5,B000BWFWG4,I had never heard of Roswell until the new star crossed show started.  I was curious so went on u tube and got hogged and needed to see how it ended so brought the whole Seasons. I must have watched each of the episodes 10 times and can t stop watching it.  don t know where i was when this came out.  I can t believe I missed it on tv.  Love it and wished there was more.,1395619200,,372,3.730769230769231
2444264,5,B000BWFWG4,"What if an interstellar ship crashes releasing alien-human hybrid orphans adopted as human? What problems will they face while growing up? What will become of those people that discover the secret? What would you do in the situations?

There are a few episodes that experiment with same actors playing different characters, and many of the other experiments we see with series today.

This was a lot of fun to watch as a 2684 minute marathon form start to stop. After the last episode, that wrapped the story up better than most series, you keep waiting for the movies franchise to take over. Waiting, waiting waiting ...

I am going about this backwards and now plan to read the series.

The love between Max and Liz is SO intense (something many women dream of) and I don't know why I had never watched this show when it was first aired. If you are a sucker for love stories, this is a keeper. I just wished there were more than 3 seasons worth. I just can't get enough of Max. He is absolutely gorgeous!!",1389484800,,395,4.142857142857143
2444269,5,B000BWFWG4,"Since I am watching the Roswell Series again I figured that I would write a review on it. The basic show is about 3 and sometimes more alien/human hybrids living among society today (well at least the year 2000), they are adopted and as they say ""hide in plain sight"" until there secret is known to a few of their High School Circle.
  This show does have some flaws but the chemistry between all the actors is fantastic, they really did a good job casting and that is what makes the show work for me. Stars include young Katherine Heigl, Jason Behr, Brendan Fehr, Shiri Appleby, Nick Weschler, and Colin Hanks. The veteran actor of the show is William Sadler who plays Sheriff Valenti and is my favorite actor and character's in the show. Guest, Co-Star, and re-appearing actors are Jonathan Frakes (Star Trek TNG), David Conrad (Ghost Whisper), Emile De Raven and Terry O'Quinn from Lost, and Gretchen Egolf.
  The Lead Alien is Max who is involved with Liz and their romance is the constant storyline of the series, the show incorporates all the elements of High School Love, real world situations, and of course the Sci-Fi element which is strong in some episodes and kept to a minimal in others. If you are a fan of The X-Files, Supernatural, and other ""deep"" Sci-Fi then you would most likely enjoy this. The intro of the show is catchy and Dido's ""Here With Me"" is perfectly fitting for the show, there are also some cool  tribute videos on You Tube.
  The series finale is sudden because of the shows early cancellation and is a real tear jerker. This show does have a cult like following and there is even a movie campaign to make a full length feature that some of the actors have signed on to, that is pretty high on my wish list but not sure it will happen.
  My favorite three episodes would be Summer of 47, Viva Las Vegas, and Graduation (Series Finale).  I do recommend the show and hope that you enjoy watching the series.",1389398400,,1939,4.514285714285714

I've gotten all my siblings and a ton of friends into them as adults and we have had a blast watching them over and over. I love the characters in this show.

In short, they look and act like normal teenagers.  The four characters, Max, Michael, Isabel, and Tess have tremendous powers, but do not understand where they came from or how they got there.  Roswell, was the sight of the famous UFO sighting in 1947.  This fact adds to the mystery that surrounds these teens.  The series is appropriate for pre-teens, teens and adults.

ROSWELL

WARNING Contains spoilers
-- just get the series ,( I saw it streaming, its a keeper for the DVD, those I do not have so I cannot comment on the DVD's themselves)
-- if you seen it or do not care read on----
Its useful to read the Wikipedia and other articles about a series to understand the drama behind the drama:  The music that was dropped from the original airing; from the get - go this series faced cancellation ie if it weren't for a package deal with another well known show obtained by a network, the third season never would have happened.  I can only theorize the glut of somewhat similar type shows at the time must have caused teenage angst series fatigue among the target audience.  There was a show about a creek, another that took place in a rocky mountain town and certainly Buffy.

But surprisingly, there still  is a cult following years later and for anyone, the Roswell series is definitely worth a look.  For one thing, the show has feelings and complex relationships, so women should like it, and just enough action adventure to keep men interested.  The science fiction overtones are there but not overbearing.  The show cleans up nicely through its three seasons-  a start to finish of the story, a complete saga.  Many canceled shows are unable to accomplish this, leaving the book half unread, but here there are very few dangling threads.

Another, it seemed to bring up some interesting ideas and situations I still think about.  The  sheriff's dad once a man of vigor and strength now  aged and infirm, had oatmeal on his clean shirt and as the result of a fit or something. And earlier, he could not eat his pears without assistance.  The constant rocky relationship that Alien Michael and Human Maria had was a never ending source of amusement--ie Michael gets caught by Maria over something and he sits down and says to her seemly sour puss ""Let me have it,"" resigned to his fate and the storm he expects to come.

The alien side of things are definitely emotive and heartfelt yet disquieting and psychopathic.  Note to self, if someone is discovered to be a space alien FEIGN IGNORANCE , --some of those aliens will turn you into dust if deemed too snoopy nosed and the government, if they feel you know too much, will roll your body into a ditch.

The last season has a new character introduced to the cast , Jesse, secret love interest of Isabel .  He is not an original character in the book the series is derived from but an addition (as if the series followed the books closely anyway).  It took me  awhile to warm up to him and he may have been an intentionally ironic addition-Hispanic, his people having a at least a stereotypical history current and past of being illegal aliens, in love with a space alien probably as illegal as anything could ever be.  Isabel suddenly marries him.  Unlike her brothers, who tell their sweethearts they are from another planet,  Isabel keeps it a secret from her husband who then begins to get a clue when he randomly gets tossed into unmarked vans by guys in suites and sunglasses and is endlessly interrogated about his wife(an exaggeration, but you get the idea).

There are several ways to end a series, among which are to kill everyone or at least half the main cast and  blow everything else up, but to the show creators' credit, neither really occurs.  One of the cast is killed off, but this one was absent most of the 3rd season and was one of the  psychopathic aliens so it was not entirely unexpected nor heartbreaking.  The rest drive off into the sunset in a beat up van leaving some puzzled parents behind.  The Human Husband splits away from the Alien Wife after not a whole lot of convincing to pursue his dream job.  Yes, sex with an alien woman is surprisingly good and transcendentally hallucinogenic, but few things can surpass $350,000 a year in Boston.  I imagine if he is really in love, he will keep track of her and use some of his premium salary to buy the fugitives a better van with air conditioning.

5 stars, but I take away one for a somewhat confusing plot arc.  The relationship with Max and Liz drives the series and since this is not dark fiction,  it is expected they have some sort of satisfying happy resolution.  One episode has future Max self saying to  Liz girlfriend she must breakup with past Max self else the planet, galaxy and universe will be overrun by enemy aliens and everyone they know dies horribly.  This is expectantly defeated later on when Liz seems to forget about this and lures Max back  BUT  without a reasonable explanation of why it is safe to do so.",1301356800,,4647,4.543922984356198

2444293,5,B000BWFWG4,"Roswell is a really good series with excellent actors and actresses.  It draws you into its small town appeal and doesn't let go until the end.  I ended up watching the whole series while on vacation and enjoyed every minute of it.  Once it was all over (short-lived; 3 seasons) I was left with a pang in my stomach, wanting more.  There aren't many shows that only last three seasons yet are able to do what Roswell did.  It was filmed around the millennium and is timeless, except for the large clunky cell phones.  There were so many things about this series that were endearing.  Who didn't want to go visit the Crash Down Cafe?  It's only been 8 years since the series ended, but so much has changed in the real world since then.  Roswell has this American small-town nostalgia that's infectious.  I highly recommend this series.",1279238400,2,834,4.574324324324325

Well written and acted by an anstonishing cast of people you never heard of,but now want to know. A very compelling story line and charecters that are worth watching whenever you need to get away from it all. Like a good book to sink your imagination into. Enjoy!",1263081600,,351,4.5
2444296,4,B000BWFWG4,"Jason Katims, who has since gone on to more fame with the critically acclaimed Friday Night Lights really began his climb (in my humble opinion) with this well-made and clever tale of the alien babies who crashed in Roswell in 1947 before growing up as teenagers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This show was cancelled at least three or four times before its final cancellation, before fan campaigns brought it back (the famous Tabasco Hot Sauce campaigns) and the constant shifts in focus, style and format demonstrate the many attempts to grab, well not an audience which it had, but the attention and support of the studio Execs who kept cancelling it. This show launched Katherine Heigl's career though she pretends this show never happened and several other familiar faces made appearances over the years. This show is a very entertaining show, if not a masterpiece, and the contours of storyline and format give a great sense of how challenging it must be to work in television, to structure and conceive an entertaining show. Katims found his footing with this show and demonstrated a clear eye for talent with his casting choices as he has continued to do with Friday Night Lights. This is a great addition to any individual who misses the old WB network and the teen-oriented shows it gave us.",1261094400,11,1305,4.804444444444444

Not as much special effects as I would have liked, but the story line and the characters' depth made up for all of it --- this is a keeper...",1259280000,2,425,4.234567901234568
2444299,5,B000BWFWG4,"The Roswell series was made several years ago with the older Teen in mind, but the plots that intertwine throughout the seasons are well thought out and help keep the expectancy levels at a all time high. Emotions get touched as we see mans inhumanity to those who are seen to be different and are subjected to painful body intrusions in the name of science. The sad thing is that this touches the raw emotion because we are only too well aware that this type of treatment is happening today and has happened in the past. Season three ends neatly and while it is open ended enough to start a fourth season, which would make all us older Roswellians very, very happy - it leaves no loose ends.

The first few episodes were a bit too corny for my taste, but then the series really took off and became a must-purchase. I bought all three seasons without having seen the last two, and loved them.

This is a great deal -- but bear in mind that the packaging leaves something to be desired. In opening each individual case and checking the disks, I discovered that at least one side of each case was broken, leaving the disks sliding around without protection. None of them were scratched, but I'm not too happy. The slim cases need TLC.",1242000000,2,617,4.558558558558558

About a month ago I went onto[...]where I noticed they actually had the entire first season of Roswell on the site, I started watching and imediately was addicted, I ended up watching the whole first season in only a few days and once I watched all the episodes on Hulu I knew I had to buy the rest.  I noticed people saying they thought the main actors didn't do very good and that they could have found better actors, but I think if anyone else had played any of the roles in roswell it wouldnt have been the awesome show that it is.  The series really keeps you wondering whats going to happen and how all the relationships are going to develop.  I thought I would be disapointed with the ending due to the fact that I was so addicted and thought there could have been at least another season, and that no ending would be good enough this soon, but I was pleasently suprised, It was a really great happy ending.

2444309,5,B000BWFWG4,"ever since it first aired on the wb i have been a fan of roswell, something about it is just fascinating. the first few episodes of the series are kind of slow going but its really to get you to understand whats going on. i watched this show grow throughout the 3 seasons it was alive and was sad to see it end. ALL the actors have this amazing chemistry together, you actually start believing the characters and forming this ""bond"" with them even though they're just characters on a tv show. the first season deals more with max saving Liz's life and this connection & attraction between them, its really mostly about their love story (outcast alien boy with special powers saves crushs life and they fall in love but it comes with a price) the second season (the one i happen to like the most) deals more with the sci-fi aspect and theres alot going on and you really have to pay attention because there are alot of little things that lead up to a crazy season finale and you don't even pay much attention to those details and once they all come together in the season finale you are like ""OMG I CANT BELIEVE I DIDNT SEE THAT!"" there is also a very hugggeeee drift between max & liz and basically the aliens & humans in general all because of a very sad & important moment in the show. you start realizing that not everyone is who you thought they were...someone has a secret that has a HUGE impact on all their lives. third season deals with a bit of both, love & sci-fi and although its not my favorite season (its the one i like the least out of the 3) it is still pretty good. liz and max get a little reckless and hit some road bumps not only in their relationship but between them and their parents... this is the season i really get mad at max's parents, they drive me nuts but in the end it ends up being for the better. an enemy returns unexpectedly, liz has been going through some MAJOR changes and liz and the aliens are being hunted...

i really didn't want to get into too much detail because anyone who has seen the show knows all there is to know and those who havnt i don't want to spoil it for you but all in all this is a purchase worth going through with. ive gotten countless friends hooked on this show and had them end up buying all the seasons themselves too! take a chance on a great show with fantastic acting and believable characters. this show will always be one of my top 3 favorite shows of all time (veronica mars & supernatural being the other 2)",1228348800,3,2481,4.267515923566879

It was cast very well and if everyone would have behaved in a professional manner and honored the terms of their contracts (and not tried to get out of them!) I feel it would have went for at least 5 seasons and been a lot more full-bodied and well-fleshed-out.  I recall reading a TV Guide interview with the actress who is now on that medical drama that she admitted she had not really grasped what whe was getting herself into with signing a contract and didn't want to continue being on a science-fiction show.  Maybe the direction the show started-off in at the beginning and thru the first season would have continued (had that not occurred) but it seems like they did take a turn towards really rushing the information that was more sci-fi oriented for the second and third seasons.  Had they had 5 it could have maintained the steady momentum of the relationship development with a stream of science fiction constantly running thru it and not a deluge.

2444315,4,B000BWFWG4,"I've become a little obsessive about the series Rosewell.  In the beginnig it is a real retelling of the Tragedy of Romeo and Julliet, complete with balcony scenes, which they allude to in the series.  Very powerful and in these days not believable, the writers going to extremes to have the main characters not consumate their relationship, including a time travel expisode to stop them.  Still, I like the main characters well enough to continue on to find out what happens.  The later part  of the series the Sci-Fi takes over, but the establishment of the earlier rapport between the viewer and the cast allows the story to be carried forward with the viewer's intrest not diminishing.  I like the series.",1218931200,3,709,4.818181818181818
2444316,3,B000BWFWG4,"Allot can be said about the teen drama's that have ruled the airwaves for years now and here is my take of this teen drama. It seems to me that Roswell was trying to capitalize off the success of Dawson's Creek. Except this teen drama had a sci-fi twist. All in all this show was not half bad. It had it's hokey moment's and it had it's triumphs. Lead actress Shiri Appleby looked remarkably similar to Katie Holmes and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl used her looks and sex appeal often during the show just as Michelle Williams (Jenn Lindley) did in Dawson's Creek. The stand out performer in the show was William Sadler (Sheriff Valenti) which would not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with this actor and his work. The show takes some bizarre twists and ends up backing up on its self a time or two but was surprisingly entertaining. The complete three seasons is a bit of a wild roller coaster ride with quite a few surprises surprisingly. So you get the attractive cast with  Majandra Delfino who went from ugly and homely to knockout status in a span of a summer and the gorgeous Emilie de Ravin in her ""Pre-Lost"" days and the equally attractive male cast who actually did a fairly good job of acting. However this show was doomed from the beginning as the network and the creator/producers of the show could never agree which direction to take the show. This made for some fairly absurd story lines and abrupt endings to interesting story lines. This show was not sure what it wanted to be. But yet...it is a bit of a guilty pleasure in it's own right. The first season was the best and the show was fair to decent from then on with a bit of a disappointing series finale.",1217721600,8,1683,4.446601941747573
2444317,4,B000BWFWG4,We didn't watch this until 2007. I guess the title threw us off. So much about Roswell and it didn't get our interest. It is a series that deserves to be known. We found new stars and some good acting. It had a fresh appeal with the story line for SciFi fans. You should give it a try.,1217462400,2,285,3.9310344827586206
2444318,5,B000BWFWG4,"I didn't get this full set, but the individual seasons in box set, since I never saw the show on TV, and was originally sceptical about whether it would be worth getting; got Season 1 to see what it was about.  By the end of the first show I was hooked; as others have said, Season 1 was the best due to the depth and reality of the character interactions, with enough action/sf to keep things moving.  Without putting in any spoilers, there were episodes in the later seasons that weren't worthy of the total effort, the ""off world"" story was weak (like Flash Gordon, say) and there were major ""out of character"" moments, and some excessive revisiting of previous angst..and boy, there was a lot of angst.  As I remember being a teenager, they did a good job of recreating that age.. idealism greater than adulthood, more sweetness, less selfishness, more awkwardness, etc.  Unusually for a TV series, you really get involved with the 3 dimensional characters, and much of the plot seems true to real life.  As others have also said, that's what makes the brain-farts on the part of the writers more irritating when they occur.  In spite of the flaws, some sloppy (Michael forgetting Max's name late in Season 1; using California foothill landscape for New Mexico, etc.) and some deeper as mentioned above, the whole series hangs together and preserves its punch right through to end, which is generally satisfying.  Life is tough; it's bitter sweet but it beats the heck out of the alternative.  If you like the premise of ""alien"" teenagers and an in-depth exploration of the combination of romance/melodrama/s-f I would highly recommend this series.  It handled all the elements imaginatively and almost always kept me caring about the characters.  Not perfect but up there with Stargate, Dark Angel, etc. and better in terms of the deeper exploration of human interaction.  That said, this is much less action/adventure oriented than Stargate etc. so if you want heavy plot driven action show this isn't what you're after.

Buy it and enjoy the emotional rollercoaster and inventive sidelights.  You keep thinking it's about to slide away down a rathole but it never does.",1215475200,24,2176,4.86449864498645

2444322,5,B000BWFWG4,"I can still remember the moment WB tantalized us with these trailer-like sneak peaks of Roswell before actually airing it.  There was this little scene of Liz sitting in her terrace wrapped up in a blanket writing in her diary with the voice-over, ""Sept. 23...I'm Liz Parker and five days ago I died."" I didn't know what the plot would be like, naively enough, I didn't think of aliens but I can say w/ all honesty I was hooked from that moment, and I followed the show till its very last. As far as story goes it was a good one; great even considering its sci-fi wake; and one can't deny the following it amassed even in the recent years. I do believe the plot suffered a bit as the show progressed and these cancellations threats kept us fans half fearful half outraged, and when the show changed networks, well.  But still the good far outweighed the mistakes in my opinion, and for me the cast always delivered even when the plot or writing left me wanting more. Maybe due its untimely end I couldn't wait for the DVDs and they took so long getting them out.  Honestly if you followed the show the way some of us obsessively did- and even if you  did it sanely enough, there are a bit of gaps in the story, little loose-ends that never got a solid resolution, some really big ones that the DVDs never even attempted close. So I was a bit disappointed, to put it mildly, when there were no deleted scenes; or commentaries from the actors- whom had unbelievable on-screen chemistry, nor any DVD additions really.  Even so, I can still live with it; but now  with this new 'edition' sort of, I'm left wondering.  Does it have more stuff; things I would've appreciated in the first set? I would've loved to be able to get them in package like this; as a whole, and I really hate it when production houses or whatever do this; putting out there new editions of a product to get more profit.  Anyhow, my concern is, and for those out there who can pacify me I'd be so grateful, is this better, worthier than the previous vers? Or is it almost the same; the discrepancies being so minuscule that make little difference?

Anyway; I'm aware this ended up sounding less than a review than when it started.  I can attest for the series; which has impacted millions and still finds its way to new and younger fans.  It's truly a collectible; the acting was superb and it provided a great stepping stone for many in the show. You could see not only the potential of the show, but the young actors in it; there were so many poignant scenes that made you fall in love w/ them over and over again; regardless of which version you get :)",1208304000,5,2624,4.389690721649485

2444348,5,B000BWFWG4,"Hi All,

This is Absar from India. I recently purchased the Roswell season 1-3 set DVDs... I saw this serial for the 1st time probably 6 yrs ago on TV. I was firstly really watching it for Apple Shirby, she has one of the cutest faces and voices I know. But I really got engrossed in this serial.. I loved the quiet way with which Max Evans loved Liz. It was so cute.. being a teenager back then I could really relate to the way he felt about her. 1st Season was just mindblowing. I absolutely love the title song from Dido - Here with me. Her voice is just out of this world.

2nd and 3rd season weren't exactly brilliant. They changed the theme from a love story to a sci-fi thriller... it was good but not that great. I thought the love story theme worked a lot better for it. I was disappointed that they stopped airing the serial after 3 seasons, I would've love to see that on air for like 5-6 yrs atleast.

Favourite character is Apple Shirby. Katherine Heigl is also very hot - Probably her first major sitcom. If anyone wants to watch this - I would recommend the 1st season... But you would never feel complete unless u watch season 2 and 3.",1191196800,6,1151,4.222727272727273

2444350,4,B000BWFWG4,"I was addicted to this show! At its best, it achieved an atmosphere and tone which I haven't seen elsewhere, and the efforts of the actors and writers combined to create memorable and engaging characters.

At the same time, I have mixed feelings... I've read that the networks the show was on put pressures on the writers and producers, and I do think this impacted the show negatively. It veered from a relationship-oriented show in season 1 to a sci-fi show in season 2, then in season 3 the relationships and the sci-fi sort of coexisted uneasily.

Personally I like both relationsip-oriented shows and sci-fi, and the best episodes were the ones which combined them well. Overall, I think that for this show, it would have worked best if it had stayed relationship-oriented, with the sci-fi lurking beneath the surface and remaining as something of a mystery. As it was, the sci-fi that they ended up with was, in my opinion, poorly planned and poorly thought through. The basic premise of the alien backstory (revealed at the end of season 1) was trite and paper-thin, and for the rest of the show's run, it was used in a very preemptory way, so that rather than slowly revealing a carefully planned mythos, it seemed that the writers didn't really care about that mythos, and instead just used it or altered it for each episode's convenience.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it seemed as if the writers made only a half-hearted attempt to create a convincing piece of fiction. Here's an example: At the start of season 2, it's revealed that one of the series regulars has become a Buddhist. I'm not a Buddhist, but I've read a bit about Buddhism and I'm sympathetic to its ideas. How wonderful, I thought, that an already-established character on a weekly TV show is shown embracing a non-Judeo-Christian religion. But... it was mostly played for laughs. And the few times the religion was mentioned, it was completely untrue to what Buddhism really is. It's as if the writers made up an imaginary religion and called it Buddhism. At one point the character refers to the Buddha as ""saving my immortal soul,"" which is a very non-Buddhist idea. I'm not expecting the writers to be experts in comparative religion, but it would have been nice if one of them had spent 15 minutes reading up on the basics of Buddhism, or talked to a real live Buddhist (surely there must be some Buddhists in L.A.!) -- who knows, they might have even found inspiration for details of plot and character (inspiration which at times was sorely needed).

I know it sounds like I'm very critical of the show, and I am, but that's only because there were other aspects of it that I liked so much. And it's evident from the episode commentaries that series creator, writer, and producer Jason Katims, as well as writer/producer Ron Moore, are intelligent, thoughtful people who really cared about the show and were enthusiastic about their work on it.

Overall I'd say the show has some great things in it and it's worth watching for sure. For me, it just didn't come solidly together as the best shows and movies do, and that's a shame, because I think it had the potential to be greater than it was.",1173744000,11,3189,4.667259786476868
2444351,5,B000BWFWG4,"I first became familier with Roswell after purchasing the first season DVD set early last year. Since then I have became one of the shows biggest fans. I was a bit concerned that the second and third seasons would not be as good as the first, but to my surprise they are just as good if not better. Roswell is still one of my favorite TV shows. Season 1 deals more with the relationship/love story between Max and Liz. The second season deals more with the sc-fi aspect while the love story takes a backseat. The third and final season has the best of both the love story and sci-fi story. I have to say I have never cared much for sci-fi series but Roswell is so much more than just that. Like the wonderful first and second season, the third season still takes you on a emotional journey. As you go through each episode you still find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. The sad thing is with the final season the characters are not always hanging out together at the crash down cafe. They are doing their own things which is a bit hard for me because I was so accustomed to them being together, but it was just part of there characters growing up. It was so hard to see the last season of Roswell come to an end.
