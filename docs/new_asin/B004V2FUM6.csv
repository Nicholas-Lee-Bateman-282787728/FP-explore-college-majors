8442750,3,B004V2FUM6,"Good movie Good action by Hemant Birje and Archan Puransingh Vidya is a school-teacher in Love Dale High School, and has approximately 12 children in her classroom. One day they decide to participate in a inter-school competition and travel out of town. Their bus is stopped by a group of masked men, and all of them are taken captive, held for ransom in an isolated location. Vidya and the children manage to escape, but are caught and imprisoned in an underground cave. Through a snake-hole they manage to escape, this time aided by one of the masked men, and find shelter with a kind-hearted Forest Officer Ranjit Singh and his wife Jaswanti. The masked bandits follow them, locate them, kill the masked man, Jaswanti and Ranjit Singh, finally managing to entrap them. Looks like all ways of escape are closed to Vidya and her school-children, and they may be taken, held hostage until the bandits receive their ransom, and thereafter possibly get killed.",1304812800,,958,4.883435582822086
