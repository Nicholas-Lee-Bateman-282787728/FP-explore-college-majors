8554779,5,B00ANQHS56,Thanks  I  liked  theDVD & it  came in prefect  shape,1482451200,,53,3.9
8554780,5,B00ANQHS56,Good content on all four series's. only negative is that even with the English option you still need to use subtitles because sometimes they will use Japanese characters for locations.,1474243200,,184,5.166666666666667
8554781,5,B00ANQHS56,"These are anime style takes on these stories, and they are all set in Japan.  They have a single story arc that lasts through the entire series, so sometimes it seems to be moving a little slow.  Don't expect the half-hour stand alone stories you get with most American style cartoons.  If you're a fan of anime, then I think you'll enjoy this collection.  At about 280 minutes per title (maybe more like 240 minutes after you skip prologues, themes, and previews), they're a nice weekend binge fest.",1471737600,,500,4.6477272727272725
8554782,1,B00ANQHS56,The item was anime. It did not say that in description.,1465948800,,55,4.090909090909091
