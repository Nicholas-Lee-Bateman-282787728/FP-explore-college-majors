8215075,4,B000UVCKIO,"This is a great workout to do while pregnant because the instructor is knowledgable, fit, and encouraging. Keeping fit keeps your energy up for when baby finally arrives. Being in top shape helps tremendously. I highly recommend this workout for all levels.",1381795200,,257,5.142857142857143
8215076,5,B000UVCKIO,"This is a great video for anyone expecting. The routine is vigorous, yet accessible. By the end you will definitely work up a good sweat. I have lent this video to several friends who have used it and managed to stay in shape through all nine months of pregnancy. It is also a good routine for those not expecting, so the video can retain a place on anyone's workout shelf after baby has come. Highly recommended.",1381708800,,413,4.447368421052632

8215078,5,B000UVCKIO,"I found this video to be extremely helpful on days when I didn't feel like trekking (or should I say waddling) to the gym. The intensity level felt challenging enough, but not overwhelming. There's also plenty of modifications to match your fitness level. Definitely recommend!",1381622400,,277,5.177777777777778

8215081,5,B000UVCKIO,"Hypfit Workout is wonderful!  The intensity level is just right--not to difficult but enough to keep my heart rate & energy up.  This is my 1st pregnancy and wanted to maintain my fitness level without over doing it, and this workout is perfect.  The hypnotherapy section at the end is relaxing and a welcomed treat for those crabby days.  Keri Jenkins is a pleasure to watch!  It's like having a friend in the same boat who wants to workout with you.  Highly recommend this DVD for all pregnant women.  Kudos to Hypfit for incorporating many aspects of fitness!!",1189382400,3,563,4.683673469387755
