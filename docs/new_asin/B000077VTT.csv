This DVD pretty much sums up what Lenny is like in concert. But not only does it show what he is like live, but you also get a look inside his daily life, which is just as exciting. Lenny is 100% is own person, he doesn't take any crap from anyone, and you either love or hate him. He is sexy, confident, laid-back, and completely loveable. Even if you don't really like him, you will by the end of this DVD, it's worth every minute. And if you ever get a chance to see him in concert, please please please go, it will be the greatest night of your life. It was mine.",1047859200,4,702,4.021428571428571
