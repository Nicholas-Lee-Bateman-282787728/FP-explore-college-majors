8352962,2,B0026L7RNE,"Beginning with the now clichd 'based on true events' bs and showing most of the main characters dead at a crime scene before going two days earlier for the film to properly start. A group of people from various walks of life are at a party when they decide to take a trip to San Diego where they stay at a ranch owned by Constantine (Daniel Baldwin). But before the night is up things will take a much darker turn.

Marketed as a horror movie, in actuality this badly acted film is more honestly a drama akin to the likes of one would see on the Lifetime station on any given day. The direction is pretty much a mess and the motivations of any of the characters rang hollow to me. I found myself checking my watch on multiple occasions hoping and wishing that the movie would just end. Daniel Baldwin has been in worse films before (I still break out in cold sweats merely thinking about ""Vegas Vampires"") but this one is still pretty awful.",1516406400,,941,4.346590909090909
8352963,1,B0026L7RNE,"Pretentious and boring. This mess is just another in a long line of films that make me  wonder why I bothered. There's nothing to keep your interest and the occasional subtitles were needless. I couldn't have cared less what they were saying. Stupid bunch of American and Japanese 20-somethings get mixed up with some baddies and get done in somewhat belatedly.
The sound is awful and I lost interest almost immediately.
To be avoided.",1410739200,,435,4.878378378378378
8352964,1,B0026L7RNE,"WOW!!! This is one of those movies that was not only hard to watch, but hard to describe. Its about a true murder story, young love, foreign students on visa's and a strange set of circumstances at a bar, an acquaintances home and a one night stands home.
This movie was way beyond strange from the way it played out and from the characters and their personalities/actions to the way the movie was presented.
They say that ""truth is stranger than fiction"", but this movie will give that statement a good run for the money even though its based on a true story.
Most of the characters are either annoying or obnoxious or both along with their bad acting you have a toxic mixture that's at the least VERY IRRITATING to the viewer.
The story is understandable although the way its told leaves a lot to be desired and was totally unnecessary and lacked anything that would help keep the viewers attention. It also begs the question of why was it even made or why was this the chosen format to tell this tragic story of the murders of these mostly young people? I found little to no redeeming value to this story the way it was presented.
This strange (not in a good way) story really lacks any entertainment value in its current form. There is some nudity and two scenes of rape, suggested gay sex, drug use and plenty of foul language including the Fword. Please, take a pass on this one even if its free to watch. That's where I made my mistake! _5 stars.",1395532800,2,1453,4.425373134328358
8352965,1,B0026L7RNE,"Long winded with a lot of unnecessary character building, I saw no reason for this film. There is some T&A and a rape and a half but no real story. I couldn't recommend this one at all, even as a prime member freebie it's not worth your time.",1356652800,5,242,4.0625
8352966,5,B0026L7RNE,"Maybe it's the fact that I saw this film on the big screen (it was showing as part of an arthouse double feature in LA), but I really, really dug it.  It's set up as a horror movie, it's weird, and I think Akihiro pulled off leading-man charisma fairly well.  Alec Baldwin does give the best performance in the thing, though, I'll give you that.

Can you get this on NetFlix?  If so, give it a go.  It's trippy, it's interesting, darkly funny, and it subverts genre tropes really well.  It's worth a shot.",1272499200,,505,4.319148936170213
8352967,1,B0026L7RNE,"I'll Be There with You: 3 out of 10: This movie is a mess. It threatens to become an interesting mess; but alas, it is in reality just a mess.

The first clue something is wrong, is this movie's supposed genre. Apparently, it is a horror movie. I'll Be There With You is no more a horror movie than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was. It has horrific elements certainly, but it is more of a drama and a relationship drama at that. Whether director Akihiro Kitamura meant to make a horror film or the marketing department at Celebrity Video Distribution simply choose to label it as a horror film is unknown.

Now what director Kitamura meant by this film is somewhat of a mystery; it is all over the place. There is a relationship drama, bar pick-ups, date rape, non-date rape, strange computer graphics from someone's Commodore Amiga, escaped criminals killing, Japanese nerd comic relief, and Daniel Baldwin.

Indeed a bloated Daniel Baldwin gives the best performance of the film. That alone should be condemning with faint praise. In fairness, the ladies in the cast (Adarsha Benjamin, Michelle Lawrence and Elisabeth Donaldson) are decent if somewhat unpolished, but the male lead Akihiro Kitamura is a black hole of charisma. Kituamura's tearful denouement is cinematic pain defined. (I would blame the director but they are the same guy.)

With its lack of focus and bizarre computer generated sequels I'll Be There With You reminds me of that mess Demonlover. But with a lower budget and less talent on both sides of the camera I'll Be There With You's mess is even less enjoyable.

There are a couple of good movies in here somewhere. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.",1259020800,2,1686,4.8
