5858873,5,B00DV3CA24,"Loved this movie, the progression of the girls' feelings was nice, it was funny and sweet.  Side characters were well-done, well-acted, and interesting; from the seriousness of Van and the main character's mother to the somewhat one-dimensional characters like Nerd and Boyd.",1470355200,,275,5.5476190476190474
5858874,5,B00DV3CA24,"This movie is adorable. Very funny, touching and eye opening to the discrimination that certain members of the LGBT community faces daily. I highly recommend it.",1469491200,2,161,5.230769230769231

5858878,4,B00DV3CA24,"Misunderstanding is always a silly device in movies, but here it's more like the characters accept them because it's easier than being brave about truths. Not just of who we are as individuals, but who we are in relation to others. And especially of love. A nice story, with the backdrop of a tech college, some good characters and side characters, and dialogue that feels real. A good movie not only to watch, but to own. Only just misses a star because of the odd dual-couple-but-not-a-couple that lasted for much of the movie: I couldn't decide if it was cultural or basic human or what, but that core of misunderstanding just didn't quite sell the story to me as much as the quiet pace and cinematography of the film.",1468281600,,721,4.596899224806202

5858880,5,B00DV3CA24,"By far the best lesbian film I've seen.  Is it sad that the best one comes from overseas?  This is just a simple rom-com, with no preaching and show-boating.  It treats the romance between two girls as just a romance.  There is no platform standing here.  Other reviewers may get into specifics about the plot, but I felt the need to mention that aspect of it.",1466726400,2,360,4.393939393939394
