8045149,2,B00076YPN0,"I had read (online) a lot of good things about this DVD. However, either I misunderstood the target audience, or I'm a lot better at hand percussion than I thought!

I was under the impression that the intended audience was not the beginner, but more of an intermediate player. As such, it seems that the majority of the folks would already be intimately familiar with setting up congas, basic hand techniques, the (widely used) tumbao conga pattern, tambourine/shaker usage, etc.

While I did learn a few useful things, I really feel that the Kalani ""Ultimate Conga/Bongo Jam"" series were much more informative and useful for those who are qualified to swim in anything deeper than the kiddie pool.",1198886400,2,699,4.915254237288136
