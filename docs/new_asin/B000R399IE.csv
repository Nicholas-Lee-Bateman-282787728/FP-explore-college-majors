8198652,5,B000R399IE,"Having searched for this tape for so many years, I had given-up ever finding it.  I ordered it not knowing what condition it might be in, but when it arrived and I played it, it was in superb condition.  Can't tell you how much it means to our family to have this tape.  Our family was one of the families interviewed with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross - she was indeed a gift from Heaven.

You have made this family very happy.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
