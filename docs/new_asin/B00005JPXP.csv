1586869,4,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold's remake of a classic Glenn Ford western based on a terrific Elmore Leonard tale rips the screen with it's nearly non-stop action and urgent time sensitive story.

Christian Bale is astonishing and is an actor who can apparently do anything.  He makes no false moves in a challenging role that he has nuanced with a heart-felt urgency and desperation.  Russell Crowe as the evil Ben Wade is a laid back, confident devil in disquise with a particularly vile henchman.

It's always great to see Peter Fonda in a part he so easily inhabits.  His father's great westerns come to mind as he lopes across the screen.

This movie is about much more than simply honoring one's word.

1586870,5,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold's remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"" comes to us 50 years almost to the day after the premiere of Delmer Daves' original. Daves' film--a lean, spare tale about Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), a smooth-talking outlaw headed for prison, and Dan Evans (Van Heflin), the impoverished rancher assigned to guard him--has won a reputation over the years as a minor Western classic. Mangold's remake has Russell Crowe and Christian Bale stepping in as Wade and Evans; without giving away any major plot points, the new version is longer, sadder, bloodier, messier and more ambitious than Daves' little oater. But is it better? My critic's head tells me I should prefer the cleaner, more sharply drawn lines of Daves' version, but my movie fan's heart points out that the 117 minutes of Mangold's version fly past more quickly than the 92 minutes of Daves'. Crowe was a shrewd choice to replace Ford; Both actors have a quiet center suggesting enormous inner depths. But Crowe is a more expressive actor than Ford ever was, and the new script (again without giving anything away) gives him many more opportunities than in the original to demonstrate his character's villainy. There are few actors less alike than the lean, ascetic Bale and the stocky, hangdog Heflin. But both make a specialty of quiet suffering, and if Heflin's Evans was unfortunate, Bale's Evans (again without giving anything away) is a modern-day Job. Once again the cat-and-mouse head games Wade plays with Evans are the centerpiece of the story, and Crowe and Bale--two of the best living screen actors--play them to the hilt. But the Mangold version gives more prominence to the supporting cast, adding new characters and changing or enlarging the roles of others from the original. (Particularly noteworthy in the new version is Ben Foster as Wade's right-hand man Charlie Prince, giving the same kind of charismatic-psycho performance that made Richard Widmark a star six decades ago in ""Kiss of Death."") Mangold adds a lot of themes to the story--the encroachment of the railroads, the reflexive racism of the Old West, the tyranny of greedy land barons. It should have bent the story out of shape, but instead Mangold builds the suspense to a white-knuckle level that exceeds the tension Daves achieved. The verdict? Purists may prefer the original, but the new version is the one that sticks in my memory.",1189296000,5,2371,4.98989898989899

1586872,5,B00005JPXP,"Pulls its morality from the 50s, its violence from Sergio Leone, and star power from tabloids of today.  A brilliant homage with a face of its own.  Crowe, Bale, Fonda & Foster blast this Western  --  Capital W --  into NOW.  Militia (read National Guard) called into  war when army manpower runs low; disabled veterans discarded by their government; white hats with sordid secrets and black hats with -- well, lets not spoil the fun.  All the conventions are intact.  If you grew up in the 50s, you'll recognize the camera angles, the corrals and the cattle. Sergio Leone's dusters morph into Ben Foster's rock star leather.  Like all good westerns, it's all male.  Women play their supporting roles as wives and barmaids, but don't expect Candice Bergen's turn in Bite the Bullet, or another Sharon Stone.  Rank this up there with Monte Walsh, The Magnificent 7, Tom Horn, and The Hired Hand.  Throw in The Cowboys, High Noon . . . and, heaven help me, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.  With touches  of McCabe & Mrs. Miller (yes, that IS a Western). Grab your popcorn and your cap pistol and settle in for 2 hours of shoot-em-up at its finest.",1189209600,6,1144,4.594059405940594
1586873,4,B00005JPXP,"The Western film: a truly American invention and in this new millennium a rare commodity. ""Unforgiven"" comes to mind and that was 10 years or so ago. There are others, of course but they are few and far between. There are Westerns that glamorize the Old West: ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" and those that don't: ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.""
""3:10 to Yuma"" is somewhere in between the two mentioned above and it is about the eternal struggle between good and evil, between the have and the have nots, between those that would uphold the family and those that would demolish it and those who would preserve the peace and those that would let chaos rule.
James Mangold (""I Walked the Line"") has chosen to remake, revise, re-invent the 1957 Glenn Ford starring ""3:10 to Yuma"" with a sterling cast of Russell Crowe (as outlaw, train robber, Ben Wade), Christian Bale (erstwhile Batman as Dan Evans: everyman, ranch owner-going broke) whose life is turned upside down when he accidentally comes in contact with Wade while Wade is in the process of robbing a Pinkerton protected stage of all of it's loot.
Crowe dominates the screen as Wade. His Wade is mercurial, slimy, sexy, brutal...seemingly willing to do anything for the thrill of stealing and killing. Crowe plays Wade quietly even sympathetically but always in control even when he physically isn't. Crowe dominates, both physically and cosmically, every scene that he is in: he sucks the oxygen out of a room upon entering and, in the one sex scene of the film, his ""prey"" has no choice, nor does she struggle by the way, but to comply with his wishes. In fact, she wants it as much as he does.
Bale's Evans is downtrodden, desperate as well as desperately poor. He is days away from losing his farm and more importantly losing the respect of his family: the more important of the two in the world of ""3:10."" For in this world you are nothing without family and property and less than nothing if you lose it.
On many levels Wade and Evans connect: they look at each other and their expressive eyes tell us something akin to ""there but for the grace of God go I."" But way down deep inside each man, inside their cores, they are brothers who have merely taken different roads.
There is lots of violence, murder and even a little sex in ""3:10"" and perhaps it is even a bit long by 20 minutes but ultimately Mangold pulls all the various pieces together into a cohesive whole. But the real magic of this film comes from the premiere acting jobs of Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and a terrific Ben Foster (""6 Feet Under"") as Charles Prince: a grotesque killing machine, more ""Mad Max"" than Jesse James who, against all odds plots to save Wade from destruction.",1189209600,34,2712,4.616977225672878
1586874,5,B00005JPXP,"Raw, gritty, bloody, heroic western. Great story told well. Bale and Crowe are awesome together.

1586875,5,B00005JPXP,"Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a Civil War veteran, is having a tough time of it running his family's ranch in the Arizona desert. Dan owes money to Hollander, a rich landowner who sets Dan's barn on fire to run him off. The land is worth more to the landowner who wants to sell it to the railroad. The next morning, Dan and his two sons, William (Logan Lerman) and Mark (Benjamin Petry) set out to round up their cattle. Their path will lead them across Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), a notorious bandit, and his crew of heartless thieves, including Charlie Prince (Ben Foster, HBO's ""Six Feet Under"", ""X-Men: The Last Stand""). Ben and his team have just robbed the latest stagecoach carrying cash for the railroad and killed all of the Pinkerton agents guarding the shipment, save one, sparing the life of Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda). Wade takes Dan's horses, but leaves them alive, so he and his men can ride into the nearby town. There, they send the sheriff out on a wild goose chase and enjoy come relaxation time. But Charlie wants to get the team across the border and is surprised when Ben says he will meet them soon. Ben is soon apprehended and the railroad wants to get the criminal to the ""3:10"" prison train leaving Contention for the camp in Yuma. They offer five men a lot of money to make sure Wade makes the short journey in time for the train. Dan takes the money, in an effort to pay off some of his debt, and to keep the ranch going until the next spring. Naturally, when Charlie learns of Ben's capture, he brings the crew back and they are determined to free their boss.

Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line""), this remake is a very good film. Intense, believable, well-acted and exciting, it even makes a completely implausible ending work.

The film works for a lot of reasons. Let's start at the top.

Russell Crowe and Christian Bale top line the film and both turn in yet another very good performance. It is interesting that each actor just seems to get better and better with each film. Very different actors, they do seem to have a similar taste for challenging roles.

Crowe is arguably the bigger star, but he likes to challenge himself and take on roles like heartless criminal Ben Wade. As the story progresses and we learn more and more about Wade, we learn to appreciate his character more and see more of the layers Crowe is bringing to this role. Initially, he seems like just another sociopath killer, who feels no pain as he kills yet another person standing between him and some money. But is he really that heartless? Or does he feel slightly pressured, even intimidated by the heartless people in his crew? That is for you to decide, but the mere fact Crowe is able to give this character that kind of depth speaks volumes to his skill as an actor.

Wade is also not above playing little mind games with people. After he is captured, the posse takes him to Dan's ranch, where he meets Dan's wife, Alice (Gretchen Mol). While they wait for some business to unfold, they have dinner and Wade quickly ascertains Dan's weak points and starts to use those to poke some pins and needles into the rancher's hide. These moments are amusing and help to lighten the tone. As William, Dan's older son listens to the criminal's stories; he even seems to start to develop a little hero worship, which doesn't escape Dan's notice.

Then, they are off, to make the journey to Contention, to make the train.

Christian Bale is never anything less than interesting in his films. Quite often, he is simply mesmerizing. Even as Bruce Wayne, he manages to make the character seem real, and to give the former graphic novel creation a lot of depth and unusual traits. He often physically punishes himself for the sake of the role; for ""The Machinist"", he lost a lot of weight to play the role of an insomniac who worried about the world closing in on him, in the recently released ""September Dawn"", he lost a lot of weight, during filming, to portray an American fighter pilot held prisoner in Laos during the Vietnam War. But does this make him a good actor? Well, it certainly helps to create the illusion of the character he is playing in any given film. But Bale brings a lot more to his roles and usually creates mesmerizing performances.

Dan Evans is a man who has had many struggles in his life. A Civil War veteran, he seems slightly put off he doesn't get and can't command any respect for his civil service. He lost part of a leg yet a wealthy land owner doesn't even seem to give it a moment's thought when he orders his men to torch Dan's barn. Because Dan feels powerless, he comes off as a bit of a wimp in the eyes of his older son, one of the many factors prompting him to take on the task of transporting Wade. He wants to redeem himself and earn his son's respect.

It is a performance the equal of Crowe's. Each reveals little aspects of their characters as the story progresses. As each learns about the other, they seem to come to a better understanding of their nemesis. I won't call them friends, but they seem to appreciate the choices each has made, and in some cases, will make, throughout the course of the film.

Peter Fonda turns in a stand-out performance as the Pinkerton agent who decides to take out his vengeance on Wade by trying to ensure he makes that train. Alan Tudyk (just seen in ""Death at a Funeral"") has another memorable supporting role as Doc Potter, drafted into the journey. Luke Wilson has a brief, but intense cameo as a railroad worker bent on revenge.

But the real standout of the supporting cast is Ben Foster. As Charlie Prince, we see a mirror image of what Ben Wade once was; all bad, driven to do nothing but rob money, kill anyone who gets in their way, keep his gang in order and help keep his boss out of jail. He quickly rounds up the gang to save Ben. When they realize what is required to save Wade, he quickly silences their objections to what lies ahead. We never feel as though there is any question he will succeed in his plan; he is that driven, that committed to Wade.

The film is filled with great dialogue, the type of dialogue that helps to build the characters and allow us to learn about their past, giving us a more rounded view of their persona. Throughout, Wade and Dan have conversations which initially start as a minor form of mind game initiated by Wade. But as he gets to know the rancher, he starts to subtly reveal things about himself. Both characters are the better for this subtle form of exposition.

These same conversations also help to lay the groundwork for the finale. Now, I still don't buy into the film's conclusion, I don't believe some of the actions of some of the characters, but the film sets up this ending very well, dropping little clues and hints throughout.

The dialogue also appears to be authentic. As the characters speak, they don't use any modern day phrases, ruining the image of watching two men in the Old West. Period characters speaking in modern dialect is a more common thing than you might realize; because we are familiar with modern day words and phrases, it is more difficult for us to realize these are being used inappropriately in a period piece. It is interesting that we are now seeing a variety of projects attempting to give us a hyper-realistic view of what life was like in the Old West. First, HBO's ""Deadwood"" created by David Milch, and in which every other word out of every character's mouth is the ""F"" word. But it works, and is surprisingly engrossing. Now with ""3:10 To Yuma"", we see another thorough, seemingly accurate depiction of a different part of the Old West.

There are also a number of terrific action sequences, keeping things lively and interesting. Because this is a western, these involve robbing stagecoaches, shootouts and chases on horseback. I realize some people may not appreciate this type of action, too old-fashioned, but it gives a stronger sense of immediacy, of danger to the film. Because the things are happening on a smaller scale to `real' people, they seem more dangerous.

""3:10 To Yuma"" is a very good film. A remake of the Glenn Ford - Van Heflin original, I have never seen the first film, so I can't compare the two. But the new version featuring great performances from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, a number of fine supporting performances, and great dialogue is a very good film.",1189123200,7,8385,4.546719681908549
1586876,5,B00005JPXP,"Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster are all in top form here, especially Crowe (Oscar nomination in the future?). He plays Ben Wade just right. Not too over the top, but with a witty ego for sure. He could make you laugh one second and cut your throat the next.

I would agree with most critics who say this is the best western since 1992's Unforgiven. The dialogue is smart and the action is fierce. Peter Fonda is also worth mention as an old bounty hunter, and Luke Wilson also show up for good measure.

1586877,5,B00005JPXP,"The Western: a classic and simple genre, famous for its portrayals of lawless towns, armed bandits, shootouts, saloons, and whisky drinking. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a film that makes use of them all, and I expected nothing less. What I did not expect was a story of amazing depth and complexity; this remake of Delmer Daves' 1957 film--which itself was based on Elmore Leonard's short story--is a triumph of plot and character development, telling a story that's just as meaningful as it is brutal. It begs the question: Is there truly a clear distinction between good and evil? This film refuses to answer that question, making for one of the most compelling films of the year.

One of the main characters is Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), an Arizona outlaw with a deplorable record of robbery and murder to his name. He seems to feel no remorse over his actions; indeed, he is an unlikable character, having little if any regard for other people and what he puts them through. But at the same time, he's engaging and oddly magnetic, with an air of mystery that's undeniably fascinating. Watching him, one gets the sense that he knows what someone else is thinking, which is both interesting and disturbing. He leads a band of murderers and thieves across the Western desert, a ruthless band that remains loyal for no apparent reason. Judging by the behavior of Wade's right hand man--Charlie Prince (Ben Foster)--one gets the sense that a little hero worship is at work.

The other main character is Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a one-legged farmer currently in a financial crisis. A greedy, arrogant landlord named Hollander (Lennie Loftin) has cut off the local water supply, destroying Evans' crops and making the land infertile. Hollander also oversaw the burning of Evans' barn; Evans had borrowed money, but was unable to repay. To make matters worse, Wade stole Evans' herd of cattle. Facing a lifetime of hardship and the disrespect of his wife and children, Evans joins a motley crew of townsfolk in their effort to capture Wade: the rich Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts); the cantankerous Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda); and Doc Potter (Alan Tudyk), the local veterinarian (who occasionally sees human patients). In return for having him arrested and sent to Yuma Prison, Evans will be paid handsomely. But catching Wade will prove to be no easy task; by the time he is caught, more than a few lives are ruined.

Thus begins a physical and emotional journey, one of incredible insight. Wade is now bound by handcuffs and ready to be transported to Yuma. Once there, he'll board a prison train at 3:10 in the afternoon. As one might expect, almost nothing goes according to plan, and the characters are thrust into life or death situations. This is especially true in terms of Wade's posse, which has been following Evans' group relentlessly. In the midst of all character interactions, the greatest dynamic exists between Evans and Wade. At first glance, they seem like complete opposites; one lives a life of honesty while the other lives a life of crime. Nonetheless, both men are deeply flawed, with emotional baggage they have yet to rid themselves of. They have more in common than either would care to believe.

This isn't to say that being on common ground has brought them closer together. If anything, they push each other's buttons, especially when it comes to matters of faith: Wade--a lowly, deceitful man--is a pious Christian, and he always seems ready to quote a passage or two from the Bible; Evans--a good, honest man--is struggling with his faith, feeling as if God has ignored him for quite some time. Both men hide secret pain, all of which is slowly revealed as the film progresses. There's something about their line of communication that I found incredibly revealing, especially when the worst is brought to the surface. Example: Wade rouses Evans by questioning his treatment of his wife. ""You say one more word,"" Evans shouts as he grabs hold of Wade, ""and I'll cut you down right here."" ""I like this side of you, Dan,"" is Wade's reply. Here's a conversation that speaks volumes with so few words. It was highly effective.

An intriguing subplot involves Evans' son, William (Logan Lerman), a headstrong fourteen-year-old who feels he has something to prove. While specifically told to stay home with his mother and brother, William runs off to join his father, hoping to be of use. But more importantly, he seems genuinely curious about Wade: Is there, in fact, something to be gained by knowing who Ben Wade really is? Is this killer really as cold-blooded as he lets on? It's difficult to know for sure, especially since he and Evans form alliances just as quickly as they break them. What they share can't be considered a friendship. But on the same token, they are able to acknowledge each other's existence, and not always with hostility. Surely something can be said for that.

By the time the characters reach Yuma and engage in a climactic shootout, any sense of black and white reasoning has been lost. ""3:10 to Yuma"" exists in that massive gray area between the two, preventing the audience from pigeonholing the characters into definite types. This is without a doubt the film's greatest strength, acting as an appropriate counterpart to the ending. While the final moments require a little extra thought on our part, it still plays out beautifully, about as smooth and efficient as a well-oiled machine. For all the clichs that could have bogged it down, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a Western that doesn't let itself get carried away. This is not a shallow Tough Guy movie; it's a wonderfully executed character study. Here's one train that you should definitely catch.",1188777600,9,5698,4.8872802481902795

I saw this movie listed on Prime and decided to give it a go.  It was slow and unintentionally cheesy, so I had to complete it over several sittings.  I regretted making it all the way through, but now you can benefit from my misfortune.

There is a problem with narrative development and pacing.  We keep waiting for something to happen and it never does.  And when we finally get to the ending, it's just an anticlimax.

There are all sorts of weird, anachronistic problems.  For instance, I couldn't help but wonder what in the world is going on with the idiot with a steampunk sniper rifle.  This isn't a steampunk movie.  It just isn't.  I have no idea what the writers were thinking.  Also, many of the characters are overly dramatic and emo in a modern way, and it just interferes with the suspension of disbelief.  Now, I realize that, for the most part, westerns are fiction, but I just don't picture sulking flowers of men as the roughest of frontier outlaws-- unless they're Gene Wilder, who gets away with it as parody.  And, everyone carries around single action revolvers-- appropriate for the time period; however, the actors haven't the slightest clue how these things work.  You don't have to be a gun nut to notice these guys aren't familiar with their equipment, and it breaks the illusion of spontaneity.

There is also a problem with the action-- what little there is of it.  The director doesn't know how to run an action scene, so instead tries to lamely fake it with framing.  When two men are in a scene, surrounded by others with rifles and shotguns, they need not worry.  Everyone outside the frame is on indefinite pause.  They don't just miss; they aren't allowed to react at all... because they're outside the frame!  This is what happens when a director thinks he's far smarter than he is.  It interferes with telling the story.  I felt like I was watching a parody, when it wasn't.

So, after completing this movie, I went back and caught the 1957 version.  It was totally worth it.  That was a great film.  So what happened with the remake?  Was it ""modernized"" too much?  Probably.  Plus, we're stuck with a generation of actors who didn't spend time in their younger years riding and shooting.  It shows.",1524614400,3,2405,4.59433962264151

The rest of the movie isn't great either. You are waiting for something to happen the entire time and NOTHING does.

Its a rare occasion when the credits start to roll and we can say that was really good.

Also, he didn't seem at all hampered by his disability...they tried to point it out a few times, but then it was like he can run and walk and do everything just fine, so why is this a disability?  Classic western syndrome with lots of bullets flying around and hardly anyone getting hit, even though some of these guys are supposed to be crack shots.  Kind of annoying, but can be overlooked.

Bale is a generous actor, giving a memorable and human performance as the underdog rancher, but reining it in just enough to let Crowe be the stand out.

This is a good western. It features a good cast of characters and it is a great storyline. A group of men transfer a wanted and dangerous criminal to a town to catch the train to Yuma. Meanwhile his gang has gathered to find out where their leader is and help him to escape.

The cinematography is spectacular.  The storyline is well written and the cast does a good job of bringing the story to life. I purchased the BluRay version of the film as it was on sale for a very good price. I then added a HDX digital copy to stream to my tablets and also to my digital high resolution projector.

1589000,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma takes place in Arizona in the late 1800s. Outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his vicious gang of thieves and murderers have plagued the Southern Railroad. When Wade is captured, Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), struggling to survive on his drought-stricken ranch, volunteers to deliver him alive to the 3:10 to Yuma, a train that will take the killer to prison. During the grueling expedition. Evans and Wade, each from very different worlds, begin to earn each others respect. However, with Wades posse on their trail, the mission soon becomes a violent, impossible journey, shaping each mans destiny.

Based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, the tale was previously filmed in 1957 with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. This version combines the requisite action of a big-budget Western with psychological conflict. The lead characters are pretty complex, which makes things very interesting. These are not the larger-than-life heroes played by John Wayne in his heyday. Theyre flawed men who have gone down different paths in life. Evans is poor and bears a physical injury sustained during the Civil War. Wade is authoritative and always appears in command, even when being escorted to imprisonment. He is honorable, in his own special way, but nonetheless ruthless. The men admire each other precisely because they are such opposites. Evans sees in Wade a carefree man who doesnt subscribe to the rules of civilization. And Wade sees in Evans a righteous man with better morals than any law officer hes ever encountered.

Director James Mangold avoids many cliches of the screen Western, but presents an excitingly choreographed climactic gunfight. The film is elevated considerably by the presence of Crowe and Bale, actors who convey the inner complexity of their characters.

The 2-disc 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital HD release contains audio commentary with director James Mangold, A Conversation With Elmore Leonard, a historical timeline of the West, the documentary Outlaws, Gangs, and Posses, deleted scenes, and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.

1589101,5,B00005JPXP,"Former fighter in the civil-war now small-time rancher 'Dan Evans' (Christian Bale) struggles to keep things going and
owes money to a local businessman who sends a couple of his henchmen out to torch 'Dan's' barn to serve as a
reminder of the debt.
The following morning 'Dan' and his sons head out to try and round-up the cattle that had been scattered the night
before whilst doing this they witness a stage robbery by 'Ben Wade' (Russell Crowe) and his cut-throats.
'Wade' and his gang leave the scene, 'Dan' and his boys find the one survivor of the hold-up 'Byron McElroy' (Peter Fonda)
badly injured and in urgent need of medical help.
Meanwhile 'Wade' and his crew head for town to celebrate their haul, over confident 'Wade' leaves himself open to
capture.
One or two want to kill him there and then knowing of his reputation as a fast-gun and ruthless killer, however it is decided
that he should be taken to 'Yuma' to stand trial for his many crimes, however raising a posse willing to risk their lives against
'Wade's' equally ruthless gang who'll try and spring him is another matter.
'Dan Evans' desperate to raise the cash to stay afloat and protect his family volunteers to join 'McElroy' and a couple of others
to take 'Wade' to 'Contention' where he'll be put on the 3.10 to Yuma to face trial and almost certainly end up hanged...$200
is a lot of money, and worth taking the risk for.
'Dan's' eldest son 'William' (Logan Lerman) wants to join his father on the dangerous journey from 'Bisbee' to 'Contention' but
his father tells him to stay put and look out for his mother and younger brother.
With 'Ben Wade's' gang led at this time by gunman and killer 'Charlie Prince' (Ben Foster) are never that far behind the group.
'Ben Wade' is goaded into killing a couple of his escort along the way and makes for an escape, however 'Dan's' son 'William'
had ignored his father's will and followed the escort, he recaptures 'Wade'
The journey had been fraught with incident but arrive in 'Contention' they do, as do 'Wades' gang, the wait for the train to arrive
seems endless knowing that the gang are waiting for 'Dan' to try and cover the short distance from the hotel to the train station.
Strangely, though both 'Dan' and 'Ben' stand on opposite sides of the law they have on the journey acquired respect for each
other....'Ben' will, knowing that 'Dan' is doing this for his family help evade his gangs bullets as they make a dash for the train.
Saw the film first time around in the cinema when released, though i bought the Blu-ray also when released i hadn't taken time
out till now to re-watch the film, in truth though a re-make of the 1957 'Glenn Ford' /'Van Heflin' original (not always a fan of
re-makes) the film is a whole lot better than i remember it to be.
It's a rooting-tooting gun-fighting bonanza, with some great performances from it's cast along the way....certainly a film worthy
of a re-visit.

1589182,4,B00005JPXP,"Entertaining Western. Rated R for violence, cussing (some GDs and a couple of ""F"" bombs), three brief scenes of surgery, and a post-love, so to speak, scene without nudity.

I like Russell Crowe best as the good guy, heroic figure, like in ""Gladiator"" (2000), or ""Cinderella Man"" (2005). But here, he shows that he's quite an effective bad guy as the ornery villain Ben Wade. Before watching the movie, I was paging around a bit in the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, and what do you know, Wade mentions the same book early in the movie during a saloon scene:

""Proverbs 13:3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life; He that opens his lips too wide brings on his own destruction.""

A little later, Wade mentions the same Bible book again in speaking at table to Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda):

""Every way of man is right in his own eyes, Byron. The Lord ponders the heart. Proverbs 21.""

But is Wade a villain with a soft spot for God's Word, or is he just quoting it to manipulate people. He later insults McElroy by accusing him of being a man of one book, the Bible:

Wade: ""Byron's like a song with one note. You ever read another book in your life, Byron, sides' the Bible?""
Byron: ""No need.""

The good guy in ""3:10"" is Dan Evans (Christian Bale). Bale's Evans is a Civil War veteran with a gimpy foot from battle, who is struggling to provide for his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol), 14-year-old son William (Logan Lerman), and younger son Mark (Ben Petry), who has tuberculosis. As the movie begins, William has a barely suppressed, smoldering/simmering contempt for his father, who he subtly taunts as not doing good enough for his family. In an early scene, Dan tells Alice that he's tired of his family looking down upon him and God's seeming silence to his plight:

""Now I'm tired, Alice, I am tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't. I've been standing on one leg for three damn years, waiting for God to do me a favor. .. And He ain't listening.""

By capturing and bringing to a train for transport to prison the outlaw Ben Wade, will Dan be able to earn sorely needed reward money for his family and raise himself in their eyes? That's the movie's plot.

Ben Foster as Ben Wade's chief sidekick, the brutal, cold, even psychopathic Charlie Pierece, is a scene-stealer.

Spoiler Alert**********************************************************************************************************************************************************

With Ben Wade in custody, and needing to get him on the 3:10 to Yuma by going through a seemingly impossible gauntlet of Wade's men and townsfolk who are promised a bounty if they will kill those trying to get Wade to the train, Evans receives a memorable monologue from Wade. Maybe sensing the type of words Dan spoke to his wife earlier, Wade gives the story of the beginning of his life and of how his mother and God let him down. Obviously tempting Dan to give up his mission in discouragement, Wade says:

""You ever read the Bible, Dan? I read it one time. I was eight-years-old. My daddy just got hisself killed over a shot of whiskey and my Mom said we're going back East to start over. So she gave me a Bible, sat me down in the train station, and told me to read it. She was goin' to get our tickets. But I did what she said. I read that Bible from cover to cover. Took me three days. .. She never came back.""

As the movie moves towards its climax, you wonder who's going to give Wade's sidekick Charlie Pierce his comeuppance, who's going to kill him? Dan? His son William? Wade? Someone else?

Also, as the movie moves towards its peak, Ben Wade is thrown a gun. Looking at its handle, one sees welded to it a gold crucifix.",1482796800,,3759,4.623123123123123

1589509,5,B00005JPXP,"This is one of my favorite movies ever.  Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are actors who continuously hold down the lead role.  Dan Evans (Bale) is a good man, ex-army man turned rancher, who has had a string of bad luck over the years.  Ben Wade (Crowe) is the lead villain in the film.  Evans is a man to be admired as he continuously puts his family first.  Wade is a man who is rotten to the core, an animal, but the film shows that even he has scruples.

I won't rehash the plot because ever other review does that.  What is so intriguing about the movie is that while Wade and Evans hate each other and have wildly different views about right and wrong, they still have a certain amount of respect for each other.  Well, more so Wade shows a respect for Evan's character.  As the film goes on we learn more about the characters and that they are not originally who they seem.  It leaves me to wonder if Ben Wade is not a product of his environment and not born a cold-blooded killer.  This is the nature vs. nurture argument.",1472774400,6,1031,4.262886597938144

1589814,5,B00005JPXP,"Four and a half DISTINCT Stars. This version of the classic 1957 western movie ""3:10 to Yuma"" is also based on a story by author Elmore Leonard and comes exactly 50 years after the original movie. That movie starred Glenn Ford as the ruthless outlaw with a sensitive side, Ben Wade, and Van Heflin as the desperate rancher, Dan Evans. This movie has two of today's top actors, both Oscar winners, Russell Crowe as Wade and Christian Bale as Evans and it traces the major themes of the original movie but then varies enough to make this more than a close remake, as it ups the ante with much more violence and introduces new locales, characters, and interesting variations on the script. Co-starring Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw, and Logan Lerman, the cast performance is terrific. BTW, the famous ""3:10 to Yuma"" theme song is not used in this movie. The ending may be surprising. I recommend seeing both movies. Directed by James Mangold. Highly Recommended.

1589858,3,B00005JPXP,"The ending is unsatisfactory and even silly. The film is filled with crazy men and survivors and one day one side will get the upper hand on the other but not today. It starts off well, maintains your interest & they nearly pull it off but resort to that crazy ending. Pulp Fiction resolved the matter with a superb performance by Samuel Jackson who sees the Hand of God in a violent incident. Somebody shot five bullets at him and his partner and they all narrowly missed them. He can't continue with the life of a hoodlum. As they argue about it in a diner over brunch two stick-up artists begin robbing the diner. At this point the killer gains the drop on the robber and forces them to listen to his speculation on the meaning of a biblical passage that he would quote before he killed someone. He acknowledges he's really quite bad but he's trying real hard to shepherd the weak through the valley of darkness then he releases the robbers and leaves with his partner. In 3:10 to Yuma Ben Wade never experiences a  moment of clarity that expresses his dissatisfaction with his present life and the need for a change. Another problem is the desperate rancher who joins the posse that will bring Wade to town and on the 3:10 to Yuma. One can understand why. What the rancher does in Yuma makes no sense. If Wade had convinced him of his foolishness and why he must return home to her rather than die for the railroad. It's the writing that undermines this film. Everything else is pretty well done. You just realize that it could have been a far better film",1464134400,,1559,4.451048951048951

And that's my biggest complaint about this movie, it just wasn't that plausible, especially the last 20 minutes more or less.

Christian bale stars in the role of Dan, a ex-union fighter for the north, walking on one leg, Dan struggles to feed his thinning cattle. Plagued by a drought Dan's land becomes threatened when his payments begin to come up short. Russel Crowe stars as Ben Wade, an opaque outlaw with a manipulative nature. Weaseling his way out of circumstances through seduction, or the quick draw of his 'cursed' pistol. Driven by lust, the adrenaline of being a thief, consumed by rebellion, Ben Wade soon clashed with the righteousness, pride, courage and transparency of Dan; when Wade decides to use Dan's cattle to derail and ambush a wagon carrying gold.",1452297600,,707,4.80327868852459

1590123,4,B00005JPXP,"""Even bad men love their Mamas.""  Based on the previous 3:10 to Yuma, starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin.  I was surprised at how much of the dialogue from that movie showed up in this one, though the ending changed.  Crowe's character, Ben Wade, is a bad man on his way to Yuma Prison.  He keeps things light while killing men as easily and as off hand as anyone else might swat at a fly.  Christian Bale, as Dan Evans, is a competent foil, though an inept farmer/rancher.  A Civil War veteran, he has earned the contempt of his son, while about to lose his ranch.  Though very violent, the film turns Westerns on their head, seeming to be a farce.  Throughout, Crowe is an invincible bad man in irons and the good guy is hard to root for since he is continually the loser.  Entertaining as long you understand (hope) it's just a movie and that bad guys don't always win.",1447977600,,872,4.333333333333333

1590426,1,B00005JPXP,"So many reviews from lovers of this movie so I don't have much to say except: I hated it. Too many characters, too much of a plot, not believable. it does not hold even a match to the original with less of a stupid action plot and centered on just two men. Van Heflin's and Glenn Ford's performances were far more outstanding and emotional. The ending of the original when Evans' wife was waiting in the buggy outside town to see if her husband made the train and then it started to rain breaking the drought was very moving  and one could really feel the deep respect between them..  Westerns made in that era were far superior. Movie makers have become so devoid of morality and a sense of honor they have lost the

creativity it takes to make originals so constantly come up with remakes which fail every time. Same goes for Crowe in ""True Grit"". Why anyone would think they could outdo John Wayne is beyond me..  Guess everyone will disagree with this review but I will say again this remake was so inferior to the original and such a different story they  can't  be compared. Glenn Ford had a charm that came right through the screen that Crowe could never match....  the story line in the latest one is right out of Twilight Zone. Way too many characters to really enjoy the relationships. The actors from that era were magnificent  and knew how to not overplay it but still give superb performances. .",1439251200,4,1408,4.47265625

1590799,3,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold (that's Man and Gold combined, whom you either know from ""Walk the Line"" or ""Copland"") directed this competent remake (or more accurately, a reimaging) of the 1957 film of this title (both of which use the short story by Elmore Leonard as their starting point), a blood and fire Western that combines the best elements of both high drama and low-brow gunfight serials. Even though he is not (as he proclaims himself to be) ""the greatest actor in the world,"" Russell Crowe is a fairly subdued performer here, offering a competitive but nonetheless relaxed effort at playing Ben Wade, a brutal but not entirely antagonist robber and murderer of the West. To describe what happens between him and quasi-disabled rancher Dan Evans as they end up journeying to the town of Contention to wait for the 3:10 train to Yuma would deprive you of the urge to watch the film itself. What I can say is that there seems to have been a philosophical realignment of values this time, with the ""pulp"" ambitions of the original story changed somewhat for this screen adaptation; rather than a mere fiction, ""3:10 to Yuma"" makes some serious points about family, the idea of manhood, and the wasted efforts at revenge. Though the film has a downbeat conclusion, there is some sense of vindication in the ending, with Crowe's character taking a surprising turn indeed. Undoubtedly too heavy morally and too packed with drama to revitalize the real genre of the Western as it used to exist in film and in literary magazines, Mangold's film is in many ways head and shoulders above the other offerings spewed out by Hollywood's poop culture machine. If you are in the mood for action, you'll love it, but expect some heavy emotions along the way.
Extras include a fine audio commentary by the director, and a couple of simple 'making ofs' that explore how the meat was made. Also of note is the cast, including a sullied Peter Fonda doing a great turn as an aging lawman. Definitely a film worth considering, and even the usually intolerable Bale makes an 'A' for effort here. C+",1426636800,,2070,4.752777777777778

1590890,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 TO YUMA

 There is only one reason to re-make a classic movie, that is to make a better version.  The original 3:10 To Yuma of 1957 is rightly considered to be among the best westerns in the heyday of the genre.  The new version is even better.
 We expect a lot from director James Mangold after his recent triumph with the biographic Walk the Line.  He does not disappoint.
 Christian Bale plays the farmer trying to make his life whole by bringing a bad man to justice.  This fine actor and leading man displays his acting skills in a brilliantly understated study of a tortured father and husband as he tries to make good.
 Russell Crowe is the heavy in the role pioneered by Glen Ford.  He plays a charismatic bad man, simultaneously charming and ruthless. Crowe has never been better.  He dominates each frame in which he appears.  He compels the attention of the viewer in a way not seen since the very best work of Sir Richard Burton.
 The beautiful Gretchen Mol plays the farm wife with subtlety.  Watch for a grizzled Peter Fonda in a supporting role.

Russell Crowe puts onery to task playing Ben Wade, while Christian Bale does his best to be the meak rancher Dan Evans.  Crowe's acting is first rate.  He's mean, he's nasty and he's hellbent on not going to jail.  In many ways the Wade character is Cort from The Quick and the Dead.

Christian Bale brings on one if his finest performances in 3:10.  He's a man torn by duty and loyalty.  Asked to help get Wade aboard the train he resists all attempts by Wade to let him go.  Wade goads Evans until Evans even begins to doubt himself.

Here, a wanted criminal, Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe ), is influenced by a maybe not so common rancher ( C. Bale ) during their ride to Yuma, AZ. This unseen emotional transformation happens gradually to the outlaw Wade perhaps by his recognition of one man's devotion to his family. Wade's gang is such a cut-throat but trusty mob that he never doubts their ability to rescue him during captivity. A good supporting cast helps the film along. It somehow lacks the grit of the old western movies but it liked it anyway. Yes, the western genre is not dead and probably never will be.

""The film is an exercise in Implausible Plotting. Cowboys and lawmen of the Old West escort a Notorious Outlaw across the wilderness and leave his hands cuffed in front of him, even after he kills two of the escort party in ways he never could have done had they just bothered to tie him up. Said cowboys and lawmen send a decoy ""outlaw"" in a stagecoach to throw the bad guys off the trail of the escort, and they just happen to lock the unfortunate decoy in the stage *for real* without giving him a key, so he can burn to death when the gang catches up and discovers his identity. Said cowboys and lawmen, armed and holding the higher ground, look out a hotel window to engage in conversation with the Notorious Outlaw's psychotically murderous gang, and then allow them to ride away unaccosted after several death threats, so the carnage can come later. What sane person would behave as these characters do? They act stupidly so dramatic tension can last longer.""

1591225,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 To Yuma is probably the second best Western movie Ive viewed thus far.  Im not big into Westerns though there are some I enjoy fine.  Compared to other major Western Ive seen Id say I like this more than Tombstone, but I still think the remake of True Grit is the best.  Aside from two minor aspects and the fact that Westerns aren't my genre this film really has no issues.  The film looks great, has some thrilling action, has a great cast, and has some enjoyable characters.

The story is as follows.  You have a man named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who is heavy in debt and has to leave his farm with his family if he doesnt pay them off.  Meanwhile you have a desperado named Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his men who rob a stage coach owned by McElroy (Peter Fonda) and nearly kill him.  Wade is arrested but they need to get him on the train to Yuma.  However, his men are still on the loose including his most loyal follower, Prince (Ben Foster), and will try to stop them.  The sheriff of the town, the doctor, Evans, McElroy, and even Evans son, William (Logan Lerman), ban together to take Wade to justice while fending off his gang and other threats they encounter along the way.

As I said the film looks good and has some enjoyable action, but what stole the film was the cast and characters.  Russell Crowe and Christian Bale were excellent in the film and they played off each other great.  This would not be half the movie without them considering that most of this film is the relationship between Evans and Wade.  Crowe plays an excellent villain.  He is definitely bad and deceitful but also has some good in him which is showcased at the end.  He also has excellent charisma.  Ben Foster also plays another intimidation villain.  Logan Lerman does a fine job as the son.  Im not too familiar with this actor.  The only other film Ive seen him in (I think) in Noah and I didn't care for him there.  However, he does a decent job here.

Peter Fonda was good as well, though he was underused.  They kept him alive in the beginning just to kill him off in a bit of a distasteful way, which I didn't care for.  The pacing could have been a bit faster too.  There were a couple scenes that couldve been cut out.  Those are really my only problems.

Overall, definitely give this look if you love Westerns, action movies, or just want to see Russell Crowe or Bale give great performances.  Its my second favorite Western after True Grit, though that can change.  I haven't seen that many Westerns really.  Its not a film Id watch regularly because, as I said, I am not a big fan of Westerns, but I cant deny that its still a great movie from a critical standpoint and I did have fun with the dichotomy between the characters and some of the action.",1409875200,,2766,4.3561643835616435
1591256,4,B00005JPXP,"Let me get this out of the way first: We should take up a collection and get those guys an atlas! The opening scenes of this movie have continuous references to Bisbee, Arizona. I spent a good portion of my life in Bisbee, so I was more than a little curious, to put it mildly! Imagine my surprise and dismay to discover that Hollywood's Bisbee is NOT in the southeastern mountains of Arizona, is NOT a mining town, and is NOT in even the vicinity (despite numerous references to crossing the border into Mexico), but is, instead, somewhere flat, grassy, and with cholla (the ""Jumping Cactus""), which grows farther north! To add insult to injury, they had the temerity to include an interval (you'll see Luke Wilson as a bad guy) with Chinese laborers building a railroad! In Southern Arizona? Puleeze!

This is right up there with the classic ""My Darling Clementine"" starring Henry Fonda. That one was supposed to be about Tombstone and the Gunfight at OK Corral, but was filmed in Monument Valley, which is in the far northeastern part of Arizona, over 300 miles away. That location was hard to stomach, too!

Okay, now that I got that off my chest, let's talk about the movie itself. It is absolutely terrific! Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale (""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige"") is a law-abiding small-time rancher, struggling to make ends meet. His hard-working family consists of a wife and two sons. The man who holds his mortgage has cut off his access to water and he is on the brink of ruin. He had the lower part of one leg amputated in the Civil War. In the early scenes of the movie, their little ranch is raided, their cattle run off and their barn burned.

As Dan and his fourteen-year-old son track their small herd, they happen upon a stagecoach robbery being committed by a gang headed by a charismatic, Bible-quoting fellow named Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe (""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Cinderella Man""). This gang is so feared and respected they travel the area with relative impunity. Dan and his son pick up an injured Pinkerton guard, played by Peter Fonda (""Ulee's Gold"" and ""The Hired Hand""). They have to get him to a doctor (who actually turns out to be a veterinarian), played by Alan Tudyk (""Death at a Funeral"" and ""28 Days""). Wade and his gang have stopped in ""Bisbee"" for some R & R, and as a result of a terrific scene between Dan and Ben (this is based on a story by Elmore Leonard), Ben is captured. With a rueful smile, Ben says, ""Remind me never to play poker in this town.""

Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is a fascinating character. He intellectually seduces everyone, finding grounds for common interest, obtaining agreement on some shared value, searching each new acquaintance for a weakness. He is, on the other hand, a cold-blooded killer who does not hesitate to shoot someone because ""He bored me.""

The Pinkerton Agency is charged with the responsibility to deliver Ben Wade to the ""3:10 to Yuma."" The train will deliver him to the Territorial Prison, where he will be hanged. Finding a shortage of willing guards, a reluctant Dan Evans is hired to help out; the pay should go a long ways to getting his struggling ranch back on its feet.

Getting there is what this movie is all about. Be prepared for bloodshed, suspense and humor. You know Elmore Leonard... I'm on the waiting list at Seattle Library to view the original 1957 classic Western that starred Glenn Ford. (I wonder if THEY found Bisbee!)",1409529600,,3450,4.656814449917898

If you watch stuff like survivor (not going to capitalize that...), big brother, or american idol etc. stop reading and go play on your smartphone because I'm sure you have a person that needs to have you tweet your thoughts on your making a sandwich or who's hair extensions look great.

As Bale's young son looks on [Logan Lerman -""Perks of Being a Wallflower""], the two adult adversaries develop a strong--and dangerous-- bond.

There were a few cliches but even those had their own twists. Usually when I expected something to happen, it went in the opposite direction.  From Russell Crowe's portrayal of a vicious robber with an unexpectedly delicate artistic bent to Christian Bale's veteran soldier homesteader getting him to the train in return for enough money to keep his farm, it was an entertaining, and definitely tense story. Logan Lerman is very good as William, the teenage son who's just rebellious enough but still manages not to follow the cliches usually set up for his character. It's bloody and violent but the characterizations and outcomes were a definite and welcome change from the usual written-by-the-outline story.",1394755200,,871,5.170212765957447

1591605,5,B00005JPXP,"Actually there's no up/down comparison between the original and the remake.  They are both good films and I have both - but if I had to choose only one, I would have to choose the remake, simply because of the way movies tended to be a little too artificial back in the '50s and hence had a way of distorting human behavior, esp. bad human behavior.  It can seem kind of 1-dimensional sometimes.  Yet, the original must have still been fairly risqu for its time.  It portrays Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) heading off to the attractive female bartender's quarters within minutes of entering her establishment.  There's also the brutal hanging body of a posse member from the hotel chandelier for Dan Evan's (Van Heflin) wife to see as she comes to town in search of her husband.  So the earlier film was not really for kids (unlike Trix - the cereal), but did have serious adult overtones.  I saw the 1957 version first and sensed a flavor of the kind of thematic suspense synthesized in ""High Noon"" (1952) with all the clock watching and the lack of courage from other 'upstanding' citizens and officials.  High Noon was also in B&W

The 2007 remake takes it to a new level and includes several plot events that were not included in the original.  Since it was in color, this could be a tip off that this version was not necessarily beholding to the original and in many ways it was not.  I did not find this at all objectionable nor problematic.  This generally seemed to work to more effectively develop the plot and intensify the story.  This is also true of the ending - which I will save for you to see.",1393372800,14,1601,4.479310344827586
1591606,4,B00005JPXP,This was a good movie with great shots and acting! I am a sucker for a good western. And this did not disappoint.

1591607,5,B00005JPXP,"Ok, so this review is going to focus on the main two characters. Not to take away from everyone else's performances, but I was the most intrigued by the relationship between Bale and Crowe.

Any movie with complex and compelling characters is always a hit for me! The relationship between Evans (Christian Bale) and Wade (Russell Crowe) is remarkable and its the main reason why I really enjoyed this movie. At first glance, you see a desperate, weak and highly moral Bale versus a charismatic, witty, tough, and ruthless criminal but as the movie unfolds  and the layers are peeled back, you see just how similar the two men are. It's almost as if they are brothers; they are instantly drawn to one another. They have the same fortitude, strength, smarts, and pride but they just took very different paths in life. A good example is when Evans tells Wade, ""I'm not stubborn, I just can't leave because my youngest boy has bronchitis and he needs to be on the dry lands."" It shows you that although Evans is a tough sharp shooter (similar to Wade) he has a family and his values and morales are different because of that. It shows that Evans is a selfless man who cares for more than just himself. Wade is extremely intuitive and deep down is a good hearted guy who may have turned to the dark-side due to his father death and his mother's disappearance. You can tell that Wade might have been a religious and family oriented young boy until he was left to fend for himself. It's a really beautiful story when think about it...the way that those two characters mirror one another. The ending made me very sad though. You can just tell that Wade and Evans would've been the best of friends and probably would have been able to grow so much from that friendship. I love that this film really challenges the stereotypes of the good guy and the bad guy and makes you realize that its not always so black and white. Good action, good acting, good movie.",1393200000,,1948,4.53125

1591657,4,B00005JPXP,"There are several aspects of commendation whereby this movie shines among many modern westerns. A few of these include realism, compelling story, and excellent resolution.
Realism: The main characters are believable and dynamic. The protagonist, while seemingly incapable, demonstrates a great deal of perseverance which lend to the overall winsomeness of the story, as it pairs well to the dynamic villian, masterfully portrayed by Russell Crowe.
Story: While not unique, it is not your run of the mill Western. While the realism of the character's adds to the overall story, the basic layout is perfectly acceptable; a robber is to be brought to court on the other side of the region for justice. Not just any villian, not just any hero, and an excellent twist. I am generally not a fan of stories where you find yourself rooting in some measure for the villian, but in this case, I think it quite appropriate.
Resolution: I'm not going to spoil it for you, but be certain, that regardless of what you are hoping will happen to the two main character's, either good or ill, I believe you will be satisfied with the ending.

I did love this movie, and wish I could rate it 4.5 stars. Perhaps one day I'll tack on the fifth star just to offset some of the lower ratings.",1387324800,,1270,4.7207207207207205

1591877,5,B00005JPXP,"Despite a couple of high-profile stars in Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, James Mangold's long-gestating version of Elmore Leonard's 3:10 to Yuma wasn't able to do a True Grit at the box-office and provide a western hit, which is a pity because it's the best effort to revive the horse opera since Open Range. Perhaps the original intended casting of Tom Cruise and Eric Bana may have helped at the box-office - Crowe certainly doesn't have even half of the charisma that Glenn Ford had in the 1957 Delmar Daves version, though Bale has suffering down almost as pat as the eternally worn-down Van Heflin - but the film surprisingly manages to improve on that version's problematic ending that stopped it just short of being a masterpiece: it's not a huge change, but it's just big enough for one character's actions to make sense this time and not feel like a Hollywood copout. It's not the only difference. The short story has been opened out considerably, no longer relegating much of the action to a two-hander in a hotel room as the very bad man and his unlikely escort wait for the prison train - or for his ruthless gang to try to spring him. This time round more than half of the picture is taken up with the eventful ride to that town through Apache territory and a railroad camp with Ben Foster and the remnants of the gang in hot pursuit of the ever-depleting makeshift group of guards - Peter Fonda's ruthless and convincingly weather-beaten bounty hunter, Alan Tudyk's vet, Dallas Roberts' railroad man and Bale's embittered son Logan Lerman.

Mangold's Copland was very much a modern-day Western and he's completely at home with the real thing, offering another disabled hero nobody thinks is up to the job in Christian Bale's embattled debt-saddled rancher who had his foot shot off back in the wars and is now desperate for cash to prevent the local loan shark from burning down his farm and selling it to the railroad. It does a better job of linking the two men than the earlier version, with Bale stumbling across their gold shipment robbery while searching for his scattered herd. The robbery itself sets the tone for the new version and its considerably larger body count and the odd trailer-friendly explosion, and also gives unwelcome rise to Crowe explaining one particularly ruthless action that would have been better left unjustified, though thankfully there's not too much expounding of world views or moral codes. Like the best Westerns, this is a film where actions speak louder than words, and the action itself is generally well handled, the screenplay throwing in some good twists along the way even if Crowe's outlaw never really gets under Bale's skin the way that Ford managed with Heflin. It's well acted too, the supporting players making their mark without hogging the screen and Mangold keeping things moving along briskly despite the running time passing the two hour mark. Like the Delmar Daves version this may not make it to the very top tier of the genre, but it's still a damn good - and damn entertaining - Western.

The DVD includes an audio commentary by Mangold, 7 deleted scenes, only one, where Crowe's outlaw taunts Bale by telling his son ""isn't protecting you, he's following me,"" adding much, and a trio of featurettes, but the BluRay extras package is more extensive, with additional featurettes on Marco Beltrani's Oscar-nominated score, the history of the railroads out west, the guns used for the film and an interview with author Elmore Leonard about his days writing pulp Westerns. The interactive `Inside Yuma' feature isn't entirely successful, slightly awkward to navigate between script, storyboards and on-set footage (the latter not helped by running the film's soundtrack over the top of them) while the historical timeline feature is useless because the text is so tiny as to be illegible even on a large screen TV (what is it with some Blu-rays and miniscule unreadable text?). Yet despite that it's a decent extras package rounded out by a fine 2.40:1 widescreen transfer.",1374796800,3,4045,4.88646288209607
1591878,5,B00005JPXP,"Christian Bale and Russell Crowe give winning performances in this great western classic.  If you're fans of Christian Bale or Russell Crowe this would be a great movie for you.  Crowe is very believable as a hard hitting leader of an outlaw gang and Bale plays the Civil War soldier just trying to provide for his family.  When he's offered the job of getting Crowe on the 3:10 to Yuma to take him off to prison, he's determined to see the job through.  Pursued by Crowe's gang of outlaws and the unexpected arrival of Bale's oldest son, complications and circumstances arise making Bale's more job difficult to finish.  Crowe's character does redeem himself in the end and does the right thing by staying on the train taking him to Yuma after Bale's character dies.

1591911,5,B00005JPXP,"So, I had heard a long time ago that people thought 3:10 to Yuma was a good movie. At the time, I didn't know it was a remake of the original and I never really got the opportunity to see it when it was in theaters. Finally, after 6 years or so I got the opportunity to view this movie on Amazon.

I... I can't believe I didn't see this movie sooner.

So let's get this out of the way, I haven't seen the original movie and I don't plan to. After having tried to watch the original True Grit, I realized that I just don't have a taste for old movies, so I'm not going to try with this one. Let's just stick with what we've got here and go from there.

So let's get this out of the way, I wanted to cry while watching this movie. It was so subtle in how it grabbed me that I had no idea I was falling for it hook line and sinker, even my girlfriend was starting to shed a few tears. When you first start the movie, you think that Christian Bale's character of ""Dan"" is a useless do-nothing who is going to go throughout the whole movie spectating everyone else. Russel Crowe ""Ben"" is an obvious scene stealer and does an excellent job of playing the anti-hero. He's not really a villain, but he's definitely no hero either. He's just a guy watching out for his own skin who takes a liking to the no nonsense Dan.

Without spoiling too much, I started to tear up when I realized why Dan volunteered to escort Ben to the ""3:10 to Yuma."" It was a powerful emotional moment that when I realized it, my voice started cracking when I said it aloud. Dan went from a do-nothing character to a man with something to prove. He didn't want money, he didn't want land, he didn't want justice. He just wanted his little boys to (blank) and that to me, was a powerful moment for this character. When you find out why Dan is willing to risk his life to bring in this dangerous outlaw, you can't help but want to get emotional. Dan has his reasons for doing what he did and you can't help but root for the guy.

This movie will not bore you, sure it's a western, but it's a great western. At no point did I feel that the plot dragged on or that there were empty scenes, this was simply a masterpiece of a movie that I wish got more recognition than it did. If you're thinking about seeing this movie to see if it was as good as people said it was, then you are in for a treat.",1373932800,8,2359,4.064516129032258

They ended up demeaning the original to a ""motion picture piece of drivel"" as if written by E. Allen Poe, Q. Tarantino, and Jerry Bruckheimer for the Spike TV, ADD, intellectually-challenged, and testosterone crowd craving some violence, guts, and uber macho-macho morbidity.

I can honestly state that I have NEVER, not in the worst B or even C western, EVER, seen so many ubelieveable moments; guns that never run out of bullets, people who are shot repeatedly and do not fall or die, plot devices that a moron wouldn't attempt. At the very start of the movie Peter Fonda gets himself shot and left for dead. Then, a day later in movie time he gets up and leads the party just as if he had left the spa. This movie didn't need a technical consultant it needed a reality consultant.

The very worst bit is the climax of the movie when the protagonists are taking shots from perhaps 30 men without any effect whatsoever.

Pros: Terrific visuals, costumes and sets. Plenty of action.  Blu-Ray is everything you would hope for.

Cons: Awful screen play, with most of the dialog being mumbled throughout.  Character development almost none existent, and little interaction except when shooting or getting shot out.  Ending was totally unbelievable.

1591998,5,B00005JPXP,"This was a great movie, and one of the best westerns to come along in more than 30 years, with the exception of course of Unforgiven which was obviously superior. But I have to say James Mangold and team deserve credit for taking a real risk with this movie. No one has been making westerns much at all for the past 25 years. There have been a few here and there like Quick And The Dead, but they simply don't measure up to this movie. Its so well done that it comes close to being an american classic, but doesnt quite get there. But it was a very well made western. A nice departure for Russel Crowe who hasn't played a bad guy since Romper Stomper. He did beautifully as the villain here. And of course Christian Bale is great as always as a struggling rancher who becomes a legendary hero, and gains the respect of everyone, even his nemesis by the end of the film. It interests me a great deal how hollywood has chosen Bale and Crowe to lead the way in numerous period films that take place on American soil, when they aren't even american. Its a testament to the importance of these two actors and just how good they really are with each new role they take on. And never do you hear the slightest hint of his their native accents. These men are two of Hollywoods most prized actors. Crowe is already there, and Bale is slowly grabbing his seat next to americas most cherished and honored actors.. I think its great that some of americas best leading actors are not even american. In this film youd hardly even notice that fact, which points to the incredible acting abilities of both these gentlemen. Beyond that 3:10 to Yuma is filled with a classic and engaging story about good versus bad, with good detail paid to the genre. Personally I think this is a classic in my book even if the general public and critics might not go as far as to say the same thing. I totally enjoyed this film.",1367712000,,1896,4.343661971830986

Christian Bale typically does a great job and this is no exception.  He plays the quiet but forcefully determined rancher with dignity.

This is, of course, a western and the set, plot and pace is excellent and believable. The name of the game here is courage and commitment.

Really lame casting. Especially the deviant sidekick ""kid"" who is given a lot of attention in the film as if his character is compelling or as an actor, he's a lot to offer. Neither is the case. This guy is simply annoying.

The direction is ok, the production is sub par, the score is tolerable, supporting cast is dreadful as is the script. Fonda gets shot almost point blank in the gut. They take him to town where the Vet pulls out the slug and within minutes he's up and about and on the trail again.....RIDING A HORSE AND BEATING UP ON CROWE WITH HIS RIFLE BUTT. Really tuff!

Then, while the party is camped out, they come under attack for some reason by 3 Indians who start firing upon them from afar. I suppose they thought it might be more fun than waiting till the white guys are asleep and sneaking in to slit their throats. Anyway, Crowe sneaks up on the 3 and kills them while the rest of the party is cowering around the campfire in an apparent attempt to be as visible as possible, and then returns to be a captive. Silly. Then, the evil kid offers the local townfolk $200 for anyone who kills Bale. In an instant, the normally good, law abiding citizenry turn into a bunch of crazed greedy killers.

1592433,4,B00005JPXP,"It's been a long time since anyone made a truly great western. Hollywood was once known for them, when such iconic figures as Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne rode across the big screen. I went into this remake expecting the usual rubbish and was surprised; this is a rarity in modern times -- it's a great western.

Every father wants to be a hero in the eyes of his child. Would-be cattle rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is no exception. Unfortunately, his impetuous son William (Logan Lerman) has no respect for him, and their most recent point of contention comes when the loan sharks Dan has been borrowing from in order to keep his place afloat come calling and burn down the barn. Either he pays up in short order, or it'll be the house next. Disheartened and knowing he will soon lose everything, he and his boys set out to round up their cattle... and witness something that changes their lives forever: the robbery of the stagecoach. The attack is led by the infamous Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), a gun slinging outlaw with an impressive reputation that includes multiple murders and hold-ups. But this time he pushes his luck a little too much and is taken into custody in town, while his ""boys"" escape out back.

The intention of the Pinkerton detective on the case is to put Wade on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison... but they have to get him there first. It's a long journey across Indian-infested territory, with the full knowledge that Wade's posse, led in his absence by the ruthless Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), will be intent on rescuing him. Desperate both to save his land and recover the respect of his son, Dan volunteers to go along as a hired gun. Little does he realize what he is in for, because in addition to Indians, accidents, and escape attempts, Wade is known for his unnerving charm and calculating plans. And even if they make it to Yuma, they still have to wait for the train.

I admit that westerns are not my favorite thing in the world, in part because so many of them are dreadful. I started out this movie in the background while tidying up the living room and then midway through simply sat down and watched the rest. It's a great film. It has a solid script with intense dialogue, truly terrific actors (other notable ones show up in cameos throughout), and an unusual friendship that forms between two men so different in so many ways yet that understand one another on a deeper level. The character of Wade is ingenious, for one moment he is all charm and smiles and the next he is throttling someone or calmly throwing them off a cliff. But even though he is hard to put your finger on, you know what will happen toward the end because you start understanding him along with Dan. Crowe and Bale are incredible together; they have an on-screen chemistry that is rare these days, and it was a pure delight for me to see two such talented actors at the top of their game.

Audiences considering spending time with this film should know going in that in the true style of great classic westerns, sacrifices are made; people are killed, at times people we have grown fond of, but the story is ultimately all about integrity, which something we're severely lacking in the modern age. Dan undertakes a job and is determined to stick to it, because he gave his word -- even when it means he could die, even when he is offered ten times the promised amount if he'll just walk away. He never goes back on his word, and it is this that makes the biggest impact on his son. In a sense, he accomplishes far more than he intended to, and also earns respect from Wade that would have never been offered if he'd been easily bought off or given in. That, in part, was what so impressed me about it; that it wasn't just a shoot-em-up western where the good guys where white and the bad guys wear black, but it had a moral core to it, and depth beyond being a superficial action film. The final ten minutes are the most action-packed and profound in many ways, and even though it has an unexpected twist that some may not welcome, it does what few movies can do: share a deeper truth without preaching.",1332892800,,4123,4.4787234042553195

The remake with Russell Crow has better acting, more drama, more suspense, and better direction than the original.  It has just enough variation to make it worth having even if you already own the original version.

There are several improvements in this movie such as the heavily armed coach.  Since $20,000 was a lot of money back then and with a history of it being robbed, it would have had a very heavily guarded coach, rather than just a shotgun rider.  Also the larger number of guards with gatling guns makes for a much more dramatic and exciting beginning to this movie, and justifies such a  large gang traveling with Ben Wade.

As good as Glen Ford was Russell Crow is even better.",1330819200,,854,4.578947368421052
1592436,5,B00005JPXP,"As much as people whine about remakes/reboots coming out year after year, you can't deny that there've been some pretty good ones here and there. 3:10 to Yuma just so happens to be one of the good ones, and is a movie that gives me hope for more great westerns. I'm not a Russell Crowe fan at all, but the man steals the show here, and earns top billing with his performance of a laid-back, yet ruthless gunslinger. Christian Bale does alright, but here, it's all about Crowe...and an exploding horse. Not only is the movie good, but this blu-ray has terrific picture and audio, with plenty of extras to keep you busy for a while. And here this thing's usually found in the bargain sections...

Ben Wade and his group of outlaws run the show in their part of the west, robbing coaches and striking fear into the hearts of anyone they cross paths with. The opening of the movie shows just how easy it is to get taken out by Wade when he demonstrates his godlike speed with a revolver. Wade and his boys rob a coach of its money, then head over to the local town where one of the guys lets the men in charge know what happened with the coach, and they head out to see if anything's left. The outlaws get comfortable in town, and it's here where Wade gets captured by Dan Evans, a handicapped rancher who's just barely getting by in supporting his family, and is about to lose his property thanks to overdue bills, and those people who want their money just plain being jerks about it, burning his barn down as a warning. With Ben Wade as their prisoner, the local banker, a doctor, one of the jerks that burned his barn, and Dan himself make a journey to take Wade to the town of Contention, where he'll be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma and be tried for his crimes, and most likely hung. But Wade's boys aren't going to let their leader go, and come looking for him, and that's just one problem. The gang has to head through Apache territory and other dangerous areas, while having to worry about their prisoner, who's still very much a threat despite being handcuffed. As the journey progresses, Dan discovers that he and Wade have some things in common, and they begin to respect one another. Can the wooden-legged rancher stick to his word and deliver the prisoner to the train station?

This movie was flat-out enjoyable from the beginning to the end, and never dragged on in any parts. Ben Wade is such an interesting character that you don't even care if he's one of the most dangerous men in recent western movie history. He's a charmer and isn't a one-dimensional villain. He likes to draw, is precise with every weapon he gets ahold of, and must be a great leader since his gang's so devoted to freeing him the minute he's captured. I almost want to see a prequel showing Wade's adventures prior to this movie, but that could kill a lot of the mystery behind him too. Russell Crowe dos a tremendous job here and again, he is definitely the star of the show. Christian Bale's character is solid as well, but much different from Wade. He's a man that wants the respect of his family, since it's clear that they look down on him. His wife doesn't think highly of him, and his oldest son constantly tries to override his decisions. When he finally tells the story about how he lost his leg, you can't help but feel sorry for him if you hadn't already. Great leads aside, the movie is full of action too. The opening coach robbery features a horse being blown up for crying out loud! Do I even need to continue? There isn't a whole lot of blood, sticking to true western movie roots, but the final shootout doesn't hold back. You have to hand it to the filmmakers for not showing heads blowing up or blood gushing out of tiny wounds like some other movies have in the last couple of years.

Picture quality is nearly flawless on the blu-ray, with only a tiny bit of grain noticeable during night scenes. You'd think that a western wouldn't be that eye-appealing, since there's so much brown, but colors stand out here. When the group reaches a mountain village, you can practically see every single pebble in the rocky walls around them. As for the audio, the movie is probably 1/3 action and 2/3 character-driven, so when the guns start going off, the English Uncompressed PCM 7.1 gets the job done. Trust me- if you have a good home theater system, the action scenes in this movie will rattle the living room. Subtitles are also available in English and Spanish, but the language track is only in English.

The special features section surprised me, as I wasn't expecting anywhere near as much as they gave us. First up is a commentary track with the director that, while not the most interesting, tells you everything you need to know about how the movie got made and gives some good info on what's happening on the screen. Destination Yuma is a short featurette that consists of interviews with the cast and crew with off-set footage thrown in. It's basic stuff that you'd see on an entertainment show promoting the movie, but still nice to have. There are deleted scenes as well, and most of them were deleted for good reason since they didn't add much to the movie. Also included from the dvd extras are the documentary about famous western outlaws, and interviews with the cast talking about the western genre. The blu-ray exclusive extras are plentiful, with featurettes going over the movie's score, a documentary about the impact the transcontinental railway had on the USA, a look at all the guns used in the movie, an interview with western author Elmore Leonard, an interactive text/image feature talking about the events between 1860-1890, the trailer, and finally an interactive menu that shows comparisons between the movie and its storyboards and more.

If you're looking for a good western, 3:10 to Yuma is usually billed as the best one to come out since Unforgiven, so that's really saying something. It's a terrific action/thriller that keeps a steady pace thanks to evened out action and interesting characters. I also have to mention, as stupid as this is, that it was nice seeing 'the hot girl' from Hocus Pocus in here for a few minutes. Anyone around my age knows exactly who I'm talking about if they saw the movie back in the early 90s, and she's still looking mighty fine. So you get action, characters, her AND an exploding horse, all in the same movie! How can you NOT buy this?",1328400000,2,6411,4.551993067590987

This was one of the best westerns I've seen in a long time.  Supposedly this was a re-make.  However I am doubt if it was this good.  Both actors give powerful performances. Much like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, this was not your traditional Western.  It's not a movie you can take your eyes off if you want to follow the plot.

The problem is (SPOILER ALERT) the ending is so ridiculous. We're supposed to believe not only does one man fight off about 50 guys shooting at him from all angles but that his prisoner is going to suddenly follow him to the prison train while his posse attempts to free him. I'm sorry, but the ending was a HUGE letdown and seemed so Hollywood after the entire movie tried to prove it wasn't just another run-of-the-mill Western.

1592480,5,B00005JPXP,"The old west is back!  I watch this movie over and over. This movie is a fantastic remake of an outstanding Western classic.  It is more intense and gritty.  The upgrade adds edgy tension; and there's an undercurrent of sexuality (Both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are sizzling hot in these roles as rugged cowboys.) All actors involved give a realistic view of how hard life could be in the old American West. Russell Crowe as vicious outlaw Ben Wade is excellent.  He is evil and good simultaneously. He has amazing intelligence, honesty, gun speed and he loves his mother.  One of my favorite quotes of Ben Wade's after he murders a man who insulted his mother is ""even bad men love their mamas,"" and how Wade sets it up for Dan Evans to be a hero to his son. Both actions epitomizes the complexity of Russell's Ben Wade character.  Russell plays Ben Wade so smooth. I love how he whistles for his horse.

Christian Bale's Dan Evans is also painfully believable.  Not only is he struggling financially, Evans is struggling, as someone who lost a leg during the war, to gain the respect of his community, his sons and to re-gain the admiration of his wife.  He takes on a dangerous job for two reasons in my opinion: to impress others and for financial gain.

It seems that Wade and Evans develop a friendship during their experience together.  Evans shares so much of his personal life with Wade.  Wade seems to give Evans the respect that he is seeking. That respect and possibly brotherly affection is clearly identified in the final scenes of the movie. Wade does what he believes is necessary for Dan Evans' typical teenage son William played by actor Logan Lerman to finally see his father as a hero and a strong man.

William is a nice addition and deviation from the original movie. He is sassy and is coming into his own manhood.  He is looking for a hero and a strong male role-model.  He does not see his father as either.  The end of the movie illustrates how William becomes a man and also sees his father as a strong man.  The end of the movie also allows the viewer to see how Wade creates what memory that both he and Dan Evans want William to have of his father.  It also begs the question who really ""put"" Wade on the train?

What is it about a rugged, dusty, dangerous ""cowboy"" that is so exciting? Actors Ben Foster and Rio Alexander members of the Wade gang are also deserving of some recognition.  The setting of the west is beautiful which is a contrast to the ugliness of the lives these characters are living.

I am surprised that this movie or its actors did not receive an Oscar.  While the original was great, this version is superior. I need to stop the review and analysis to avoid spoiling for others.  Both versions of 3:10 to Yuma are classics and deserve placement in any Western fan's collection.  Bravo!",1324684800,,2845,4.51171875

He had no idea what it was about or what the title meant, he'd just heard that it won critical acclaim. So it turns out it is a Western, my least favorite of all genres - westerns tend to have lots of action with little plot and dialogue, barbaric male characters, few and poorly treated females, everything is brown, and everyone is dusty, unshowered, and, I imagine, stinking of body odor. So this film basically followed the trend, meanderingly along with someone getting shot or tortured an average of about every 5 minutes. The only reason we didn't switch to something else was my husband was multitasking on his computer with a game of hearts and I was settled on the couch after a very tiring week and didn't want to hunt for the remote. And, there was Russell Crowe. So after 90 minutes of wondering where this movie is going, it actually goes somewhere. It has a pretty awesome conclusion that ties together everything that happened up to that point and makes you think back to the characters and events.

1592585,4,B00005JPXP,"The original ""3:10 to Yuma"" is taken from an Elmore Leonard short story of which the kindest thing one can say is that, as either action or drama, it's tissue-thin. You read it and wonder what the point was. (Leonard is quoted as saying the movie version was a good example of Hollywood taking something simple and screwing it up. Wrong.)

This might be what attracted Hollywood -- the story was /so/ thin it left room for expansion and amplification. And that's what the writer (Halstead Welles) supplied. Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is a charming seducer who starts with the barmaid, then (apparently) sets his eyes on Dan Evans's (Van Heflin) wife, and then Evans himself! The dramatic centerpiece of the film is an extended scene in the bridal suite (!!!) of a hotel where Dan holds Ben under guard. * The charming Ben Wade is not only trying to seduce Dan into taking money for letting him go, but seducing Dan himself. The film ends more or less ""happily"", with Dan -- against almost insurmountable odds -- getting Ben on the train. The 1957 original is rightly seen as a minor classic.

The 2007 remake follows the original closely, adding two significant features: The railroad is trying to take Dan Evans' property (his barn has already been burned, and he's warned that his house will be next). Ben Wade is now not just a charming killer, but an out-and-out psychopath, Hannibal Lecter's cousin. (This was implicit in the 1957 film -- Ben ""reads"" and manipulates people almost as well as Hannibal (lecter = reader).) For example, he steals a fork from Wade's house and uses it to kill one of his captors, just as Lecter uses a carelessly discarded paper clip to make a lock pick. The bridal suite scene is now much shorter, with Ben approaching Dan more or less directly about the money. The implied sexual seduction is gone.

As with ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Yuma"" has its homosexual psychopath, Charlie Prince. When Charlie suggests to Byron McElroy (a virtually unrecognizable Peter Fonda) that he ought to recognize his name, Byron responds ""No, but I've heard of a balled-up whore named Charlie Princess"", for which he gets shot in the gut. If this (or a line suggesting Charlie considers himself closer to Ben than just a friend) doesn't tell us where Charlie's sexual interests lie, his apparel doth proclaim it -- he wears a pearl-gray leather jacket with big brass buttons. It doesn't matter which side of the law you're on -- if you're gay, you have impeccable taste.

The remake is far more violent than the original, with people dying left and right. The illogic of the original's ""happy"" ending is corrected, in a way that might leave a bad taste in viewers' mouths. Still, it's about as good as the original. Given the mixed reviews, I was expecting to hate it, but was pleasantly surprised. Picture and sound (the latter, especially) are outstanding. Recommended.

1592589,4,B00005JPXP,"...but I'll still give it 4 stars since the flawless acting and cinematography, beautiful locations score, crisp film editing, etc. were so good---I'm ordinarily not a big fan of Westerns other than the Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns, because their simplistic ""good guys vs. bad guys"" dichotomy just bores me to tears.  This one does have far more interesting and 3-dimensional characters, at least for a Western that is...that and the impeccable visuals and soundtrack kept me totally absorbed.

The trouble is, about 2/3 of the way through the film, the inevitable ""suspension of disbelief"" that most works of fiction necessarily require, simply mushrooms and explodes to an absolutely insane level.  It continued to be entertaining of course, but the last 10 minutes especially had me howling and groaning with exasperation...I don't want to give away the plot, but let's just say that it's basically impossible to take in ANY of the deluge of outrageously absurd and ludicrous plot turns and character shifts without your head EXPLODING!!!

Now that I think about it, I would give this film 3 stars.  The 4th star is for the all-too brief scenes with the drop-dead gorgeous Vanessa Shaw who plays a singer-cum-barmaid whom Russell Crowe beds and then draws a lovely semi-nude of...his drawing of her lying on her side with the sheets covering half of her luscious posterior goes a long way towards redeeming the ruthless onslaught of implausibility in the 3rd act of the movie.

PS.  The Elmore Leonard short story this movie was based on is, predictably, far better---shorter, simpler, tighter and far more effective.  But I guess they had to add more to it in order to fill up 2 hours onscreen.",1288137600,,1720,5.010526315789473

I thought it was an enjoyable romp around the west, similar to Eastwood films.  I think it needed more action near the end, people say it's more of a drama and I agree.  Theres a sense of urgency in being chased, but once that was over I didn't feel like I was left with much.  So I got to the part right before the two sides finally meet, and you know people are gonna get shot.  I had to pause it there for a week.  I got back to it expecting Bale to engage and win a drawn out shoot-em up, using whatever strategic militia expertise he had to get the bad guys, while crowe either helps or hinders the process.  While Crowe does do that, what followed wasn't what I was hoping, but more expecting, there was shooting and some strategy, but the end just seemed a little too simplistic and feel-good without giving anything anyway to people who haven't seen it.  It serves the drama coin well, and what you want to see happen happens, but I thought the way in which they achieved that could have been more along the lines of how westerns usually play out.

Great movie, supper scene, barroom scene, camping outside near the indians and the mining scene all come to mind.  I just found the ending to be maybe non-western is the word?  Like in Taken (love that movie too) where he spends the whole movie catching up to bad guy after bad guy, and then disposing of them before you can say... Taken?  The difference being theres only one group of bad guys in this movie, bad-ass they are.  That sniper guy should be in a metal band!",1286928000,2,1696,4.246105919003115

1592625,5,B00005JPXP,"Westerns have probably been the most successful gendre of movies;because they are about the most important part of American history. The period after the Civil War until the end of the 1900's which was when where America broke away from a society that was built on principles and ideas of Europe and developed a culture that was built on what we now come to see as America;the land of the free and the home of the brave. Simply put free spirit of the individual was what made America what it has become;not ideas laid on the people from government or the establishment. This concept arose in America, and not only did it not come from elsewhere;but was thwarted if even dreamed of.
 This movie,is an excellent remake of the original version starring Glen Ford and just as ,if not better ,in every way.
 It ranks up there with the best and certainly reminds one of what have become Western Classics;such as Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. There are some who want to nitpick over historical facts;but what makes all great historical novels and stories,great rather than mundane, is the mix of fact,fiction and legend.
  Some movies are so well made that they bear watching over and over again and this is such a movie. Some of the movies like ""Gone With The Wind"",""Midway"" or ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai"",""The Longest Day"",""Tombstone"" and such are all a mix of fact,fiction and legend;and a few of the many that are produced,bear watching many times;and that is why we call them Classics.""3:10 to Yuma ""is a Classic!",1283644800,,1521,4.75

I wasn't sure whether or not  this version would stick to that version.  I have such great respect for both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe; I wasn't sure during the film which character i wanted to hope for.  I found the difference between the two movies to be the relationships.  In the earlier version I didn't feel a closeness grow between the two men in the same way as this film.  Glenn Ford seemed more menacing. Russell Crowe was more charmingly menacing.

I was taken aback by the ending. The director did an amazing job with the violent scenes.  They were almost like ballet scenes.  The choreography of them gave them almost a poetic quality. Its true, as in th other reviews, i was very impressed with the supporting cast. It took me a while to recognize Peter Fonda.  He gave a superbly subtle performance.

I have always been a fan of the western film.  It is great to see it back in such a successful way.  Great performances, screenplay, visually stunning, and intensely enjoyable.  It is very violent and i wouldn't recommend it for younger children.",1282348800,2,1229,4.599078341013825
1592627,5,B00005JPXP,"As an aficionado of the Sergeio Leone/Clint Eastwood 'Spaghetti Westerns', I really enjoyed this movie.  Somehow, to me, this film--including the background mustic--had the same feel.  To a certain extent, Ben Wade's band of violent desperadoes is reminiscent of Indio's band of renegades in 'For a Few Dollars More.'  If you are familiar with the film, the sensuous but thoroughly detestable Indio, helps kill off his men so as to diminish the sharing of stolen treasure.  Indio and Eastwood's 'Man with No Name', also establish a deadly relationship that the Crowe character [Ben Wade] progressively establishes with the courageous Dan Evans [Bale]. In both films the evil gangs are completely killed off.

No, they're not the same movie but the similarites [to me, at least] are there.  Leone's characters are a bit dirtier and less polished than the characters in this film, but they fit the bill.  Actually the Indio and Eastwood characters [in 'For a Few Dollars More] are a combination of the Crowe character plus Crowe's devoted gang member-- the lethal fellow in the Confederate officer's uniform.  This fellow, in particular, shows all of Eastwood's impossible expertise with a pistol and the Crowe character, Wade, is an excellent pistolero, himself.

If you haven't seen it or, if it's a long time since you've seen it, I recommend watching 'For a Few Dollars More.'  I know that 'The Good, Bad, and the Ugly' got more publicity but I think 'For a Few Dollars More' is the slightly better film.

By the way, I see Leone, almost single-handedly, as the person who nearly killed off the classic Western.  His Eastwood characters--The Man with No Name and 'Blondy'--are literally ridiculously good shots to the extent that much of Leone's films are [deliberately?] comical.  '3:10' isn't comical but, still, nobody can shoot as good--with a pistol--as the guy with the Confederate uniform.",1280880000,2,1898,5.083870967741936

But this film blew me away, literally and figuratively. It has so many twists and turns that I was on the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen next, right up until the very last 10 seconds. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as a downtrodden former Civil War soldier trying to make a hardscrabble living in Arizona (I live in Phoenix NOW with air conditioning, a car, and Nordstrom's and this place is still a challenge!) The entire cast, which includes an unrecognizable Peter Fonda, is outstanding. But it's Aussie Russell Crowe who walks away with the film. His early American persona (and perfect Western accent) as psychopathic outlaw Ben Wade is so believable that one can't help but wonder why Arnold Shwarzenegger, a former Governor of California - perpetrating as an actor - still speaks English with a barely understandable accent..

1592633,2,B00005JPXP,"I loved the original version of this film and after reading so many positive reviews was anxious to see the remake.
There was a great deal more violence in the new film which made it difficult to hook the basic ""good guy outlaw"" tag on Russell Crowe when compared to Glen Ford's version of the character Ben Wade.  Despite the fact that the character development wasn't quite as well done and believable as the original, the movie was definitely tight and an ""edge of the chair""
 watch.  As a matter of fact I was ready to put it on my ""Don't miss this one"" list to friends. as well as note it as one of those movies I'd see again; that is until we reached an ending for which I was not prepared.

Viewing 3:10 to Yuma is far from a passive experience.  The violence and action packed script involves the viewer to a great extent and the ending seemed almost unnecessary and senseless, and more like a contrived and deliberate deviation created only to perhaps attract viewers who already knew the story.

There is something in most of us that thrives on the ""feel good"" type of emotion some movies generate, and the original certainly created that through its ending.  In watching the killings and brutality in the remake I found myself thinking that it was bearable because of the that good feeling that I expected would come at the end....as it did in the original.

If there never had been an original version, and if the current 3:10 to Yuma had been the first, I would have watched it, felt depressed at the end; and tried to forget it.  There would not be a  second time.  However there was an original version, and viewers left the theater thinking they had seen a good action film that had that ""feel good"" ending and worth a second or third viewing.  Any energy expended in watching was rewarded by the ending.

Nor ao with the remake.  All of the merits of the film I had felt earlier in watching it totally dissolved and left me feeling empty and somehow cheated.  Any twinges of morality or inspiration were turned to dust and completely lost, and a grand tale ruined.  All for the sake of attracting viewers .

One can only wonder at the reasons behind this ""twist"" of the ending.  Was it to attract those viewers who might not view the film because they knew the ending, or was it a reflection of the society in which we live today where senseless brutality and killing is so much the norm in real life that the ending was deemed necessary to make it realistic?

Sadly what could have been a good film missed the mark, and joined the ranks of all the rest of the forgettable sagas that grace the screen today.

Frankly, I'll take the good old originals along with the belief that good things can and do happen.  The new 3:10 was definitely not one of them.",1271462400,5,2771,4.436758893280633
1592634,5,B00005JPXP,"Man oh man,rent,buy,whatever you have to do,but watch this film. It is easily one of the best in the past few decades,and in my opinion,the best Western of all time. Everything was spot on:the acting,the locations,the mood,the dialogue;this is simply a perfectly made film. All directors under the age of 60(Michael Bay,I'm talking to you)should be required to watch ""3 10"" as many times as it takes until they learn that what makes a film great is compelling storylines and quality actors,not CGI and softcore starlets.
You've probably read the story already here:Russell Crowe plays the leader of a criminial gang who has not problem with killing those who get in his way,including members of his own gang. Christian Bale plays a Civil War veteran who lost his foot and is going to lose his land due to the local bigshot landowner's damming of the river(the only source of water without rain) so that Bale and his family will be forced into abandonning the land and be left penniless. Bale sees Crowe's gang murder people working for the railroad(Bale's land will be sold to the railroad if he doesn't come up with $200)and leave the main supervisor for dead. Bale is simply a man trying to show his sons what being a good man is all about,and he takes the wounded Peter Fonda into town to be treated. While there,he meets up with Crowe(whose gang left while Crowe was having a little R&R with the local saloon girl).Crowe makes it clear that he will give Bale a large amount of money in exchange for looking the other way while he leaves,and this is the tension of the entire film:will Bale continue to sacrifice himself and potentially his family in the name of doing what is right?Even when what is right is represented by men far more evil than the outlaws in Crowe's gang?What makes a notion or a man good?
 This film is a powerful character study and is deliciously haunting in ways I haven't see a Western address since ""Unforgiven"".If you are a fan of the John Wayne style Westerns then this film probably will not a appeal to you since Wayne was basically just Superman with a gun and everything was black and white. This film is pure grey,and that's what makes it amazing. I won't give the ending away,but let me say that it completely not the cotton candy garbage that Hollywood usually serves.

The problem is that Russel Crowe doesn't come across as
""rotten as hell"" no matter how many people he guns down.

  Life on the frontier is difficult and sparse for the Evans family.  The father, Dan (Christian Bale) is trying to hold things together on a family farm that's being squeezed out by a powerful land baron who's not only dammed the small river the farm depended on for irrigation, but started hiring local thugs to itimidate the Evans family and carry out acts of vandalism and arson - aimed not only at terrorizing the clan, but at making it impossible for Evans to make enough money to pay down his debt and keep the land from being seized.  Dan Evans is basically alone against a very powerful group of ruthless enemies, unable to stand up to them without putting his family's life in jeopardy and with no one to call on for the support he'd need in order to fight back.  His oldest son thinks him a coward for not doing more than he is, and Dan, full of self-doubt, is also worried that he's losing the respect of the rest of his family at the same time that he seems to be slowly losing their home and livlihood.  On the exact opposite end of the spectrum we have outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), whose gang of stagecoach thieves has been terrorizing the region.  When the law finally succeeds in apprehending Wade, Evans - by sheer chance - ends up playing a role in his capture.  Wade still has to be taken across some distance of wild territory to Yuma, where he'll be put on a train and shipped back east to stand trial.  Being part of the band that delivers Wade to Yuma isn't a job that has many people clamoring for the chance to climb onboard, as the rest of his gang is still on the loose and will undoubtedly attempt to rescue their leader and kill his captors.  For $200 - enough to pay off what his land has owing on it, Evans agrees to take part in the escort.

  A very character-driven movie, the two leads are both fascinating, and the hero-villain interplay between Christian Bale and Russel Crowe is among the best in moviedom.  Bale's Evans character is willing to do almost anything, take on almost any danger, not just for the physical cash that'll enable him to keep the family farm going, but to prove to people - especially his oldest son, or, perhaps especially to himself - that he isn't a failure or a coward.  After years of having no feasible chance of bettering his family's lot, he seizes at this one chance for redemption and doesn't let go, even when it begins to look even more suicidal than taking on the large crew of local thugs back home would have been.  In an interesting twist, one of those very thugs is also among the small crew paid to escort Wade to Yuma.  Also, unexpectedly, joining the party is Evans's oldest son, who follows along behind them and, by the time he's discovered, can't be sent back home for fear of sending him right into Wade's pursuing gang.  Russel Crowe's character of Wade is harder to analyze in terms of motivation, but immensely fascinating in trying to.  On the surface he seems to be an unmitigated killer with no values, rules, or code of honor, but as events play out it becomes clear that's not the whole story - it's just hard to tell what the whole story is.  As the viewer tries to crack what exactly determines Wade's at-times contradictory actions and behavior, Wade himself seems intrigued by Evans's conduct, who's increasingly willing to go to extraordinary lengths but at the same time unwilling to cross certain moral lines for any reason.  It's as if Wade has developed, in his own mind, a sense of what should and shouldn't be in the world, of right and wrong, but has long since decided that any such notions are irrelevant and inapplicable in the real world.  But now he's observing somebody who seems to be making an attempt at actually putting such ideals into practice, despite the world's best efforts to show them as ultimately futile.

  The dramatic and dangerous journey to Yuma culminates in an escalation of stakes and a tremendous showdown.  Evans and Wade have both reached pivotal points, and their performers, Bale and Crowe, have both established their roles as the stuff of legend.  All supporting performances are dead-on, and the overall production values exceptional.  One of the best movies of 2007, and a must-see whether you're a longtime western fan or have previously seen few or any.  10/10",1255046400,4,4790,4.756952841596131

1592741,2,B00005JPXP,"I usually do not review anything with so many reviews already (402 at this point); for one thing, I can't read the other views to make sure I don't simply repeat what another reviewer has written. But if I am this time, IT NEEDS REPEATING: DON'T REMAKE A CLASSIC AND MAKE AN INFERIOR VERSION! Yes, modern movies in vivid color and more imaginative camera angles, not to mention loads more pyrotechnics, make for more visually appealing experiences than old black and whites. In this case, however, those are ALL the movie has going for it. Older movies make up for the lack with complex and moving psychological impact. This one was complex, but hardly moving.

Enough venting, though. The bottom line is that this is a very dark and violent little thriller that is an okay way to spend a couple of hours, I guess, if you don't expect too much. That's why I gave it two stars. But it is a remake of an older movie that is perhaps second only to ""High Noon"" itself as one of the deepest of all Westerns (okay, so there's ""The Searchers"". And ""Outlaw Josey Wales""...but you get my drift). The changed ending, the ""wimpification"" of the hero, all subtract significantly. And it would have been nice to have the slightest nod to the original movie's excellent theme song. Sure, I didn't expect Frankie Lane crooning as Crowe rode across the screen, but just a hint of the melody in an instrumental form would have been the least the film makers could have done to admit: Yes, this story wasn't ours, it has been done before. A sort of homage. Instead, it seems as if the soundtrack tries very hard to distance itself from the original.

Which, in retrospect, it perhaps should, because it just doesn't live up. Once again, if you like modern westerns, this one is fair to midlin'. But the title makes real fans of the genre expect a lot more.

1592744,4,B00005JPXP,"In this world, it is getting harder to tell the good guys from the bad.

We live in a world in which ""good"" nations bomb ""evil"" nations into rubble and passivity.
And the corner crook lends money at a lower interest rate than the bank.

In ""3:10 to Yuma"" we are rudely introduced to a burning barn that belongs to an impoverished and beleagued rancher whose cattle wouldn't ""feed a sick dog.""
The landowner wants this man off the land so it can be sold to the railroad. So he burns the barn and bullies the tenant.

In town, the sheriff sells his lot to the Pinkertons who are intent of shutting down Ben Wade and his outlaws. So far, Wade has robbed 21 stage coaches and the deaths are mounting with Wade's gang loose.

Into this mounting mix of ambiguity comes Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the struggling rancher. He's a former Union soldier who lost a leg in the war. He's tried everything to help the family ranch survive. Now he is willing to sell his wife's pin to get another couple of months' time. The lender tosses the pin back to Dan. ""Sometimes a man's gotta be big enough to know how small he is.""

When he signs on to the posse taking Ben Wade to a far-off train for prison and execution, Dan Evens only knows he needs the $200. He doesn't stop to consider the evil he is now working for.

What unfolds is a slow and biting conversation about good. And evil.
The good guy, Peter Fonda, taking Wade back to prison has killed Indian men, women and children and countless others in pursuit of justice. ""I never killed anyone who didn't need killing,"" Fonda drawls to Wade. ""Apparently, God doesn't like Apaches,"" Wade responds, thinking about Indian toddlers still crying when they were tossed into a ditch to die; Wade is smug and secure in the knowledge that even he is not yet in the same league with Fonda as a killer.

The Pinkerton agent Grayson Butterfield, played by the superb Dallas Roberts, is in unyielding pursuit of Wade and his gang and shows arrogance and robot-like dedication to his job.
The Pinkerton man mentions the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost to the Wade gang's plunder of the Butterfield line. Wade looks at Butterfield and makes notice that Butterfield never once mentioned how many men have died protecting stage coach money.

Ben Foster, as Charlie Prince, stole this movie.
He's a cold-blooded killer but can smile like a choir boy and then calmly extract information from a man as that man burns in a padlocked stage coach.
But with Charlie Prince, there is no ambiguity. No grayness. This is rock-hard evil. With Charlie you know where he stands.

Watch this movie with an eye for irony and ambiguity and a constantly malfunctioning moral compass.
It is astounding that a ""Western"" can delve so deep into the question of what is good or evil and how we perceive those qualities and how some men learn to live with both. And do it so expertly in the guise of a straight-ahead Western.

We think we know good or evil. But in the end, we are left to wander this earth like Dan Evans, bewildered and grasping for another chance, even if we have to make a Faustian deal and put our ethics away until times get better.

""3:10 to Yuma"" is a marvel of storytelling, character development and, ultimately, a runaway train that crashes into our psyche and disrupts our views.",1253232000,3,3314,4.543624161073826
1592745,4,B00005JPXP,"""3:10 to Yuma"" is a Western film, directed by James Mangold of ""Walk the Line"" fame. The film is also a remake of the 1957 Delmer Daves film, which I haven't seen. Well, this is what I have read before watching the film, but what really interested me most was the name of the original story's writer - Elmore Leonard

Based on the 1953 Elmore Leonard short story ""Three-Ten to Yuma,"" the new film adaptation follows the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), an impoverished small-time rancher living in Arizona. When an outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is arrested at the nearby town, Dan takes up the dangerous job of delivering the captured outlaw to the train (a 3:10 departure to Yuma) with the guards including Pinkerton agent Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) for 200 dollars. But Ben's henchman led by the ruthless Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) may attack at any moment to retrieve Ben and kill the rest of all.

James Mangold's ""3:10 to Yuma"" tries to be a character-driven drama and action-packed Western at the same time. The changing relation between Dan Evans and Ben Wade plays a pivotal role in the tense storyline that is filled with plot twists, and as if to emphasize the tension, actions (including a Gatling gun) are often bloody and violent.

But what makes the film so wonderful is the compelling acting from the cast, especially the two charismatic leads Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Their fascinating performances have made the complex characters possible. After all this is Elmore Leonard's world in which there is no simple good or evil, and you need someone with genuine talent and experience to realize that.

1592812,5,B00005JPXP,"I guess we've become desensitized to great, old-time movie-making in the past decades. New generations are growing up on 'in-your-face' sex, splatter [of blood and everything else] & silliness from Hollywood with the new gen deluded with pretense, propaganda and programming. All of this, of course, propagated by technnology and the always #1 culprit: $money$. Originality being at a nadir, same-old themes are being rehashed and remakes are rampant. That's why I was not too happy with the idea of 3:10 TO YUMA [1957], one of my favorite Westerns of all time [with one of my favorite actors of all time, Glenn Ford], being redone. I even scoffed at the idea of Russell Crowe playing the critical lead, terribly miscast, I thought. However, 3:10 TO YUMA [2007] is a GREAT film and the best Western since the underappreciated TOMBSTONE [1993]. Incredibly, what I thought would be it's weak point, casting, was its greatest asset. Wow! What a wonderfully, skillfully selected group of actors this was. Stars to Lisa Beach and Sarah Katzman for their search and director James Mangold for the final thumbs up. Crowe, who played lead Ben Wade, was a more versatile character than Glenn Ford was in the orig as the leader of a gang of murdering cut-throats who is captured and translocated to the town of Contention to be put on a train that will take him to Yuma Prison. There are a couple of problems, though. One problem is that Wade's gang is gonna make sure their ""Boss"" doesn't get on that train. The othe prob is that the law has to scrounge for volunteers to escort Wade across the unforgiving plains---the escort eventually consisting of a small group of rickety, untested, unproven locals that include the town veterinarian [Doc Potter] and a guy with one leg. Awesome, as Peter Fonda [EASY RIDER, 1969] is dredged from the depths for this one and plays a tough-as-nails Pinkerton agent. Dallas Roberts [as Mr Butterfield], who I knew nothing about before this, is simply marvelous and perfect as the head of the money-transfering stagecoach company that Wade is plundering and depleting. He's paying major bucks for these guys to get Wade on that train. Christian Bale [as Dan Evans] plays a down-on-his-luck family man, both wife and oldest kid getting on his case, who is on the verge of losing his house and farm because of lack of $. He's the guy with one leg, lost it in the war, and his self-image is pretty ebbed out right now. Bale's wooden countenance and whispering, gravelly voice are optimal for his role as the chronically demoralized father & husband who can't seem to provide for his family. He is obviously picking up a gun and coming on this one. The major casting coup here is Ben Foster who plays Wade's #1, Charlie Prince. This is one all-time GREAT supporting performance. Foster is captivating as the focused but sadistic psychopath with the mesmerizing eyes who stops at nothing to get Wade back. A very atypical villian, though, as he is short, slight of build, has a low-pitched voice and seems almost androgynous. Yet it works! Great creative & innovative casting and direction AND great acting by the has-to-go-places Foster.  Logan Lerman, who plays Bale's older 15 year old son William, is terrific. Frustrated and scared, he is constantly critical of his dad yet follows the motley escort against orders when he feels the group is undermanned. His countenance and eyes alone spoke volumes and I doubt anyone could have been any better in this important role. The dialogue between Bale and his tenuously supportive wife, before he leaves to escort Wade, is moving. Ya gotta hear this---great script. Crowe, like Ford in the orig, uses smarts, smoothness [glibness] and savy to try to talk his way out of being put on that train. But, unlike Ford's persona, Ben Wade in this one is also no-bones-about-it  evil as nicely depicted by Crowe's hair-raising picketing of Kevin Durand's [Tucker] throat while the latter lay asleep in the middle of the night. This gruesome act occurs after poor Tuck annoyingly keeps Wade up most of the night with a ""...gonna hang me in the mornin"" lullaby. Not a good idea. The guy gets skewered. This one scene is unforgettable. Got to see it yourself. Luke Wilson, Owen's bro, has an AWESOME cameo here as a red-neck, yellow-toothed miner. He's torturing Wade, who got away from the escort, when Doc implores, ""you can't do that, that's immoral"", & Luke replies ""..moral ain't got a damned thing to do with it.."". Best delivery in the entire movie--thanks, Luke. Doc's heroics bails them out of this mess with the revenge-seeking miners but he is sadly killed as they escape. The escort finally gets Wade to Contention where they hole up in a hotel and are joined by the local  Marshal and his deps. The latter, though, look scared from the beginning and get the hell out of there when Wade's ""bunch of animals"" arrive, led by Prince. It becomes time for Butterfield to renounce all attempts to get Wade on the train when Prince publically puts a bounty on their heads and the gang executes the surrendering Marshal and his deputies. It's now just Bale and Crowe. Despite Butterfield's pleas to abort and still get paid Bale, who knows the only sure way to save his home, farm and family is more money, decides to go through with the deal but for more $$ and a guarantee that his family and farm are protected. He also asks Butterfield to take his son safely back. Nice repartee between Wade and William in the hotel as it's time to separate. Bale is aware the best legacy he can leave his fam is his courage, conviction [moral and ethical] & their home rather than risk certain dissolution of his family and marriage with things as they are. Has a lot to prove to himself, also. Tough journey from hotel to train station for Bale and Wade with the pings + pangs of gunfire everywhere--Prince and the boys right on top of them. William industrious  at the end trying to help his dad. Heart-wrenching end for Bale and surprising resolution between ""rescued"" Wade and his gang. Nifty finish with Wade putting himself on the train headed for Yuma to consummate Bale's mission then whistling for his horse that follows. This was a GREAT film. Interesting how through his tumultuous translocation  Wade came to admire the strength, courage and principles of his broken but stalwart captor and came to abhor his gang's spurious [strength-in-numbers] effrontery and lack of inner bark [mental strength]. It may have become apparent that Dan Evans probably had more guts than any one man in his crew. Crowe underplayed his role marvelously and was a joy to watch. I laud James Mangold for giving us a magnificent Western. A film that still respected the original 3:10 without demeaning it and, actually, giving us a little more. A film that was skillfully,  and imaginatively cast with  OUTSTANDING supporting acting at all levels---the latter probably a result of great direction, great respect for  superstar Crowe and simply having superbly talented actors. I hope this great remake will motivate many to watch the original 3:10 which had its own singular features and merits and two great, forgotten stars-- Glenn Ford & Van Heflin.",1246579200,3,7195,4.824959481361426

With both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, this is a powerful film with a supporting cast which blends together in a beautiful tapestry. Peter Fonda is outstanding as the aging Pinkerton Detective.

Forget about the typical good and bad guys.  There are no black and white stereotypes.

In essence, this is a story of two men -Ben Wade, the desperate desperado with a heart and Dan Evans, a veteran of the Civil War struggling to survive in the Arizona Desert.  The reason why Evans farms a desolate piece of land is one of the touching moments in this film as well as when Evans answers Wade's question about how he lost his leg in the war.

What happens to these two men throughout the film is what is so compelling.  Of course, there are gunfights, very good gunfights.

Glenn Ford, playing against type as super-cool, super bad guy Ben Wade, delivered a powerful performance. Van Heflin, as reluctant hero Dan Evans, may have appeared timid, but there was really no doubt that he would earn his stripes by the end of the movie.

There are a few passages in the 2007 remake that clone the original screenplay (such as when Wade ""settles up"" with Evans in the bar). But there are moments where you know that Crowe and Bale are going for a new dynamic between the characters, and if you want to watch this as a ""new"" movie (which it's not), you might be able to get past that.

Specifically, I'm referring to the campfire scene, where Crowe is on his back, laughing, spitting out blood and singing ""They're going to hang me in the morning...""

...I'm looking at Crowe, and I'm looking at Bale, and I'm thinking ""This is Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"" (and not because he's two feet away from ""Batman,"" either).

Ford's Ben Wade was crazy like a fox, but by no means crazy. Crowe doesn't pull off Ford's level of nuance and irony, but then again, he doesn't make the attempt.

The premise of the story, a son who doesn't show much respect for his father and the father that eventually does want that respect and will go to any lengths to prove to his son he is not weak, is different from most of the westerns I've seen and I guess that's why the movie gets a 4 star rating from me.

1592852,2,B00005JPXP,"When Dan Evans, one-legged Civil War veteran and impoverished rancher is having one of his barns burned down by his landlord and about to be evicted because he is unable to pay the rent, things seem credible enough. But soon, ""3:10 to Yuma"" stops making any sense at all. For starters, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his gang of cut-throats have little trouble in stopping a stagecoach protected by a crackerjack team of heavily armed guards contracted by the Pinkertons. To boot, the stagecoach is equipped with the new-fangled Gatling (machine) gun. Despite the heavy artillery, the escort is no match for Wade and his boys with the help of a sharpshooter in the hills who never misses. Okay, then there's the leader of the Pinkerton group, Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) who's entrusted to deliver the stagecoach cache of money to a nearby town. When Wade's psychopathic lieutenant Charlie Prince (convincingly played by Ben Foster) shoots McElroy point blank in the stomach, he doesn't die but merely doubles over.

Although Wade is supposed to be this crazy outlaw responsible for a string of outlandish heists and murders, he really isn't that bad--he's one of those touchy-feely bad guys with a chivalrous heart underneath. Inexplicably, he lets McElroy live. But just to show that he also has a dark side, murders one of his own men when a surviving member of the stagecoach posse takes the man hostage (Wade shoots both men). Wade first meets Evans and his two kids who have been watching the robbery of the stagecoach from afar. Even though they're witnesses to his nefarious deeds, Wade lets them go and apologetically takes their horses and lets them know where they can find them later. Even though Wade is supposed to be this brilliant criminal, he's easily trapped by local law enforcement after he tarries too long in the town with a barmaid he suddenly has the hots for.

Instead of locking Wade up locally and paying for a more professional team of law enforcement or Federal soldiers to help him, Grayson Butterfield, the Southern Pacific Railroad's representative, decides to conscript Evans, McElroy and a couple of other miscreants to march Wade through hostile Indian territory where they can catch the '3:10 to Yuma' and have him transported to where he can be put on trial. Their plan is to first stop off at the Evans ranch where they create a diversion, making Wade's gang believe that they're taking Wade in a stagecoach in the opposite direction but actually have Wade remain at the ranch where he has a nice but long-winded conversation with Wade's impressionable wife. Even though they're all afraid of the mighty power of Wade's men (with the memory of the defeat of the Pinkerton group fresh in their minds), they believe this particular stagecoach can outrun the gang all the way to a local fort. Sure enough, the gang outruns the coach, kills all the drivers and chains the Wade decoy inside the stagecoach and burns him to death. What a brilliant plan! On the way through the aforementioned hostile Indian territory, McElroy keeps chugging along despite having been shot point blank in the stomach. Wade kills McElroy after we learn that McElroy was not such a good guy after all (he murdered a bunch of Apache women and children in cold blood). Somehow every time Wade kills someone it's justified because his victims are far more morally tainted than he (Wade kills another one of the posse escorting him after we learn that this is the man who was principally responsible for burning Evan's barn down).

By the time we reach the town of Contention where the 3:10 to Yuma is about to arrive, we realize that all the townspeople are a bunch of cowards who are willing to accept $200 a pop by Wade's gang to kill Evans and the local sheriff and deputies who have volunteered to help Butterfield. Not only are all the townspeople in Contention browbeaten but the sheriff and his deputies also surrender their weapons to the gang (only to be blown away seconds later). You can watch one of the extras on the DVD and discover that some of the most notorious outlaws in the history of the old west were taken down by the local citizenry who were outraged by their antics. But not so here in '3:10 to Yuma'. When Evans singlehandedly attempts to move Wade to the train station where he can put him in the prison car, Wade cooperates and never tries to run away. Wade's gang fires round after round at BOTH Evans and Wade without regard to hitting their boss. Finally, when Charlie shoots Evans at the climax of the movie, Wade suddenly becomes a man of conscience and finishes off Charlie and the rest of his gang and then places himself in the prison car without batting an eyelash.

If you watch the DVD Extras, you'll get a fascinating look at how they put this movie together. There's some nice cinematography, passable performances and costumes but many of the scenes are incredibly drawn out (Wade's conversation with Evans's wife at the homestead and conversation with Evans at the hotel for example) and as I have already argued, a plot that makes little sense. Given the money that was put into this project, strictly from a writing standpoint, '3:10' is a decided failure!",1236988800,6,5208,4.770509977827051

Russell Crowe and Christian Bale make an absolute meal of these roles, like titans vying for supremacy. I have seen the original movie, and folks, while it has it's charm, the craft of acting and moviemaking has clearly come a ways since those days.

Ben Wade (Crowe) an infamous, ruthless outlaw, caught out in a nostalgic dalliance falls into the hands of irate city officials. The local banker, counting his losses, insists Wade be seen to hang via a federal judge, and hastily contracts a rag-tag posse of volunteers for the delivery. Their big payday of course, get this seasoned murderer out of town ahead of his gang, through hostile territory and on the 3:10 (prison) train to Yuma, alive.

The exception in the bunch is a war-injured, downtrodden farmer named Dan Evans (Bale), a family man risking a desperate gamble on the chance to restore his precarious cattle ranch, and something of his pride with it.

In a diversionary tactic, the prison stagecoach is sent on and the group delays Wade at Evan's homestead, leaving Evans and family awkwardly, yet graciously playing host to an arch criminal. On departure, Wade cynically thanks his hostess with hopes he can return her husband unharmed.

Along the journey to the 3:10, the true gravity of the mission begins to unfold. Wade's bloodthirsty gang is alerted, and hot on the trail. Bandit and Indian attack loom constantly. If that weren't enough, even handcuffed, the prisoner begins coolly eliminating his captors, in order of their apparent offensiveness to him. Entertaining himself with their paranoia, Wade plays them off against each other, even wryly enjoying the heavy beatings that accrue.

Yet, in the midst of a night ambush he vanishes, mows through the attackers unaided, then restores himself into ""custody""- still in handcuffs. What on earth is going on here? Especially when Evans, hobbled and underqualified, and seemingly the main target of Wade's disdain...somehow never seems to find harm's way.

By the end of this movie, I was quite affected by the predicament of a jaded killer who seems vulnerable to nothing, except the courageous heart of one honest man who will stake it all on something an outlaw never had, or clearly understood.",1236211200,6,2519,4.983333333333333

1592858,2,B00005JPXP,"The western is the 'genre that wouldn't die'. Every time it seems that nothing more can be said by a man in a cowboy hat, along comes a 'Dances With Wolves', an 'Unforgiven', or a 'Deadwood' to prove everybody wrong. This year brings two major westerns to the big screen: 3:10 To Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James. Both are A-list, straight up genre exercises that threaten to re-ignite the western as a pertinent American film milieu. Both will probably fail; and I say this without glee because I happen to love westerns.

3:10 To Yuma is a remake of a Glenn Ford film from about '57. I never saw the original, which means most people never saw it, which means it's a perfect film to remake. (Unlike many film geeks, I'm all for remaking flawed or forgotten films.) And this looks like homerun material right out of the gate. James Mangold, coming off a fine Johnny Cash bio seems poised for a top-notch crowd-pleaser, assembles a dream cast. Hell, any film starring Russell Crowe is worth seeing. But Russell Crowe and Christian Bale... holy crap! It's a must-see just to watch these guys share the screen. Put these two in a classic shoot-em-up, and how can you go wrong? Here's how.

Bale plays Dan Evans, a crippled, down-on-his-luck rancher, who volunteers, for pay, to help escort a captured gang leader, Ben Wade to a train that will take him to Yuma prison. Along for the ride is Dan's teenage son who loathes his father, and obviously admires the charismatic Wade. Dan's challenge is to deliver Wade alive, before Wade's gang, led by the surprisingly effective Ben Foster, catch up with them, rescue their beloved leader; and kill everybody else. During the perilous journey, Dan and Wade develop a strange connection; the two men seem to really understand one another, though Wade is obviously manipulating Dan all the way. This relationship, in fact, is the heart of the film. And watching Bale and Crowe play their scenes, one gets the feeling that you're watching two of the finest screen actors in the business; it's like listening to Miles Davis jam with John Coltrane. Pure joy! For the first two acts of Yuma, the interaction between these two guys is so great, it's well worth the price of admission. Then, it all collapses so spectacularly, that the whole thing just leaves a terrible taste in your mouth; like eating a delicious feast that gives you food poisoning.
What goes wrong?

Let me backtrack. All film genres go through evolution. The breakdown goes something like this: Adolescence (in the case of the Western let's site John Ford's Stagecoach, or Hawks' Red River), Adulthood (Winchester 73, Shane), Maturity (The Searchers, Liberty Valance), Experimentation (Leone's films and 'professional westerns'), and Revisionism (McCabe & Mrs. Miller, El Topo), and - it could be argued - Irrelevance (Young Guns). Once a genre goes through this evolution, a filmmaker is free to apply their genre film to any stage of that evolution. Clint Eastwood's career is a good example of this: his first Western, Hight Plains Drifter falls in the Experimental range; The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven are Mature, and Pale Rider is Adult. 3:10 To Yuma, as such, is an Adult Western and it never really pushes that boundary; never tries to press into a Mature stage and certainly not into the Experimental stage. And that's OK. In fact, it's good. But what happens at the end of the film simply abandons every genre convention along with the films own internal logic in favor of... well, frankly I'm not sure what. Throwing out genre tropes and conventions must serve a purpose. Here, it serves none; the twists and surprises ring hollow and result in nothing but disappointment.

The last 10 minutes of 3:10 To Yuma is absurd. The characters, so skillfully established in the first two acts, suddenly start behaving like some other guys. Wade becomes very noble; willing to risk his life for no good reason (when a simple shout to his cronies would resolve the whole dilemma). And Dan becomes downright suicidal. All of these changes are, tentatively explained with unconvincing bits of dialogue and minor revelations that barely make sense. On top of this mess Mangold throws in a big shoot-em-up chase scene that makes no sense physically or thematically; and finishes it all off with an even more ridiculous character turnaround coupled with the most pointless death of a main character I've seen in decades. Basically, a disaster of an ending that sours the artistry of what came before. It's hard to recall the last time I saw a film that so fundamentally shoots itself in the foot. A real shame.",1233360000,5,4628,4.847029077117573

For the longest time, I'd never really been in to Westerns. They were kinda' cool from an action standpoint, but I rarely saw films of this genre concentrate on the characters. Unforgiven is probably the only other Western I could say I really, really liked. Then I saw the 2007 remake of 3:10 to Yuma. For me personally, if I had to make a choice between style and substance, I'll just about always take substance first (though, I certainly don't mind style, depending on who's creating it). In 3:10, we have two fascinating tales, 1) a man striving to be more for his family than what he'd become, and 2) the story of a supposed cutthroat outlaw, who in the end, wasn't such a bad guy after all. Prior to seeing this for the first time ever (which was well after it's theatrical run and on to Blu-ray), I had no clue this was even up for Oscar nominations. But, I can certainly see why with such a competent script, great storytelling, and even greater characters played impeccably by Bale and Crowe. I particularly enjoyed watching the chemistry that grew between them as the film progressed, which was elaborated upon even better due to their opposing personalities (Evans being the giver, and Wade being the taker). In fact, there were many a scene that I'd like to say I found thoroughly heroic and almost inspiring, in a sort of bittersweet retrospect, but at the expense of not ruining some of the more dramatic plot twists, I'll leave the viewing to you, the audience. The film presents a terrific balance of action, drama, and character development, all while being very realistic to the old west in terms of design and production. Aesthetically speaking, I'd probably go so far as to call it the best looking Western to date. Critically, I'd almost put it as one of my all-time favorite films, but I thought the overall length was just a tad too short for all the material to really stick with me by film's end. It sure does have its replay value, though (I've seen it 4 times now at the time of this review, and it hasn't lost a step).

Video - 4.5

For the most part, 3:10 does an excellent job in terms of maintaining sharpness, contrast, and especially blacks. Dark images always tend to stick out the most to me on Blu-rays, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well night time scenes held up in this effort. The only problems I noticed were a few shots here and there that displayed extreme amounts of grain, though in very, very quick intervals (maybe 1 or 2 seconds at most). I think it may have been a result of photography/visual effects, as opposed to the encode itself. But on top of that, I also noticed a few day scenes where closeups would some times become soft. Again, I'm not sure if this was a part of the photography or encode, as some shots do a lot of focus change, but it's hard to tell because of transition speed and the pace of the movie itself.

Audio - 5.0

Lionsgate continues to impress me with their job on audio encoding. Presented with an uncompressed PCM 7.1 track, 3:10 does a perfect job of directionality and ambiance, putting dialogue, sound effects, and a catchy score by Marco Beltrami to their full potential. Being a Western, you can expect a few gunshots, horse galloping, and several instances of boot/spur on wood/dirt. To put it bluntly, you will not be disappointed. All sounds meld together flawlessly with no dropouts, distortions, or channel intrusions (<-- reference quality).

Extras - 4.0

Depending on the film, I'm always up for some well-made special features. I actually don't care too much for commentary, as I'd rather just watch the movie, so I can't tell you what it was like on this particular effort. I did, however, take a look at everything else. Basically you have a few segments covering the production side of 3:10, then a couple of other mini documentaries covering the history of the old west (in this case, the mythology of the outlaw and the emergence of the Transcontinental Railroad). I enjoyed the production segments, but personally found the history ones a little more on the bland side (I was never good at history in school, and I'm actually not even that fond of Western culture, to be honest). But if you're in to that sort of coverage, it's not too bad for the 40 minutes they give you. All extras are in HD, by the way.

Overall - 4.5

Being one of the few Westerns I really enjoyed and probably the best LOOKING of its genre to date, 3:10 to Yuma is an excellent movie worthy of its Oscar-nominated efforts. James Mangold directs a fabulous group of actors led by Christian Bale and Russell Crowe that both entertains and provides a subtle look into sociology that some still argue exists today. With a near perfect video transfer, a flawless audio encode, and very in depth special features, 3:10 comes highly recommended to anyone looking to add not just a well-made Western, but a genuinely gripping film into their collections.",1233273600,3,4944,4.61547212741752

1592918,5,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma is an update of the 1957 movie that's in turn an interpretation of a 1953 Western short story by Elmore Leonard. The 1957 movie cleverly tweaked the Western, inverting the white hats/black hats trope at a time when the genre was chiefly focused on morality.  And yet while it flirted with the notion that good guys can be bad and bad guys can be good, it wasn't really willing to go so far as to make the characters more than lovable rogues.  So perhaps it was inevitable in the era of Westerns like Unforgiven where the West is an unpleasant, unfair place, that the latest incarnation of 3:10 to Yuma is both more brutal and more fanciful than its predecessor.

The story follows Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and his family, a lame Civil War veteran on a struggling ranch.  He has been borrowing money and time from Glen Hollander, a landowner who is more interested in moving Evans' ranch than getting paid.  As played by Bale, Evans is a desperate man - as weathered and bitter as a piece of broken leather. He yearns for the respect of his wife and two sons.  And when he crosses paths with outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), Evans sees his chance.

Wade is a gentleman outlaw.  Suave, violent, and dressed in black, he leads a ragtag band of murderers who will stop at nothing to get the gold, as exemplified by a daring raid on a stagecoach guarded by a gatling gun. Never mind that the gatling gun's weight would make it an impractical accessory for a stagecoach, or that the noise from the gun would most certainly spook the horses.
Given the opportunity to deliver Wade for a bounty, Evans is determined to bring him to justice.  At first, it's just for the money, but it becomes clear that it's for more than that - it's to regain a measure of respect, for himself and from his family. Wade comes to like Evans, a man of conviction and courage that he finds lacking in his own gang.  When Evans' son William (Logan Lerman) tags along, Wade develops a deeper appreciation for the father/son bond. Through a variety of travails that include Wade's outlaw past coming back to haunt him, the two become brothers in arms.

By the time they get to Yuma, it's clear Wade isn't easily captured or confined; he repeatedly escapes and brags that Yuma prison won't be able to hold him either.  So he's literally going along for the ride in the hopes of a happy ending for all: giving Evans his life back and Wade going free once more.  That's where the similarities between the movies end.  The finale is a gut punch that ratchets up the stakes.

A strong Hollywood Western streak runs through 3:10 to Y uma, starting with the aforementioned gatling gun on a stagecoach. Wade wears a black hat.  Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), Wade's right-hand man, twirls his pistols.  And for all the talk about Evans being lame, he only occasionally limps - he can shoot, run, and ride with the best of them.

As a realistic depiction of the Wild West, 3:10 to Yuma falls short.  But as a meditation on good and evil that gives its actors an opportunity to showcase their considerable talents, Yuma hits its mark ... right between the eyes.",1232496000,2,3133,4.523049645390071
1592919,5,B00005JPXP,"I've never been a Western fanatic.  I'll watch one occasionally, but am not an avid watch and can't claim to have seen all the classic Western's.  I also hadn't seen the original 1957 version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" so I am not comparing this to the original.

With all those asides, I loved this movie and thought it was brilliantly done.  For starters, the cinematography was stellar, but it certainly would not be a good sign for a modern Western to have poor cinematography.  The acting was top notch, by both by stars, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, but was surprisingly strong by the supporting characters like Ben Foster and Alan Tudyk, as Charlie Prince and Doc Potter respectively.  Additionally, Peter Fonda delivered a first rate performance as Byron McElroy and Logan Lerman had a breakthrough performance as Dan Evan's (Christian Bale) son.

Dan Evan's, a Union soldier with an amputated leg has moved to Arizona after the Civil War for the warm, dry climate to help his son's medical condition.  Him and his family are struggling to survive and his chance to help his family arrives in the form of Ben Wade.  Wade and his band of outlaws are thugs prowling the Wild West for coaches to steal and thieve.  When Ben Wade is finally captured, Evan's offers to help transport him to be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma and be brought to justice.  His reward is $200 and the chance to help his struggling family.

As we follow the transport of Wade, Evans and the rest of the group encounter the usual trouble with Indians and other obstacles.  But what really sets this apart is the tension and interplay among Bale and Crowe.  The dichotomy of the two characters on the surface is obvious -- soldier, family man, father and honest man and outlaw, womanizer and conniver -- creates a great deal of contrast and tension that the actors execute flawlessly.  Without giving anything away, the final shootout and last scene delivered as well as anything I would expect or want in a Western.

1592923,5,B00005JPXP,"This remake has little in common with the 1957 Glenn Ford classic of the same name.

  The basic story is identical: Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a hardscrabble rancher, down on his luck, trying to make a go of his dusty, drought-ridden ranch. He has borrowed from Hollander who wants Evans off the land so the railroad will buy it. (This doesn't make a lot of sense since the railroads were awash in federal land given to them.) Hollander has cut off Evans' water and Evans is desperate. Evans has but one leg, the other lost in the Civil War and a 14 year old son, William (Logan Lerman) who doesn't respect him.

  Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is a bandit and a killer, a totally cold-blooded killer. Assisted by his second-in-command Charlie Prince (brilliantly played by Ben Foster), Wade's gang pulls off a daring, bloody robbery of a stagecoach carrying a big payroll.

  Evans happens to become briefly involved. Although we've just seen Wade and his gang shoot down bunch of people, they let Evans and his two sons go. This is our first hint of Wade's humanity.

  The gang goes to the nearby town of Bisbee. Evans goes there looking for Hollander and instead finds humiliation - and Wade. Wade is captured and Evans accepts the offer of a $200 reward for getting Wade to prison.

  Now begins the cat-and-mouse game between captive and captors. Wade is intelligent, charming and disturbingly alternates between psychopathic violence and saving the day for those of his captors he doesn't kill. It's really strange.

  Ultimately it comes down to the down-to-earth integrity of Evans and the blandishments offerd by the wilely Wade.

  The story is far from the simplicity of the largely this-is-good, this-is-bad line of the original. In fact, on occasion, the storyline strikes very discordant tones and feels more like a contemporary Los Angeles streets story.

  Overall, there is little of the classic Western genre in this film, save men riding horses and shooting guns. There is none of of the nobility John Ford invested his Westerns with or the balletic nihilist violence of Sam Peckinpah. This is a strained morality tale with Western trappings.

  It is, however, an excellent film. Crowe and Bale deliver standout performances. Ben Foster as Wade's obediant, murderous subordinate is chilling. Even Peter Fond turns in a good performance as the old bounty hunter who has been after Wade for decades.

  So approach this remake without consideration of the original and you'll probably greatly enjoy it. If, on the other hand, you are looking for faithful adherence to the original, you won't find it here.

It takes a lot of chutzpah to take a classic and think you can hype it up and make it better. The result in this case made it highly improbable, with characters playing with and ""fanning"" their sixguns. Anyone who has ever fired a handgun knows it's hard enough to hit your target while aiming, let alone fanning, something that is strictly old Hollywood-ish. Then the one ""main"" villian playing with his sixguns, constantly drawing and reholstering them--another Hollywood improbability. Further, the only way this movie's ending could have been even more absurd is if Crowe's character, Ben Wade, had made a noose and hanged himself. I also felt very sorry for Wade's horse trying to pursue that 3:10 to Yuma without running itself to death. I love westerns. If you want to view behavior that was more likely in those days, see ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Open Range"" for starters. Then take a trip to Tombstone, AZ, and see the realistic reenactment of the OK Corral gunfight, which took about 30 seconds, not minutes, with participants standing so close to one another that they could almost have clubbed each other to death. Further, only fools came to those battles without a weapon already in their hand, as opposed to seeing who could draw and fire fastest. Their goal was staying alive and not showing off to see who was the fastest draw.

Those that thought this mostly hokey movie was realistic should stick to watching the old Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy movies and other contrived ""Mother Goose"" fairy-tale westerns where almost everyone wore ""Buscadero"" rigs which didn't exist until developed for 1940s Hollywood Westerns. Further, I don't understand what one reviewer means by ""trigger[ing] his gun by thumb""? How awkward it would be to use your thumb on the trigger unless one is trying to shoot themselves--which I almost expected Ben Wade to do at the hilarious end. And, saying ""Fanning was mostly for speed...[sic] not accuracy, like cover fire,"" which is so ridiculous that I had to LOL. Cover fire? Those were SIX-shooters, and the typical gunbelt in those days only had room for another 24-rounds--except maybe those of Andy Devine's girth. It's not like they are using modern M-4 assault refles with several 30-round magazines.

If you read up on history of the American West, you will find that those who were successful (i.e., survived) relied on accuracy not speed. Or maybe you'd like TV's ""Heroes""-like Westerns with the cowboys wearing capes and flying rather than riding horses. If you like fairy-tales, better stick with Mother Goose. BTW, sixguns used for fanning by tricksters must have modified sears inasmuch as anyone who knows anything about single-action revolvers (such as the Colt Single Action Army) knows that fanning can cause the sear to break rendering the weapon as useless as those who think fanning is effective for providing covering fire. When all the ammo you have is 24 rounds, you can't provide a lot of covering fire unless you also have a Gattling gun at your disposal and a crew to reload the magazines. In addition, those who carried two handguns (which was rare) did not fire both at once as that couldn't be done with any degree of accuracy (except perhaps by reviewer M. Edgar). They did so because it lessened the chance of having to reload at some critical moment if they carried only one gun and were poor marksmen.

Reviewer Mercer, who takes no umbrage with improbablity, would have loved all the old John Wayne war movies (such as ""Sands of Iwo Jima"") in which, as USMC SGT Fran Striker, carried an M1 rifle that he was never seen reloading, and which would have been impossible anyway as he never had any ammo pouches or carried any bandoliers which was not uncommon in the old war movies.",1227830400,4,3974,4.848306332842415

1593001,4,B00005JPXP,"I'm not huge on westerns, but I eventually get around to 'em if word of mouth is good on this title or that.  And I heard good things about ""3:10 to Yuma"".  Also pulling me in was all the talent both in front of and behind the camera.  So was it good?  Yep.

Excellent scenery, excellent action (of both the realistic and ""big summer movie"" overblown-but-fun variety), and excellent characterizations make this one a must-see.  Simple as that.  Other reviews will give you more, but really, that's all you need to know.  Better to go into ""3:10 to Yuma"" without knowing every little thing about every little aspect of it.

Director James Mangold makes me smile, though.  He hates to send you out of the theater on a downer note (see ""Cop Land"", where he restores the deaf sheriff's hearing in the final moments).  So, although it seems in the final minute that one of the characters has learned something during the course of the movie and- a grim look on his face- will now accept his deserved fate, in the final five SECONDS of the film we essentially get a joke with a horse that thoroughly undoes that mood and sends the audience out with a chuckle.  Oh, well- the implications of that final, final ending are actually kind of grim, too (with the movie cynically observing that a dog can't change his spots), so I guess technically I can't complain that the closing moments aren't in tune with the grimmess preceding it.  And, make no mistake, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is pretty grim overall. But like the best westerns, the grim tone doesn't bring it down, but informs, complicates, and enriches the movie.

My standard DVD of ""3:10 to Yuma"" featured an excellent widescreen image and a glorious sound palette.  A handful of extras, concerning the movie itself and the period of history it covers, provided an hour or so of interesting viewing after the movie was over.

So, don't hesitate to buy your ticket and catch the ol' 3:10 to Yuma.  Just make sure you're ready to duck, 'cause the bullets will definitely be flyin'.",1227657600,,2019,4.610644257703081

A very poor attempt to duplicate a TRUE WESTERN CLASSIC ! They butchered the original story line and added way too much garb. This will make you want to see the original with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and appreciate it even more.

I had HIGH HOPES for this movie when I heard it was coming out. Too much HOLLYWOOD BS ruined this classic for the remake. The original classical music was missing as well.  I will not be adding this to my western collection.",1227657600,4,529,4.333333333333333

The plot follows the original just closely enough to please the old crowd yet adds twists enough to please the new.  It is more than just a remake, it adds more excitement and tension of the old western good-vs-evil motif.  Is the outlaw all bad or is there a seed of good deep down inside?  Both Crowe and Bale provide exceptional performances of two men on a quest to redemption.  One would have liked a little more character development perhaps - such as Crowe's character and the significance of the crucifix on his revolver handles.  However, the depth and passion of the portrayal gives such intensity that we are still drawn in to the story.  A wonderful retelling of an old west classic.",1227657600,,833,4.543624161073826

Intelligent script, and, although there's a lot of blood and gratuitous violence, it seems to be necessary to the story line. The ending run to the train station by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale is the only section that goes over the line toward unbelievability. I mean, dozens of shooters keep missing and missing. Right!

1593053,5,B00005JPXP,"Modern day westerns don't usually get much better than James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma, which manages to mix the perfect amount of suspense, action, and philosophy.  Russell Crowe stars as murderous outlaw Ben Wade, who is sought to be punished for his crimes and delivered to prison by broke rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and a small group of others.  Wade's gang is naturally on their trail, and for a majority of its two hour running time, 3:10 to Yuma manages to entertain and impress.  What's most impressive however is the surprising performance of Ben Foster as Wade's top man Charlie.  In a film featuring two powerhouse actors like Crowe and Bale, Foster manages to turn in a dynamite performance.  There's also smaller roles for Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Gretchen Mol, and Kevin Durand; but it's Crowe and Bale's show all the way.  All in all, 3:10 to Yuma is a spectacular blast that re-affirms my faith in the western genre getting proper justice paid to it in the 21st century, and if you're a fan of the genre or are just a fan of Bale and/or Crowe, this is wholeheartedly recommended.",1227398400,,1110,4.695876288659794
1593054,3,B00005JPXP,"My take on this movie is that some very good performances were devalued by the special effects people sitting in front of computer screens.  A tense psychological cat and mouse game begins with the capture of Russell Crowe who plays notorious outlaw Ben Wade.  A simple rancher Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale, volunteers to escort Wade to the train to Yuma prison in order to earn badly needed money for his rain-parched ranch.

This is a remake of the 1957 release of the same name starring Glenn Ford as Ben Wade and Van Heflin as Dan Evans.  Russell Crowe does his usual outstanding job.  Crowe is as excellent as a charming cowboy psychopath as he is as master and commander of a ship, a fearless gladiator, or a police thug turned noble.  Ben Foster is perfectly cast as Billy Prince, Wade's wild-eyed loyal to the death sidekick.  If you saw a fellow with his demeanor on a city street today you would be inclined to cross to the other side.

It is unfortunate that the makers of the film decided to go with special effects action to the detriment of the psychological in this movie.  Action and psychology are not mutually exclusive but they are out of balance in this movie.  The earlier version is incredible enough as Van Heflin shoots his way to the train with Ford in tow.  Putting Christian Bale's character on a peg leg goes beyond one's willingness to suspend disbelief.  The firepower depicted in this version is enough to invade Iraq again.

This version runs one-half hour longer than the 1957 edition in order to accommodate all of the extra violence.  There is a scene that was added to this version and not present in the earlier Glenn Ford version.  Crowe kills three Indians.  Though the script tries to justify the scene by having them take a short cut through dangerous ""Indian territory"" it is obviously not justifiable since Indians are never seen or discussed again.

""The Unforgiven"", the best of the modern cowboy genre, did not need as many (if any) computer-driven effects to tell a good tale of the old West. With such an excellent cast neither did ""3:10 to Yuma"".  Nice try, but computer gimmicks should always be subordinated to good performances.",1225238400,9,2187,4.695538057742782

1593057,4,B00005JPXP,"This is a remake of the 1957 film of the same name. Fortunately I saw the original last year, which is a minor classic itself. In general I don't like remakes, however this is well done and Russell Crowe again shows that when he wants to, he can be a terrific actor. Rather surprisingly I thought his performance overshadowed Christian Bale's, who is generally considered a better actor.

The story that Peter Ustinov used to tell of an actor he was working with is never more true than here. Ustinov was in the background in a shot, and the star of the movie turned to him and said ""what are you doing?"". Ustinov said ""I'm doing nothing"". The star said ""Oh no your not I'M DOING NOTHING"". That sort of sums of Russell Crowes performance. He doesn't do a lot, but his not doing a lot is actually very good!

The plot has been told over and over here so to keep it short, Ben Wade (Crowe) is a notorious criminal who has to be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma (where there is a prison). Dan Evans (Bale) is a struggling farmer who being desparate for money volunteers to help, knowing that Wades gang will be on their tail.

The major difference between this film and the original is the inclusion of Dan Evans son as a major character. I didn't think this did any harm, and in places it worked very well.

The single DVD has a few extras on it which are pretty good (commentary/deleted scenes). On the DVD case it says its the best western since Unforgiven. Whilst writing this review I was trying to think of any other westerns since Unforgiven and couldn't remember any... So if I've seen any they obviously didn't have a big impact. This film is by no means perfect but I have no problem recommending it.",1223164800,,1704,4.365930599369086

The all black wearing Crowe plays a bad guy very well, and I think this movie displays some of his best acting to date. Overall a pretty good action western.",1221955200,,481,4.670588235294118
1593060,4,B00005JPXP,"Good westerns (or any westerns, for that matter) are few and far between in Hollywood these days; not like the glory years of last century when they were always in the theaters. 3:10 to Yuma casts two very strong actors (Russell Crowe as Wade and Christian Bale as Evans) in the lead roles and each does a marvelous job at portraying their respective characters. (It's always good to see Bale in a non-Batman movie where his acting chops are put to far better use. Likewise, it was a pleasant surprise to see Crowe as a villain that is despicable, but at the same electric and interesting.)

The movie manages to marry dramatic and action events quite well, with not being too heavy in either category. The only real underdeveloped character is Evans' wife, though it is due in part to the nature of the story, which doesn't really involve her.

The chemistry between Evans and his eldest son seems tense at times, but adds a lot to the overall plot once you have completed your viewing. It goes back to the fact that Evans is faced with losing his farm as he doesn't have the money to pay for the loan and he doesn't stand up to the people trying to take it or burn it to the ground. His son is young and full of youthful notions of standing up to these men, but his father, a Civil War vet, is more passive, as he knows the horrors of battle. The tension ensues between father and son for the duration of the movie, ending in a satisfying climax.

Evans' passiveness is tested throughout as he meets Wade, who is Evans' polar opposite and full of aggressiveness, which on some level impresses Evans' son. Between Wade and Evans' son, Evans makes an internal journey from being passive to a gray area in between. The movie shows there is a fine line between being bad and being good, and Crowe's Wade relishes watching the internal confusion Bale's Evans goes through.

The supporting actors are good enough for their respective roles, such as Peter Fonda's Byron McElroy who matches wits with Wade in their scenes together. Also, Ben Foster's Charlie Prince comes across as a ruthless western villain that at times, even eclipses Wade's mercilessness.

The cinematography and score all accentuate the scope and feel of this western. At times it seems claustrophobic and at times it feels like an open range movie; neither is a bad thing as the claustrophobic moments lend to some of the better dramatic scenes and the open range ones showcase the action scenes.

Some call this movie a violent western, but no more than Pale Rider in the 80's and Unforgiven in the 90's. There's no over-the-top violence and most plays out as you'd imagine the characters behaving.

This movie kind of flew in under the radar and didn't stay in theaters long. It's a shame, because this is a very well produced western that isn't too long (2hrs.) and gives the viewer some great acting and action.",1221523200,,2882,4.6171875
1593120,5,B00005JPXP,"Now I will admit something right of the bat before I get into my review. I have only recently seen this movie and turned down a number of opportunities to watch this film simply because it is a western. I will now hold my hands up and say how wrong I was and after seeing the light I have to say, this has now taken over Pulp Fiction as my favourite movie EVER!!! From start to finish this film grabs hold of you and gives you a damn good shaking. The biggest point of this film is the general authenticity of it all. It seeks to give us a western movie for the modern film going generation without alienating those classic Western fans.

The story focuses around rancher Dan Evans, a man who's been struggling to make ends meet and has had his barn destroyed by a man to whom he owes money. One day after heading into the town of Bisbee to seek revenge or to resolve the situation, Dan witnesses a stagecoach robbery led by the infamous outlaw Ben Wade. Wade allows Dan and his two sons on their way but cross paths later in Bisbee when Ben is caught by the local law and Dan is asked to be a part of the escort for a $200 pay. Dan accepts and he now joins the other team to help transport Wade to the city of Conention to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma prison in which he'll be hanged for his crimes.

The way in which the story is told for the time that it takes place comes across as authentic. You can honestly imagine something like this taking place and these types of people existing in this particular time. Aside from the main cast, Ben Wades second in command, Charlie (Ben Foster) is played brilliantly. The callousness combined with the shooting skills make him a genuinely unsavoury character who, at times you really want to be taken down early in the film as I found myself not wanting to see what he'd do to our heroes if he ever caught up to them.

I've never been known as a fan of Crowe's, but alongside Bale he really shines and delivers an intense villain who on the outside appears cruel yet cunning, but we all feel that there's some good inside. I didn't know that this film was a remake from a 1957 film of the same name but from what I've heard it seems to keep true to the original. I will be watching the original soon to see how true it keeps or whether it is something completely different.

All I know is that this film is highly recommended by myself and I promise you'll love it.",1219968000,2,2411,4.212121212121212

His character is charming, caring, but yet still a bad guy, and you can't help but like him.  I laughed and cried watching it.  I would love to see a 3:10 to Yuma II, cause you just don't want it to end.  You won't feel like you wasted your time and money if you buy this movie!!

1593123,5,B00005JPXP,"An absolutely perfect western, I have tried to find something I dislike about this movie and I've come up with nothing. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are outstanding in this powerful reinvention of an already good film and story. Bale plays Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher and Civil War veteran looking for a way to prove himself to his family and earn enough money to buy his land in order to fend off the owner and his gang of thugs. Opportunity knocks when he earns the chance to transport a ruthless outlaw, Ben Wade, played to charming perfection by Russell Crowe, to a 3:10 train on its way to a prison in Yuma.

The journey is not a simple one as the outlaw outsmarts, outwits, and even seems unshaken by every member of his transport crew. While trying to keep ahead of Wade's fellow outlaws, the group also faces Indians and vigilantes.

The best stories are those in which the characters change and grow as the story unfolds. This is definitely true of this movie and Bale and Crowe show their characters' evolutions flawlessly. In the touching moment when Bale confesses the true motivation for his choices, everything changes for both men.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen and may even be my favorite western of all time.",1219017600,,1257,4.62780269058296

I do find it interesting to have an Australian and a British actor cast as leads in an American Western.  What won me over is the character arch for these characters.  I didn't see that Wade just suddenly liked Evans and wanted to help him out.  I saw a man who wanted to be caught-who wanted to be taken back to Yuma.  I got the sense that he was tired of the life.  In Evan, I think he saw who he wished his own father could have been and wondered if Evan had the conviction he thought he had.  I think he was moved by Evan's desire to finally be a man his family could be proud of-not just some wounded veteran who couldn't feed or provide for his family.  Once I recognized this layer connecting the men, I became intrigued.  Sure there are a couple places where you have to suspend disbelief-but I didn't mind it so much.  I think I'll now check out the original and compare.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this film.",1216857600,2,1072,4.150485436893204
1593125,4,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold uses the west as his prop, not to make a silly western, but, rather, to make a character study.
There are many characters worth following and analyzing. Some are developed better than others. The four that stand out as most deserving of the audiences attention are Dan Evans, a rancher down on his luck, with one leg, and representing the past as he resists the coming railroads; Ben Wade, the intelligent and sadistic leader of a ruthless gang; William Evans, son of Dan, dissapointed at his fathers mediocrity and a worshiper of Ben Wades' legend and no bs attitude; finally, Charles Prince, the evil second hand of the Wade gang, who has a little too much affection for Mr. Wade.

Ultimately, these four characters and their intertwined journeys make this movie the high quality, entertaining flick that it is. Dan and Ben are natural enemies. Dan is an old school moralist, with uncompromising principles. Ben is a hobbesian, taking what he wants and destroying anything that gets in his way. Yet, Wade is too intelligent and multifaceted to be pinned down into the cliched killer--Prince handles this role just fine. Ben shows signs of wishing for a family, wishing for something larger and more honorable than himself to believe in. While Dan for all of his moralistic bombast sees the fearlessness of Wade and wishes to imitate his kinetic energy and courage, even if this means turning into a killer. William, who is just 14, seems torn between respect for Ben Wade and love for his father.

As these characters interact with each other, the hammer molds a beautiful frame off the anvil.

Dan takes a job as a hired man to take Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma, where Wade will be hung. Wade obviously wishes not to meet his fate in Yuma, nor does his gang. Charles Prince, with his homoerotic obsession for Wade, will do anything to stop the transfer. In the end, we find out that whether or not Wade gets on the train is irrelevant, but it does make for a shockingly thought provoking western.

There are many action packed scenes, and the gun fights are good, which all make for a great western. On the flip side...the plot gets pretty complex, and the storyline is hard to follow at times.

1593214,5,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma is a terrific remake of a classic American western. Christian Bale (great as always) is Dan, a pathetic rancher who, in desperate need of money, enlists in a posse to escort ruthless train robber Ben Wade (Russell Crowe, also turning in a noteworthy performance) to a town aptly called Contention and put him aboard the 3:10 train headed for Yuma prison. As their party endures losses of life and courage, Dan receives greater and greater incentive to abandon the mission. Like a lot of great American Westerns, the story here deals pretty directly with ideals like Honor, Justice, and Loyalty. But make no mistake, this is a modern movie; the action is fast-paced and exciting, the violence is realistic, and the production values are top-notch.

The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is phenomenal, although that mostly means you'll want to put an ice pack on Christian Bale's face. He gets a pretty nasty bruise on his cheek that, sick as it may sound, really shows off the life-like picture Blu-ray is capable of producing. It's not all about the bruises, though; there are some truly picturesque desert landscapes on display as well.

As for special features, I was surprised to find this disc pretty packed with content. In addition to all the features from the standard DVD edition, the blu-ray also has some exclusives: short pieces on the film's score and the guns used in it, a conversation with Elmore Leonard, who wrote the original short story that both film adaptations are based on, and a longer (and pretty good!) feature about the impact of the railroad on the American west. All told, there's about an hour of special features, plus an insightful director commentary.

If you like westerns at all, then you owe it to yourself to check out 3:10 to Yuma. It's the most traditional of the recent western mini-boom. Even if you don't particularly care for westerns, it's a pretty darn good movie on its own merits.",1212969600,2,1938,4.813813813813814
1593215,3,B00005JPXP,"I have enduring memories of the original, seen in black and white in the local flea pit in Belfast approximately a million years ago, so I was keen to see this one. Now it has to be remembered that the Western is really a type of American fairy tale where a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, and all sorts of improbablilities abound, such as the fast draw that never really existed and the squeezing of an entire arsenal of machine gun-like shots out of a gun that only held six bullets and which had to be cocked every time. So, one has to accept this and enjoy the ride.

I found the ride reasonably enjoyable. Crowe and Bale do quite a good job, as does the wonderfully nasty SOB who is Crowe's 2IC. However, the ending is so wildly, completely improbable that it just spoiled the whole show for me. Surely a more likely ending could have been contrived?",1212278400,,861,4.314814814814815

Set in the Wild West, it a story of of a gang leader who crosses his path with Civil War veteran turned farmer after his leg was injured in a war.  Forced to provide for his family in spite of his handicap, work long days taking care of livestock and fight evil railroad employees who want him off the land in order to extend the railroad, farmer decides to volunteer in taking in captured gang leader to justice.  With a small group of Pinkerton agents, this group takes on dangerous trip in order to reach railroad that will take prisoner to Yuma prison.  As they are trying to reach their way to the train station, they are pursued by the gang leader's friends who want to free him in order to continue their prosperous murder and roberry spree.  Lots of action during this epic that leads to unlikely bond between two men (farmer and a murderer).  I was fascinated by Ben Foster's performance of the evil, sexually ambiguous member of the gang whose obsession towards freeing his leader leads him to his own doom. Ben Foster is the actor to watch.  But the film itself is wonderful in its message that even emotionally deeply damaged people can bond, understand each other and find a common ground and decency in the most likely of the situations.

1593291,4,B00005JPXP,"With his family on the brink of losing everything, Dan Evans (Christian Bale) agrees to help the Southern Pacific Railroad bring a wicked villain, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), to justice.  Justice happens to be at the train station in Contention, where Wade is expected to hitch a ride on the 3:10 to Yuma and imprisonment.  The only things stopping Evans and his allies from making it to Contention is Wade himself and his vicious gang, headed up by the overprotective and violent Charlie Prince (Ben Foster).  This sounds like a fairly standard plot for a Western, but there are many, many more layers to this tale.

**Potential Spoilers**

First of all, the primary characters of Wade and Evans undergo changes as they trek to Contention.  Evans is out to save his family and home as well as prove to his eldest son that he really is a good father.  Wade constantly tempts Evans with promises of money and being allowed to live if he'd only set him free.  It brings to mind the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the Bible.  I know that may be somewhat of a stretch, but it did remind me of that.  Wade begins the journey as a heartless, cruel and calculating criminal who develops something of a friendship with Evans.  You'll have to watch the film if you want to decide if the changes are good.

Ben Foster's character, Charlie Prince, represents both the reality and the mythos that is the outlaw of the American West.  He's a young, desperate man with no real direction other than to steal and murder in order to fill the emptiness he was left with after the Civil War.  Where the character takes on more of a mythological presence is the fact that he's a dead shot until he's shooting at the hero and he's a stereotypical right-hand man to the boss.

Evans' son, William (Logan Lerman), is another character who is equal parts reality and myth.  He quickly becomes a man on the journey due to his circumstances.  He also learns that his father is a much greater man than he appears to be.  In the beginning, however, he's a stereotypical headstrong son who seemingly hates his dad.

**End Spoilers**

The cast of this story, which includes Peter Fonda, Luke Wilson, Gretchen Moll, and Dallas Roberts, does a great job.  The music brings back fond memories of larger-than-life Westerns.  Director James Mangold manages to keep all of the action and plot development on an even keel.  At no point was I bored with the film nor did I find it too unbelievable when compared to other films of the genre.  Yes, outrageous things happen, but fans of the Western will know that such things have to occur in order to elevate the heroes to another level.

I must also highlight the wonderful documentaries included on this disc.  Not only do they give the viewer an insight on the making of the film, you also learn a bit about that amazing (and violent) time in American history that has spawned so many films such as this one.  In true Wild West fashion, the O.K. Corral manages to get mentioned in one of the documentaries.  If one event embodies the true heart of outlaws and gunmen, that's the one.

I highly recommend this film to fans of Westerns.  I recommend it also to people who enjoy stories of good versus evil, temptation, and action films.  Although I rented this film, I plan to make it a permanent part of my collection very soon.",1210896000,,3340,4.572390572390573

Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a former sharpshooter in the Union Army who was injured during war, and has since moved on to the town of Bisby, an arid, poor, primitive land of ranchers and farmers.  It turns out, however, that Evans was wounded in the leg during a retreat, and he desperately wishes to prove himself to his adoring family.

Meanwhile, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) leads a gang of outlaws who rob stagecoaches.  The most memorable of Wade's men is Charlie Prince, a vile, psychopathic character with an itchy trigger finger and absolutely no remorse.  Wade - a slick-talking con-man who attacks foes through gunplay and/or psychology - and the gang particularly love to attack shipments protected by the Al Pinkerton protection agency; they've hit a string of 21 straight worth over 400K in losses.

During one peculiar scenario, Wade decides to stick around a town, post-robbery, while unprotected.  In a matter of no time he's captured by the authorities, one of which is Byron McElroy, a bounty hunter left alive from the most recent crime.  They plan on moving Wade from Bisby to Contention where they will put Wade on a 3:10 train to Yuma.  There is a dilemma, however, because there aren't enough men to escort Wade to Contention without the probability of losing him in an attack courtesy of Wade's gang.  It is with Dan Evans' desire to prove himself to his children, and the promise of $200 for his services, that he decides to join the dangerous mission of bringing Wade to justice.

What follows is great drama, action, and even a bit of comedy.  One of the better gun-scenes that I can remember serves as a worthwhile culmination of the film.

Eventually, Evans teaches his sons that when faced with situations that are sure to spell your doom, and when all others lack the courage and/or conviction to do what's right, that a man's actions, morals, and ethics are all that counts.

I highly recommend this film.",1209945600,,2249,5.176795580110498

 [For those who haven't seen the film, don't worry I'm not going to discuss the ending here]

I've seen the movie 4-5 times and I discovered something new each time I watched it. Especially about Ben Wade. This movie is a real treat, you get something new from it each time.

 Rancher Dan Evans, a good man, but bad thing after bad thing is happening to him when we meet him. Even Mother Nature isn't cooperating.

  I don't want to spoil too much about outlaw Ben Wade, but complex is a good word for him. And hide your wife.

 The real villain of the movie is Charlie Prince. He is number 2 guy in Bens gang. A murdering machine,probably insane.

Let the games begin.. due to an event, Dan and Wade are put together and hit the trail along with a few others. Dan has to do this certain thing and he & his family will be rewarded. But this is no ordinary or easy trip. The 2 men are on a journey, there are surprises, revelations..they learn about each other.
  And I really cant say more. But at this point of the film you have to pay close attention.

 I wouldnt call this movie a western, its a drama. There are too many gray hats here to be your usual good guy[s] vs. bad guy[s] western.. and actually, THATS probably what makes this movie so very good,its fresh.

 This movie is psychological, it plays with your mind.

 And the action in this film is the psychological battle the two main characters are in.

 Great job by director Mangold for there are no boring moments.

 The acting is great, down to the actor who plays Dans son. I found R.Crowe mesmerizing. I think this is one of his best performances. And all you have to do is look at Christian Bale as Dan to see his character is suffering.

 When the credits roll, you're thinking and thinking about it all.

1593347,4,B00005JPXP,"I could hardly wait to see ""3:10 to Yuma"". With all the high ratings it has received so far, I was really looking forward to seeing it. But I was disappointed after the first viewing. I had expected something different. But then after the second and third viewing I began to enjoy it. While watching the movie for the first time I expected to see a serious and realistic film. But realism is not what this is about. So what's it about? It's neither a drama due to the lack of realism nor is it a comedy, too many sad moments. Maybe it is best described as a Western movie with lots of action scenes that tries to convey some kind of moral.
The best of 3:10 to Yuma is definitely the brilliant performance of Russell Crowe. Without him in the leading role this movie wouldn't be as half as good. His character is nicely developed, just as the one of Christian Bale, who has the other leading role. This might sound strange when on the other hand a lot of the actions in this movie are not quite understandable. The reason for a few escaped me completely especially in the last twenty minutes. The viewer is left to his or her own guesses. Only in the end when Crow whistles to his horse at least some sense comes to the last scenes.
Although the story is highly unbelievable and in many parts strange, the dialogue is interesting and even now and then amusing.
Besides the great acting it's the well done cinematography, the beautiful scenery and the great sound track that make up for most of the flaws.
Of course there is a lot of shooting like in many Western movies. Sometimes it looks as if they were shooting blanks because nobody gets hit. Then on the other hand when someone gets hit there is of course the never missing Hollywood bullet fallacy - one shot drops and bodies flying through the air by the impact of the bullet. If a bullet had the power to nock down a man, the shooter would also be flying backwards. Simple physics. The scene I really got hung up on while watching the movie for the first time was when one of the ""good"" guys who was shot in the stomach gets treated by a vet who just pries out the bullet and a couple hours later this same guy is back in the saddle. Give me a break! That's ridiculous. But as I already said the whole story is not realistic.

Crowe as the renaissance villain was just overplayed until in the end became ridiculous.

I think, maybe (and this is just me) but that the concepts of honor and such may be kind of incomprehensible to some in Hollywood at this point so that often they can't convey them in a way that can make sense.

I can think of two Westerns in recent years that did a much better job at what this film tried to do.

1593355,4,B00005JPXP,"I am a big fan of the original primarily due to the great portrayal by Glenn Ford of the (film) legendary outlaw, Ben Wade. The Wade character is fascinating as a highly intelligent, sometimes fastidious individual who seems to always possess a strange calm, and an almost eerie smile as he seems to taunt fate with great amusement. As man of mystery making one wonder, how did someone so smart go so bad with the unflinching ability to kill a man yet at the same time be amused and virtually appreciative of an opponent with guts and a sense of what the right thing in life really is. Where Ford shines as Ben Wade, Christian Bale shines as Dan Evans, the down on his luck Civil War veteran, minus a leg, who is about to lose his ranch. Russell Crowe does a very good job playing the complicated Wade and just about measures up to Ford's play but Beale is the center character as a struggling man trying to balance his world between potential poverty, the feeling of failure and the lack of respect by his eldest who as a maturing teen sees his father wrongly as a weak man. After seeing the original version, I later appreciated the twists of this new version that work very well. For instance, in the original, the Evan's character, played by Van Heflin, is known as the best shot in the area and they hand him a sawed off shotgun that is only effective at 25 yards. In the Bale's version, he is recognized as the best shot and he appropriately has his own Sharps rifle, used by sharpshooters in the Civil War. The misguided youth, played quite well by Logan Lerman, has a major role in this version and actually becomes a major character in the plot. And the ending has the biggest twist of all and you have to see it to appreciate it. The outdoor scenes, towns, costumes, weapons all looked very authentic and the film has a believable presence of the post Civil War period. What I didn't like was that the film had some special effects with scenes that I thought was a bit over the top primarily because the film captures a very realistic feel for the period and it slightly mars the realism that the film captures very well with those exceptions I just described. I thought the final scenario was too sensational to believe and to maintain true suspense; the challenge has to be more reasonable to maintain that realism. The acting is standout, aside from Bale, Crowe and Lerman, Ben Foster is excellent as the violent disciple of Wade and Fonda is virtually unrecognizable and quite engaging as Ben Wade's long time nemesis. It's worthwhile to see both, they both are entertaining, the same story but told differently.",1207612800,,2626,4.542194092827004
1593356,5,B00005JPXP,"This 2007 Western is, of course, a remake of the '57 original with Glenn Ford. The story involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is then escorted to the town of Contention to await the 3:10 to Yuma, where he'll be imprisoned and hanged. A desperate rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 to survive. Wade plays psychological games the entire time and tries to corrupt Evans to his way of thinking, but things turn out differently.

This is top-of-the-line filmmaking. The cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful Gretchen Mol and the outstanding & always-likable Peter Fonda), the New Mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best Western compositions -- no lie. Most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on -- the nature and causes of good and evil, redemption, hypocrisy, the corruption of filthy lucre, the correlation of talants & ""success,"" negative influences, the nature of leaders and followers, racism, poverty, family values & faithfulness v.s. lawlessness, rich oppression, etc.

The first hour of the film is quite realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. Thankfully, most of these unreaslistic elements can be explained. Please see Carryit's review from January 24, 2008, or Clare Quilty's review from Sept. 17, 2007, and Carryit's response in the comment section. Regardless, there are at least a couple unrealistic points that will definitely turn-off viewers who demand realism with their Westerns. For instance, the whistling for a horse over the loud sounds of a steam-engine train.

One supposedly unrealistic issue keeps coming up on this review board: A man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. The quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. But watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background; it briefly cuts to another scene. Why does the yelling stop before the switch? Who knows, he likely lost consciousness. In my opinion Evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue; but this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.

One problem I had was that Ben Wade (Crowe) came off as super-human. There was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. I suppose this could be explained by the fact that there ARE people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human. Remember Bo Jackson? He'd play in a major league playoff game and then immediately be flown to appear in a NFL game. He was superhuman pure and simple (until he got injured, that is). Or how about Bruce Lee?

In any event, I didn't buy Crowe in this super-villain role, especially on account of the fact that he's obviously in his late 40s. Crowe does a fine job portraying the arrogant and charismatic outlaw, but his age and physicality don't do the role justice. Someone like The Rock would've been more believable, although he obviously lacks Crowe's acting skills. Marlon Brando did an excellent job (i.e. believable) in a similar role in the incredibly underrated ""The Missouri Breaks.""

So, this is not a realistic Western like, say, ""The Long Riders,"" ""Open Range,"" ""Wyatt Earp"" or even ""Unforgiven."" No, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a MYTHIC Western with an incredibly potent message. If you can't handle strong mythic elements in a Western this film's not for you.

When I first saw the film I didn't get the ending and it kind of turned me off (as it does quite a few reviewers here). But it was clear that there was more to the picture than initially meets the eye so I decided to view it again to see if I could make sense of it. It DOES make sense and it's all there clear as day, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. When you see it, it'll blow you away, which is why I give the film 5/5 Stars despite its shortcomings noted above.

SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ THE REST OF THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FILM'S ENDING AND MAIN MESSAGE!!

Wade is an ultra-confident, intelligent and highly talanted man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of Nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all God. He senses simple purity in Evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt Evans and win him to his way of thinking. But as they wait in the hotel room it is Evans who ""converts"" Wade, in a sense. Evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being WHO HE IS -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.

As they're waiting, Wade sketches a picture of Evans in a book. It is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of the Holy Bible. This reveals that Wade came to view Evans as a Christ figure, perhaps more subconsciously than consciously, and that Evans is clearly a type of Christ in the Film.

What exactly was it that caused Wade to ""convert"" and support Evans? (1.) He saw in Evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) Evan's son insisted that there was still some good in Wade despite his wicked history. Regardless of Wade's denial, the kid was right. The idea that SOMEONE saw a glimmer of good in him, that SOMEONE out there BELIEVED in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support Evans. (3.) Wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid (while reading through the Bible at a train station). He saw in Evans and his wife a REAL family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and their children come hell or high water. He became convinced that Evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) Evans made a deal with the Pinkerton that if he successfully got Wade to the train the Pinkerton would make sure Evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. Wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. This could be the beginning of a new life.

(5.) Wade's relationship with Evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than time, familiarity or shared events. Great friendships like this can happen quickly like love-at-first-sight (not that there's any type of gay element, thankfully). Such is the case here. Such relationships are condusive to honesty and transparency, which explains why Evans reveals to Wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.

After Evan's brutal death he has an even greater revelation: To see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but GREAT man -- murdered by a group of moral-less swine filled him with utter disgust. You can see it on his face. Yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him (sort of) but this was about their only redeeming quality. To truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of those corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.

Why did Evans have to die? Because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. For Wade to live and have a new life Evans had to perish.",1207526400,11,7550,4.666917293233083
1593412,4,B00005JPXP,"While both men provide a very solid performance, Christian Bale comes across as a little more believable as a cowboy trying to make a living than Russell Crowe comes across as an outlaw. The problem with his performance would be I see him as too compassionate which I don't forsee a lot of murderers having.

The film centers around Christian Bale on the brink of losing his ranch, which is his last shred of respect he still has. His children look to him as a failure and his wife hardly looks at him at all. When the opportunity to transfer the captured Ben Wade (Crowe) to contention or the 3:10 to Yuma, Bale volunteers for the sum of $200, enough to save his ranch. While everyone believes he is crazy for doing so, knowing his life is better as it is, than it would be to have him dead and his wife a widow. He goes forward, trying to earn something he couldn't even find being a veteran of the civil war.

This film will keep you on the edge of your seat, knowing Wade has so many enemies, but also that his posse is hunting him as well trying to save him from contention. The question is, who gets there first?",1207526400,,1118,4.268867924528302

The issue is that when you spend 2hrs watching characters barely escape death over and over to just have on up and get killed suddenly at the end it has to be a damned well deserved death.

What leads up to the end is really a top notch film, both Bale adn Crowe give solid performances and the film never feels overly Hollywood fantastical, it's a pretty gripping, intense film.

Unfortunately the character arch of the Crowe characters is predictable from the start, his fate feels obvious and you might wish Bale's character would be a bit stronger or smarter in the last twenty minutes.

People portrayed here are no cut-out two dimensional characters: good or bad, settlers versus Red Indians, robbers against Marshalls.  Rather, we have everything and everyone in the mix, not forgetting about the rail company that would bully the small people to submission in relinquishing their ranches to make way for railroads.  We also get to see the Chinese coolies that are put of the landscape in gold mining and building railroads.  What made this movie a cut above the rest is the study of the characters, explaining what made the persons that they are, the motivation for them to do what they have to do.  Despite Russell's Ben Wade and Christian Bale's character are at opposite extreme, they are held on by their strong belief.  One has a strong conscience and morality whilst the others believe in fending for oneself.  The captive and the captor strike an unlike friendship and command a mutual respect.  Then, there's Ben's second in command, Charles Prince who would go through thick and thin to set his leader of the pack free and for him, he's more of a pscyhopath that would do anything to anyone that's in his way.  The final showdown is a true Western masterpiece, not unlike Peckinpah's classic.  A true Western that's made with grace, integrity, intelligence, and ocassional humour.  It deserves to be seen on the big screen.  Highly recommended.",1206230400,,1417,4.882845188284519
1593449,5,B00005JPXP,"If you're a casual moviegoer and aren't planning to watch both this movie and the original for the sake of historical comparisons or because you have an essay to write in your film class, the latest entry into the inveterate Western genre stands on its own merits, and is as pleasingly fast-paced as it is psychologically probing.

3:10 to Yuma is a character-driven performance that never forgets the joy of a good ole gun fight. The casting in the movie stands out almost immediately with a few surprises. Both Crowe and Bale give exquisitely complex performances. Crowe, who has a self-possessed charisma, affects a gentile attractiveness, that is best displayed in his interactions with Bale's enamoured wife played by Gretchen Mol.

Bale is incredulous as a herder who is desperate to make one more go at his homestead before the railroads erase him from the face of the map. The dialogue between him and Mol about why he must escort Ben Wade to his death is heartfelt, believable, and lacks the heroic overtures we'd expect of more polished machismo. Even seeing a cameo by Luke Wilson would have been enough to spoil the picture had Wilson launched into tomfoolery, but even he remains stalwart and calmly cavalier in his role as a member of an opposing posse.

Perhaps the most compelling performance for me was given by Ben Foster. My only previous remembrance of Foster was as the metal-faced punk in the Punisher, and later as the angel-winged superhero in the X-Men. However, that's where the similarities end. Foster does an extraordinary job of being diabolically evil. His blind allegiance to Ben Wade (Crowe) seems almost disturbing to Crowe himself. Foster's facial contortions and vocal inflections make his character a deadly combination of hair-pin trigger psychosis and raw madness. His will probably be the most overlooked, underrated performance of the year sadly.

3:10 to Yuma shows how the American cowboy epic is as much alive and interesting as the vampire movie is to horror fans. Both genres still have far-reaching influences on the cultures they affect.",1205884800,2,2085,5.017341040462428
1593450,1,B00005JPXP,"The ending of this movie was just awful, it just went off the deep end and I do not recommend this movie at all.",1205798400,8,112,3.7083333333333335
1593451,3,B00005JPXP,"Just another dad-proving-himself-to-his-son movie?  Not at all.  This is a neatly paced psychological thriller that balances talk and action and pits two charismatic heroes--or one hero and one anti-hero--against each other, leaving you biting your nails until the credits roll.

As you probably know already, Russell Crowe plays Ben Wade, head honcho of a gang of murderous train robbers.  He fatefully crosses paths with Christian Bale as Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher whose land is about to get foreclosed.  Despite Wade's wits and quickness with a gun--not to mention being surrounded by his gang of sociopaths--he ends up getting captured by the law, and to earn some of the much-needed reward money, Evans is part of the group escorting Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma that will take him to federal custody--and, considering his long and bloody crime spree, almost certain execution.  Unfortunately for Evans and his cohorts, they are no match for the wily Wade or his cutthroats--but Evans is just desperate enough for money that he is determined to go the distance and deliver Wade to justice.  Nonetheless, Wade's cockiness toward his captors is unsettling both to them and us.  His wry smirk tells us he isn't bluffing when he says his gang is bound to rescue him, spilling a lot of blood in the process.

Crowe is, as always, watchable and likable, despite the fact that he is playing an utterly vile character, one who takes whatever he wants and sneers at moral men like Evans who are content to live poor and honest.  Bale more than holds his own in the role of Evans, and the real interest of the movie is not the action element--beautifully staged though it is--but the running moral discussion between Wade and Evans, making us wonder if Wade just might be attracted to this decent family man.  This growing affection for Evans--after he sees just how gritty Evans is--leads to an ending that, while not wholly satisfying, has a certain strange logic to it.  Evans does make it to the train with Wade, but there is a bundle of surprises in the last five minutes.

Watching this movie made me think of Hannibal Lecter, the articulate, philosophical man looking down on everyone around him, and feeling no guilt about doing with them whatever he likes.  Wade talks like a disciple of Nietzsche, regarding himself as the superior man, the ubermensch, the superman who has no moral obligation to anyone.  Yet while he plays the role of tempter, trying to convert the decent Evans to his way of thinking, we see hints that he might be experiencing his own conversion.

This is an intense, highly watchable piece of work, with fine acting, intelligent dialogue, and violence that seems painfully real instead of cartoonish. The minor characters are well-drawn, particularly Evans's teenage son and Charlie Prince, Wade's cold-blooded lieutenant.  (Ever notice that having a nasty character be blond seems to make him even worse?)  In many ways it is superior to the original 3:10 to Yuma, released fifty years earlier, in which Glenn Ford played the villain.  Occasionally a remake really is better.",1205798400,2,3117,4.948176583493282

1593516,5,B00005JPXP,"The Movie is one of the better western movies. In the beginning of the movie there is a hold-up of one of the stage coaches of the Southern Pacific Railway by Ben Ward (Russell Crowe) and the burning down of Daniel Evans' (Christian Bale) barn and the scattering of his cattle by an affiliate of said railway, trying to force him to sell his highly indebted land to them. Dan meets Ben the first time while looking for his cattle and later in town where he tries to defer his debt. In town Ben is arrested and Dan agrees to help transferring Ben to Conjunction to board the 3:10 to Yuma for the price of $200.

The coach with the prisoner Ben stops at Dan's ranch, where Dan's son William gets in touch with Ben. The relation between father and son is somewhat strained and you get the feeling that William despises his father and thinks him a coward. It is at the farm, too, that the actual cat and mouse game between Dan and Ben begins. Ben, the talkative bible-citing, artistic ""evil"" gangster and Dan, the reticent, dour ""good"" farmer. Ben has the ability of touching not always visible sore spots and of hitting the nail on the head.  He keeps challenging Dan to bring forth his ""darker"" side. Dan remains silent almost to the very end and avoids confrontations rather than truly embracing life.

The movie thrives on the relation/interaction of the two lead characters. Most of the time Ben talks off Dan's ear and Dan's tells him to shut up or forbids others to listen to Ben. But both characters learn from each other and aid the other in developing their own personality, until at the end of the movie the two have some kind of mutual respect/friendship between them. Even Dan's son William grows up during the prison transport and in the end actually shows true respect of his father.

At the end of the movie you will have grown to like both main characters and will want to see them riding into the West together, this from someone who doesn't particularly like Russell Crowe ;-)).

Many movies require you to suspend belief to a certain extent but this one requires you to have no rational thought whatsoever. I know it is not suppose to be factual or a documentary but just because a story is fiction the characters should not be total morons.

It was because it betrayed its audience by thoroughly insulting their intelligence. I started out loving this movie, five stars I thought, great acting, authentic setting, terrific costumes and scenery. I dropped down to four as Peter Fonda was gutshot one day and in the saddle the next day with the posse delivering Ben Wade (Russell Crow) to town of Contention. What finally sunk this film for me was the complete idiocy of the final sequence. We're asked to believe that Ben Wade, this ruthless killer, somehow finds empathy for this pathetic rancher who wants to deliver him to the hangman. He then willingly runs handcuffed with Christian Bale through town, dodging bullets from townsfolk and his own gang who have risked their lives to save him. After much carnage, he makes it to the train with Bale who dies in the effort. He then slaughters his gang ( I still can't figure out why. They were there to set him free) and willingly gets on the train, which seems to have no guards or locked cells. He then softly whistles for his horse, who has super hearing to follow the prison train from which he obviously will easily escape. Tens of millions of dollars, thousands man/woman hours by talented people in the industry and this is the best ending they can come up with? They must be DELUDED OR COMPLETE IDIOTS or they have so much contempt for the audience's intelligence and think that we're not going to notice or be insulted by the absolute departure from reality and normal human behavior.

At the core of this story is an amazing dynamic between freedom (represented by successful stagecoach robber Ben Wade) and desperation (represented by failing farmer Dan Evans).  Crowe's Ben Wade reminded me of a bored professional:  He plans and executes stargecoach robberies and longs for more challenging opponents.  He's vicious and violent, but only when the situation requires it.

In contrast, Bale's Dan Evans is beset by drought, debt and a family that doesn't respect him.  The movie opens with his barn being burned down as a warning from his creditors.  His desperation and lack of options drives him to sign up to escort captured Wade to the Contention train station.

From the thief to the good guy, you relate to the leads in a way that recent movies haven't supplied!

If you love a well-acted movie (and you can't go wrong with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, both TRULY gifted acotrs) and want a story that you can't figure out in the first frame, see 3:10 to Yuma.  You will not be disappointed!  It makes you laugh cry and shocks you!  What a great movie!!!

I loved the original movie, made when movies were THE THING to do on the weekend.

Russell Crowe does an outstanding job in whatever role he accepts, and this performance is no exception. However...there's one very significant hitch in this instance.

The production of the DVD must have been an operation supervised and quality checked by morons or prokaryotes, because the disk provided a video image that resembled the image one gets off the satellite when the signal is attenuated by clouds or rain; all out of synch and pixelated.

I'll wait until I get a Blu-Ray player and try again, because I really want this movie in my collection.

So I let myself get pulled into it.  Is it revenge, is this the theme?  No, better: father and son.  The rancher's eldest son doesn't respect him. Six thousand bullets and killings later, dad must die -- reverse image of son dying for dad.  And then the twist, Russ turns on HIS son (really, stepson and gang leader), blows him and other gang members away, boards train to Yuma.  Lights out, good music, good scenery.

Russell Crowe's character is too much like Superman and Bale's is too much like Clark Kent to like their interaction. I kept waiting and waiting for Bale's character to shine and even his final moment of glory is robbed of its luster because of this odd misplacement of charisma.

Scores of expert gunmen keep missing Bale. I just recently watched the original with Glen Ford. I thought both movies had their strengths and weaknesses, but the ending in the first movie is more plausible than in the remake.

Beside the slightly hard to believe plot, all the performances are good. Fonda as the Pinkerton is extremely good. How Crowe verbally engages his guards on the trip is very good. Crowe plays a criminal who is always thinking and playing the angles very well. Bale plays the one-legged rancher trying desparately to provide for his family very well.",1203206400,,718,4.744
1593662,5,B00005JPXP,"In 3:10 to Yuma, Russell Crowe proves again his affinity to the American Western genre, just as he did in ""The Quick and the Dead"" opposite Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman. The film is a remake of a classic 1957 Western starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin.

In this new venture, Crowe plays Ben Wade (the 1957 role of Ford), the leader of an outlaw gang who is ruthless and violent, but who also has a streak of honor. His counterpart, one-legged union veteran of the Civil War played by Christian Bale (Heflin's 1957 role), remains Wade's adversary throughout the film, but also develops a friendship for the man.

The ambivalence of this relationship, as well as Crowe's own moral and ethical ambivalence about the men with whom he rides and what he is doing, drive this film. Accordingly, it transcends the raw action-adventure drama, and confronts two men of stern resolve and capability with stark choices about life and death, liberty and capitivity, prosperity vs. poverty. The tension is increased by the fact that Bale's son is torn between his love of his father, and his admiration for the fast-shooting outlaw played by Crowe.

The movie has scarcely a shred of history in it, but its historical backdrop--the ruthless outlawry of the Arizona territory and the iconic territorial prison at Yuma--provides a wonderful setting for a great film in the more traditional Western genre. As far as a comparison with the 1957 film is concerned, Crowe is much more convincing as a Western Outlaw than Glenn Ford was convincing in any western. Or perhaps it is the ""new realism"" one sees in more modern Westerns, beginning with Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns of the sixties (which rejected the clean-and-pressed costumry and which introduced the strong Hispanic flavor which doubtless part of the Southwest frontier), and continuing through ""The Long Riders"", ""Tombstone"", ""The Assassination of Jesse James"", and now ""3:10 to Yuma"".",1203206400,,1934,5.018691588785047

This isn't a Western so much as a morality tale set in the Old West. Yes, it's a little simplistic in that when a character makes an offensive remark, you know he's going to end up dead in five minutes. But this is a morality tale.

What I love best about the movie is that it makes the distinction between people who act as though they're righteous vs people who actually are righteous. I wdn't say this is a really happy movie, but it is happy in that the main characters end up as better people than when they started. This movie made me want to be a better person too.

Everything about this movie is superb: the score is subtle and doesn't try to overwhelm you with its ""western-ness""; the lighting is beautiful, especially at the end, when it captures the glow you get late in the day; and the actors turned in some really good performances. I'm still amazed  that neither of the leads (Russell Crowe and Christian Bale) are Americans--they pulled off their accents beautifully. Ben Foster was absolutely chilling as the baby-faced henchman with no conscience and an obsessive loyalty to his boss. And he showed some really good horsemanship.

One other thing I liked about this movie is that it seemed to be more concerned with telling its story than in showing a lot of gore. This story takes place in the lawless frontier, so it has its share of blood, and some really bad things happen to some characters (hence the R-rating). However, the movie doesn't dwell on them or force you to listen to people's screams. It tells you the event happened and moves on.

1593741,1,B00005JPXP,"I understand this movie has received a lot of + reviews. I wish I could include mine amongst them. But I really couldn't get into it. The actors and the sets all looked authentic, what the west probably looked like. But the actions these grisly looking cowboys take stretches the imagination. The director doesn't have the courage to give us a really bad guy in Crowe's character. We are told throughout the movie that Wade's a bad dude. Despite being the leader of this outlaw gang the script lets Wade's right hand man, Charlie Prince (played by Ben Foster), do the really despicable stuff. After Wade's gang takes on a heavily fortified Pinkerton stage coach he is captured while making a booty call (And we find out here he has an artistic side to as he draws a portrait of his lover). But he must be delivered to the 3:10 train to Yuma which will take him to prison.

This is where Christian Bale's character comes in. He plays Dan Evans, a civil war veteran. He has a bad leg that he injured in the war. He is struggling to make an honest living as a rancher. He and his 2 sons come across Wade and his gang by accident. After Wade is captured Evans signs on to the posse that will deliver Wade to justice. His motivation, we learn, has as much to do with proving himself to his boys than putting a killer behind bars.

As the posse escorts Wade to justice they go through many dangerous situations, including transit through indian territory. In one of the many things that stretch the imagination- Wade is able to overpower his captors on 3 seperate occasions while he is handcuffed in the front. And yet, after each recapture none of them has the brainstorm to cuff him in the back! The ending, which I won't reveal, also stretches the imagination. It seems that Wade has true empathy for Rancher Evans? Not realistic at all. It seems to me that the West was more likely populated by really bad men, characters like Eastwood's 'William Munny' in Unforgiven or Henry Fonda's 'Frank' in Once Upon a time in the West or William Holden's 'Pike Bishop' from the Wild Bunch. These killers didn't have to wait for a gallant quickdraw showdown in the streets to start blastin people. If they could get the jump on a foe by shooting them in the back or while they were unarmed then so much the better. They were just mean and ornery through and through.

I agree with the many folks who commented thusly: beautiful movie, with excellent acting, especially by Crowe & Bale- but with stupidity galore. The thing with the captors having Wade, a known murderer, very loosely handcuffed with his hands in FRONT of him- and letting him stay that way even after killing TWO of his captors- that was completely unacceptable. Stupid beyond explanation. And the gut-shot Pinkerton man- oh, he's basically FINE the next day, just because the bullet was removed? What??? And it just goes on & on- why did anyone tell the poor sap decoy in the stagecoach where the rest of the group was taking Wade?? Why did these morons make a campfire in known Indian territory? Why did they let Wade go to the window & chat with his pals when they got to Contention? Why, when the outlaws were busy gunning down the lawmen when they came outside- unarmed & surrendering- did the idiot captors not take that opportunity to SHOOT the outlaws?? And so on & so on. And the ending was so far beyond far-fetched that there's just no describing it in any way that makes any sense. The biggest disappointment of all: this could have been a great movie, with a little bit more effort. Why is it that nobody who watched the movie before it was released, or read the script, or did any editing, said, ""Hey, why are these guys all so incredibly stupid? Do they have lead poisoning or something?"" What a waste.",1202601600,23,1434,4.6015625

1593778,5,B00005JPXP,"As I have said in various other reviews prior to this one, remakes appear to be all the rage in Hollywood currently. Some of these films fare better than others with moviegoers and critics, and truth be told there have been numerous remakes that have been well worth the cost of admission (not to mention the cost of making the picture). However, when remakes fail, they are generally so terrible that audiences and critics alike question the need for so many of these remakes, essentially ruining any good favor some remakes have established with audiences, causing some to wonder if remakes are even needed in Hollywood or if they should become a dying breed. If you find yourself wondering why Hollywood bothers remaking certain films that are commonly held up as classics in the world of cinema, then I know of one movie that you should see that would renew your faith in today's modern director's trying their hands at classic films. The film I am referring to is director James Mangold's (""Walk the Line"") superbly crafted western ""3:10 to Yuma"", starring Christian Bale (""Batman Begins"") and Russell Crowe (""American Gangster"").

""3:10 to Yuma"" is the story of two men, outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), who find their fates intertwined after Ben is arrested for robbery and murder and Dan volunteers to assist in delivering him to a train heading for Yuma, Arizona. However, their journey will be anything but peaceful, as the men find themselves being tracked by the very band of criminals that Ben led when he was a free man; however, now they are led by Ben's homicidal second-in-command, Charlie (Ben Foster), and these ruthless killers will stop at nothing until their leader is free.

How does a successful director follow-up a critically acclaimed film, such as ""Walk the Line""? Easy, you sign on to direct a remake of a classic film, such as ""3:10 to Yuma"", then assemble a team of extremely talented stars to flesh out your cast, such as Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster, and Peter Fonda, top things off with an extremely well written script, and voila! You find yourself with an outstanding film, which is being praised by critics as being ""The best western since 'Unforgiven'!"" (Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle), and leaving moviegoers with a movie experience they will want to see over and over again. Congratulations James Mangold, you have conquered yet another movie genre in your highly successful career in Hollywood. It's not often that a director seems to choose a different genre every time he/she makes a film, but that is exactly what James Mangold has done throughout his career as a director, with films ranging from romantic comedies (""Kate and Leopold""), to thrillers (""Identity""), to drama (""Cop Land""), to biopic (""Walk the Line""), and now westerns. So, what can audiences expect next? Only time will tell.

The cast of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is led by two of the most extremely talented actors working in Hollywood today, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. With these two actors in virtually every scene in the film, there is no possible way this movie could fail. Both actors imbue their characters with such charisma, intensity, and mystery that the audience just can't help but pay attention when they are on the screen, that is how commanding their individual presences are, and when they are acting opposite each other, those are the scenes in the movie that are absolutely brilliant. The supporting cast is comprised of equally talented actors, two of which steal several scenes throughout the course of the film, Peter Fonda (""Ghost Rider"") as a grizzled, tough-as-nails lawman whose sole purpose in life is to bring Ben Wade to justice; and Ben Foster (""The Punisher"") as the deranged second-in-command of Wade's gang, who would rather kill a person than look at them. These two actors deliver outstanding performances, that in my opinion are worthy of Best Supporting Actor nods, along with the two leads who should each be nominated for Best Actor, but were snubbed by the Academy in the end.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not trying to sound like ""3:10 to Yuma"" is just a drama with a western backdrop. Sure, there is a lot of intense drama throughout the film (which all great films need to have), but there are also plenty of high-energy action scenes and gunfights that will please any fan of western gun battles. I've heard some people say that for a western it was a whole lot of talk and not a lot of action. Well, I guess I was watching a different movie because the ""3:10 to Yuma"" that I watched featured numerous smaller gunfights throughout the first half to three-quarters of the film, but the last 20 minutes alone is this huge battle for survival, filled with non-stop action and guns blazing right up to the final moments in the movie. So, if you've heard that this is too much of a drama to be a western, then you heard wrong and whoever told you that should probably re-watch the film, because they must have missed the last 20 minutes of the movie.

""3:10 to Yuma"" is an intelligently written western with plenty of sharp dialogue, intense action sequences, and some of the best acting you will find in any movie. This is definitely one remake that should make your list of films that you need to see in the near future.

The cast was nominated for best ensemble in the Screen Actor's Guild Awards and it was well deserved from the leading roles right down to the day players.  The film and Mangold really should have received an Academy Award nomination.  The score is also very special and sets just the right tone for the picture.  It's easy to overlook as it is to some degree subliminal but if you're paying attention you will realize the impact it has and how much it adds to the film as a whole.

1593829,5,B00005JPXP,"We were pleasantly surprised by this magnificent western. The performance by Russell Crowe is simply superb as the villain we learn to like, admire, and ultimately... gain great respect for his inordinate ability to get out of the most unfortunate circumstances.

3:10 to Yuma is filmed to perfection with some of the most audacious scenes of any western we have watched. Ben Wade is an infamous outlaw, deadly with weapons and with his hands, but with the ability to gain people's respect, the admiration of children, and the romantic involvement of the women he is able to talk to.

He is confronted by a rancher by the name of Dan Evans, played magnificently by Van Heflin, who sees his world changed because of his loss of a leg during the war. His children are hungry, he lives in a modest house, and his wife... no longer looks up to him. He is dying to get a job that pays enough so he can protect his family and continue to live on a farm that provides a dry climate for his youngest son who suffers from respiratory ailments.

Dan Evans accepts a job to help the law capture and deliver Wade to a prison. The odds are all against them because of Wade's reputation, ease with weapons and with his hands, and the gang of sharp-shooting cowboys that not only follow him, but are ready to give their lives to protect their leader.

The simple rancher develops a relationship with the outlaw... and both begin to admire each other and wish circumstances were different... for each has those things the other would kill to obtain... the simple rancher has the family, the home, the wife, the love of his children... the outlaw has the admiration, courage, and money that would permit the rancher to satisfy the needs of his loved ones...

Russell Crowe is able to bring a villain to life that is somehow capable of quoting the Bible and at the same time... break every commandment the Bible talks about... But you will love the interaction between the actors. We were pleasantly surprised to see Peter Fonda again... it has been a long time, and he gives the usual grand performance as he plays the role of adversary and bounty hunter... following Wade's trail.

The special features are excellent and they provide a view as to the way the film is capable of simply capturing our attention in this fast paced... Magnificent Western!!!

1593830,5,B00005JPXP,"Who may doubt the Western genre is for North America the nest of the mythical call? Because the honour, the pride and the reason to live or the fear of death are nothing compared with certain values that hardly may be bought.

Let's be honest, since the times of ""Tombstone"", we had not had the chance to enjoy plainly the last borders of the boldness and braveness that sometimes emerges from the spirit of a simple man. This similar issue was dealt by John Huston in ""The red badge of courage"" and Howard Hawks in ""The sergeant York"".

The epic effort to capture one of the most feared gunfighters - Ben Wade - will make a humble farmer and devoted man finds the bliss of his life due the several points of view exchanged with this sinister outlaw, due the brutal chase of the partners of Ben to avoid he be sent to prison . The only other reference of a thinker outlaw I remember was Robert Ryan in ""The naked spur""

The epic stature of this man is absolutely recognized through the unsaid attitude of Ben Wade, and that's explains the reason of his behaviour in the last sequence of the film.

It's useless to say the memorable performance given by Russell Crowe, who supports by far, the dramatis personae, his particular vision of the world, influences and at the same time is influenced by the vision of Bayle, as the devoted father who really wants his family be definitively the owners of his ranch.

James Mangold (Memento), is superb as director, with marvellous angle shots and realistic atmosphere.

Delmer Davis was the director in the first version, Van Heflin is the blood farmer and Glenn Ford is the outlaw.

plot spoilers below.

Other people have pointed out plot flaws. The movie is just a well shot western patina applied over handsome actors doing nonsensical stuff. What bothered me was that this movie was an exercise in wish fulfillment for anxiety ridden baby boomers. It had all the classic mid-life anxiety themes:
(1) my snotty teenage son doesn't respect me.
(2) my wife is no longer attracted to me.
(3) I'm screwed up because I had bad parents.
(4) the bad boy always gets the girl.
(5) I haven't been successful at work.

So what does he do? He performs an outrageous act of principle which, in the end, gains him the respect and admiration of everyone involved. Even the bad guy is overcome with admiration.

The movie that you end up with is a whiny, nonsensical mess. I'll give it credit for one thing: it looked good. It was well shot. The villains looked like villains, and beautiful women were working on farms or tending bars in tiny towns. However, the substance of this movie was garbage.",1202342400,18,1268,4.476190476190476

1593833,2,B00005JPXP,"There is a lot of good photography and some exciting set pieces, and there are bits of good acting in this movie, and even a few scenes that work pretty well.  But the high points are overwhelmed by numerous plot points wherein characters do inexplicably stupid things or things contrary to the nature of the character.  This happens mostly with the good guys, but also a couple times with bad guy Russell Crowe.  My wife and I paused the movie halfway through because it got late and I was tired and the next day she had to convince me that we should finish it so at least we knew what happened.  But my wife also felt that the movie was, as a whole, unbelievable due to these many plot holes and inconsistencies.  It seems to me that a supposedly exciting movie should hook you in better than that.

I also have to say that this is the 2nd movie I have ever seen with the adult Christian Bale (back in the 80's I saw `Empire of the Sun') and I have yet to be impressed.  Of course the other film was `Batman Begins' which stinks in too many ways to count.  But anyway, so far, it is my opinion that the adult Christian Bale seems to be a 1.5 note player.  He's good at doing that vacant, angst-ridden stare that is so popular these days, the expression into which bad directors hope the audience will project their own emotions so as to save the artists some work.  But not much more.

Another thing: some critic said this is the best western since `Unforgiven.'  Please!  Not that `Unforgiven' was all that great, heck, `High Plains Drifter' and `Outlaw Josie Wales' are tons better.  But truly, the best western since `Unforgiven' was `Brokeback Mountain.'  And for crimony sakes, `Brokeback Mountain' was better than `Unforgiven.'

I will concede, however, that watching `3:10 to Yuma' is better than watching no western at all.  But is it better than just watching a rerun of `Gunsmoke' or `Kung Fu'?  I don't think so.",1202256000,4,1925,4.498559077809798
1593834,5,B00005JPXP,"This is a very good modern Western.  Yes, it uses the same title, mostly the same characters, and the plot is similar in most of its core points, it is still a different version of the story than the 1957 movie.  And I gather that both are different than the Elmore Leonard story from which the movies draw their inspiration.

This movie is much more violent, has a longer and more event filled journey to Contention, and there is a difference in what is being robbed, what happens to the wagon, and the makeup of group taking Ben Wade to meet that fateful train to Yuma.  The move from the hotel to the train is much longer and terribly more violent than the 1957 version as are the moments before the train to Yuma leaves.  Remember this is a modern tragedy and has different conventions than the movies had in 1957.

Christian Bale plays his Dan Evans as a defeated and desperate man than Van Heflin did.  However, Bale draws us in and we participate in his struggle more than we observe it.  Russell Crowe is just as good as Ben Wade.  He is less charming than Glenn Ford's version, but shows his more refined side in different ways.  For example, Crowe's Ben Wade likes to draw and does it pretty well.  Both versions of Wade try to use charm, then bribery, then terrible threats.  Crowe's Wade demonstrates his violence where Ford's characterization implies it after the opening shooting.  The difference is probably more about what movies were not allowed to do fifty years ago.  In any case, the movie is really about Dan Evans and why he persists in a task that, in the end, no one cares to see done as much as it is about the outlaw Ben Wade.

One key difference in the way the versions are told is that this movie is about Dan proving himself to his sons, especially to his oldest son, William (Logan Lerman), where the 1957 movie was about Dan regaining the confidence of his wife, Alice (Gretchen Mol), who has a much smaller role in this movie.  Dan's sons are older in this telling.

Do I prefer one version over the other?  I think they are different movies and enjoy them both on their own terms.  However, I would feel much more comfortable showing the older version to young people than the new version because of the intensity of the violence in the new movie.  But don't think the new version is a blood and guts splatter film.  It isn't.  But it is intense and much darker than the older film.

Very good and a fine Western.

1593835,3,B00005JPXP,"This is short and to the point. This western, while full of good acting, action and being in color, falls very short of the book and the original ""3:10 To Yuma"" with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. The orignal used acting and suspense to carry the movie, not killing every body in sight, as is the case here. There were just too many things inserted that made this implausible, like the ""standard sex scene for a rating"", too many unnecessary killing to digress from the plot. Only one scene was required to show the coldness of Dan Wade....the stage coach scene and shooting his own man to get at the driver. Beyond that, most of the deaths were added for ""drama"". The original 3:10 used that opening scene, the hanging of the ""drunk"" and the killing of Charlie at the end, to fully establish that there was some meaness going on in the plot.
The Peter Fonda charater was dumb, as was the mine scene. We already knew that Dan Wade could kill.

I kinda of enjoyed the film until the killing got stupid and then Dan got blown away (not one bullit or two bullits, but the whole bloody gun) and the ending just ended with a horse running. I immediately turned to DishNetwork recording of the original so I could see the better ending and hear Frankie Laine put the whole movie to bed with his great ""3:10 To Yuma"" song.

1593837,1,B00005JPXP,"The movie opens with a farmer whose barn is being burned because the area is going to have a train run through it and someone wants his land.  This is followed by a stage coach robbery with Russell Crowe as the leader of the gang. Everyone looks suitably dirty and Crowe gets to wear the ""black outfit complete with hat.""  Move to a saloon where Crowe is talking to the lady bartender. She doesn't fit into this movie since she obviously has escaped from a Vogue photoshot so she disappears. Crowe is captured.  The farmer is asked to take Crowe to the train so that he can be held for trial. Crowe's fellow bandits follow them (Indians appear and disappear for no reason since this is not about fighting Indians). The farmer is left alone with Crowe and his gang (who are present to save Crowe)waiting for the train. There is a marshall with the farmer but he leaves because he says he is frightened. Crowe (after finding out the farmer is trying to impress his son) shoots all of his gang so they can't save him.  The farmer is shot to death.  Crowe then gets on the train, whistles for his horse and the train pulls out with his horse running along side. Peter Fonda is in the movie but only for a short time since he falls off the side of a mountain.  I don't remember why.

The movie does not flow.  It hops from one scene to another which completely destroys the interaction between the farmer, his son and the robber.  There are too many things added which have no bearing on the story (Indians, surgery on a man who appears to have plastic intestines, and a lady barkeeper). Overall, the movie is a waste of time.

There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in the ""one/two-star"" reviews, but it comes down to this; The actors are good, the scenery is good, the cinematography is good and the costumes are good.  Even the basic concept of the movie is pretty good - murderous criminal captured and needs to be transported to prison.  The execution, however, is where this film falls so flat that any good aspects are overshadowed by its shortcomings.  Granted, the film wouldn't be particularly exciting without some shoot-em-up scenes along the way, but the series of events that take place along the trip become increasingly far-fetched and eventually culminate into an ending that is both unbelievable, and utterly ludicrous.  Crowe plays his character as well as anyone could within the constraints of the script, but his inconsistent and counter-intuitive behaviors would only make sense were he to be suffering from a multiple-personality disorder, but we are never given the slightest indication that he is insane, just bloodthirsty.  To top it all off, Crowe's admiration of Bale's character would be better classified as ""pity"" because he never really does anything admirable, he just tells one sob story after another, which Crowe seems to take a liking to for one reason or another.  I can't, for the life of me, understand why people are giving this 4 and 5 stars.  3 I could see, but we need to expect more from Hollywood than this, or they won't have any reason to make films any better.",1202083200,15,1674,4.886925795053004

Why would Crowe suddenly turn on his own men and kill them? Why wouldn't Bale's character shoot Crowe's character rather than let him escape?

Yes, the ending is different than the original 1957 version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma-Special-Edition/dp/B000TGJ82Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition)</a>), starring Glen Ford and Van Heflin. In fact, the ending is what prevents me from giving this film a five star rating. But that doesn't mean it's a bad ending, just one that I was personally a little disappointed in. Over all, the ending is exciting even if it is a little improbable. And the bit about the horse? People, it's a hint that Wade plans to escape the train relatively quickly.

The movie, based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, follows the plot of the 1957 version pretty closely. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher who had his foot shot off in the war. Russell Crown plays Ben Wade, the leader of a vicious outlaw gang. As the film opens, Evans and his two sons witness a brutal ambush and robbery of a Pinkerton crew trying to deliver a payroll to the railroad. As the movie progresses, Wade is captured in town and needs to be taken to the town of Contention to be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma. Evans volunteers for the price of $200 to help escort the prisoner. What follows is an epic journey that finds members of the escort getting killed, the remaining group fighting off an ambush by indians (with help from Wade). losing their prisoner then having to save him from vigilantes, and finally the arrival in Contention to face the outlaw gang.

Throughout the film we're treated to great acting, a wonderful plot, exciting yet thought provoking, and a perfect soundtrack.

In these things, it becomes a pseudo-Western; if it *does* revive the Western genre, I hope its successors don't commit its same atrocities.

The film is an exercise in Implausible Plotting. Cowboys and lawmen of the Old West escort a Notorious Outlaw across the wilderness and leave his hands cuffed in front of him, even after he kills two of the escort party in ways he never could have done had they just bothered to tie him up. Said cowboys and lawmen send a decoy ""outlaw"" in a stagecoach to throw the bad guys off the trail of the escort, and they just happen to lock the unfortunate decoy in the stage *for real* without giving him a key, so he can burn to death when the gang catches up and discovers his identity.  Said cowboys and lawmen, armed and holding the higher ground, look out a hotel window to engage in conversation with the Notorious Outlaw's psychotically murderous gang, and then allow them to ride away unaccosted after several death threats, so the carnage can come later. What sane person would behave as these characters do? They act stupidly so dramatic tension can last longer.

Yes, the scenery is lovely. Yes, the acting is pretty much flawless, but who would have expected less from Crowe and Bale? The character actions and the conclusion are the problem here. After seeing this film, my 18-year-old brother remarked, ""Well, if that was reality, I'd definitely wanna be on the side of the bad guys ... all the good guys were either stupid or wimpy.""

The concern belongs to the people who need to bring him to justice. The group of volunteers includes a desperate, but honorable man (Christian Bale) who is willing to take on the risk of getting Wade to the train in Yuma that will take him to jail.

I have frequently and even recently said that I do not like Russell Crowe, but he was very good in this role. It was impressive to see him pull off a character who can seem so innocent and trustworthy but is capable of horrible things if you cross him. He was not the star, however.

Ben Foster. I wish I could say that we will see more of this guy in roles like this, but unfortunately I don't see it. (I won't call this a fluke, because he definitely has talent, but I really believe this was the kind of role that comes along once in a lifetime.) He was the consumate outlaw. His fierce loyalty to Wade made him a very bad man, which translated into one of my favorite on-screen villains.

1593926,3,B00005JPXP,"I hate westerns but everyone told me this would be different. And I do like Russel Crowe and Christian Bale so I decided to check it out. Well, at the end of the movie, I was right about my previous thinking. That I knew it would feel like a western, and it sure did. It looked like a western, it sounded and acted like a western, and there was nothing new or interesting about it. I do have to give props to Ben Foster for his role in this, it was quite chilling. But other than the acting, which was quite good, you still have to deal with the bleak boring imagery and the cliches, and the predictable ending. And Christian Bale jumping across rooftops with a damaged leg.....Yea. OK... I gave it a 3 out of 5 because of the acting, which is what kept me awake.
I suppose, if you actually enjoy watching westerns, you'll probably love this film, but for those of us who don't, well, there are plenty of other genres around.",1201564800,,925,4.261363636363637
1593927,5,B00005JPXP,"Ok, so I'm certainly not much of a fan when it comes to westerns but 3:10 to Yuma gets me in the mood for them. This feels like Russell Crowe's best film since Gladiator and Christen Bales best film ever. In the beginning the movie starts with a blazing fire. Even though it starts off with such an exciting scene I started to doubt it for some reason. Christen Bale plays Dan Evans who is a hardworking rancher and former soldier trying to take care of his family. The problem is his land is in a drought and he isn't making any money.

Because of these things his eldest son constantly disrespects him throughout the movie. Evans barn is burned down by men working for Grant Hollander whom he owes money. The next morning while looking for his lost herd with his two sons Evans finds something he shouldn't have. Outlaw Ben Wade and gang robbing an armored stagecoach. As Evans and his sons try to back off Wade hears their horses and goes after them before they can get too far.

Wade takes their horses so they can't run to tell about what just happened and that's how the two first meet. Now, after Evans finds out that he is going to be kicked off of his land because the government is trying to build a railroad he takes matters into his own hands. He goes in an empty bar with a shotgun looking for Hollander but finds Ben Wade. Wade is then caught and planned to be taken to the 3:10 to Yuma but some muscle is needed to get him there. Evans volunteers with a guarantee that he'll be given $200 dollars. Now they're all in for one crazy ride just to get a man on a train.

I have seen only a few westerns but this is one that can take the genre to new generations. The story is a good one, it's simple but it still keeps your interest because you want to see if these few guys can get Wade to Yuma. Also there is a bit of a mystery inside the character development. Evans and Wade start to develop a relationship that adds to the movies realness. The acting was spot on, Russell Crowe's talent was a great acquisition to this film and I can't imagine another man playing Ben Wade. Christen Bale was good but his better scenes didn't come until the end of the movie.

The action was great, it had amazing scenes of gunplay and a perfect blend of action and drama. I also loved the movies pace, just as I thought it was a bit dry it went into gear and took it to another level. 3:10 to Yuma is one awesome flick that I think many will enjoy. Although my grandfather says ""Unforgiven"" was much better I think this may give some life to the western genre. Trust me, after you see this, you very well may go pick up some Clint Eastwood movies.",1201564800,4,2647,4.225296442687747
1593928,3,B00005JPXP,"Whether or not you believe the old is better than the  new or vice versa is probably largely dependent on the era you come from and how much extra blood, gunfire and gore is needed to complete the experience for you.  The new version's story line continues along much of the same theme of course, but with lots more violence and at least one unnecessary doodad thrown in - the construction camp thing - which made me wonder who came up with that one and why.

It was an experiment for me, and I hastened to view the older version before the new one came out, simply for the pleasure of seeing them side by side and making a comparison.  (I also did a review on the excellent old original Glenn Ford, Van Heflin film) For me, Glenn Ford's cold, calculating Ben Wade came across better than Russell Crowe's version simply because he never let his character portrayal cross over the line from bad boy to ""misunderstood boy"" even while working his mind games, something that was an important element for me.  Intelligent, cruel, ruthless, the master of self-control and manipulation, it is easy to see how a varmint like that would reign supreme over his miscreant followers and command a dark, dependent loyalty.  The character of Ben Wade was complex and difficult to construct, no doubt and both actors did a good job of it.  Both supporting casts were well-chosen, and the youth who followed his father hoping to somehow protect as well as support him against the long odds, and as a result had to grow up literally overnight did a remarkable job in the new version.

The ending of the new version held a more satisfying parting twist in the same sequence of events as the old one, I must admit.  As the train is pulling out of the station, it leaves behind a morass of death, agony and destruction - but not the faithful cow horse who will undoubtedly receive an extra helping of oats that night if any are around to be stolen.",1201478400,,1928,4.517241379310345

Peter Fonda was also good, although he receives a gunshot to the torso at close range (clearly a lethal wound in the 19th century), and is no worse for wear after being patched up by the local veterinarian! This is a small criticism, though. My major problem with the movie is the ending, which I found baffling. Russell Crowe's gang of outlaws (who presumably he had worked with for years) loyally fights to free him, but because he admires Christian Bale's character so much(?),he responds in a way which only a Hollywood screenwriter would find plausible.

But, as a parent of a teenager, the universal conflict between parent and teenager, the theme of respect of parent, respect of one human being to another,  the theme of not just the typical Good vs Bad, but the many shades of goodNESS and badNESS and Redemption, especially when it isn't the stereotypical, dessert on the plate variety, was profound and gripped me throughout the movie. The ending was superb. Was it a bit of a stretch in what is Reality? Maybe, but that stretch added to the Godliness of what was being accomplished. Like God intervened to carry the Universal Themes of this story to it's bittersweet conclusion. I'm not going to give the story away; others have done that already, but the Modern American Western Film, when done right, brings movie-making and movie-viewing to a whole other height, that films placed in Modernity, just don't hit as they fall into the ""same old; same old"" mundanity. The starkness of the past, the beauty of what was America, the stripping away of ""things"", Man and Women, small creatures compared to the Grandeur that is Nature and its Vastness of that era, that lack of gadgetry, the beauty of horses, the Simplicity of a Time Past, but yet so complex in its own way.

1593961,5,B00005JPXP,"I love a good Western and for my money this one ranks right up there with the best of them. The plot is easily set out.

Dan Evans, a veteran of the Civil War which cost him a leg has moved to the Arizona Territory with his family to try his luck at cattle ranching. Ben Wade is the head of an outlaw gang which has been marauding through the Territory, attacking stagecoaches, robbing banks and killing all who stand in or near their way. Eventually, Wade is captured and through a series of events, Evans is deputized as a part of a posse which is to take Wade to the Town of Contention and put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma which has a jail cell in it's baggage car.

Wade's gang is still at large and are determined to see that Wade is never put on that train.

The story of the trip involves many insights into the characters in the drama, not the least of which is that of Ben Wade, played well and thoughtfully by Russell Crowe. Wade is most definitely a violent man and a killer. He also is an artist and a philosopher about some matters which he shares with Evans during the crucible they are passing through as they make their way to Contention.

The movie is blessed with many fine actors who make their parts come alive and which give depth and interest to the dangerous business they are all engaged in. The special effects are well done and the movie reeks of authenticity.

1593962,5,B00005JPXP,"a great movie, one of those like tombstone you can watch over and over.  the plot problems ive read here are more about movie goers who are ignorant of black powder weapons, horses and fighting for your life.

wade is complex with a wierd moral code who meets up with a flawed man he comes to respect. their interaction is what this movie is about.  the ending is superb, when crowes character acts violently because of a newly developed friendship that is based on 'respect' rather then time and familiarity.

edit below:
i feel compelled to defend the film in certain areas so i have made comments to some of the reviews.  here is a synopsis
the ending first:
if this had been a movie about a outlaw who spent a week seeking revenge for the murder of his best friend by a gang of outlaws he had ridden with before, there would be no problem understanding the plot, or in this case the ending.  but since the murder of the bale character (who had become wades best friend) took place so quickly and the revenge followed even more quickly people are confused by it.  the ending is the one part of the film that is truly crystal clear.  great friendships can happen quickly sort of like love at first sight.  wades character was missing a relationship in his life with someone he truly could 'respect' when he found that person and he was murdered right in front of him, he reacted violently after all he was a killer.

on the fonda charater getting shot:
the black powder cartridges being fired in the converted black powder muzzle loader pistols did not contain much stopping power (wades colt might have used more powder). maybe 8 to 12 or even 16 grains of black powder, these projectiles did not have much velocity or foot pounds of energy on the target and the energy drops drastically with distance so when they hit it was about like poking a hole in someone with a sharp stick, this is why many old time outlaws survived multiple gunshot wounds and continued to fight. Jesse James survived being shot in the lungs. therefore penetration through a tough abdominal wall could indeed slow the bullet enough to not do much damage internally but it was a good idea to get the bullet out, and since there was no real shock or trauma just a hole a person could indeed get up and pursue their mission. the old mountain men survived much worse wounds and still survived on their own, as have men in modern combat. did you see masters and commanders? was mark wahlbergs character having a sucking chest wound in 3 kings realistic?

the exploding horse incident:
dynamite concussion does not carry well through the air, if it is confined then its expansion is catastrophic, or if it is wrapped with a chains or other objects it will cause damage with the flying shrapnel, otherwise its just a really big shove, so the horse and rider carrying it would be blown to bits by the concussion and the shock wave that is left would reach out and do little damage.

the other plot twists are explainable and believable for people under stress for their lives. which includes why the sherriff abandoned the bale character, and why they didn't expose themselves to being shot by leaning out a window to shoot into the street etc. even the burning stage coach incident is believable, i'm sure in hindsight the person in the stagecoach wished he had done things differently but thats how people die in combat or law enforcement, mis-judging the enemies capabilities can be fatal.

the burning stage coach guy not doing the hollywood scream:
this isn't really a problem, did you ever see the monks burning in vietnam while protesting back in the 60's? not a squeal, people who are rapidly burned to death often don't scream because their body shuts down and they can not respond. many fatal burn victims are found in a completely rigid state with their fists tightly cleanched, that is the body shutting down. some burns that are less damaging are more painful and therefore allow more responce.

(edit: my son a doctor reminded me of a couple of other points:
1: if the oxygen is burnt inside the stage coach rapidly there is no air to expel a scream.
2: if a person breathes super heated air the lungs throat and larnyx are toasted and no longer function.  the movie got it right.)

the limp problem: i have to review the film to look for it but since the amputation was well below the knee he may have only limped when the prosthesis was irritating.  but its not that big of a deal in my opinion.

the difficulty that i see is that when people see an event depicted in film that is close to reality they don't recognize it because their lifes experience is based on other hollywood movies. spend some time watching the discovery, history and military channels, the truth is out there.

the only question i have is how the horse heard the whistle over the train noise, and why they didn't just shoot the horses of the stagecoach they were robbing but robbers chasing down a stage coach is very old hollywood tradition, beyond that i found this movie to be very believable.

for those determined to not like this film because of plot problems and continuity alone, i am afraid you are destined to a life without the imagination of our fellows, entertaining us.  movie makers do ask that we lower our credulity meter at least a little.  the naysayers may be better off reading the tax code of the u.s. for entertainment, thus keeping it very real.",1201132800,4,5430,4.564814814814815

White and black hats just won't do. You'll have to rassle up a barn full of gray hats 'cuz the good guys are a little bad, and the bad guys are a little good, and a whole bunch are in between.

Christian Bale plays Dale Evans, a down-on-his-luck one-legged rancher that's an Indian head penny away from losing his ranch to some downright unlikeable note-holders. His wife doesn't have any faith in him and questions his every decision. His oldest son thinks he's a coward. Fate however, has dropped a potential solution to his dilemma in his lap-- escorting the notorious gun slinging bank robber Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the train (3:10 to Yuma) that will bring him to prison. Completing this task with the limited help of a rag-tag posse will garner Dale $200, enough to get him out of his jam. The only thing standing in his way is Ben Wade's gang. You see Wade's gang, led by his psychopathic 2nd in command (Ben Foster), is hell bent on springing Wade from the posse before it delivers Wade to the train.

There are some great switch-a-roos as far as who's in command of the situation. And in this very gray landscape of what's right or wrong, good or bad, brave or cowardly, there's plenty to think about.

1593965,4,B00005JPXP,"Fifteen years ago, Unforgiven was hailed as the return of the western to Hollywood. Not much in this genre has been produced since (certainly nothing to match the fantastic Unforgiven). Now, 3:10 To Yuma has arrived to once again prove the western is not dead. While not quite as good as Unforgiven, this film is excellent, and will be enjoyed by anyone who likes some thoughtfullness to go along with their action.
  3:10 To Yuma is a remake of a 1957 film of the same title. I have not seen the original, so I could approach the remake on its own merits, without comparisons. After watching the remake and liking it, I intend to track down the original and watch that too.
  The first thing that struck me while watching the new film was the cinematography, direction, and editing. This movie looks stunning. The way it was shot is fantastic, and really adds to the atmosphere of the story. Some of the reaction shots were so perfectly placed I watched them several times just to see how the editor put the sequence together. Great job by the director and his crew! How 3:10 To Yuma got shut out of Oscar nominations for best director, best cinematography, and best film editing is beyond me.
  All of the actors turn in excellent performances. While Russell Crowe does a good (if uninspired) job, the film really belongs to Christian Bale. This man is an excellent actor if he's given a role he can really stretch himself in. Bale can express conflicted emotions with just a look, and his role in this film definitely makes great use of his talents. The fact that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film just seems wrong. Rivalling Bale's performance is Ben Foster as Charlie Prince. Foster gleefully plays his role to the hilt. I can imagine the real-life Jesse James' personality might have been something like Ben Foster's character. An outstanding performance.
  The story is excellent, and really draws you in. There is a suspense level through most of the film, which is a necessity in a western. The suspense is really ratcheted up in the last 30 minutes of the film, leading to the conclusion. No spoilers here! While I didn't love the ending, the film would be radically different without it, and I'm not sure if it would be better or worse. You basically just have to accept that all of the characters' actions and motivations could POSSIBLY happen in the real world. A bit to much of a deux ex machina ending, but it does wrap up the story to a satisfying conclusion. Watch the film and see what you think.
  I would definitely recommend this film to all. While the ending was a bit weak in my eyes (I would have given the film 5 stars with a better ending), the film is excellent overall, and is a satisfying and enjoyable experience.",1201132800,,2780,4.609311740890688
1594002,5,B00005JPXP,"There have been many attempts to revisit the Western genre. Happily, this one works and I think the sparse, but exquisite use of language and the vivid setting (which, thank goodness, was filmed outside and not on a studio lot) adds much to the movie. There were some key sentences that jumped out of this film and I've noted them below. If you see the film, try to listen for them and see if they resonate as strongly for you.

I found 3:10 to Yuma to be primarily a character-driven movie, although there is no denying that there is plenty of action as well. To my mind, this is Christian Bale's strongest, most mature and multi-faceted performance to date, although fans of his other roles might find that point debatable. If so, I'll concede the point since I'm wavering on that position anyway. Still, if I had to choose right now - today - I'd say this is his seminal film, if only for the way he manages to convey the ambivalence at the heart of a world-weary man, trying to find the energy to pull off one last desperate move.

  The basic plot of the movie is simple. Dan Evans (played by Bale) is a rancher who is having a hard time making ends meet. He is at a pivotal point in history, just before trains were commonplace everywhere. Evans is hoping to take a renowned criminal, Ben Wade, to the Yuma train (the 3:10 to Yuma, hence the title) and collect a $200 reward for his efforts. Russell Crowe brings Wade to life, quite skillfully.

  Both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are well-matched, each playing off the other perfectly. Director James Mangold made the choice to use a lot of close-ups and this works well to emphasize the character studies in this film. Pay special heed to Bale's portrayal of a tormented man whose facial expressions are just as important as his words. The pivotal words of his? To me, they are these: ""I""ve been standing on one leg for three damn years waiting for God to do me a favor - and he ain't listening."" Still, he wants to be a good man, wants his wife and sons to respect him and see him as honorable. That is a key element of his life. He is also more drawn to the dark side of things than he cares to admit.

  Russell Crowe has a particularly risky role because he has to play ""the bad guy"", but not as a simplistic one-dimensional criminal. He has to make the part his own. That he did so still amazes me. His key words won't make sense till you see the film but they are: ""I read the Bible from cover to cover. It took me three days. She never came back.""

  Before moving on to the special features available on the DVD, I'd like to give a nod to Peter Fonda's strong performance in this film as well as other actors who I don't have time to describe in detail here.

  The theme of the movie revolves around the complicated and very difficult path to righteousness and all the ways that one can veer away from that path - as well as muddy the waters. It is a very slippery slope, a point driven home by this movie.

  Okay, the special features: I have to say that even if this movie had been terrible, I'd have considered buying it for the features alone because of the historical information contained in them.

 After making a western which often gives sway to the mythological, even fanciful aspects of history, the features focus on the truth behind the fiction. The whole Western genre is explored as well as such famous outlaws as James Younger and his gang and Black Bart. Particularly noteworthy was the detailed information about how Western outlaws and Civil War veterans connected, particularly those who'd fought for the South.

  This one is absolutely jam-packed with special features, including a look at how the film was made. The section on the actors and their connection to the horses was intriguing. While two of the actors loved being on horses and riding, one did not. I won't spoil the suspense of finding out which actor in this film said that he hated riding. It was amusing. Also fascinating? Describing how they got a train on location.

  One of the best films I've seen in awhile, highly recommended, although typically bloody and gritty, as you might expect.  After seeing this, go have a look at the original movie and think about what this one says about our contemporary culture, based on the aspects of morality and other issues explored in the remake.",1201132800,25,4351,4.480354879594423

Ironically, 3:10 to Yuma wasn't one of his recent novels. In fact it was one of his early published short stories (circa 1953). And the 2007 movie has been mislabeled as a remake of the 1957 film adaptation of Leonard's short story. No, 3:10 to Yuma 2007 is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-the-Line/dp/B000E8QVWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk the Line</a>&nbsp;Director Jame's Mangold's adaptation of Leonard's story...not so much a remake of the 1957 film.

And 3:10 to Yuma (2007) is a terrific adaptation. It's as predictable as Western's come. It's a simple story of a group of good guys that need to escort the bad guy to his fate before the bad guy's gang can come to his rescue. You've got cowboys. Indians. Shoot outs. Tales told around camp fires. It's everything that you'd expect from a good Western. Which means the over-acting of the 50s is out and more realistic dialogue and actions are in...for the most part.

Some of the action and especially some of the actions go a bit beyond realistic...especially towards the climax, but overall 3:10 to Yuma is a fun Western played out by a complete A-list cast that should not be missed if you're into the genre.",1200960000,,1354,5.206422018348624

Westerns simply don't work these day because of all the special fx in movies. With a lo fi action it just seemed like a made for tv movie.(low budget). The plot was simple and offered no twists. The ending was ridiculous to the point of being laughable.

The Blue ray disc- terrible. There was lots of ghosting effects in dark scenes. Lots of grain in the light scenes. And distortions in the close up scenes.

In conclusion I regret buying this disc and should have rented on Netflix first. The only positive is Crowe and Bale and watching Luke Wilson get shot.",1200960000,2,682,4.491935483870968
1594006,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma takes us back to the Wild West, an unstable and dangerous place. The movie revolves around its two main characters, outlaw Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and crippled but capable rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale). Despite living by a strict code of honor for which he would die, Rancher Evans receives no respect from his sons or his wife and is on the verge of losing his ranch. He longs to win back the admiration of his family. Enter the dangerous and enigmatic outlaw Ben Wade. Rancher Evans seizes an opportunity to hold on to his ranch and perhaps win a little bit of respect from his family when he puts himself in great danger from Ben Wade's gang by agreeing to escort Ben Wade to the train route known as the 3:10 to Yuma for a sum of $200.00. A momentous battle of wills takes place between Wade and Evans. Wade is a larger than life outlaw who, in addition to being a sociopath, has such charisma and power of will he probably could convince a man to jump in front of a speeding train. He persistently tempts Evans with his heart's desires in exchange for letting him walk away. Evans, however, has a strength of character that holds tremendous sway over Wade. The tension builds as we wonder if one can conquer the will of the other. For Wade, his life hangs in the balance as his gang fast approaches to rescue him from the clutches of the law. For Evans, this seems to be his last chance to hold on to his ranch and win back his family's admiration. The ending was not quite what I wanted but nonetheless was not totally predictable. Overall I would say this movie is a success and is thoroughly entertaining. If only the ending were more appealing to me, I would have given it a fifth star.",1200787200,,1713,4.389937106918239

Some have called this the best western since ""Unforgiven.""  If that's true then the western genre has fallen quite a bit since that great one featuring Clint Eastwood.

If you want your western to be action packed but monotonous then you'll like this film, but don't compare it to the Eastwood greats from the past.  It is not in that category.  It is good for a pleasant ride through an afternoon, but you won't want to watch it over and over again the way you might with ""Tombstone.""  It's just not good enough a film for that.

1594011,5,B00005JPXP,"""3:10 to Yuma"" was a worthy representive of the reprisal of the Western genre seen recently on the silver screen.  Russell Crowe acknowledged as one of the finest actors on the scene today was superb as heinous, calculating outlaw Ben Wade.  Christian Bale equalled his intensity in his role as crippled Civil War veteran and struggling Arizona rancher Dan Evans.

Based on an Elmore Leonard short story, director James Mangold adroitly used the beautifully sculpted New Mexico countryside to frame his drama.  Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and a series of authentic looking sets captured the flavor of the gritty and grimy old West.

Crowe playing the shrewd yet somewhat moralistic badman gets captured after his remorseless gang robs the stage headed for Bisbee, Arizona.  Part of the armed guard aboard the stage consisted of a bounty hunter Byron McElroy played in a rare appearance by an aged Peter Fonda.  A posse outfitted by the Southern Railroad gets commissioned to bring the shackled Crowe to Contention where the prison train to Yuma will pick him up.  Bale desperate for money and determined to elevate his depleted status in the eyes of his family signs on for the job.  They set out on a perilous journey through Apache country trailed by Crowe's murderous gang now led by a mean spirited and quick drawing demon Charlie Prince played nicely by Ben Foster.

Along the way members of the posse get winnowed out but they are joined by Bale's son William played by newcomer Logan Lerman, who'd disobeyed his father's orders to stay home.  As they arrive in Contention it turns out that the obsessed Bale must by himself escort Crowe to the train against the plethora of guns courtesy of Crowe's cabal.  By this time a mutual respect has developed between the adversaries on either side of the law.  In an unexpected twist from the original Crowe proves his mettle helping elevate Bale's worth under the watchful eyes of his 14 year old son.",1200614400,2,1958,4.8969696969696965

1594083,5,B00005JPXP,"Yes, it's a western, a remake, and yes, it's bloody and yes it's so terrific you will want to watch it again right after having finished it the first time.

Perfect acting by everyone. Russell Crowe is given the chance to show his amazing talent, to really dig into it. Christian Bale is marvellous as a father trying to make up for lost chances, finally doing it right.
But to me what struck me most, is the amazing talent of Logan Lerman who plays C. Bale's son. I have never before watched such a stunning performance by a 14 year old. No matter if he's in close up or riding a horse in the background, he's always focussed. Perfect!!!
Also the bad guys, most of all Ben Foster, are such dirtbags, you really wouldn't want to meet them. Neither in the dark nor the light.
Perfectly directed by James Mangold with a constant change in pace, great lighting, perfect composure - what is there left to say, I'm in awe!!!
One thing to reality: the bad guys somehow walk through almost any gunfight unhurt. Especially in the shootout scene at the end, there are many opportunities for Bale to finish off the meanest of the gang. Strangely enough he never gets the idea. Also when they are attacked by the Apaches, nobody puts out the fire which makes them the easiest target.
This is what makes it a five star movie, not more (with 5 extras for Logan Lerman). It's Hollywood, not real life.

As to the story: Based on a terrific short story by the great Elmore Leonhard, Christian Bale is Dan Evans, a poor rancher with a wife and two kids. He needs money badly to hold on to his farm. So he agrees to help out in getting Ben Wade, a captured outlaw (Russell Crowe) onto the train to Yuma. Amidst all the action (involving Crow's gang, dirty businessmen, a handful Apaches, Chinese railroad workers, a sexy singer, Peter Fonda as an avenging bounty hunter) you have the psychological dialogue/duel between the good (Bale) and the evil (Crowe).
As they get closer, they discover that in their hearts they are not so different after all. Both have their dark sides and the good. Which is going to win, and with whom? Will Wade have mercy with the farmer or will Evans give in to the money that is being offered to him in case he would give up the fight for justice?

BluRay? YES, YES and YES!!! Marvellous, sound, sharpness, depth, color, shadows, detail.
A terrific film!",1200614400,16,2367,4.5

1594088,5,B00005JPXP,"Director James Mangold revives the classic allegorical Western in ""3:10 to Yuma"", a reworking of the 1957 film of the same name with themes both contemporary and timeless. It's set in the Arizona Territory of the iconic post-Civil War 1860s, when disaffected Confederates continued to terrorize the United States and its industries in the form of outlaw gangs, and the transcontinental railroad was blasting its way through the American West, which was still an untamed, indifferent landscape of dust, settlers, bandits, and businessmen, a land of great opportunity and rapid ruin.

Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a veteran of the Union army struggling to hold onto his ranch as the man who owns his mortgage tries to force him out. Desperate to save his land, Evans accepts $200 from Mr. Butterfield (Dallas Roberts) of the Southern Pacific Railroad to help escort notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the town of Contention, where he'll be put on a train to Yuma to stand trial for 22 robberies of payroll coaches. Wade's gang, now led by trigger-happy Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), vows to free its leader and kill his captors.

Dan Evans is a man maimed by war, impoverished by his commitment to his family, who has lost the faith of his wife and teenaged son. Ben Wade's brutality and cunning made him a wealthy man with little opportunity to enjoy his success, and he has grown weary of the fugitive life. Much of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is about the value judgments that people make under unforgiving circumstances. How much is his family's livelihood worth to Dan? What should he sacrifice to assure their well-being? To what lengths should Ben go to preserve his life and liberty?

Wade is widely reviled by common folk for all the men he has killed. But Butterfield wants him hanged for all the money he has stolen. Which is worth more, lives or capital? The film doesn't shy away from Wade's brutality or the violence of frontier life. Wade and Pinkerton bounty hunter Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) are two of a kind, on opposite sides of the law. Ironically, McElroy is mercenary, while Wade has a value system, however destructive. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is an exciting Western action movie with gun battles, colorful characters, parched landscape, and complex, ambitious ideas.

The DVD (Lions Gate 2008): There are 7 deleted scenes, 3 featurettes, & a feature commentary. ""Destination Yuma"" (20 min) is a making-of documentary. Director James Mangold, writer Michael Brandt, the cast, and creative crew talk about constructing the towns, stunts and action sequences, costumes, the train and Contention. ""Outlaws, Gangs, & Posses"" (13 min) is about the realities of the outlaw gangs in the West. Several historians recount stories of real outlaws and explain their historical context. In ""An Epic Explored"" (6 min), Mangold talks about the Western as a classic form within which any sociopolitical issue can be explored. The audio commentary by director James Mangold in constant and informative. He discusses inspirations for the film, changes from the 1957 film, characterizations, where modern Westerns tend to go wrong, themes, the Western as allegory, and more.

1594089,2,B00005JPXP,"The actors are good, the scenery is good, the cinematography is good and the costumes are good, but many elements of the story are strikingly bogus. With the people and budget he had, the director could have made this film an Oscar nominee instead of an awful mess.
For example - early in the action the bad guys get in line-abreast in front of the stagecoach they are robbing, and charge like cavalry, giving the coachmen the maximum opportunity to shoot at them, then they get behind the coach where they can be shot with the gatling gun. Nobody smart enough the get on a horse is going to be that stupid. They would drop a tree or big rock in the road and shoot from behind cover.
Another example is the bounty hunter. He is shot in the stomach from close range. That can be dicey in the best modern trauma wards. At that time and place it was a death wound, but he is on his feet later that day and riding a horse the next. It was absurd.  Later, they are trying to sneak thru dangerous Indian country. They stop for the night and build a bonfire. They might as well have roasted marshmellows and sung camping songs. When the Indians come and start shooting, they huddle by the fire so they can be more visible while Russell Crowe walks up to the Indians and kills them ( they don't notice him coming ).

Many of the classic western elements are here, but there is a deeper character development than ever in early westerns.  This movie just goes to show that a very entertaining western can still be made today.  Much of it has all been done before, but there are enough twists and turns and action to keep this movie rolling along and to keep you interested in the characters all the way through.  Even if westerns are not your thing, you probably will enjoy this anyway.  Child warning:  This is a rather violent movie and probably not something for younger kids, due to the many killings.  In one scene a man is burned alive, although they don't really show it happening; just have him choking on the smoke prior to his demise and then the wagon engulfed in flames.  The one ""sex scene"" is not graphic at all and doesn't show much skin, so I wouldn't worry about that for the kids at all.  Am more concerned about the violence, but it is essential to the plot.  It is not too gruesome or overly graphic, but it's no Sunday picnic either.  There is a high body count, but we are dealing with a vicious gang here, so it is to be expected.

1594134,2,B00005JPXP,"I keep hearing that 3:10 is such a great western, the best since Unforgiven and even something in the footsteps of the western genre of old.  Well, sorry, but I don't see it.  3:10 starts out with a mediocre story and goes downhill from rapidly from there.  What it does have is beautiful photography and two exceptional lead actors.

In 3:10 to Yuma Russel Crow is charismatic as ""Bed Wade"" the evil, murderous thieving outlaw.  Although he plays the part well the character of Wade is so poorly defined that all that talent just goes to waste.  Wade's motivations are unclear and his actions almost haphazardly out of place with his character.

Christian Bale is ""Mr. Evans"" who signs on with a rag-tag team of towns and rail folk to transport Wade to Contention City and put him on the train to Yuma.  Each man who goes gets $200 and while Evans desperately needs the money his motivations may also include a dislike for villains and a need to do something important with his life.  Who knows, not really sure.  The rest of the story is getting Wade onto the train.

Spoilers may follow.

The story as it stands isn't bad.  But the movie soon takes a downward shift.  The events that happen on way to Contention and then the events in Contention especially are so ludicrous that it can't help but detract from the movie.  No amount of fine acting or pretty scenery is going to change that.

Take for example Fonda.  His character is belly shot at point blank range early in the film, but he's up and back in the saddle transporting Wade almost immediately.  Or, knowing that Wade's gang is going to be stupid and instead of cutting their losses and running with the money they are going to go after Wade, the good guys devise a not-so-clever ruse to make his gang follow the wrong stagecoach.  Locked in that coach isn't Wade but another one of the good guys.  And, come to find out, he really is locked in there and with his only offensive weapon a pistol and no key to his lock it doesn't take a rocket scientist to put together what is going to happen there.  Wade is in fact moved out on horseback instead of say, locked up in the local jail until adequate force can be brought to bare to move him to Contention.  I don't know, maybe Brisbee doesn't have a jail.  Anyway, Wade is never properly restrained so he escapes a couple of times and while no one will stand up to him while he escapes they still pursue him and capture him again.  Near the end the survivors are holed up with Wade in Contention waiting an hour on the train.  Wade's gang is below the window getting the townsfolk on their side and killing the local law all while Evans, his son and the railroad man watch without involving themselves.  Later, Evans will make a suicide run (bum leg and all) to the train pushing a very cooperative and helpful Wade.  Why? I don't know exactly.  It isn't for the money anymore, maybe it is so his son will think better of him.  Noting makes you look tougher than sacrificing yourself senselessly, at least in the movies.  And why is Wade helping him now? I don't know.  And it gets worse, the final shootout and actions of Wade are just so bizarre that I was left feeling so completely dissatisfied with the movie.",1200268800,4,3228,4.448040885860307
1594135,4,B00005JPXP,"The remake of 3:10 to Yuma has something profound in it.  The bad guy--Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe--is a representation of our own evil selves on a subconscious level, while the good guy, who isn't doing anything particularly out of being good himself--Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale--is more the good character only because there's some practicality in doing so.  He isn't good just to make the moralistic-idealistic viewpoint premise in a fake way, as though the reason for being good were because God says so, or something equally trite in an average western.  He is good because he can't look his kid in the eyes and be the father figure without being the good character.

This idea is more something one would see in a Bud Boetticher western rather than a John Ford one and a simplistic cowboys and Indians western picture where white people always win simply because the Indians are two-dimensional savages--something ridiculous and belittling, especially to the Indians.  Nope, this one has some not-necessarily-complicated views on how practical it is to be an idealist, and that being that idealist isn't necessarily for the sake of itself.

If you look at the plot from this angle, the gunfighters are more representations, titans of each ideal.  So, the action scenes work toward something.  I can't remember any western recently that tried so hard allegorically to examine idealisms and succeed for that reason.  What makes the bad guys bad isn't some pretense of physical ugliness, but of their lack of respect for others' lives, and their Machiavellian treatment of others to get what they want.  To partly spoil the end, the bad guys even corrupt others into assuming that life essentially has a dollar value.  The gang's indebtedness to their leader, Ben Wade, held captive by railroad bounties, including the protagonist, Dan Evans, is their reasoning for trying to break Ben Wade free.  So, the bad guys have a code that gives them character depth, even if it's a fairly obvious one.

This had to be a western, not just because it is a remake of the movie with Glenn Ford, but because it is about an earlier moment in the history of the U.S. where a clash consumed it.  On one side were the lawless and less idealistic men who believed in free ranges.  On the other side are the invasions of social status: towns, populations, governments, railroads, etc.  In the end, it isn't the bad guy's metaphoric fangs that make him what he is, but his position instead.  He is actually something of an intellectual who is bad out of his lack of an answer to his own philosophical question about this relationship of social status.  And so, when the bad guy redeems himself, it isn't because he's another two-dimensional Hollywood bad guy.  He is won over by something so simple and obvious that every viewer will understand what has caused him to be the bad man.  And, it's not because Ben Wade can't be regarded with empathy or because he's a wooden or shallow character.  Ben Wade is a killer, and this makes him the bad man.  He resolves his problems with violence, and this makes him the bad man.  This film is adept at pinpointing these differences.  So, the epiphany had by him ending--the part which I refuse to spoil with a full description--makes a lot of sense, even if some would not notice that Wade's final act had been preceded by an epiphany.  What Ben Wade lacked was something and someone to convince him to value a social bonding regarding something higher than his own immediate needs.  It's not who dies or how many that matters, but why.

Luckily, the so-called good guy in the film, Dan Evans, isn't good because he has religion, or because he wears a white cowboy outfit.  He's about as dirty as the rest of the on-screen characters.  But, a television western like this could be made where viewers could know who the good guy was because he wears white.  In this feature film, we know who the good guy is because of what he will and won't do, and what he has to do.  He is a reluctant hero.  He is only good in apparent to the ending for what he has resolved to do.  What makes him the good guy is that we value his decisions as something inherent within all men.  This makes him the hero.",1200268800,,4233,4.668016194331984

I enjoyed the moral ambiguity of the characters, and the grittiness of the world they live in.  Both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale were wonderful in their roles, as was the young actor (a ringer for the young Christian Slater) who played Bale's son.

This picture's critics are right, though - you really have to suspend your disblelief to follow the second half of this picture.  I wondered myself why Bale's character didn't just shoot Charlie Prince out of the Hotel room window.  There were a number of places where Crowe's character could have escaped, or attacked and gotten a horse or something, but he didn't.  The ending was extremely strange to me.  I guess it was supposed to indicate that the ""bad guy"" had come around somehow, but I was just puzzled.

Upon further thought, it occurred to me that they might be angling for some sort of sequel involving Crowe's character.  That would explain a lot about the ending.

The original 1957 film was boring but still head and shoulders above this one. At every key point in the plot the characters behave in completely uncharacteristic ways. The low point of the film is the scene where the bad guys line up in the street below the hotel window and dialogue with the good guys in the room above them. In real life, when bad men who are trying to kill you get this close and hold this still you start shooting them, not engaging in meaningful social intercourse. When the Indians attack the camp of the whites, nobody puts out the campfire that makes it easy to shoot them. The outlaw gang keeps coming after their leader when the intelligent thing to do is to split up the loot and get the hell out of the territory.

1594140,5,B00005JPXP,"This movie reminds me more of Shakespeare than of Louis L'Amour. The characters are as real people, not stereotypical heroes and villains. As in the L'Amour west, they inhabit a harsh and gritty world, full of danger and death. The people have no illusions about succeeding in their quest for security and happiness. They know that their only hope for survival is through strength.
But, we quickly move into the Shakesperean realm of human motives, subconscious drives and strong passions.
For example, consider the inner turmoil of the one-legged rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), who has a 14 year-old son who thinks his father is an ineffectual and weak man, because he is not quick to strike out at the man who is trying to take away the family ranch. His wife seems to turn away from him and is even momentarily seduced by the charismatic presence of the strong, though evil killer, Ben Wade, played perfectly by Russell Crowe. Evans makes a last ditch effort to save his ranch and family, not only for their survival, but to gain their respect and so that he may even respect himself.
Wade is shown as the most evil and dangerous kind of killer. He possesses a disarming gift of likeability and pleasant congeniality. But, in an instant, he will turn and strike like a wild animal, with extreme and uninhibited viciousness.
This is a film with so many facets and layers that there is no way to do it justice in this short review, nor does this writer possess the skill or ability to provide a thorough analysis. I only suggest that viewers watch this film for some of the classic themes that exemplify the most significant dramas, such as the coming of age of Evans' son William, well-portrayed by Logan Lerman.
Westerns have often been used to present large themes relating to human struggles. Filmmakers take us to that mythic place when they have a real story to tell. This is one of those westerns.",1200182400,,1911,4.7074626865671645

In a world where making a good western is a long and winding beaten path, Hollywood has managed to rope in two hits this year, ""No Country for Old Men,"" and 3:10 to Yuma.  Not since Young Guns has such good westerns been available. Russell Crowe is Ben Wade a ba ba ba ba bad to the bone gun slinging robber who gets caught because he had his pants down. Now that Wade fought the law and the law won, the task of getting the outlaw to another town where the train headed to Yuma Prison arrives at 3:10, proves a deadly task. Dan Evans, (Christian Bale) is a down on his luck rancher who signs on to get the prisoner to the train on time for $200.00. Some male bonding goes on here as Wade gain respect for Dan Evans for his strong upright principles. They get to the train on time but Wade's gang of ruthless outlaws come out blazing their guns to save Wade from going to prison. The only real surprise in the simple plot but nicely done western is the last man standing. Great looking western movie sets, cinematography, period costume designs and some great acting makes 3:10 to Yuma a good DVD choice. I also credit a noteworthy performance by young rising star actor Logan Lerman. Veteran actor Peter Fonda also stars. 3:10 to Yuma is a remake of a 1957 movie of the same title which stared Glen Ford.  Couch potato review, 5 potato 6 potato",1200096000,,1360,4.3046875

Their just no comparison to the original in performances and drama. The kill all at the ending was like James Mangold just didn't know how to end the film.

It shows very well that often we must beware of the easy and charismatic leaders in order to do what's right. Often the most heroic of people and actions are the least recognized, but God will give grace to the humble and oppose the proud.

But by the time the movie closes toward its ending, the screenplay becomes filled with scenes that would be seen as acceptable (not brilliant, mind you, but merely acceptable) only to someone who knows next to nothing about classic Westerns and has little common sense about human nature. I am still dumbfounded that so much that could not pass the plausibility test on the old country store porch or the old courthouse square is in a Western that so many find a laudable addition to the genre.

The best western since Unforgiven? It is third rate, or worse, compared to Open Range. The new 3:10 to Yuma is inferior to the original, whose creators knew it was a B movie and wise enough to keep it on track and realistic in light of both the Old West and human nature.

There's a sense of honor and dangerously violent threats to life and limb. Courage, honor and loyalty defend themselves and we are left to identify with them and share their triumph. It's all good, clean fun and the transfer between samurai and cowboy works so well that The Magnificent Seven didn't even bother to adapt the plot of The Seven Samurai-it was just lifted intact and it worked perfectly.

It's hard when you watch 3:10 to Yuma not to imagine Russel Crowe as the captured leader of a band of Ronin being let to his ultimate doom by Christian Bale. the beleaguered peasant. But for those who saw the original with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, there's something extra here, some homage to modern concerns. We learn that the doomed bandit was abandoned by his mother when he was eight and that the farmer is being driven from his land by the railroad as his sons look on and lose respect for him. There is a lushness to the social landscape too. Chinese laborers, former slaves, Mexican sharpshooters, disappointed actresses and the tortured bodies of Comanche captives are litterd about.
The violence is stunning-so prolific that it becomes almost a form of dance. Ben Foster as the homicidal genius is riveting.
All in all, a brilliant return to several different views of yesteryear.

Instead of lean and mean, you were left, with the ending's ridiculous shootout, with loaded and bloated, especially so if you've had the good fortune to see the original with Van Heflin and Glenn Ford, which in contrast was a piece of dusty grim understatement involving hard choices and hard men.  The new version went from being a fine character study, to a shootout on steroids - and a confusing one at that. Look, this movie is better than most out there, and the acting will blow you away.

This is a very well done remake and expansion of the original 1957 film and retains the plot, except for a major change at the end.  Russell Crowe's villain isn't just the bad guy in black; he's a guy who claims to be rotten to the core but professes a love for his mother, has read the Bible and can quote it chapter and verse, is a wildlife artist, and doesn't need to speak much since he can say a great deal with his eyes.  A restrained and nuanced performance.
Christian Bale is equally fascinating as a poor rancher who lost a leg in the Civil War and is now fighting drought on his land, trying to keep his wife and sons from going hungry.  His only chance for some cash and a way out is to escort Crowe to the prison train, facing Apaches, Crowe's gang, and his own fears and doubts along the way.

1594278,5,B00005JPXP,"It's movies like 3:10 to Yuma that remind why I love movies so much; in an age of filmmaking where everything is about money, bigger and better special F/X, movies that try to be too smart for their own good and where character development has taken a backseat to mindless action 3:10 to Yuma comes around and gets everything right. I'm a fan of westerns, but I won't lie it's not my favorite genre, while there are many westerns I love as a whole I'm not really into them as much as I am other type of films. 3:10 to Yuma is easily one of the best westerns I have ever seen and makes me wanna seek out more movies like this.

For me 3:10 to Yuma is one of those movies that as I'm watching it I enjoy it, but feel that maybe it could be slightly better, but when everything starts to kick into high gear and I think back I realize how wonderful a movie 3:10 to Yuma just was. The action scenes are very well done and the characters are also excellent and developed, well at least the main characters were.

The screenplay was written by Halstead Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas and I must say it was an excellent script. While it may not offer anything really new to the western it works very well and is very well written. The lead characters Dan Evans played by Christian Bale and Ben Wade played by Russell Crowe are very well developed and have a lot of depth to their characters. It's the typical good guy vs. bad guy screenplay.

Director James Mangold does an excellent job; his scenes are all well paced and he gets everything right. The action, the suspense, the dramatic moments all work perfectly and he also creates a great visual look. Right now in Hollywood there is a lack of filmmakers who can actually tell a story. So many filmmakers out there while they can put together an entertaining movie with solid action scenes, but they cannot tell a story; But James Mangold is able to not only tell a story, but also put together some great action scenes, which is very rare in Hollywood these days for a filmmaker to be able to do both.

3:10 to Yuma is a remake and it proves if done right a remake can be great. Most remakes are simply made for the money. You take a movie that has a fan base and odds are due to that you'll make money. 3:10 to Yuma was the exception to that. Outside of film buffs or die hard western fans I'm sure not many were aware of the original and even if so let's face it westerns aren't what they used to be. It was once said in Hollywood you aren't a star unless you did a western. Nowadays get one made is really tough.

The acting here was brilliant. Christian Bale is in my opinion one of the best actors out there right now in Hollywood. You name the role and Bale can play it. His character of Dan Evans is one of my favorite film characters of all time. The character is well written and has plenty of depth. And Bale does an amazing job at brining him to life. Christian Bale as Dan Evans is everything a film hero should be. Under the most dangerous of times he shows courage and bravery even with his own life at risk. He's scared and let's face it who wouldn't be? But like a true hero even in the darkest times he stands tall and fights for what he thinks is right. Dan Evans is everything a film hero should be.

I like Russell Crowe, but I'm not a huge fan, but his character of Ben Wade is a character to be remembered. He's an outlaw, but not really a villain. Sure he's done some bad things, but the old west was a very different time than it is now. Your outlaws are different sometimes; some are just evil men plain and simple, but a lot despite the bad things they have done aren't really bad guys. Maybe in today's world they would be, but not back than. Ben Wade may be an outlaw who has done some bad things and we see him do bad things, but deep down he is a good guy.

Ben Foster as Charlie Prince makes one hell of a great villain. He's ruthless and just simply a terrible and disgusting person and Foster plays the role perfectly. You really wanna see this guy get what's coming to him and the final couple of minutes when you really see what a coward he is you'll wanna see him pay even more; excellent job by Ben Foster.

The final act to 3:10 to Yuma is just simply brilliant. It's loaded with suspense, tension and excitement. There were moments where like I said I thought could be a little better, but once the final act starts I realized how powerful all these scenes were prior. I was on the edge of my seat watching the final act and not many movies today can get that rush out of me. Dan Evans has Wade's men after him and they offered money to anyone that helps them. Dan Evans is forced to go at it alone and this isn't Rambo. The final act isn't done in this over the top way, it feels real. And that is why it works so well.

The ending was tragic, but very fitting. Some people disliked it because it strays from the typical Hollywood ending. 3:10 to Yuma doesn't end on a down note, despite the tragic ending. I highly recommend 3:10 to Yuma. Western fan or not this is a must see.",1200009600,2,5073,4.194871794871795
1594279,2,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma is one of those films that either leaves a lasting impression on you or you feel is just another overblown western. The  storyline is good. The old run of the mill rancher needs to instill pride in his son (and himself) has been done before (literally), but this has a better twist.
  The problems lie in the following. Christian Bale is a strange actor. That is good for certain roles. Portraying a solemn, yet forceful, yet understanding, yet this, yet that dude - did not work at all for him. He was all over the place. It wasn't just Bale, their was  very contrived and unconvincing acting all around. It's a shame that in a marketing attempt it was compared to the splendour of ""Unforgiven"". Yes, some nice action and landscape scenes, but the misplaced dialogue ran rampant. Russell Crowe was good at creating a mood of fear, thats true. So much so that it became highly improbable for him to have an attack of proper paybacks and retribution.
  All movies are a stretch, however when you make the audience, in their head, go, ""c'mon"", that seals its fate. This is not sci-fi, but a film that wants to project normal human reactions and emotions. To make anyone think that one man defending himself against a multitude of seasoned gunfighters, pulling a semi unwilling vicious criminal, whos handcuffed,  jumping off roofs, through wide open areas, on a 1/2 mile travel intent, to a train, that may or may not be there, is beyond bogus.
  I will say this, the movie was entertaining. The audio was great with all its blistering gunshots and horses. I just had to suspend a little too much belief.

1594332,5,B00005JPXP,"Great westerns are a rarity today much less a remake that's why James Mangold's film ""3:10 to Yuma"" (adapted from an Elmore Leonard story and previously made as a marvelous film with Glenn Ford) is all the more remarkable. Any film--whether it be a historical western or a science fiction film is truly made more as a commentary on the era it was made in and ""3:10 to Yuma"" is no exception to this rule. Although the final moments of the film might stretch credibility to some, if you've followed the shifting relationship that develops between Dan, Wade and recognize the respect that Wade gains for Dan in spite of insurmountable odds, you'll buy into it. Or not. I suppose it depends on your beliefs and personal taste.

Dan (Christian Bale)struggles with a ranch that just isn't producing putting him and his family further and further into debt. A Civil War veteran, he's still active even though he lost half his foot in the war but because of his experience he's a cautious man who looks out for his family first and as a result his son who is in the thrall of the folk heroes of the time doesn't respect his dad. When Wade (Russell Crowe)storms into town after robbing the payroll for the railroad yet again, Dan becomes a reluctant hero but sees a way past his troubles--he volunteers to escort Wade to the nearest town and get him on the 3:10 train to Yuma and the territorial prison. Wade isn't your typical criminal however--he's intelligent, articulate and an artist to boot which makes him all the more crafty and difficult to control. He's a sociopath who finds common ground with a common man --Dan--who has had a string of bad luck. What appeals to him about Dan is his sense of honor and sacrifice for his family along with the fact that he is, in spite of his flaws, an honest, decent man just trying to make a go of it something that Wade can never be.

Meanwhile, Dan and a crew of ""escorts"" must contend with Wade's gang and in particular his unstable Lt. (Ben Watson in a marvelous, and disturbing performance)who is tracking Wade's every move in an effort to spring his boss.

The Blu-ray transfer looks stunning with deep, rich blacks and great detail and color. If you aren't a Blu-ray fan (or you're in the HD DVD camp), the regular DVD also looks terrific drawn from the same source. Audio sounds terrific with a lossless audio transfer and nice use of the surround speakers.

The extras aren't quite as good as I thought they would be. While the commentary from director Mangold is marvelous, I would have liked to see more time spent on the featurettes and a discussion of what really went on during the time frame of the film. We do however get a nice interactive feature which I haven't honestly had time to investigate yet.

A marvelous film filled with strong performances from Crowe, Bale, Peter Fonda and what is essentially an extended cameo by Gretchen Moll, ""3:10 to Yuma"" isn't ""The Unforgiven"" but it really doesn't pretend to be. I think what many of the critics are seeing is a serious committment to the type of involving western like the one that Eastwood made. This film about honor, duty and desperation is well worth checking out.

One of a trio of fine westerns that came out in 2007 (""The Proposition"" is another one), ""3:10 to Yuma"" is as much about the characters as it is about the action and that's truly what makes for outstanding drama.

If you were born in the 50s or prior, you should see ""3:10 To Yuma"" for the past you miss or have lost; if you were born after the 50s, you should watch it to get the sense of the heroic epic that is all-American in presentation, but age-old in scope.

Dan Evans (Christian Bale, an actor who keeps getting better and better) is a struggling Western rancher beset by a mean landlord intent on evicting him and a cruel weather pattern that has starved his land of rain and forage for his cattle. Into his world comes a coach containing a command of Pinkerton detectives and their charge, the most notorious bad guy of the West, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). The head Pinkerton, McElroy (an almost unrecognizable Peter Fonda) wants to get Ben on the 3:10 to Yuma Prison. They stop at Dan's weathered and lonely ranch for a break and dinner, and Dan Evans - a veteran of the Civil War with a pegleg - is enforced to accommodate them. His 15-year-old son, who has lost faith with his father's ability to provide, finds instant romance in the mystique of the manacled Ben Wade, a Bible-quoting, charismatic criminal. What nobody there seems to know, other than Ben, is that Ben's gang is aiming to spring Ben from his captors the next day.

Through the series of events that follows, Dan Evans opts to help transport Ben Wade to the train, for a $200 consideration. Part of this is an inner moral concern, an attempt to make good in his son's eyes; part of it is to save his ranch from the greedy and ruthless landlord. Through it all, his dogged determination in the face of overwhelming odds wins him the respect of the least-likely person, and the one person who seems most supremely confident of personal victory: the ostensibly contained Ben Wade. It also, ultimately, wins him the regard and devotion of the person he is trying to win; his son.

This is an old-style Western, full of shoot-em-ups, chases, railroads, tunnels in the mountains, and rough, dry terrain, and lots of grizzled Western characters. The filming is superb, the sets just what you might expect. You can feel the grit on your teeth from the dust. And the acting is top-notch, from the principals Bale and Crowe down to the youth, Logan Lerman.

The extras on this DVD are great too, especially for those interested in Western history. Overall, this is a great entry into the pitifully small genre of lately-done Westerns. Highly recommended. Those who, like me, grew up with ""Rawhide"", ""Bonanza"", and ""Bat Masterson"" will welcome it like an old friend.",1199836800,2,2914,4.674463937621832
1594334,5,B00005JPXP,"I am not a fan of Westerns. I generally find them trite, cliche and silly. In fact, there was a time I would've said I hated Westerns, as well as Romantic Comedies and Musicals. Over time, however, I've learned that what I hate are bad movies, and while many Westerns are, this one is not.

This movie is often, and rightly, compared favorably to Clint Eastwood's amazing film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgiven-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006FDCJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unforgiven (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. Like that film, ""3:10 to Yuma"" elevates itself beyond the standard bang-bang, shoot-'em-up style of Western to become something better and much more interesting.

You're likely familiar with the plot. Poor rancher decides to escort hardend criminal to a small town in Arizona so the bad-guy can get onto a train and go face a hanging. The rancher isn't really thrilled about doing this, but does it partly for the money, partly for honor and partly to redeem himself in the eyes of a teenage son who thinks his pa is a moron and a coward and worships the criminal in question.

As the movie advances both the rancher and the criminal wind up developing something of a respect for each other, and it's particularly fascinating to see where this takes them. As the two make their final dash for the train, one wonders how much effort the criminal is putting into escaping and how much he's putting towards helping the rancher get him to the train.

One of the only flaws with this otherwise fine movie is that I would've liked some explanation for what brought Crowe's character to the point he's in. Clearly he's a smart man, far smarter than those in his gang. He obviously has at least some grasp of homor and a vague sense of right and wrong. Why did he end up becoming a criminal when he could've been so much more? Perhaps he's a simple sociopath? That would go some distance to explaining some of the seemingly odd choices he makes at the end of the film.

The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is top-notch, as one would expect with Crowe and Bale. It'll be interesting, come Oscar time, to see how badly this movie gets snubbed (since I doubt it will get anything other than technical nominations). But even if the Academy is not big on this film, I certainly am, and wholeheartedly recommend it.",1199836800,3,2385,4.982412060301508

1594336,2,B00005JPXP,"I wonder how many of the people who praised this remake of the classic 1957 film with Glenn Ford & Van Heflin--ever saw the original? This one proved to be a disappointment to me when I saw it in the theatre despite the casting of Crowe & Bale. The original was spare, 97 minutes and in black & white whereas this one is in widescreen/color and runs close to 2 hrs.  Also Elmore Leonard's tale has been expanded to include more characters, subplots and several gunfights which I felt detracted from the main plot between the 2 men.  In fact what made the original so good was that it concentrated on that-and I believe you don't need all this fat to put into a simple though complex psychological story such as this!! I like both Crowe & Bale in other roles but I don't believe either of them came as well as Ford & Heflin did in the original. In fact, Crowe comes off as downright psyhotic & unlikeable whereas Ford in a great under-rated performance came off as charming but with an edge. What really pissed me off about this film was the adsurd ending when one of the main characters is killed off and the other one survives (you can guess which). Very unsatisfactory compared to the original where both characters do survive. Sorry but if you want to see the last decent Western since ""Unforgiven"", check out ""Open Range"" with Robert Duvall & Kevin Costner on DVD and eventually Blu-ray.  That one is definitely a keeper which this one clearly isn't.",1199836800,5,1454,4.5

Russel Crowe's character is supposed to be a bad man who eventually begins to have a grudging respect for his escort as played by Christian Bale.  That notion in itself is not absurd but the script developed Crowe's character in such a way that I found the ending to be ridiculous and unrealistic, to say the least.  Crowe's character is unabashedly bad and yet we find him helping his prison escort to get him to the train, then shooting down his own gang members for freeing him.  I gave the movie three stars solely due to the beautiful cinematography and the solid acting.  but those alone can't amke up for a bad plot.",1199836800,6,742,4.548872180451128
1594339,4,B00005JPXP,"I like Westerns. Wyatt Earp, Open Range and of course Unforgiven are some of my favorites because they explore the depths of man's adaptation with his surroundings and his struggle between good and evil. I can also find a place in my heart for some of the more outrageous action westerns such as Silverado, Tombstone and even (gulp) Young Guns. All three are shameless action films that don't pretend to be anything else and I can respect that. 3:10 To Yuma is a combination of all these movies to some degree. At times it explores man's pathos and philosophy in those harsh and barren lands but it's also not afraid to have a nameless villain meet a grisly death by his dynamite bag being targeted by pistol packin' Pinkertons. And while these action scenes make for great entertainment, like any good movie, it's the characters that carry the picture. There are all around great performances here in a fairly deep cast. Russell Crowe plays the celebrity outlaw and bible quoting Ben Wade, while Christian Bale plays Danny Evans, the down and out one-legged rancher who is being kicked off his land by the local real estate mogul. Peter Fonda portrays Byron MacAvoy, an aging but still very dangerous bounty hunter for the Pinkerton Agency and then there is Wade's right-hand man Charlie Prince (or is it Princess?), played with extreme malice for anything in life but Ben Wade by the soon to be superstar Ben Foster.  Can somebody please tell me why this kid is not the biggest thing in Hollywood yet? But I digress...

When Wade is captured without incident in town by the Pinkerton's, Evans volunteers to assist in the escort to the neighboring town of Contention for $200, where the 3:10 train will deliver Wade to Yuma, and most assuredly the gallows.

All the while the film has made it very clear that Wade's gang will do it's best to prevent this journey's success and they may even run into some Apaches along the way. Obstacles that should keep us busy until the final inevitable showdown in Contention.

A detour at the Evans farm allows for some character development, including Dan's insecurities about how his family views him as a failure. We realize that Byron is no better than Wade or any of his men as he eerily mentions that he has not killed any soul that didn't deserve it. This is his dismissive justification even though it is later learned that some of these ""souls"" were women and children. We also are privy to the dangerous charm that Wade possesses during his few conversations at the Evans dinner table.

Credit must be given of course to director James Mangold who plays this all with a fine balance of standard western flair and compelling social twists on the differences between good and evil (I was laughing out loud when Charlie Prince offers $200 to anyone in town who will shoot Wade's captores. Needless to say, more than one of the townsfolk participate.)

While the shootouts are exciting enough, the sets are genuine and the soundtrack contributes to the authenticity of a western, it's the verbal exchanges between Evans and Wade that lift this film well above the average realm. We get the sense that Wade's probing of Evans is more than just Hannibal Lecture-esque quid pro quo, where the information is used as power to exploit the owner. Rather, Wade seems to genuinely want to understand why this one-legged rancher is going against such insurmountable odds to complete this quest. Once he thinks he has figured out Evans' motivation, he continuously tests those limits until, in the end (and maybe well before) there is nothing left but respect.",1199836800,,3595,4.780998389694042
1594340,5,B00005JPXP,"If there is a truly unique American contribution to film making then that contribution has to be the Western.  Though not as popular a theme these days as it was in past decades, it only takes a powerhouse film such as 3:10 TO YUMA to remind us just how pungent storytelling of this type can be.  Yes, the story itself (based on a short story by Elmore Leonard) is rather simple: desperate farmer needs money to save his failing farm and family and signs on to escort a powerful outlaw to the train that will take him to prison.  But in this screen adaptation by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas the story is fleshed out by sharing with the audience the essence of the pioneer spirit and the sequelae of the Civil War on the minds of the dispossessed who turned to crime against the ruling order - the railroads and the banks represented the conquering North - and the film becomes one of profound understanding about man's plight in the pioneer West.

The landscape and atmosphere of Arizona is captured with dusty accuracy by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and sets the stage for director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted', 'Walk the Line', 'Identity', 'Kate and Leopold', 'Cop Land') to work with his talented cast to give a realistic view of life in the hard times of the old West.  Russell Crowe is the notorious outlaw Ben Wade whose gang includes such actors as Ben Foster and Rio Alexander and once he is captured during a robbery, the local sheriff promises to pay $200. to destitute, crippled farmer Dan Evans to escort the prisoner to Contention, AZ for catching a ride to the 3:10 to Yuma and prison.  The connection between the two disparate men - Wade and Evans - is the message of the story and is beautifully enhanced by allowing the audience to understand both sides of 'the law'. The co-stars of the film include Gretchen Mol as Evans' wife and young Logan Lerman as Evans' impressionable son William, Dallas Roberts as the head of the bank investment at risk, Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw and a large cast of the people who interplay in the drama.

Both Crowe and Bale give superlative performances, acting so cohesively that it would be difficult to single out either for the Oscar: this is ensemble acting at its finest. For once the added features enhance our appreciation of the tales from the Old West and how they became legends and the comments by the director, producers and cast actually make sense! The film will doubtless become a classic: it deserves the honor.  Grady Harp, January 08",1199836800,27,2544,4.688340807174888
1594341,5,B00005JPXP,"Until last years magnificent `The Proposition' I avoided westerns at all cost.  The days of John Wayne are long gone and it became apparent that the western was all but dead; a few lifeless limbs sprouting each passing year that further proved the genre was needed to be put out of its misery.  Then, after much talk surrounding Winstone's performance (an actor with whom I'm eternally smitten) got to my ear, I decided to rent `The Proposition' and give the western another try.  The film is as close to perfection as a film can come and continues to mesmerize me with each memory I hold to.  2007 alone proved to be the year of the western.  `The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford', `There Will Be Blood', the awards dominator `No Country for Old Men' and the critically acclaimed `3:10 to Yuma', a remake of the Glenn Ford classic.

It goes without saying that I would have seen `3:10 to Yuma' even if `The Proposition' hadn't wetted my appetite to the revived genre.  My obsession and utter fascination with the godlike creature known as Russell Crowe would drive me to any film; and I mean ANY FILM, but it's nice when your interests in an actor are validated by the quality of their work.  Russell Crowe is all about quality, and `3:10 to Yuma' is the finest quality western around.

Yes, the critics got this one right.  `3:10 to Yuma' is not only one of the best westerns yet to be filmed, but it's one of the best overall films I've had the pleasure of watching.  It's strong in all areas, from script to direction to cinematography to the acting.  `3:10 to Yuma' is a film designed to please its audience, and it manages to do just that.  `3:10...' provides entertainment in aces.

The film, like its inspiration, follows family man Dan Evans as he helps transport outlaw Ben Wade to make the 3:10 (a train) in order to meet sentencing and ultimately meet his death for his countless crimes.  `3:10 to Yuma' is in all respects an action film, a western of the grittiest, most violent persuasion, but at it's heart it succeeds brilliantly as a psychological drama, a film that explores the depths of criminology and the root of every man, honor and respect.  As Ben is transported across the open plains he tries his hardest to crack the shell that is Dan Evans and as he persists we get to see the man that is Ben Wade, someone not at all who he seems.

This updated adaptation works at creating a nice backdrop for out characters, making them real to us, giving the audience plenty of opportunities to connect to both Ben and Dan.  As we see Dan struggle to be the man his sons look up to, the man his wife can look at with admiration we feel his pain in his failure.  As we watch Ben connive his way through situations, working to save his skin we see the core of this man, the center of this rough exterior that is as human as it is monstrous.

With that said, I must comment on the brilliance that is Russell Crowe.  As Ben Wade he masterfully creates a villain that is so real, so heartfelt and earnest that we root for his escape.  Crowe plays Wade much like Gandolfini plays Soprano, with such intimate humanity wrapped in savage brutality.  He fools us with his sympathetic and compassionate mannerisms then betrays our trust with outright heartless actions.  His confidence and nonchalant attitude help create his demeanor and play devil to his ferocious appetite for survival.  We see his eyes staring straight ahead; we see his lips purse, his hand fall to the side; we see his eyes shift in their sockets and despite the fact that he remains silent Crowe is telling us so much.  Wade has this intense magnetism, an air that engulfs all who take in his presence.  Just notice the way Dan's wife Alice looks at him while alone at the dinner table, those wonton eyes gazing at this bloodthirsty killer who owns her attention.  It pains me to know that this performance has gone ignored all awards season for it deserves so much attention.

The rest of the cast works beautifully as well, Christian Bale and Ben Foster especially.  Bale plays Evans with such determination and human feeling that we understand his actions and the motive behind them.  We know why he feels he must do this even though we know he doesn't.  He's overshadowed much by Crowe's commanding presence, but he shines through on his own.  Ben Foster, who plays Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince, delivers a nerve shattering performance.  He really gets under the skin, but this is not a stretch for him.  Anyone who's seen 2005's `Hostage' knows that Foster can do creepy very well.  Peter Fonda has some nice banter with Crowe and Gretchen Mol is splendid as Dan's frustrated wife, but her scenes are limited and thus we really don't get to experience her to the full.

`3:10 to Yuma' is a gorgeous film to look at, a masterful creation handled passionately by director James Mangold.  Each scene beautifully connects to another and helps string the audience along to the orgasmic conclusion.  With realism and heart `3:10 to Yuma' commands our attention and delivers Grade-A entertainment around every breathtaking corner.",1199836800,,5138,4.629139072847682
1594401,5,B00005JPXP,"This is a great movie -- fun, intelligent, skillfully directed and full of texture and depth.  Russell Crowe hits a solid home run with yet another mega-macho role: his Ben Wade is one of the most magnetic characters seen onscreen in ages and ages... Although he is an utter villain, I'm sure I am not alone in wanting to see either a Ben Wade sequel or prequel, although it would probably spoil what is, right now, a completely perfect film.  (Ben Foster's role as Wade's henchman, Charlie Prince, is also an impressive performance... Nice transition from his role in ""Six Feet Under""!)

The original ""3:10 To Yuma"" is one of the great classic Westerns, and while this version doesn't entirely displace it, it is certainly a brilliant film, ranking right up there with Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" and the miniseries adaptation of Larry McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove"" as a modern masterpiece of the genre.  Highly recommended!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1199836800,,961,5.018867924528302
1594402,5,B00005JPXP,"Call it sort of a renaissance with the cowboy lifestyle becoming more eminent again.  Westerns were part of movie culture for many years.  The stories were often exaggerated but made for great action.  Now comes the remake of the classic Three Ten to Yuma made in 1957.  The story is much the same with great actors making this remake a future classic.

The story starts off violently as you would expect many Westerns to do.  One of main characters Dan Evans who is played by Christian Bale is behind on his land payment.  The owner of the land comes in with his posse and burns down his barn.  This would cause most to seek revenge.  Although Dan isn't going to do anything stupid.  With a wife and two children he just wants to make sure his ranch will survive.

Next comes our other main character, Ben Wade who is played by Russell Crowe.  Ben Wade has become legendary for his crimes.  Ben and his gang get a classic introduction in the stage coach scene.  The coach is loaded with money and armed guards.  Ben's gang comes out shooting and eventually wins.  This scene ends up bringing Dan and Ben together.

The action that follows in intense to say the least.  The acting is really excellent and the story stays interesting.  I don't want to get to involved with the story to spoil anything for you.  Let's just say there should be more movies like this out.

The Blu-ray version of this movie is excellent.  With a superb picture it is also balanced with great sound that will make any home theatre sound like you are in the middle of a gun fight.  This movie is also packed with tons of extras.  The disc is load with featurettes and documentaries including an Inside Yuma: Exclusive Blu-ray disc experience.

The Western has returned in a great way.  This movie is sure to become a classic.  From it's superb gun fights to the great storyline.  3:10 To Yuma will no doubt bring the romance between man and the old open west back.  This is a great film and even better on Blu-ray.  So if you want to partake in a classic experience this movie should be up your ally.",1199750400,2,2077,4.446808510638298

1594404,4,B00005JPXP,"Until the big shoot-out climax, when the plausible factor gets stretched to the limit, 3:10 To Yuma, is a big enjoyable western relying on the traditions of the genre without resorting to post modern hindsight. The film is based on a 1957 highly regarded film and a story by Elmore Leonard.

A partly crippled rancher, (Christian Bale), volunteers to help escort notorious outlaw, (Russell Crowe), to the 3:10 train to Yuma, to collect two hundred dollars he needs to keep his ranch alive, feed his family, and thwart greedy land developers. The stockpile of western cliche's, (nearly all of them; the stampede, the cowardly sheriff, the stagecoach heist, the hotshot young gunner,...) seem only fine dramatic development to the mounting suspense due to the traditional and convincing performances of the hero-villain team. The escorts are chased by the outlaw's shoot-'em-up gang, attacked by Apache Indians, besieged by railroad developers, followed by the rancher's daring young son, and finally surrounded by an American frontier that would rather see quick cash in their pocket than justice brought forth.

The big climax in Yuma gets a bit crowded with unlikely character development and impossible action shoot-outs, and the finale could have kept the trails more blazing had it been slightly altered, but here's a western that so respects the heroic traditions of the genre, it's impossible not to love.",1199750400,,1411,5.238938053097345

When it is declared that Wade will be escorted to Contention, to be put aboard the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison, Evans volunteers to help, in order to raise funds for his family.  Things go wrong, of course, as Wade's gang is in hot pursuit.

Let the bullets fly.

Christian Bale is a knockout as always; the man is a chameleon.  Russell Crowe lightens the screen with his portrayal of the seductive Wade (as he declares in a deleted scene: ""People like me!"").  The scenes between these two great actors provide more tension than any gunfire director James Mangold has to offer (and he has a lot).  Peter Fonda adds a sense of class--not to mention plain old menace--as a corrupt Pinkerton detective.  Ben Foster, as the psychotic Charlie Prince, is a delight to watch; he actually manages to steal some of the pivotal scenes.  The film is layered with roles from actors you know; Alan Tudyk provides some jokes as the veterinarian-turned-doctor, and Luke Wilson shows a surprising knack for western menace in his cameo role.

The action is quick, of course; ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a western, and it never really tries to be anything but.  Sure, it's more a thinking-man's western in some regards; the budding relationship between Wade and Evans is the focal point of the movie.  But if you want action, you'll get it; bullets fly, wagons crash, caverns cave in, and quite a few people die.  The main focus, though, is on the acting, which is all top notch; as Peter Fonda says in the making-of featurette: ""I ride like the wind.  I hate it, but I make it look good.  That's acting.""

Speaking of bonus features...the movie comes equipped with a very interesting documentary about the reality of what we perceive as the ""Wild West.""  Hope you aren't too surprised to learn Hollywood blew things are of proportion.  The addition of the documentary speaks volumes for Mangold's ideas for the movie; this is a western that never tries to transcend its genre--and by staying in place, it becomes great.  Sometimes, it's nice to see a movie revel in what it is, and never try to be more than it should.  Plus, it's nice to see a good contemporary western; they don't make 'em much anymore.

It doesn't matter if ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a remake; it is a good movie on its own.  See the original, of course; but watch this one too.  For you western purists, you'll enjoy it; while it does, in spots, try to be a bit more realistic, there's still plenty of the western bravado you've come to expect from Hollywood.  If you like action movies...look no further.  Simply put, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one of the best action films in recent years, with Oscar-worthy performances and enough bullets to satisfy even the most ruthless outlaw's bloodlust.

1594409,5,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma is a well done remake of the the 1957 film by the same title. With a few slight differences, this movies quickly earns 4 stars out of the gate.

The cast of Christian Bale (Dan Evans), Russell Crowe (Ben Wade) and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince).  Each rightfully cast into the film with their roles becoming an extension.  It was easy to forget that Bale was Dan Evans, due to the remarkable performance.

The story (quick summary) is based upon Dan Evans trying to redeem himself in the life of his son, Will (Logan Lerman). Dan rides out with his sons to locate cattle let loose by the hands of a man trying to take over his land.  Evans runs into a armored stage coach heist gone bad, meets Wade. Evans takes a turn into town, finds a man is needed to assist taking Wad, in custody, to the 3:10 train to Yuma.  Evans agrees, to earn n the money to save his farm and his graces in the eyes of his son.

The adventure crosses beautiful scenery and brings out performances that will keep you engrossed.  Bale is at his best, with a remarkable performance!!  Crowe found his niche playing a  bible-quoting, gun-toting  ""madman"".  Crowe pulls out a performance, not unlike that of A Beautiful Mind, where he can close himself down and let his actions and voice lead the role as it should... making himself expressionless.  (A breathtaking performance after A Good Year!) and...  as many reviewers have stated and agreed, Ben Foster's role as Charlie Prince, dirty rotten scoundrel and Wade's right hand man, will leave your with squinted eyes, staring, filled  with instant dislike!

The Old West is hard place to live, not only you have to deal with criminals and desert weather, but also with creditors who can be just as dangerous.

Things are not going well financially for the crippled family guy Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who has to support his wife Alice and two sons--he didn't pay the bills and his creditors burned his barn. As he is going back to town with his kids to complain about what happened, they see the famous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) with his vicious gang who just busted a wagon full of cash (killing almost everybody). The gang members see Evans and his kids, but Wade (the boss of the gang) decides to only take their horses and leaves them standing there, but the gang makes a mistake--they left one wounded man. The gang goes to town and while Wade is alone and having fun with a local girl, he gets captured by the authorities while he is talking to Evans--who made it to town anyways. But they need extra help to transport him to catch a train that will take him to prison, and that's where Evans volunteers to help--for $200 dollars. He doesn't know that transporting this infamous bandit will turn his life around.

Review:
Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) has created an instant Western classic in almost every aspect. Here we find two cowboys, who are on different sides of the law, but at the same time, there is a sense of fellowship, loyalty and understanding between them--Not only their acting is impressive, there is so much chemistry on screen. In one hand, we have the outlaw Ben Wade who is a casual guy, a bit of a playboy, but he can be vicious if you push his buttons. despite all the immorality and his cockiness; he is a likeable character nevertheless. Then we have Evans who is a serious man of integrity, a loving father that will do everything he can to support his family righteously. There is a point in the film where his loyalty is put to the test, as well as the will to continue with the mission--this is the point of no return when it's not even about the money anymore. The two characters blend towards the end, they finally understand each other and create one of the best endings in recent memory.

Technically speaking, 3:10 to Yuma is a marvel to behold. We get the classic look and feel of the Old West with excellent cinematography, intense gun battle sequences and good costume design. Perhaps for many, the first act might be a bit slow, but after Wade gets captured, the film picks up with great drama and suspense. With all these great sequences, we also get excellent sound effects--which reminds me a bit of Kevin Costner's Open Range. Some of these sounds effects creates even melancholia--listen carefully, specially during the final battle.

The Verdict:
We didn't know taking the train could be so difficult back in the Old West. 3:10 to Yuma will not disappoint fans of the genre. It follows the classic Western formula with great performances by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Do I see a nomination for any of these vanguard actors? I'd say yes.",1199664000,,3713,4.602719033232629
1594461,5,B00005JPXP,"I was excited when I first sat down to watch the remake of 3:10 to Yuma.  I have yet to see the original and maybe thats a good thing here because I had nothing to compare it too.  The pace of the film does move rather slow, but to me thats what a western is all about.  This movie takes time to develop the characters.  It lets you get a chance to know the two main characters and therefore helps justify the ending that most negative reviewers thought was unbelievable.  The ending for me is what makes this one of the greatest movies of last year.  The intensity of the two main characters and the build up to the final showdown is great.  I loved it.  I would compare to a movie like Unforgiven or Proposition.  Those two movies are slow paced but by the time you get to end it just pulls you in and you realize everything you just saw before the climax was just as important as the climax itself.  One person said Tombstone and Young Guns were better, now I love both those films too, but be honest those two movies are more action based.  A real western isn't about how exciting the west was, it's about how tense it was.  Everyone was just trying to find the means to live.  For entertainment purposes give me Tombstone and Young Guns 1 and 2, but when I want a western that makes me get all tense inside, and makes me think about what I just saw, I'll turn to this one.  As a fan of westerns I highly recommend this film.  It's a great piece of art that deserves to be viewed over and over again.",1199664000,,1504,4.155709342560554
1594462,3,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold's re-envisioning of the classic western ""3:10 to Yuma"" is an astonishing success for 2007. While it unquestionably received an update in crisp dialogue, bloody violence and breath-taking action, it does still retain many elements from the original. It is a different brand and a different breed - but then again ""3:10 to Yuma"" was not a conventional Western even upon its initial release in 1957. With plenty of star power, superior acting and a snazzy score, ""3:10 to Yuma"" proves that the Western may not be dead for audiences of 2007.

Life has dealt a bad hand to Dan Evans (Christian Bale), but he makes the most of it as a simple rancher with his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol). When he accidentally witnesses the robbery of a stagecoach at the hands of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) his life becomes unexpectedly intertwined with the calculating criminal. When the law catches up with Wade, Dan is recruited to escort him to the afternoon train which will take the prisoner to Yuma to await his trial. But Wade's malicious gang is out to set their leader free, and Evans must dodge bullets and more if he hopes to catch the train alive.

As a Western, ""3:10 to Yuma"" brings back the familiar blazing sun, barren deserts and sweaty action of ""Spaghetti"" Westerns, but introduces a more stylized, serious and violent tone than what the original offered. More reminiscent of recent takes on Westerns such as ""Unforgiven"" or ""The Proposition"", it utilizes a setting and mise en scne more than anything else, to emulate the Western feel. It is foremost a character study, and since the original premise was so alluring it was a perfect choice to remake. Like Unforgiven, the lines between good and evil tread very closely, and here the villain is so cool and composed that we readily forget he is a criminal.

""3:10 to Yuma"" was an adept choice to reintroduce to audiences since most people who will be watching the film have never seen the original or didn't know this was a remake. This is a film that is so character driven that it thrives on performances; advances in technology won't overly influence its effectiveness, nor will rehashing underlying plots. The original tells an unconventional story that is nearly untranslatable in the expected realism of today without quenching audiences in an explosive, full-color, thrilling, harsher and more vibrant picture. Fans of the original will most certainly be disappointed by the altered conclusion, but everyone else (the vast majority) will be grandly entertained.

The acting is superb, and Crowe snares the spotlight as a wickedly intelligent and sophisticated outlaw. Christian Bale is Crowe's equal onscreen, and they both demand attention. Not often do the bad guys blend with the good guys to the point that we actually root for both of them to succeed. With respect and perhaps admiration, Bale and Crowe appear almost like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with equal parts rivalry and partnership. Ben Foster is outstanding as the maniacally evil Charlie Prince, who demonstrates the despicable qualities most black-and-white villains (such as his counterpart Richard Jaeckel from the 1957 classic) couldn't have hoped to display. And Peter Fonda plays Byron McElroy, a weathered bounty hunter who snags all the coolest lines in the film.

With an impressive score by Marco Beltrami, stunning cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line and Sideways) and the redefining of good and evil amongst heroes and villains, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a sturdy remake despite the shortcomings of adjusting the finale. The updates will resonate with newer audiences, and this stirring action film may successfully revitalize an almost extinct genre in 2007.

1594467,3,B00005JPXP,"It's inevitable that any movie will have plot holes, but the sheer number of them in this movie that are highly noticeable in the first viewing is incredible.

Spoilers:
Everyone keeps telling everyone else not to talk to Wade - which leads to the death of a few of the party.  Yet they never think of once to gag him?

The scene when they serve Wade dinner.  Now, we all know he's a dangerous murderer and all, yet they give him a miniature pitch fork to scoop up his meal.  He could've charged anyone at the dinner table and murdered someone then and there.  In fact, he actually does kill someone with the fork that he hides.  Predictable?

For some reason, they don't even bother to handcuff him so that his wrists are tied around his back.  So he can basically grab anyone and steal their weapon.  Like how Wade steals Byron's gun (a trained bounty hunter) and throws him off a cliff.  Logic?

The hotel scene.  Evans and the marshall and his guns are on the upper story of a hotel.  They see Wades gang all congregated right outside their window.  Evans in fact has some sort of two shot shot gun.  I mean he could've easily blown off Charlie's head and another gangmember then and there.  The marshall could then kill the other two.  Yet they stand there and let Wade tell them everything.  OK?

Evans has a wooden leg yet he can outrun 15 people shooting at him at once while dragging along Wade.  Uh huh.

At almost every point int he movie, I'm wondering why Wade doesn't just grab the guy he's standing next to's gun OR when Wade actually has a gun, why doesn't he just shoot that person's back?  It's like they are standing there asking ""Hey Wade, can you please steal my gun when I look in the other direction?""  I mean, why not just blindfold Wade or break his fingers so he can't shoot a gun?  Or at least handcuff his wrists around his back.  It's incredible.

In fact, he just changes sides for no apparent reason in the end and slays his entire gang because Evans told him that he's 'not a hero and that he was shot from behind.'  Why?

It's appalling that these things are all so blatant.  The movie is watchable because of the acting and the limited gunfighting.  They kill off many of the characters for no apparent reason, like Byron, who is easily the coolest character in the movie.  But ultimately it's not satisfying due to the many plot holes, inconsistencies and lack of 'western' action.  The first battle scene when the gang takes the coach with the payroll is easily and shamefully the best and only worthy action scene in the movie.",1198972800,7,2564,4.421841541755889
1594468,4,B00005JPXP,"The western used to be king in Hollywood. Then it died. Or so goes conventional wisdom. ""The western is dead"" is a mantra repeated by those who either just don't understand the genre or don't understand that for any movie to succeed, regardless of genre, it either has to have a great story or great characters or, best yet, both. 3:10 TO YUMA has both and it should come as no surprise to anyone that it's one of the best films released in 2007.

The film is a remake of a 1957 movie. I have yet to see the original, so I can't compare the two.

Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a simple rancher trying to make an honest living as a small time rancher. However, Evans borrowed money from the wrong person and the sooner Evans is off the land the better. The money lender keeps sending people to harass Evans and his family even though he still has time to pay off the debt. While traveling to Bisbee to try to clear up some of land and debt problems, Evans and his son arrive at the scene of a stagecoach robbery by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). Wade asks to borrow Evan's horses, but promises he shall get them back later. Torn between letting a wanted criminal escape and protecting his family, Evans submits. As he continues to town, he finds his horses on the trail unharmed. Later Wade is captured in Bisbee and Evans is recruited as a deputy to escort Wade to Contention to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma. Evans doesn't really want to perform the job, but the money offered is enough to save his ranch and keep his family fed. The journey to Contention is a perilous one as they are pursued by Wade's gang, are forced to travel through hostile Indian territory, and have a run-in with some railroad workers who want to have their own personal revenge on Wade. Despite having an incredibly violent shootout, the movie finds its core in the values of honor and commitment and the psychological struggles that a man has to deal with in living an honorable life.

Russell Crowe does a decent job at portraying Ben Wade. Wade is an interesting paradox. He is a ruthless killer, but he also lives by a twisted code of ethics and honor. Near the beginning of the film he's presented the opportunity to kill the one man that has been hunting him his entire life, but he doesn't and lets the man live. I know many people didn't have the same reaction, but at the end of the film I really cared about Wade and was hoping that he would evade the law a little longer.

Even though Crowe received first billing, the real star of the film is Christian Bale. Bale is such a talented actor that I will watch any movie he is in. His performance of the conflicted rancher Dan Evans is perfect. Evans is trying desperately to live an honest life, but finds it incredibly difficult, especially since he has a secret that his family has no knowledge. The role is one that in the hands of a less talented actor would seem to be sentimental and clich&eacute;. Bale's performance is none of that and fills Evans with a conflicted emotional intensity that any man who has ever considered himself a ""common man"" can relate.

I know that this version of 3:10 TO YUMA has received some criticism for not staying true to the original story, being too violent, not being realistic, and being too psychological. As noted earlier, I've never seen the original film and therefore can't personally comment on the criticism. However, talking with others who have seen the original film as well as this version, I get the impression that the movie might not be exactly the same as the original film, but does remain true to the spirit of the film as well as the original Elmore Leonard story that both movies were based upon.

The film is violent, but it isn't incredibly graphic; people get shoot and they bleed and people get hurt and you see their pain. That's the type of violence here. Sure it's bloody, but it is realistic and none of it feels unnecessary. As for the film being unrealistic, well this is a movie. Sure the shoot out at the end probably would not have unfolded as it did in real life. However, given the character of Ben Wade, it still fits within our ""suspension of disbelief"" (you know, also known as imagination, that thing that has to happen in order for a movie or story to work).

The movie is very psychological. Good guys don't always wear white and bad guys aren't always dressed in black. Heroes have flaws and villains can sometimes turn out to be a hero. That might not be the way things are supposed to be, but that is the way things usually are in this world. I like a good old fashioned Western almost as much as my parents do, but I like it when things get mixed up a little, too. To me, movies are a bit more realistic when things appear grey instead of just black and white. Highly recommended and in my opinion one of the best movies released in theatres in 2007.",1198627200,,4866,4.424107142857143

Wounded in the Civil War, struggling rancher Dan Evans has earned the scorn of his son as he faces foreclosure on their ranch. Meanwhile, outlaw Ben Wade has ridden into town, and in a desperate move to earn $200 and save the ranch, Evans agrees to risk his life to escort Wade to the train that will take him to prison. On the long ride through the desert wilderness to the train, Wade and Evans come to grudgingly admire each other as they tell their stories during the long night. But Wade is no outlaw with a heart of gold; woe to any man who crosses him, whether it be a wise guy marshal or member of his own gang who makes a mistake. And Evans has a past he's deeply ashamed of, and has to live with the fact that he feels his son's disdain is almost deserved. There isn't any good guy/bad guy clarity here; it's hard to tell who's who sometimes as Wade's childhood, the slaughters he's perpetrated, the crimes of the railroad company and the killings by the ""law"" are revealed.

There's a lot of violence in this film, but it wasn't gratuitous. The ending isn't quite believable, but this is a morality play. Highly recommended, but use caution for kids--it can get bloody out there.",1198540800,4,1491,4.964

It juxtaposes two men- one is unaccomplished, frustrated, and desperate-in short, a failure with a family.  The other is unattached, romantic, intelligent, fast, and powerfully charismatic.

It really does take every minute of the movie, and especially the structure of the ending, to tell us WHY the first of the two men is the true hero, and why the second is empty and valueless.  You'll see that the West was won by men of no accomplishment and high character, not men of talent and charisma.  You'll see that a father's love has more power than a gunslinger's right hand.  Perhaps most important, you'll see that a hero is such because he gives, not because he takes.

James Mangold's 2007 remake of 3:10 TO YUMA also has superb acting, but the almost continuous and extreme violence turned me off to the point that I couldn't have cared less about what happened to the characters and how the movie ended.  In fact, the ending is nothing short of ludicrous.

1594526,5,B00005JPXP,"Although many say the Western is dead, in books as well as movies, it continues to rear its head and make itself known every so often.  There's something inherently noble and visceral about the artform and the subject matter, the calm delineation between good and evil, that stubbornly continues to attract an audience.

In 2007, the Western showed back up at the box office in a trio of films that came out roughly at the same time.  3:10 TO YUMA was the first out of the gate, but it was followed in quick order by THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.

The movie had been made fifty years ago, and much of the plot in that version made it into the remake.  Both movies were based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, who has had several of his Western and crime novels made into films.

Christian Bale stars as Dan Evans, a one-legged, down-on-his-luck rancher struggling to keep a home together for his wife and two kids.  Russell Crowe plays Ben Wade, an intelligent and heartless outlaw who's leading one of the blood-thirstiest gangs to ever take up the owlhoot trail.

Both stars take turns stealing scenes.  Bale has the hard-edged look of coarse rawhide.  Crowe possesses some of the deadest eyes ever shown in movies.

One of the best portrayals in the movie was a surprise to me, though.  It took me a minute to recognize Peter Fonda as professional bounty hunter turned Pinkerton agent Byron McElroy.  Fonda reminded me a lot of his father Henry, but part of that is because Fonda has aged.  He also delivers a quality of acting and honesty in the character that is just amazing, and he was content to carry the supporting character role and didn't try to upstage anyone.

Logan Lerman was another surprise.  He stared as William Evans, Dan's 14-year-old son.  I'd thought Lerman was much older, but as it turned out he was 14 when the movie was made.  He was likeable and intense.

When it came to truly cold-blooded villains, though, Ben Foster as Charlie Prince totally blew me away.  The hair on the back of my neck went up as soon as he stepped on stage, and within a minute I hated him.

The story is simple.  Dan is struggling to make ends meet and bumps into Wade during an armored wagon job.  Later, after taking Byron McElroy into town for medical attention, Dan confronts Hollander, the man who's trying to run him off his land.  When Hollander won't give him an extension on his loan, Dan finds Wade and helps take him captive.  Then he agrees to help transport him to Yuma for $200.

The movie quickly spins out into the action of the violent road trip.  In addition to being one of the fastest gunmen around, Wade is also a skilled psychological warrior, constantly taunting his captors and seeking out their weaknesses.

The action involves traveling through hostile Indian lands, meeting up with a team of killers working the railroad coming through the area, and a final showdown in Yuma that is one of the most exciting I've ever seen in a Western.

For two hours, I sat marveling at the characters,  then tensely awaiting the outcome of the latest danger they were all facing.  Even then, the twists and turns of the characters, the back stories they were all hiding till the very last moment, were awesome.  No one was quite who I thought they were.

Westerns succeed best by having good men with a history of bad violence and bad men who haven't completely gone over to the dark side.  3:10 TO YUMA is one of those.

One caveat I will offer to people who have seen the original movie starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, this version does NOT follow the same paths or end up the same way.  Expect to be surprised and shocked at how things turn out.  And you'll be tense nearly the whole way through.",1196035200,221,3780,4.522123893805309

While Bale and especially Crowe are good in their respective roles, the movie just doesn't have the drive, passion or vision of other far more entertaining Westerns. It just doesn't feel as if the director had a grasp for the material -- it seems he was following a set-in-stone outline/screenplay without adding some dramatic strength to the proceedings.
The film is not directed as well as it could be as there are transitions that lack good directorial flow and things seem to happen (or are filmed in ways lacking the right amount of suspense or tension) just to serve the script, especially the very end, which is a letdown after what's come before.

1594582,3,B00005JPXP,"This is one of those movies that are technically superb -- great acting, the best in cinematography, a first-rate screenplay (albeit one that was filmed before, back in the 1950s).

 But at the heart of this movie, at the core of its concept, is moral rot.

 I'm from the old school of westerns. I don't demand that my heroes be perfect -- but I want them to be real heroes, nonetheless. I don't expect that the townspeople will automatically rush forward to help the good guys win their struggle with the baddies. After all, ""High Noon"" and other classic westerns showed us ordinary, honest citizens who wouldn't lift a hand to defend themselves from the scum of the prairie -- who expected ""the marshal"" to do all their fighting for them.

 But the townspeople in ""High Noon"" didn't turn on Marshal Will Kane and try to kill him after having hundred-dollar bills waved in their faces by Frank Miller's gang. And Miller and said gang were not depicted as somehow invincible, dashingly romantic characters who even have the hero's son all goo-goo eyed over them, as is the case in ""3.10.""

 Russell Crowe is a superstar who dominates the screen in any movie he's in. But did the producers of this movie have to make him so daggone sure of himself about everything, and so clever (and the posse who has him in custody so fumbling) that he manages to kill two or three of them before they even get him to the hotel?

 Then there is the final scene, where Crowe, in an improbable and sudden change of mind, guns down all his old gang just before alighting the prison train. It's like the director is telling us, ""These men are so special that only their own fearless leader is allowed to kill them -- not any two-bit marshal!""

 The final indignity comes just before the fadeout. As the train pulls away from the station, Crowe whistles to his horse, which is standing beside the track. The animal quickly trots after the departing train carrying his master. Can you say, ""Daring prison train escape"" and ""sequel""?

 Pardner, in my book only Gene Autry or Roy Rogers or Ken Maynard were allowed to call their horse that way. Not some murdering, cynical bank robber who believes in nothing but his own greed and survival.

 Meanwhile, Chrisian Bale, the well-meaning but barely competent ""good guy,"" lies dead beside the tracks after having been shot by the paid-off mob of ""honest citizens.""

 Call me old-fashioned, but is this the kind of movie we want our young people to see? Is this what we want for our ""entertainment""? I sure don't.

 Like I said before, I want a western where you don't have to ponder, trying to decide who is the good guy and who is the crook. Where you don't have to hide your face with embarrassment at being an ""honest citizen"" like those who shot down lawmen so outlaws could escape, all for some almighty dollars. Where the boy in the movie admires the good guy -- not the chief crook.

 I want Gene Autry back.",1194912000,5,2939,4.558095238095238

1594585,5,B00005JPXP,"Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a Civil War veteran, is having a tough time of it running his family's ranch in the Arizona desert. Dan owes money to Hollander, a rich landowner who sets Dan's barn on fire to run him off. The land is worth more to the landowner who wants to sell it to the railroad. The next morning, Dan and his two sons, William (Logan Lerman) and Mark (Benjamin Petry) set out to round up their cattle. Their path will lead them across Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), a notorious bandit, and his crew of heartless thieves, including Charlie Prince (Ben Foster, HBO's ""Six Feet Under"", ""X-Men: The Last Stand""). Ben and his team have just robbed the latest stagecoach carrying cash for the railroad and killed all of the Pinkerton agents guarding the shipment, save one, sparing the life of Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda). Wade takes Dan's horses, but leaves them alive, so he and his men can ride into the nearby town. There, they send the sheriff out on a wild goose chase and enjoy come relaxation time. But Charlie wants to get the team across the border and is surprised when Ben says he will meet them soon. Ben is soon apprehended and the railroad wants to get the criminal to the ""3:10"" prison train leaving Contention for the camp in Yuma. They offer five men a lot of money to make sure Wade makes the short journey in time for the train. Dan takes the money, in an effort to pay off some of his debt, and to keep the ranch going until the next spring. Naturally, when Charlie learns of Ben's capture, he brings the crew back and they are determined to free their boss.

Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line""), this remake is a very good film. Intense, believable, well-acted and exciting, it even makes a completely implausible ending work.

The film works for a lot of reasons. Let's start at the top.

Russell Crowe and Christian Bale top line the film and both turn in yet another very good performance. It is interesting that each actor just seems to get better and better with each film. Very different actors, they do seem to have a similar taste for challenging roles.

Crowe is arguably the bigger star, but he likes to challenge himself and take on roles like heartless criminal Ben Wade. As the story progresses and we learn more and more about Wade, we learn to appreciate his character more and see more of the layers Crowe is bringing to this role. Initially, he seems like just another sociopath killer, who feels no pain as he kills yet another person standing between him and some money. But is he really that heartless? Or does he feel slightly pressured, even intimidated by the heartless people in his crew? That is for you to decide, but the mere fact Crowe is able to give this character that kind of depth speaks volumes to his skill as an actor.

Wade is also not above playing little mind games with people. After he is captured, the posse takes him to Dan's ranch, where he meets Dan's wife, Alice (Gretchen Mol). While they wait for some business to unfold, they have dinner and Wade quickly ascertains Dan's weak points and starts to use those to poke some pins and needles into the rancher's hide. These moments are amusing and help to lighten the tone. As William, Dan's older son listens to the criminal's stories; he even seems to start to develop a little hero worship, which doesn't escape Dan's notice.

Then, they are off, to make the journey to Contention, to make the train.

Christian Bale is never anything less than interesting in his films. Quite often, he is simply mesmerizing. Even as Bruce Wayne, he manages to make the character seem real, and to give the former graphic novel creation a lot of depth and unusual traits. He often physically punishes himself for the sake of the role; for ""The Machinist"", he lost a lot of weight to play the role of an insomniac who worried about the world closing in on him, in the recently released ""September Dawn"", he lost a lot of weight, during filming, to portray an American fighter pilot held prisoner in Laos during the Vietnam War. But does this make him a good actor? Well, it certainly helps to create the illusion of the character he is playing in any given film. But Bale brings a lot more to his roles and usually creates mesmerizing performances.

Dan Evans is a man who has had many struggles in his life. A Civil War veteran, he seems slightly put off he doesn't get and can't command any respect for his civil service. He lost part of a leg yet a wealthy land owner doesn't even seem to give it a moment's thought when he orders his men to torch Dan's barn. Because Dan feels powerless, he comes off as a bit of a wimp in the eyes of his older son, one of the many factors prompting him to take on the task of transporting Wade. He wants to redeem himself and earn his son's respect.

It is a performance the equal of Crowe's. Each reveals little aspects of their characters as the story progresses. As each learns about the other, they seem to come to a better understanding of their nemesis. I won't call them friends, but they seem to appreciate the choices each has made, and in some cases, will make, throughout the course of the film.

Peter Fonda turns in a stand-out performance as the Pinkerton agent who decides to take out his vengeance on Wade by trying to ensure he makes that train. Alan Tudyk (just seen in ""Death at a Funeral"") has another memorable supporting role as Doc Potter, drafted into the journey. Luke Wilson has a brief, but intense cameo as a railroad worker bent on revenge.

But the real standout of the supporting cast is Ben Foster. As Charlie Prince, we see a mirror image of what Ben Wade once was; all bad, driven to do nothing but rob money, kill anyone who gets in their way, keep his gang in order and help keep his boss out of jail. He quickly rounds up the gang to save Ben. When they realize what is required to save Wade, he quickly silences their objections to what lies ahead. We never feel as though there is any question he will succeed in his plan; he is that driven, that committed to Wade.

The film is filled with great dialogue, the type of dialogue that helps to build the characters and allow us to learn about their past, giving us a more rounded view of their persona. Throughout, Wade and Dan have conversations which initially start as a minor form of mind game initiated by Wade. But as he gets to know the rancher, he starts to subtly reveal things about himself. Both characters are the better for this subtle form of exposition.

These same conversations also help to lay the groundwork for the finale. Now, I still don't buy into the film's conclusion, I don't believe some of the actions of some of the characters, but the film sets up this ending very well, dropping little clues and hints throughout.

The dialogue also appears to be authentic. As the characters speak, they don't use any modern day phrases, ruining the image of watching two men in the Old West. Period characters speaking in modern dialect is a more common thing than you might realize; because we are familiar with modern day words and phrases, it is more difficult for us to realize these are being used inappropriately in a period piece. It is interesting that we are now seeing a variety of projects attempting to give us a hyper-realistic view of what life was like in the Old West. First, HBO's ""Deadwood"" created by David Milch, and in which every other word out of every character's mouth is the ""F"" word. But it works, and is surprisingly engrossing. Now with ""3:10 To Yuma"", we see another thorough, seemingly accurate depiction of a different part of the Old West.

There are also a number of terrific action sequences, keeping things lively and interesting. Because this is a western, these involve robbing stagecoaches, shootouts and chases on horseback. I realize some people may not appreciate this type of action, too old-fashioned, but it gives a stronger sense of immediacy, of danger to the film. Because the things are happening on a smaller scale to `real' people, they seem more dangerous.

""3:10 To Yuma"" is a very good film. A remake of the Glenn Ford - Van Heflin original, I have never seen the first film, so I can't compare the two. But the new version featuring great performances from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, a number of fine supporting performances, and great dialogue is a very good film.",1194220800,18,8385,4.546719681908549

Turns out it was very well done, well directed, tight writing, artful delivery, great cinematography...  What I found most compelling about the film was the lead actors.  Bale tends to have pretty boy stamped on him in everything he does (though I think he's a fantastic actor), and as he plays a man quite truncated in his virility, I enjoyed seeing him act with such reserve.  He mastered understatement in this film, allowing subtler facets of his skill to come to the fore.  I do think he is a creator to watch, and it's a pretty nice view to behold.  At the other end of the spectrum we have Crow, whom I've been impressed with but never truly blown away by.  Perhaps I am not so moved in this film either, but I was immensely impressed with Ben Wade.  Wade was richly presented in all his contradictory angles, so much so that I found I no longer minded that he was engineered by Crow.

Whether he gets to that train and how he gets there plays out in James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma, a film both rightfully praised and condemned by critics and audiences alike.

Called the first great Western since Unforgiven (which isn't saying much considering the company), the film has more than its share of strengths, including one of the more exciting plots in recent years.  The last half of the film rivals the intensity and uncertainty of a great mystery, action and drama all rolled into one.  Although it's clear the third act is heading for Yuma and many bullets will fly at about 3:10, the film doesn't tip its hand as to how exactly everything is going to fall together.  By the time you figure it out, your diving under your seat to dodge the bullets.

Bale shines in yet another role.  As an actor in his early 30s, Bale's face shows the age and weather of a man from his father's generation.  His Dan Evans carries the literal and figurative scars of the Civil War and does so with a humble stoicism shocking to those who know him only as the Caped Crusader.  With his chameleon-like versatility and willingness to pass on glamorous roles in favor of playing emotionally and physically ugly characters, Bale is staking his claim as the actor of his generation.

With all that praise, this is far from a perfect film.  At times, the action borders on ridiculous.  Once viewers come down from the adrenaline, they will question the plot's plausibility and see that much of it is pure Hollywood fantasy.  The most obvious flaw deals with the reaction of the guys taking Wade to Yuma after he kills two of them and seems impossible to control.  At that point, real cowboys would have strung him from the nearest tree and been done with him.  Instead, they give him repeated chances to peal them off one at a time like buxom coeds in a slasher film.

Wade lacks the ambiguity of more irresistible villains.  Yeah, he's a step above his uncultured crew of ""animals"" (his words), but he's still a mustache-twirling killer who does everything short of tying innocent women to railroad tracks.  Unlike Bale, Crowe doesn't own this role.  At no point did I forget I was watching Russell Crowe...in a western...as a bad guy...dressed in black...with a fast gun.  In a film full of western cliches and stock characters/action, Crowe's villain is the most tiresome.",1192406400,,2546,4.651006711409396

Previous reviewers have pointed out some of the more ridiculous gaffes, like a guy getting gut shot one day and riding around just fine the next.  Here's a few more: Despite the villain getting away repeatedly, nobody in the posse ever thinks to put a blindfold over his eyes or a sack over his head.  Nor do they ever tie a rope to leash him to someone or something.  Then they head into Injun' territory with the bad guys hot on their trail.  So what do they do?  They stop and camp for the night (instead of pushing on) with a nice big fire so the Apaches can easily find them!  When they get to town they decide to wait for the train by hiding at the hotel.  Gee whiz, I bet them bad guys will never think to look at the hotel.  Not!  We later find out the hotel is half a mile from the station.  Hmmm, not a real good location unless you want to give the baddies plenty of chances to blast you as you run for the train.  They probably should have put the 14 year old kid in charge of the posse - he seems to be the only one with brains and initiative.

Crowe's character is a ruthless killer but believes his victims' lack of integrity justifies his actions.  Consequently, he never met a man whose killing he couldn't justify -- until he meets Bale's character.

Bale's integrity and the way it breaks Crowe is an interesting metaphor for the triumph of good over evil.  The only problem is that this phenomenon requires the audience to temporarily suspend its sense of reality.

This western grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for two hours.  At the end, I felt like I hadn't taken a breath the whole time.  It's gritty and dirty and cruel and incredibly intense.  Crowe manages to make his nasty character likeable and even heroic at the end.  His manly charisma dominates the screen.  Bale is also excellent as the pitable, noble rancher.  I was really rooting for him.  Ben Foster plays  a thoroughly hateful sadist with relish, but he looked so much like Mike Love of the Beachboys that I was a little distracted during his close-ups.

1594656,4,B00005JPXP,"When actor-turned-director Clint Eastwood single-handedly resurrected the western with 1985's gritty ""Pale Rider,"" the genre was a horse which had been beaten time and time again, long past its apparent death.  But Eastwood nourished it back to health, and the genre has gone through something of a revival since then.  The latest ""neo-western"" is James Mangold's ""3:10 to Yuma,"" a remake of the 1957 classic starring Van Heflin and Glenn Ford, which, in turn, was based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.

The thinness of Christian Bale would seem ghastly if it weren't for the fact that he's put his body through worse, like his turn as a Vietnam pilot in Werner Herzog's recent ""Rescue Dawn"" or particularly his horrifically skeletal appearance as an anorexic insomniac in 2004's ""The Machinist.""  As astoundingly versatile as ever, Bale easily slips into the role of Dan Evans, a would-be rancher who's in debt over his head and having some family problems, most of which concern his rebellious and headstrong eldest son (played by Logan Lerman).

Along comes Ben Wade, the most feared man in the Old West, quick as a whip with his pistol and just as quick to reveal a devilish smirk.  Fate finds him captured at last, cornered in a saloon.  A ragtag group is assembled to escort him to a town eighty miles away, where Wade will be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma, and then hanged.  Dan sees his chance to prove himself to a family that no longer cares, so he volunteers to lead the group, accompanied by a variety of different people portrayed by the likes of Peter Fonda, Dallas Roberts, and Alan Tudyk.  Meanwhile, nearby, Wade's gang, headed by the feral Charlie Prince (played by Ben Foster, who last we saw in the third ""X-Men"" movie), rallies their forces and begins racing Wade's captors to Yuma.

That's not all Dan and his group will face in their journey; along with the psychological taunts of Ben Wade, they'll also have to deal with raging apaches and vengeful miners (including Luke Wilson).

It sounds familiar, and it is.  As ""3:10 to Yuma"" has been done before (and done well), one would expect that Mangold's re-hash would try to add something or stir things up a bit.  Early in the film, Mangold and his writers try to decide whether their film should be more realistic, a western with depth, or a stern-faced homage to the westerns of old.  What made recent westerns like Clint Eastwood's extraordinary ""Unforgiven,"" or even Kevin Costner's ""Open Range,"" so great, was their ability to honor their decades-old forefathers by looking straight ahead and striving to do something more than just lovingly reference films like ""High Noon"" or ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.""  Unfortunately, Mangold & Co. try to look ahead, but can't help glancing over their shoulders repeatedly at the film's predecessors.  It's in the panoramic scenery and dusty close-ups, the stiff dialogue (filled with the obligatory post-""Deadwood"" cussin'), even in the occasionally Morricone-esque pluckiness of the score (which quickly masks this with some refreshingly ambient and strong guitar work).

Despite the slightly-confused efforts of Mr. Mangold, who last directed 2005's ""Walk the Line,"" the cast is like the West's sturdiest horse, effortless carrying the film through the dusty haze of its misdeeds.  The villain almost always steals the film, and Crowe's villain is no exception.  He plays the part with a chilling glint in his eye and frightening malice in his smile, topped off with the cocky invincibility of Hannibal Lecter.  He's especially effective in the film's final scenes, which reveal, delightfully, that Crowe's character is nowhere near as shallow as he once seemed.

Crowe is the yin to Bale's yang, a potentially fascinating contrast that isn't explored to the fullest.  Bale has become well-accustomed to the part of the unhealthy, tormented, disturbed man looking for a change, and it goes without saying that he examines all the depth of the character and brings it on to the screen.  Unfortunately, there isn't quite enough depth to the character, and so Bale's performance seems considerably less dazzling than his performance in recent releases like ""The Prestige.""  He narrowly evades standing in Crowe's villainous shadow.

The supporting cast sags a little under the weight of these two cinematic titans, but manages to hold their own.  Peter Fonda is especially brilliant as a grey old Pinkerton who's still hard as steel and rough as sandpaper, and who's not afraid of Ben Wade - or much else, apparently.  His performance is the sort that makes one wonder just what Fonda's been up to lately.

Another supporting castmate of interest is golden blonde Gretchen Mol, who plays Bale's wife.  A tense dinner with Ben Wade eventually leads to a one-on-one confrontation between Wade and Mol's character; their behavior in this scene suggests that perhaps Mol may have already met the mean Mr. Wade somewhere previously.  Perhaps she'd led a very different life before becoming Mrs. Dan Evans.  Perhaps her character, like many of the film's others, could have been quite interesting, given a little more attention from the filmmakers.

The final sequence of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is truly intense, the first entirely believable hero-dodging-bullets scene in recent memory.  The rest of the film isn't too shabby either, but neither is it too great.  In the Old West, a man had to decide whether he was good or bad and then stand by his decision; that was the way of the land.  ""3:10 to Yuma"" can't make a decision whether it wants to be like one of the old westerns or be its own film, a hard-hearted, full-speed-ahead neo-western.  It's a sturdy enough ride, thanks to an untouchable cast, but at the ride's end, that's all it is.",1191196800,3,5759,4.94392523364486

Christian Bale is equally remarkable as Dan Evans, a one-legged former Union soldier now a good-hearted but down-on-his luck rancher, failing at his miserable spread and in the eyes of his family. The superb supporting cast includes Peter Fonda as a crusty, tough old bounty-hunter and Ben Foster as Wade's murderous deputy.

As the movie opens, Dan Evans is in danger of losing his ranch altogether, while Ben Wade and his gang are robbing a Pinkerton-protected stage coach.  Evans helps capture Wade, and signs on for the money to help escort Wade to a train that will take him to the Yuma Prison.  Thus begins a harrowing ride cross-country through hostile Apaches, revenge-seekers, and Wade's vicious gang out to rescue their boss.

At the heart of the story is the delicate wrestling match between Wade and Evans.  The cynical Wade tries repeatedly to bribe the needy Evans into releasing him.  Evans, who we learn has had more than his share of bad breaks, turns out to have both surprising steel and compassion. As the two men survive a series of violent events en route to the train station, they develop an odd mixture of respect for one another, each the product of his breaks and his choices.  This unusual relationship drives the last half hour of the movie, as, in the face of enormous odds, Evans will try to escort Wade to the 3:10 train.

The film is perhaps overlong for its slim storyline, although it does allow the viewer to get to know the characters in their very human ambiguity.  These same characters seem to survive amazing damage from bullet wounds and rifle butts without losing their ability to get up and run or fight back.  The director seems not to have enough faith that the audience would understand the implied premise that the relationship between Wade and Evans is based on the traditional code of the West; he layers justification for each actor's actions.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of the traditional Western and of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.",1191110400,5,2315,4.76
1594658,5,B00005JPXP,"Dan Evans (Bale) needs money to save his ranch.  Forclosure is on the horizon, and he is short on money.  Being a former sharpshooter in the Civil War makes him a good addition to the group escorting outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) to the train station.  There Wade will catch the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison, and a hanging.  The journey is full of troubles, not the least of which is the fact that Wade's gang is in pursuit, led by Charlie Prince (Foster),  Prince is Wade's right hand man, any wants nothing more than to see Wade set free.

This movie is all Crowe and Bale.  They give great performances, and are the reason to see ""3:10 to Yuma"".  Crowe in particular bounces back and forth between charming and nasty, yet creates a character that is likeable in his own way.  The supporting case, including Peter Fonda and Ben Foster solidly support the leads as well.  Action-wise, there is enough to satisfy and both suspenseful and, at times, violent.  The ending is satisfying and feels right, given what has gone before.  I highly recommend ""3:10 to Yuma"".",1190937600,5,1055,4.5828877005347595
1594729,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma is about Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his band of thugs who have repeatedly orchestrated several robberies in Arizona in the late 1800s.  It is also about Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a self-deprecating rancher who is doing what he can within his own ethics to get his family by, but he is failing.  Evans first meets Wade when he and his sons witness one of the robberies. Soon, Evans visits the town of Bisbee alone to confront a man he is in arrears with and he happens upon Wade and his gang again, who had drawn the authorities out of town after having Wade's top goon Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) inform the authorities of the latest robbery and saying that Wade's group headed elsewhere.  Evans leaves and meets the Bisbee authorities when they see him helping a wounded bounty hunter, who Wade and his men shot during their robbery.  Evans informs them that Wade and his men are indeed in Bisbee.  Evans actually plays an active role in apprehending Wade, and he agrees to assist in escorting Wade to the town of Contention, where Wade will take a prison train to his inevitable execution for his many murders and robberies.  That train is the 3:10 to Yuma and the movie's primary focus involves the ride to Contention and the various encounters with Wade's pursuing gang and many other enemies along the way.

3:10 to Yuma is a well polished piece of western cinema.  If Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was an elegy to the once alive and well American genre then I guess 3:10 to Yuma is an fitting in memoriam.  It's a remake actually, although almost unrecognizable from the original 1957 western.  Other than what amounts to being a fairly unsatisfying conclusion, 3:10 to Yuma is one of the best films of 2007 so far.  There are many things to praise here.  James Mangold (Walk the Line, Copland) puts together a fun and entertaining shoot'em up that also happens to deliver in both style and substance.  The characters are great here and the performances are handled well enough that I wouldn't be too surprised if we saw two or three get credit in the upcoming award season.  Although, the fantastic screenplay may very well be the unsung hero.

Christian Bale repeatedly solidifies his reputation as a great actor by, in my humble opinion, actually upstaging Crowe.  Part of that is the character of Wade, which I'm almost tempted to say was written to be an ego-booster for Russell Crowe.  I'm not one of those people who tries to bash Crowe though, he is amazing in this too.  His presence is formidable in anything and the character of Ben Wade definitely calls for it.  The best performance in this film and who I think would be well rewarded with a Golden Globe or an Oscar nomination is Ben Foster as Charlie Prince.  I'm pretty sure we'll see him get nominated and perhaps even win. He is incredibly scary and one the best villains to come along in some time.  Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda were very good in their limited roles as well.  I actually think this is hands down the best ensemble cast of the year so far and one of the best to come along in quite a while.

Still, the film does seem anti-climactic and maybe upon another viewing I'll concede that the ending was satisfying, but for now it really is that alone that keeps 3:10 to Yuma from getting a perfect rating.  It's the first film of the year that I'd recommend seeing as soon as possible because by award season this will likely be one of the movies everyone is talking about.",1190851200,10,3473,4.573505654281099
1594730,5,B00005JPXP,"Believe what they're telling you.  The remake of `3:10 to Yuma' deserves all the accolades heaped upon it.  Going on a limb, I found '3:10...' to be superior to the revered modern Western classic, 'Unforgiven,'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgiven/dp/0790729644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unforgiven</a>&nbsp;which gave new meaning and thrust to the revenge motif.  What makes this movie special is how it hits you.  Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are marvelous, the centers of fine acting with good support all around.  The story is a solid one to boot.  What mainly impresses me that even when expecting twists and turns in the movie, it seldom failed to shock and surprise.  I felt like I was the duped narrator in Mark Twain's ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"".  Truly Director James Mangold has assembled a modern classic, one worth owning and watching again and again.  If you don't mind all the expletives, this movie's as essential as about any Western I can think of.  Not since 'The Proposition'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proposition/dp/B000GIW9I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proposition</a>&nbsp;have I enjoyed a Western of this fine caliber (sorry for the lame pun).  (Even if the latter film was far different, including that it was really an Eastern--as from the Australian Outback.)

The story remains the same, but not having read it nor seen the 50's film, I felt the compelling ride.  Dan Evans (Bale) is a trying man.  He does what he can honestly to keep his ranch even if the robber barons and the railroad tycoons use all means possible to usurp his land.  In debt, they cut off his water supply even after he's made payments.  His family tries to keep a high moral profile with a hard-working wife and two spirited sons.  Particularly his eldest son, William, is a stalwart for his father's instilled virtues.  On the other side of the fence is Ben Wade (Crowe), a slippery outlaw who has a band of loyal bandits who outnumber the forces of law and order in the West.  He is a friend of Native Americans and a foe of Manifest Destiny, even if he sports his own twisted take on scriptural vengeance.  There are many key supporting players, including Wade's cold-blooded side-kick, Charlie, whose menace is as quiet as it is off safety, and McElroy (Peter Fonda), an elderly, but tough and experienced bounty hunter for Pinkerton's.  To survive financially, Evans must deliver Wade to the 3:10 train going to Yuma in order to earn a $200.00 reward.

There are plenty of complications to keep us alert, and the movie's pace always uses good judgment.  During the campfire scenes time is never wasted to fill us in on the past and draw full sketches of motives and character.  Just when we are about to mosey back into our seats, the film hits us again.  We are blind-sided like much of the fates of the key players.  Caught in the crosshairs between corrupt monopolists and ruthless bandits, Dan Evans has us rooting for an ordinary man who is truly wronged, befriending an outlaw he finds in an odd but mutual arrangement.  Always keeping the audience guessing, '3:10 to Yuma' is a treasure of a cinematic experience.",1190505600,5,3261,5.18546845124283
1594731,5,B00005JPXP,"It doesn't matter what genre he's writing in, Elmore Leonard can tell a riveting story and the cast and crew of this movie managed to make it near as good as the written word.

Dan Evans (Bale) is a crippled Civil War vet with a wife and two kids and a farm about to be foreclosed on for the railroad.  When Ben Wade (Crowe) robs a stage in his town, Evans volunteers to join a 4 man posse to escort Wade to catch the 3:10 to Yuma. He needs to stay with his wife, kids, and scattered herd--but this is the only chance he's got to get the money to save his ranch.

The journey takes them through Apache country and a mental minefield of memories and pain.  At the end, only Evans remains to get Wade on that train and the temptation is strong to just take that irresistible offer from Wade and walk away.

""3:10"" is a Western in the old style.  It's gritty, it's strong, but it also possesses some of newer character development which explains why both men are the way they are.  The film held my attention throughout the whole run.  Both my husband, who is a die hard Western fan, and my friend liked this film as well.",1190332800,5,1119,4.196261682242991

1594733,4,B00005JPXP,"There is an Amazon review here by Clare Quilty (Lolita anyone?) that nails all the illogic in this film so I will not repeat it.  He's got that right, but I enjoyed this film anyway.  It was smartly paced, looked great, and had a marvelous cast.  Russell Crowe's roguish killer/bandit playing mind games with his captors was great fun.  Christian Bale's downtrodden rancher trying to find some redemption for a failed life was compelling.  There's a bit more unease generated by Ben Foster's devoted lieutenant than just pure psychopath.  And there's a nice bit by an, at first, unrecognizable Peter Fonda as a vicious bounty hunter.

I liked the leaner original film this was based upon.  And perhaps the expansion of this version created some of the illogic so ably pointed out in the above cited review.  But call it a guilty pleasure, I went along with this rough ride without any of those valid criticisms bothering my enjoyment of the film.  It moved, it held my interest, and there were some nice nuances in the interplay of the performers that allowed me to suspend disbelief.  Yeah, it ends in an overblown shootout, but I like big shootouts and don't look for logic in them. The resolution had some surprises and the denouement in the cold light of day doesn't make sense, but I'd taken the hook and my enjoyment of the film was not lost by it.

I love the Western genre.  Funny that it is being kept alive often by Aussies and Brits.  No matter.  This may not rank in the pantheon of Classics, but for sheer entertainment, I found its pleasures outweighed its flaws, and it was a worth the ticket.",1190073600,9,1608,4.612676056338028
1594734,1,B00005JPXP,"This is one of the least convincing Westerns I've ever seen and certainly one of the least satisfying.

It's getting decent reviews now but I think a lot of critics will want to adjust their opinions later, or after a second viewing.

It's mostly the fault of the script and direction -- the final reel of the movie is one of the most nonsensical wrap-ups to a major motion picture that I've seen in ages. It's almost like the filmmakers just decided to forget logic and narrative and turn the climax into a shoot-out that defies all sense.

And I realize that not every situation in a movie is supposed to be the product of divine intelligence, but after enough characters do enough stupid things, you start to doubt the movie as a whole. Here are some examples....

DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ PROBLEMS WITH THE PLOT POINTS:

1) You cannot get shot in the belly (as Peter Fonda does early on in the film) and have the slug removed and then keep walking around like nothing happened. Especially not in the dirty, gritty, unsanitary Old West.

2) You cannot shoot a bag full of dynamite 15 feet away and have it explode without exploding you, too. The amount of TNT shown being shot would seriously injured if not killed the shooter.

3) Here's a thought: If you're going to lock yourself in a stagecoach as bait for a gang of desperados ... maybe you ought to think about packing more than just a single six-shooter. A scattergun, perhaps?  Hell, why not two scatterguns? What's to lose?

4) Never give yourself up to a villain who promises to go easy on you. Everybody knows that. Except the sheriff of Contention.

5) If a villain is in the street just below your window, and he's holding up a wad of money and offering it to the townspeople in exchange for them killing you? If you shoot him, the townspeople can take the money for doing nothing and won't want to kill you anymore. Now why wouldn't any sane Western hero realize this? Because then there wouldn't be a big shootout.

6) A villain helping the hero because he *feels sorry for the hero* violates all the rules of most Westerns. It's also lame and unsatisfying.

7) What exactly is Crowe's plan at the end of the movie? To get on the train to validate Bale's efforts and then ... escape?

8) Where was Crowe's horse hanging out at the end during all that noisy shooting, if it wasn't tied to a rail?

9) Wouldn't the guards standing watch over a Western fort notice a gang setting fire to stagecoach if it happened in their backyard? Wouldn't they send some people to do something about it?

10) Who were those men Bale was watching through his spyglass? They couldn't have been Ben Foster and his posse? The time and the chronology don't add up.

11) It's cheating for a writer, who is examing concepts of extreme good and evil, to have a villain only kill characters we have been set up to dislike.

Anyway, that may seem like nitpicking, but trust me you don't want me to go into all the other things I hated about this film. You don't have the time.",1189987200,71,3041,4.440647482014389
1594735,4,B00005JPXP,"It seems there are those folks who like the Western genre and those who don't. Well, I like the genre, and always have. Basically, very little about it changes: good vs evil, little guy triumphs over the bully, character and integrity always matter, and even if the hero doesn't always get the girl he always wins.

""3:10 To Yuma"" has all of that and more. Russell Crowe (as Ben Wade) plays a deliciously evil yet complex villian. One who can draw and quote scripture as easily as he can kill a man for singing an annoying song. When told there has to be some good in him, Crowe's character responds there isn't. However, his character is so engaging, so charismatic that people want to find good in him. He even has the audience disbelieving how bad he can possibly be.

Christian Bale (as Dan Evans) plays a down on his luck rancher who is desperate for the $200 reward money to take Wade to the town of Contention to meet up the 3:10 train to Yuma. Although a good man who tries to be morally upright, Evans has his flaws as well and his own demons to struggle with. Unfortunately, the only other person who seems to be able to zoom in on those is Wade - and he is very willing to take any advantage where it might present itself.

This movie is not just made up of 2 characters and 2 actors, however. The remaining cast is very well put together. Ben Foster who plays Charlie Prince - seemingly self appointed Wade's second in command - shines in his role. He is so fiendish, so evil, so....just so - you wish you had a weapon in the audience to do him in yourself! Peter Fonda plays a role as a Pinkerton agent that is also complex and memorable.

At the end, the build up was the same I've experienced with ""High Noon."" I seriously can't remember the last time I'd felt a sense of anticipation and dread and hope that intense at the end of a Western! The actual was a little odd, but it didn't completely put me off. I might have ended it differently, but the ending provided could have worked, too. I came away with a different feeling as to why Wade acted like he did and it is different from what most people think. But I won't disclose that here!

If you like Westerns, you will really like this one! And if you don't really care for them, try this one. It might just change you mind!",1189987200,4,2294,4.288683602771362

So he volunteers to take a dangerous outlaw (Crowe) on a trip to the train station. Danger follows since Crowe's men led by Ben Foster's character are on their trail.

  Crowe and Bale are great of course but I'm most suprised by Ben Foster's turn here. He's very impressive here as a villian. Sure he was ok as a bad guy in Hostage but his performance here easily puts that one to shame.

  Besides the performances being great, this is just an engaging and gripping western. It can be slow with a lot of talking yet I was entertained neverless. I would've gave it 5 stars ""think of that as 4 1/2 lol"" if I didn't find the end some-what disapointing and not as good as the rest of the movie. Despite that I still have to give this a huge recommendation. It's a really good movie. Tombstone to me is under-rated, so this isn't the best movie since Unforgiven but the best western since Tombstone.",1189987200,2,1030,4.481283422459893
1594737,4,B00005JPXP,"Set in the years immediately following the Civil War, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a rip-snortin', old-fashioned Western whose characterizations and performances compensate for an occasionally muddled plotline and a tendency towards implausibility.

Christian Bale stars as Dan Evans, a struggling rancher who, for a $200 fee, agrees to help escort a cold-blooded killer to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma, Arizona (at that time a territory, not a state).  Russell Crowe is Ben Wade, the gang-leading outlaw whose very name strikes terror in the hearts of the local populace.  Based on the short story by Elmore Leonard ( as well as the 1957 movie derived therefrom), ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a thoughtful Western drama that nicely balances its requisite shootouts and tough-guy posturing with just enough psychological insight to make the whole thing interesting and worthwhile.

The two stars bring a great deal of intelligence and conviction to the roles they`ve been assigned to play.  Bale's reticent stoicism is placed in direct opposition to Crowe's world weary cynicism and outward charm - and the match-up is a good one.  The men they are portraying may have an entirely different view of morality and of what it takes to be a man, but they are still able to establish a genuine, if somewhat shaky, rapport on the common ground of mutual respect and understanding.  The climax of the story may feel a trifle contrived and artificial - we really don't believe that Wade would do what he does at the end - but it isn't enough to spoil the overall effectiveness of the film.

James Mangold (""Cop Land,"" ""Walk the Line"") has directed the movie with sufficient gusto and energy to counteract some of the verbosity of the screenplay.  Fortunately, the dialogue generally avoids platitudes and cliches - although the action itself is frequently confusing and often geographically inconsistent (i.e. characters who don't have horses seem to arrive at destinations almost as quickly as those who do).

In addition to Bale and Crowe, Mangold has elicited excellent performances from Ben Foster as Wade's wiry but creepily bloodthirsty henchman, Charlie; Logan Lerman as Evans' too-big-for-his-britches older son, William; and screen legend Peter Fonda as the hard-bitten bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, who may finally have met his match in the wily Mr. Wade.

On a final sour note, the cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is surprisingly dull, muddy and lifeless, an especial disappointment considering the gorgeous Southwestern landscape with which he was given to work.

All in all, however, a very fine Western.",1189814400,6,2610,5.144208037825059
1594738,5,B00005JPXP,"Wow! Finally a Western made for the adult mind! Thank you Hollywood for a job well-done!

What a delightfully complex film about motivation, relationships and values. It's about a father and a  son on the verge of manhood, and another son with an illness;  a bad guy who has a strong sense of self and truly knows how to lead;  about a society that condones the mass murder of women and children as long as they are Native Americans but not of armed robbers stealing from what was then one of the most powerful corporations on earth - the railroad  industry.

It's also about a society which tolerates racism towards hardworking Chinese laborers building the railroads; and at the same time allows working-class, Caucasian  farmers to be brutally pushed off  their land in order to make the powerful even richer. But the only real ""bad"" guy society is organized against is the one who steals from the rich and powerful! How incredibly convenient and ironic!

This story is also about pride, self-respect, intelligence, courage and even self-confidence. We are also confronted with senseless violence committed by evil men on one hand and the  immediate need for self-defense on the other. What's worth risking your life over? Is the central question 3:10 to Yuma asks.

There's so much going on this amazing film, there's no way to absorb it all the first time around! What a breath of fresh air to watch such a clever story!",1189728000,3,1425,4.775510204081633
1594799,4,B00005JPXP,"Although the western film recently experienced a brief resurgence with Unforgiven, the number of quality ones has been few like Open Range.  With the remake of the 1956 cult western, 3:10 to Yuma, (itself adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard), the genre is primed for another comeback with this tense, well acted film.

Set in the old west not long after the Civil War, a cattle rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), and his family struggle to make a life for themselves as a local businessman threatens to foreclose on his property and make way for a railroad.  His cattle are poached by outlaws led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his lieutenant, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster in a surly, effective performance).  The criminals rob a money wagon (in a scene right out of Heat done western style) and stop at a local town.  Wade is captured by local lawmen and is escorted to catch the Yuma prison train, which is hours away from arriving.  Evans offers to join the group in return for some valuable reward money that will ultimately help his family's plight.  Thus begins a tortuous journey that has potential repercussions for Evans' family and Wade's bid for freedom even as his gang is in pursuit.  Will Evans and his motley crew get Wade to the railroad station in time and who will survive?

Director James Mangold, fresh from his successful biopic, Walk the Line, again elicits strong performances from his two leads, Crowe and Bale.  Crowe is everything we expect him to be, and his role is Oscar worthy.  His outlaw is a cultured, Bible-quoting man who effuses an animal magnetism that is appealing to men and women.  What is so satisfying here is that Bale is equally up to the task and really shines in a difficult, challenging role.  The supporting cast is uniformly sharp with special nod to a grizzled, unrecognizable Peter Fonda as a tough bounty hunter.  Logan Lerman is effective as Evans' older son who is ashamed of and gradually realizes a growing respect for his father.  Luke Wilson has an amusing bit role as a corrupt railroad hand.

The film has a plot similar to the 1950's westerns High Noon and Last Train from Gun Hill, and encompasses elements of the classic western formula, namely the cattleman versus the railroad; only in this case, it is used as a jumping off point to a deeper, more psychological conflict.  This is really a movie about what motivates people to do what they do.  Most of the dialogue involves Wade's hurling insults and quips at a stoic Evans.  We can see that Wade has a respect and growing admiration for Evans' seemingly hopeless quest, and the emerging facts have a strong bearing on what is to come.  We learn about Wade's childhood and about what truly guides Evans' reasons for taking such a risky mission.  His role in the Union Army during the Civil War comes to the fore.  And how did he get his leg maimed?  These shades of background and characterization enrich an already tense and interesting plot.  The memorable ending, which pushes credibility just a tad, truly tests each man's resolve and sense of justice.

Production values are strong with beautiful cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line, The Pursuit of Happyness).  The film moves at a deliberate, methodical pace (editor Michael McCusker) and is never boring. It gets to the conflict fairly quickly and reaches its finale, an agonizing chase across town that is quite exciting and riveting right to the startling end.

Make no mistake, this is a film that western enthusiasts will love while those who appreciate a strong, tense character study will find much to savor.  Although we expect gold performances from Crowe and the ever maturing Bale (hard to believe this was the boy in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun), it is Mangold's prowess in that delicate balance of critically acclaimed, popular filmmaking, that may become a major force in Hollywood for years to come.",1189641600,8,3915,4.794336810730253
1594800,5,B00005JPXP,"Both a coming of age story and a morality play, this Western was filled with action and was fun to watch.  I think it's worth seeing on the big screen, but it's also one that I'd see again.

There were a few things that were improbable and a couple of times where I was thinking ""why don't they just do xyz?"", however for the most part it was a story that flowed well and made sense, even if some of the end results weren't what I was expecting.

I think the relationship between the father and son was the most important part of the flick, although it will probably be the most overlooked.  The coming of age part of the story was also strong, although it certainly wasn't a main theme.

If you like action movies with a strong story and moral questions and quandries running through it, you'll like this.  It doesn't even have to be that it's a Western, much like 16 Blocks with Bruce Willis, this movie is about whether a man will do what's right even if his life is in danger and the odds are against him.",1189641600,4,1009,4.229166666666667

It would be redundant to repeat the many eloquent reviews already written about this movie, even though I do agree with most of them. It seems that just about any movie Russell Crowe stars in will be superb and ""3:10"" is no exception. This is due in part to the excellent supporting cast provided, where each added their own mark and contributed to the success of this movie. In my opinion, most notable was Ben Foster as Charlie Prince. He dominated the scenes that he was in and you found yourself waiting for his next appearance. (Award worthy performance) For me, everything worked for this film: cinematography, ""costume"" selection, score, story, - - - everything and the two hours went by like 20 minutes. Hopefully, the DVD will include extra footage and when it finally is in my collection, it will sit alongside ""Unforgiven"", ""Once Upon a Time in The West"", ""Open Range"", ""Lonesome Dove"", ""The Shootist"", ""The Long Riders"", to name a few.

Ben Foster is his sidekick, or one of the motley crew who ride with him, and he is the epitome of evil, reminding me of Richard Widmark as he plays the arch villain to the hilt.  Peter Fonda plays the part of a detective.  Besides his acting ability, I admire him for how  discriminating he is in the parts he chooses.  Alan Tudyk is excellent as a doctor who finds himself drawn into the action.  The film is about good and evil (so what else is new) and though Russell Crowe is a criminal, he's not as focused on evil as Foster is; he has redeeming qualities.  Christian Bale is supposedly the ""good"" to Russell Crowe's ""evil,"" but this is a thinking person's western, and it is obvious that the ""good"" has elements of ""evil,"" or at least flaws, and vice versa.  Quite a lot of killing takes place in this film, and that is why I rate it four stars instead of the five it really deserves.  It starts out with a robbery that is more like a full scale war and it ends with a war-like confrontation on the streets of a town called Contention.  But Crowe, Fonda, Foster, Tudyk, Bale and the entire cast are such fine actors, and the Western countryside so apropos to the action that I really liked the film.  The main kudos go to Crowe, who gets so amazingly into his characters.  There are two women in it, Bale's wife and a barmaid, both of whom have eyes for Crowe.  Who wouldn't!  I will never get over that scene in ""Gladiator"" when he reveals himself as Maximus.  In this film, there's nothing that dramatic; just a series of good shots of him looking like his character, Ben Wade, a complicated bad man, a thinker and an artist who is sure of himself.  Good to see on the big screen, because of the New Mexican landscape that goes so well with the good/evil theme, and how wonderful to be able to hear dialogue, unlike the DVDs I watch, where for some reason sound doesn't come through properly.  And the dialogue is darn good, with some memorable lines.  The sound track is also quite beautiful, written by Marco Beltrami, who seems to be paying homage a bit to the spaghetti western composer, Ennio Morricone.  Last but not least, I believe Russell Crowe is a natural horseman, and seeing the rapport between him and his horse is appealing.  Well, I guess I'm just an incurable horse opera lover.  If you are, too, see this movie!",1189555200,4,2489,4.426373626373627
1594803,5,B00005JPXP,"Director: James Mangold. Starring: Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, Ben Foster.
Poor, one legged rancher, Dan Evans (Bale), must accompany dangerous criminal, Ben Wade (Crowe), to the 3:10 train to Yuma with a cluster of inept bounty hunters, after discovering Wade robbing a carriage on his land with his gang of violent colleagues. Naturally, a dangerous journey beset with psychological mind games ensues. The movie is extremely entertaining, with a great cast of actors. I thinks the movie works well because of the two lead performers. They both manage to muster appropriate amounts of depth in difficult roles, with Bale expressing an intense air of desperation with ease, while Crowe bounces off his co star as he treads the blurred line of good/bad guy with a rugged charisma.
Ben Foster is on typically over-the-top form as the second-in-command of Crowe's posse, offering another nicely played psycho to his fledging bad guy career.
All in all, I am glad I saw it in the theater--looked good on the big screen.",1189468800,4,1031,5.070588235294117
1594804,4,B00005JPXP,"In 1957 Director Delmer Daves, fresh from helming Glenn Ford in JUBAL (1956), and Richard Widmark in THE LAST WAGON (1956), gave us a minor B&W classic in his version of the Elmore Leonard short story 3:10 TO YUMA. It was a good, but flawed Western, with Glenn Ford doing a suave job playing a charming heavy (not his first), and Van Heflin giving us another shade of his downtrodden homesteader from SHANE (1953). It was filmed a bit under ""A"" status on a modest budget, mostly on the Columbia Ranch, suffered with an illogical ""happy"" ending, and was more a character study than it was an action shoot `em up.

In the spirit of Revision, director James Mangold ( COP LAND (1997), and WALK THE LINE (2005)) remade the 1957 film in a very 2007 style, with a heavy body count, gratuitous nudity, repeated scenes of bullish brutality, extra characters and more plot lines; pushing for a Sergio Leone look, feel, and sound. I think he might have been well served to pay more attention to Kevin Costner's OPEN RANGE (2003), that managed to cast venerable Robert Duvall, both modernize yet revere the genre, and used more realistic sounding blanks in the pistols.

In many ways Mangold used the original film as a story board, even using a lot of the original dialogue. For film buffs they make terrific book ends, each with their own merit. I read where the original casting Mangold was trying for would have had Tom Cruise as outlaw Ben Wade and Eric Bama as rancher Dan Evans. Russell Crowe gave a very nuanced and confident performance as the outlaw leader, Wade, seething yet underplaying, always the con man, charming and charismatic -using the best qualities Glenn Ford found, with a dash of Richard Widmark, giving us a very ""likeable"" antagonist, part villain and part Samaritan, a cold-blooded killer with a twinkle in his eye, who smiled as he put a bullet between your eyes, who was also an artist, a poet, a lover, and a bit of a biblical scholar. Christian Bale, an actor I admire, did not fare so well with his homesteader Evans. Heflin, in the original, gave us a proud dim-witted bohunk, a man so down on his luck that Ben Wade believed he could tempt him with cash; and almost did. Bale seemed a bit lost, hung up on his prosthetic metal leg, unwashed hair, and other ticks that never were quite integrated. He never conveyed real desperation; there was just some missing ingredient. He spoke his back story but did not believe it. Sadly we could see him ""acting"". Spencer Tracy would have spanked him. Ben Foster as Charlie Prince was mercurial, the reincarnation of a young Lee Marvin, bizarre, lethal, almost albino in appearance, perhaps homosexual, a stone killer in skin tight leathers; brandishing his twin Colts like captured bolts of lightning. Richard Jaeckel was wound too tight, coming off as twitchy in the original. Foster reinvented the role and deserves kudos for it.

In both films there was a twist ending, illogical in the original film, and just preposterous in the new one, compounding and deepening the illogic to a painful and frustrating level. But this remade 3:10 is very watch able, full of interesting acting, some touching scenes, and three times the action of the old film. So film buffs and Western lovers flock to this muscular movie, a stylish anomaly, an earnest and vigorous remake of a flawed original.",1189468800,,3351,4.734589041095891
1594805,5,B00005JPXP,"Comparisons and contrasts with the 1957 film version of the Elmore Leonard short story are probably inevitable but I prefer to focus entirely on this film co-starring Christian Bale (as Dan Evans in the Van Heflin role, for those who remember) and Russell Crowe (as Ben Wade in the Glenn Ford role).  Their acting is superb throughout the film and special note should also be made of Ben Foster's brilliant portrayal of Charlie Prince, the evil and violent second-in-command of Wade's gang that, in recent years, has robbed several dozen trains and Butterfield Line stagecoaches that the Pinkerton Company has been paid substantial fees to protect. Also noteworthy are Logan Lerman's portrayal of Evans' older son, William, and Peter Fonda's portrayal of Byron McElroy who seeks personal vengeance for reasons best revealed in the film.

As it begins, Evans, his wife, and two sons are struggling to survive. He has a permanent disability from his service in the Union army during the Civil War and is destitute...and desperate to save his small ranch as well as regain the respect of his sons, especially William's.

Others have their reasons for admiring this film. Here are a few of mine. First, none of the frequent, extensive, and often sudden violence is gratuitous.  For the Wade gang and their Pinkerton adversaries, violence is a career; for most of the other characters, it is a given in their way of life. Whatever the situation, violence is seamlessly integrated within the development of the plot, as are the cinematography and the musical score. I also appreciate the fact that director James Mangold makes no effort to idealize the ""Old West"" by including church socials, ballads sung around a camp fire, buying ""sody pop"" and gingham dresses for adorable children, etc.  He leaves no doubt that the world portrayed in this film is harsh, often brutal, and a challenge to survive that many cannot overcome.

Finally, I admire how Mangold works with this cast to suggest at least some degree of complexity in the character and personalities of the main characters. Ben Wade is a case in point, killing whenever he sees the purpose or is so inclined but he also has impressive knowledge of the Holy Scripture and displays artistic talent; he also has a sharp wit and a playful sense of humor. Over time, Dan Evans proves to be far more thoughtful and sensitive than he first seems. He will kill Wade if he must but prefers to earn his fee for keeping him alive and then getting him on the 3:10 the train. His is a journey of self-discovery while being abandoned by everyone except his son William. He eventually realizes that his leg can never he healed but his self-respect can be restored. As I observed the interaction between Wade and Evans, I recalled other Elmore Leonard characters who also remind us that human beings are never as pure or as evil as they may seem.

More quibbles than complaints, I think that Gretchen Mol (portraying Dan Evans' wife Alice) adds little to the plot's development because the character herself is so under-developed in the few scenes in which she appears. That is not true of comparable spouses in High Noon (Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane) and Shane (Jean Arthur as Marian Starrett). Also, I don't know what to make of Emmy Nelson, a bartending prostitute with whom Wade has a brief reunion. As portrayed by the exceptionally lovely and stylishly dressed Vinessa Shaw, she seems totally out-of-place in such a hellhole western town. In a dramatic film such as this, plausibility of resolution is imperative. In my opinion, the final scenes after the train to Yuma  arrives are facile but not entirely believable. That's all I care to say about them. Let those who have yet to see the film decide for themselves.

Because of the quibbles cited, I do not consider this film a ""classic"" western  (e.g. the aforementioned High Noon and Shane as well as My Darling Clementine, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider, The Stalking Moon, Unforgiven, The Virginian, and The Wild Bunch) but it is certainly well-constructed and consistently engaging. With few exceptions, the acting is crisp and nuanced. I look forward to purchasing the DVD as soon as one is available and seeing it again from time to time, as I now do with several other personal favorites.",1189382400,4,4300,4.854024556616644
1594806,5,B00005JPXP,"The day before seeing 3:10 to Yuma my wife and I saw the 1857 version of the file with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. The one problem with the original film was that as Ben Wade is being taken to Contention there is no action.  One wonders if Wade is so confident that his men will rescue him that he has no desire to escape.  In the new Yuma there are no such dead spot and the story flows much better.  It was interesting to note that some of the dialogue from the original film has been retained in the new one.

Another point between the films is the more realistic depiction of the West in the late 1800s.  The original film, like many Westerns of the period, is too clean.  The gritty existence that ranchers faced in Arizona is not found in the 1957 film.  The town of Bisbee looks like the set from Old Tucson rather than the stark frontier town of the 2007 Yuma.  The performances are very fine with Russell Crowe playing a carefree bandit but inwardly conflicted Ben Wade and Christian Bale as Dan Evans who is trying to prove his courage to his family and himself.  Ben Foster as Charlie Prince was a standout performance.  Charlie is the grim and efficient killed that Ben Wade is not and the icy performance by Foster was magnificent.  Peter Fonda was great as the bounty hunter Byron McElroy, who even though he is on the side of the law is every bit a criminal as Ben Wade.  A nice change in the story was having Evan's older son (nicely played by Logan Lerman) rides out after his father. But the end of the film was a bit of a surprise; in the original Ben Wade and Evans get on the train together and in the new version Evans is gunned down after delivering him to the jail car.  In both films, Ben Wade comes to admire Dan Evans for his bravery and decides to go along with the plan to put him on the train (knowing that he can escape from Yuma prison) however, in the new Yuma Wade proceeds to shoot down each member of his gang.  It is a bit extreme for someone who was counting on his men to free him.

3:10 to Yuma is an excellent film with well-paced action and thought provoking story.  While the film may not revive the popularity if the Western it will probably be the most popular such film since Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.",1189382400,2,2249,4.2564705882352944
1594807,3,B00005JPXP,"James Mangold's re-envisioning of the classic western ""3:10 to Yuma"" is an astonishing success for 2007. While it unquestionably received an update in crisp dialogue, bloody violence and breath-taking action, it does still retain many elements from the original. It is a different brand and a different breed - but then again ""3:10 to Yuma"" was not a conventional Western even upon its initial release in 1957. With plenty of star power, superior acting and a snazzy score, ""3:10 to Yuma"" proves that the Western may not be dead for audiences of 2007.

Life has dealt a bad hand to Dan Evans (Christian Bale), but he makes the most of it as a simple rancher with his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol). When he accidentally witnesses the robbery of a stagecoach at the hands of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) his life becomes unexpectedly intertwined with the calculating criminal. When the law catches up with Wade, Dan is recruited to escort him to the afternoon train which will take the prisoner to Yuma to await his trial. But Wade's malicious gang is out to set their leader free, and Evans must dodge bullets and more if he hopes to catch the train alive.

As a Western, ""3:10 to Yuma"" brings back the familiar blazing sun, barren deserts and sweaty action of ""Spaghetti"" Westerns, but introduces a more stylized, serious and violent tone than what the original offered. More reminiscent of recent takes on Westerns such as ""Unforgiven"" or ""The Proposition"", it utilizes a setting and mise en scne more than anything else, to emulate the Western feel. It is foremost a character study, and since the original premise was so alluring it was a perfect choice to remake. Like Unforgiven, the lines between good and evil tread very closely, and here the villain is so cool and composed that we readily forget he is a criminal.

""3:10 to Yuma"" was an adept choice to reintroduce to audiences since most people who will be watching the film have never seen the original or didn't know this was a remake. This is a film that is so character driven that it thrives on performances; advances in technology won't overly influence its effectiveness, nor will rehashing underlying plots. The original tells an unconventional story that is nearly untranslatable in the expected realism of today without quenching audiences in an explosive, full-color, thrilling, harsher and more vibrant picture. Fans of the original will most certainly be disappointed by the altered conclusion, but everyone else (the vast majority) will be grandly entertained.

The acting is superb, and Crowe snares the spotlight as a wickedly intelligent and sophisticated outlaw. Christian Bale is Crowe's equal onscreen, and they both demand attention. Not often do the bad guys blend with the good guys to the point that we actually root for both of them to succeed. With respect and perhaps admiration, Bale and Crowe appear almost like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with equal parts rivalry and partnership. Ben Foster is outstanding as the maniacally evil Charlie Prince, who demonstrates the despicable qualities most black-and-white villains (such as his counterpart Richard Jaeckel from the 1957 classic) couldn't have hoped to display. And Peter Fonda plays Byron McElroy, a weathered bounty hunter who snags all the coolest lines in the film.

With an impressive score by Marco Beltrami, stunning cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line and Sideways) and the redefining of good and evil amongst heroes and villains, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a sturdy remake despite the shortcomings of adjusting the finale. The updates will resonate with newer audiences, and this stirring action film may successfully revitalize an almost extinct genre in 2007.

1594808,4,B00005JPXP,"3:10 to Yuma

This western staring Russell Crow and Christian Bale is a remake of the 1957 film baring the same name and is also based on the short story by Elmore Leonard. This film is about good and evil plain and simple.  It's about the relationship of a seemingly good man and one that seems rotten to the core.  Bale plays an everyman rancher that has fallen on hard times and has lost the respect of his family.  He is a desperate man that is no longer able to provide for his family.  Crowe who plays an outlaw that is legendary.  Everyone has heard of Ben Wade and fears the things that he has done.  I can see the comparisons to Unforgivin because it's like they took the Mooney (Eastwood) character and split him in two.  In the Unforgivin, Eastwood was battling inner turmoil of good versus evil, here it's manifested by two different characters that find a strange bond and sympathy for the others plight, even if it's unspoken and never addressed. Some great acting on screen, one of the new notable faces is Crowe's right hand man, played by the terrific Ben Foster, who nails his role as a confident and homicidal bandit

A very involved plot that always makes you wonder what direction the movie is going.  The Characters are interesting and muli-layered.  Sometimes you often wondered who the good guy was, if their really was one.  It's a good western and worth seeing on the big screen.  It's not a perfect piece of film making like Unforgiving and defiantly uses the Western stereotype we have seen in Tombstone and others like it, the quick draw showman gun slinger.  The money hungry businessman, everyone has tuberculosis...you know, the normal western stereotypes.  Clich or not this film works and works well.  Mangold is not re inventing the wheel with this piece but it fits in line with a lot of other westerns that follow this formula that are fun to watch and enjoy the performances.  It doesn't hurt this film that it features two of the greatest actors of my generation...oh, and Peter Fonda.",1189296000,,2024,4.624649859943977
