8111099,5,B0009VBTIM,Well made DVD with great basic lessons and not boring but entertaining as well. A must for every drum teacher and student.,1396310400,,122,4.590909090909091
8111100,4,B0009VBTIM,"This is a good step by step beginning drum video.  Harvey Sorgen walks you through some basics before ""letting you play with the band"".  My only complaint is that although the first part is very fundamental, in a good way, when you get to the scene section of playing with the band, it's a quantum leap to be able to successfully do a dance groove or a country groove for 5 to 6 minutes without LOTS more practice back in the rudiments.",1293408000,,436,4.304878048780488
8111101,5,B0009VBTIM,"This is simply the best video out there for the beginning drummer.
Well worth its price and then some. Harvey goes through everything from set up and tuning, to playing along with him and his band.
If you have an interest in learning the drums, buy this DVD. You won't regret it.",1267574400,,279,4.384615384615385
8111102,5,B0009VBTIM,"I  RELLY THINK OF THE VIDO IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE THE TEACHER HAS RELLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING LANUAGE.ALSO I WOULD LIKE IT MUCH BETTER IF YOU WOULD SHOW MORE STICK MOVEMENT A LITTLE SLOWER.THE BEST PART OF THE VIDO IS THE ONE WHEN YOU DID THESTICK SPIN BECAUSE I BEEN TRYING THAT FOUR A LONG TIME. THIS MAY NOT BE A 1,000 WORDS,BUT I REALLY NEED TO LEARN THOSE REALLY GOOD DRUMMING  LESSONS FROM YOU.",1005955200,,395,4.324324324324325
