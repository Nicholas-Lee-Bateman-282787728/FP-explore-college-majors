8715882,5,B00XH2KBCA,"This is the story of "" Park Ji Sang "" who is the son of a vampire , who inherits the abilities and desire for blood that his parents got when they were infected with the vampire virus , which was discovered by their professor on a field trip to Europe. He becomes a doctor and searches for a cure with his best friend and roommate,a genius virologist who was blacklisted for believing in vampires , while hiding the fact that he is a vampire. The heroine is a doctor who discovers his secret and fall in love with him.
If your expecting loads of gore and sex you will be disappointed. Instead what you get is a good story with a different twist on the vampire theme, with our hero taking tablets to control his blood lust so he can perform operations, and drinking blood out of milk cartons. The villain of the piece is the leader of a vampire cult who murdered his parents while trying find out what they had discovered about a cure for the virus so that he can release it into the world and control all the vampires blood lust with pills. The story is about how our heroes defeat the cult and search for a cure, with tragic results(or are there?).
A good story full of drama, great acting from the cast, and a nice bit of directing.
That's what I thought of it. I hope you agree . If not, fair enough.",1453420800,,1303,4.216
8715883,5,B00XH2KBCA,"Being fond of vampire themed movies, this one did not disappoint me. Very well paced story and some really tender moments. Particularly liked the scene where she finally meets the boy who saved her, very poignant.

The actors are very good and you really hate the villains and love the heroes; some sad moments are also present, but will not mention them here so to avoid spoiling it for the future viewers.",1448409600,,407,4.652777777777778
