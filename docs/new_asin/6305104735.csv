963958,3,6305104735,Not a great movie.  An old man can only move so well so no great action fighting scense. Still not bad as a kung fu comedy.,1359072000,,123,3.730769230769231
963959,3,6305104735,"I've seen much better, but in the lines of classic martial arts film, this one is good. The fight scenes are short and a little sloppy to me, but still a nice kung fu watch to kill some time.",1285113600,,191,3.923076923076923
963960,3,6305104735,"OL DIRTY KUNG FU (1979) is the Wu Tang Collections retitled release of MAD, MAD KUNG FU, directed by Chien Yuet San and starring Cliff Lok, Simon Yuen, Chan Lung, and Lee Hoi San. Other reviews here make the mistake of confusing it with the completely different DIRTY KUNG FU (1978), which was directed by Lau Kar Wing and starred Wong Yue as a would-be bounty hunter, with Lau and Norman Chu as co-stars.
This one deals with an aspiring kung fu champ, played by Cliff Lok, who wanders the countryside perfecting his own style of kung fu and helping people in trouble. (Hes also an accomplished noodle maker, which makes for some clever, comical scenes.) Because of his choice of weapon, he gets mistaken for the venerable champion known as Bamboo Stick and is even aided by the real Bamboo Sticks top student (Chan Lung), who is traveling incognito to avoid recognition by enemies of his master. Lee Hoi San plays the local town boss whose no-good son (Cheng Kang Yeh) was mortally wounded after Bamboo Stick had come to the aid of a village girl forced into marriage with the son. Lees desire for revenge soon involves all three protagonists, neither of whom is good enough on his own to defeat Lees ""Iron Head"" technique. Eventually the real Bamboo Stick (Simon Yuen) coaches Cliff and paves the way for a final, grueling battle with the town boss.
The simple plot, which deftly mixes humor and suspense, offers an effective showcase for a series of well-staged fights showcasing the considerable talents of the four lead actors: the underrated Cliff Lok (KUNG FU GENIUS, DUEL OF THE SEVEN TIGERS); veteran Simon Yuen (the original DRUNKEN MASTER), who is frequently doubled by one of his sons (from the famed Yuen Clan); Chan Lung (also in KUNG FU GENIUS), in a rare heroic role; and perennial villain Lee Hoi San (aka Lee Hai Sheng, also in KUNG FU GENIUS). The tape quality of this Wu Tang Collection edition is not what it ought to be (see KUNG FU GENIUS), but it is a tad better than most of the releases in the Wu Tang lineup.",1041292800,3,2035,4.6088154269972454

963964,4,6305104735,"at first it seems like a very poorly choreographed kung fu movie, but once you get into to it, it does improve. filled with humor and action, one of  the better kung fu movie's i've seen. where as bruce lee is very serious  and true action, this is more light hearted with crazier fighting.  recomend!",948585600,4,301,4.4363636363636365

7882752,3,6305104735,"Unless you are a true fan of Shaw Brothers films don't buy this one.

The plot, what small bit of it there is, is hardly interesting. The fight scenes are a little on the boring side and the jokes are so far between that you wonder if the translators were just phoning it in that day. Yes it's not an expensive DVD but there are much better ones you could be spending your money on.",1383350400,,382,4.093333333333334
