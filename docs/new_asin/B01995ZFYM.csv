7565543,5,B01995ZFYM,"Brother's Conflict is an interesting anime where the heroine is surrounded by not only guys, but thirteen of them! And all of them are her step-brother's though that doesn't stop the feeling that are surfacing towards their step-sister.

Along the way of moving into a new household and having family around- problems start to rise and the heroine believes that it's perhaps time for her to move and be on her own once again.

Wanna know more? Than go buy this anime and find out what she does and how the relationships evolve.",1457740800,10,527,4.655913978494624
7565544,5,B01995ZFYM,"Though it can be diabetes-inducing how the main heroine (Ema) lacks a personality of her own, Brothers Conflict is saved by the Asahina brothers, who are all intense, complex and compelling each in their own unique way. The story line is unique, intelligent, and elaborate yet simple. The voice acting is every bit as beautiful as the art direction.

One problem with this anime, though, is that the narrative is flawed; the episodes skip a lot of time too quickly. For instance, despite Ema having moved into the Asahina residence in the first episode, four months have already passed by the time of the fourth episode. However, this doesn't damage the anime too gravely because the moments that are shown are so full of depth and character that they just leave you wanting more.",1482019200,,780,4.82089552238806

7565548,2,B01995ZFYM,"This is a fine release as you would expect from Funimation. Nothing special but the quality is fine and you'll find no issues in that regard.

However, the show itself is less than stellar. The premise arguably could have been interesting, if not a bit skeevy. Yet every chance this show had of being interesting is squandered by the main characters lack of any personality or soul.

She completely lacks any personality and exists solely as a vessel for the horniness of her unbelievably perfect ""brothers"" who somehow all don't have, nor seem to have ever, had a relationship. In fact, every character aside from the oddly placed shota (child) brother acts as if they have never seen a female before.

Conflict is also nonexistent in the series as she willingly accepts the advances of every single boy who comes on to her, only to mildly comment to herself in private that maybe she shouldn't be doing this. Yet evey episode feels the need to open with the line, ""of course we love each other, we're family."" So I guess everything is ok when you have been kissed and forced upon by no less than 8 brothers in less than a year.

The show's animation is lazy, the character designs bland, and if you want to dig deeper, even the source material is handled poorly here. Nothing is pulled from the visual novels save for the base situation. The only brother in the lot with any pathos at all in terms of his backstory is hidden away most of the show, only speaking a handful of lines over the course of three disparet episodes.

There are better harem shows out there, there really are. Despite two genuinely funny ova episodes that close out the series, this show isn't enjoyable even as a show to drink to.",1464480000,5,1707,4.565359477124183

7565550,5,B01995ZFYM,Love this Anime!!!!!  If you like romantic comedy this is your anime!!  It was so good I watched it twice when I got it!!!  Its hilariously funny how one by one they fall for their new step sister!!  I highly recommend that you  this anime!!!!,1461715200,,243,4.311111111111111
7565551,5,B01995ZFYM,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this anime at first, but after watching it, I love it. It's an unusual story, of Ema and her pet Juli after moving into their need home with 13 older stepbrothers. With there being so many characters, I was surprised by how all the brothers had distinct personalities, and how invested I was with all the characters. Both the sub and dub are very well done, in my opinion. I hope Japan makes a season 2, because after 12.5 episodes and 2 OVAs I need more! If you're looking for a new reverse harem to watch, I'd recommend this one.",1459555200,8,568,4.220183486238532
7565552,5,B01995ZFYM,"A very touching and sweet anime about a young girl, ema hinata mostly alone all her life besides her pet squirrel  juli and her father. But her dad marries into a big family and a big family it is 13 boys!!!!! And all want to be ema hinata""s boyfriend...  but does she really need a boyfriend or does ema just needs her family more..... this anime is different then usual protagonist boy and a beavy beautiful girls at his beck and call to rescue him or fight over him it's a girl and her male harem. It is so diffrent from other anime that I really hope they can continue with this story and a second season",1459296000,10,608,4.188034188034188
7565553,5,B01995ZFYM,"Definitely an exciting anime while not being the usual reverse harem you see everyday (although not common the genre is). The English Dub and Sub are both professionally done in this anime with a bountiful cast that humours the anime further.
The characters are definitely unique and interesting in turns of events that play out as our heroine (Ema) develops a more stronger relationship with the 13 step brothers she has.

Is it Love? Or Family that she wants? Or both! That's what the boys have to figure out before their feelings take control of their actions.
Ema is definitely a resilient girl who the viewer can relate too.",1458086400,11,629,4.770642201834862

8744444,3,B01995ZFYM,"I've been trying to expand my anime collection and the anime that I've watched so I've started this thing where I'll buy complete anime series online that look interesting. This way I have no choice but to watch it since I spent the money to buy it. Well Brothers Conflict just happened to be the lucky anime this month.

This anime was decent. I kind of wish that there was more of a storyline in this anime. Brothers Conflict is about a girl whose father is getting married and she is moving into an apartment like building with her 13 new step brothers..... yes 13. All 13 brothers eventually fall in love with her. So this anime definitely suggests incest. There really isn't much else to it. I wish the anime was longer than 13 episodes. They could have done more with this",1491955200,,778,4.440559440559441
