2052513,4,B00020HBWI,This film shows a lifestyle I had never heard about before and it was very informative and moving. The expressions of the people in the vidoe are very genuine and it leads you rto a new level of understanding.,1221436800,4,209,4.384615384615385
2052514,3,B00020HBWI,"As he prepares to explain style, E.B. White writes: ""Who can confidently say what ignites a certain combination of words, causing them to explode in the mind? Who knows why certain notes in music are capable of stirring the listener deeply, though the same notes slightly rearranged are impotent? These are high mysteries.""

It is this mystery which causes this film to fail. There is so much of so much potency here; yet, it rarely ignites. (I think of only the two times the thin, black woman with very funky, dready hair breaks into song. There. . .that works. . .that moves. There is something going on inside her which merits more time, more exploration. That pathos, that struggle, that pain, that courage, that journey was what I was expecting in this film.)

The rest? It's mildly interesting. I'm made mildly curious about the world of drag kingdom as I could be made mildly curious about anything slightly foreign to me. But this way of life is not just slightly foreign to me.

The people? They were also mildly interesting. The entertainers seemed quite ordinary--like clerks with unspectacular lives--quite content within their own orbits and with their own celebrity. One of the entertainers talks about attending, then giving, workshops. . .

. . .There. . .That's it! That is exactly it: that all this--this potent stuff: this agonizing gender confusion, this social ostracism, this devestating loneliness--can become a matter of workshops?

Of course, although this film too often allows, it can't be.",1212969600,2,1518,5.007936507936508
2052515,4,B00020HBWI,"Venus Boyz, a documentary film by Gabriel Baur, is all about the exploration and expression of masculinity by women. These individuals range from women who are primarily heterosexual and simply enjoy the power and entitlement they feel while wearing men's clothing and attitudes to women born as hermaphrodites who have, after years of classification as female have opted to explore their inner leanings towards masculinity and male-ness. This range of viewpoints was a key element of why Venus Boyz is a film worth watching.

Unlike their male drag counterparts (queens), drag kings don't have as may films that celebrate and explore why women sometimes feel the need to dress like men, although there are some. Other than Brandon Teena's story, which remains in the spotlight due to his traumatic death and Hillary Swank's portrayal of him in Boys Don't Cry, the individual tales of these female cross-dressers and trans-sexuals are often unheard. Venuz Boyz gives us a range of these stories and a chance to take a glimpse into the performer's lives both on and off stage. Although their tales are sometimes accompanied by kitschy performances, I felt like it was the less showy parts of the documentary that were really able to communicate to me some of the politics, problems and positives of cross-dressing and of exploring female masculinity.

I wouldn't recommend this documentary to everyone. Certainly, you have to be willing to listen with an open mind about these women's experiences with a gender-biased world, but for those who are interested in exploring how a group of women are working individually to redefine gender, this is a worthwhile film. Even though I had a very open mind going into the film and have a background in similar topics, I had no idea that the range of women who choose to cross dress was so diverse. I was also reassured to hear that many of the ""protagonists"" of the film have been able to find funding and support for their artistic explorations and expressions.

There is a reason that this film has won awards and been featured at major GLBTQ film festivals, and that it is because it offers an insight into a world not found in other films. And, if you have ever wondered about your own female masculinity, this film will likely offer you comfort and familiarity.",1201910400,4,2307,4.910256410256411
2052516,5,B00020HBWI,"The reviewer Jeffrey is a man and says that the camera moved jerkily, the movie was too slow, and some things are not explained. I am a butch woman and I loved the movie. I identified with the characters and was incredibly inspired by the characters, their performances, their ability. If genderqueer things are your things, if you are a butch woman who wants to see some butch women positively represented (for once) on the screen, then this movie is for you! You may be inspired to dream, expand your goals, and feel more confident about your potential (and the potential of other genderqueers) to achieve those goals. If you don't want to watch a movie on these issues tonight, rent something else.",1126742400,15,701,4.7073170731707314
2052517,2,B00020HBWI,"Not only is the drag king movement thriving, but it's being documented in various media.  This documentary shows Judith Halberstam, author of ""Female Masculinity"" and Del Grace Volcano, photographer of ""The Drag King Book.""  Here several drag king performers and butch women are interviewed.  This film makes no division between kings, transsexuals, or butches.

Consistently, those interviewed say they want to blend genders or do away with the concept:  they don't just want to experience ""the other side.""  Many perform with drag queens or do avant-garde work with gay men.  One transsexual referred to her body parts by both male and female terms.

There are a ton of foreign drag kings in this work.  Does that mean Europe is a more accepting place or more condemning and thus  kings have to fight harder over there?  Does that mean American women don't have much to say about the movement?  Does that mean the movement is really global?  None of this gets answered.

This film moves slow.  The camera has many jerky movements and the view is often blurred.  Many may think of this documentary as a female version of ""Paris Is Burning.""  However, PIB was funnier and moved faster.  This just plodded along.  I'm guessing the makers here lacked the funds and time that Jenny Livingstone had.

The title is never explained.  They show some kings doing an excellent imitation of the Backstreet Boys, yet they only show it for a second.  In the academic Drag King anthology, it is stressed that the movement isn't in just big cities like New York or London.  However, in this documentary, only the big city shows and performers are brought up.

I'm happy that someone made this work.  It just wasn't that great.",1094428800,11,1712,4.840830449826989

2052528,3,B00020HBWI,"Didn't know what to expect.  But it is only fair to have exposure given to the women as it is given to the men.  This was my first experience watching females cross-dressing and living as males.  I think everyone's personal sense of identity is equally important and I am glad a voice has been given to these females.  I love watching RuPaul's DragRace.  I have learned so much about these men who, for whatever reason (individually unique) enjoy cross-dressing as females, whether as performers or as their life choice.  Hopefully, with more exposure, the general public will eventually come to the realization that, whether male or female, basically each of us is a person, an individual who has to make choices to live the best way we can.  Three stars are for the fact that I think the technical aspect of the film could have been done much better.  I applaud the individuals who participated for their bravery and self-confidence.....keep up the good work/",1426118400,,961,4.817073170731708

2052535,4,B00020HBWI,"Can these ladies be saved, I say they can.

The question is do they want to be saved?

God is a loving God and His arms are open to all who will receive Him.

In my book ""Don't Say a Word About This! Exposing and Confronting Sexual Perversion"" I discuss whether or not certain persons can be saved.

It is so unfortunate that some people are so judgmental to other people.

I have seen many movies and think that everyone who wants to expand their understanding of the world should view this movie.

8019556,5,B00020HBWI,Beyond the drag. I liked how it went into the personal lives of the queens. Lets you know that there is more out there than male and female.  I went to some drag shows. I went in drag.to one show but not how these kings did it. I also did it one Halloween. I had some favorites in this film. Much respect. I might just watch again...and maybe drag again.,1520121600,,354,4.057142857142857
8019557,1,B00020HBWI,"Bleh- I'm always amazed when I see Drag QUEENS they seem to be doing drag because they're honoring women and want to be like them, but when I see Drag Kings they're doing it to make fun of men and rely too heavily on male stereotypes. That being said I was only captivated by a few subjects in this documentary the rest seemed superficial. The technical aspect of this film was shot pretty poorly. It was shot in 2001 before the age of HD cameras and was very difficult to watch.",1461715200,,479,4.274725274725275
