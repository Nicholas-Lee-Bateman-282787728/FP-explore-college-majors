8755687,2,B01DEB9XM2,"This review is for the US remake of the Chilean film.

Dad (Michael Biehn) deals drugs, mom is dead. Dad sire son from oldest daughter Ana (Jeannine Kaspar) who they keep locked up, but seems normal. Anny (Electra Avellan) is the younger daughter and excuse me if I have them confused. Dad winds up in prison and the girls hide out in a shack, used by their dad. They actually don't make it to any woods until there is 16 minutes left in the film and it doesn't last long. Uncle Costello (William Forsythe) sends his goons to find the girls and the drugs.

This felt like an abduction film. They didn't build the girl's character enough to make you feel for them, as if  Director Patricio Valladares was simply using them like the Johns in the film. Some good performances, but the plot seemed weak.

Guide: F-word, rape, sex, brief nudity?
