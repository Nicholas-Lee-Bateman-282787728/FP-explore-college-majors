3760512,5,B001PSVHNK,"Excellent.  A must have for musical theatre buffs.  First saw it on PBS and loved it, although the Phoenix PBS HD Channel 8 sound seems to have odd buzzes and drop outs via the usually reliable DirecTV.  Anyway, having the DVD solves the sound problem.  Fascinating look at a true genius of the golden age of musicals.  I have watched it 3 times in a month.",1239840000,3,357,4.348484848484849

This DVD is a must have for dance lovers.",1235001600,16,278,4.326923076923077

8334525,5,B001PSVHNK,"Wonderfully done as biography and dance history.  I doubt any one DVD could encompass all of Robbins' work as ballet choreographer, Broadway choreographer and director, and theatrical innovator.
