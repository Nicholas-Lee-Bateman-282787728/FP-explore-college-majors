8483724,3,B005QROJL8,"Normally I do not care for the spaghetti western, but I thought this was worth a look.  Strictly a B flick.  Standard plot - Bank robbery and murder while Sheriff Pat Garrett is at the church getting married and he has to leave his bride to track down the Clantons.  I got it because Rod Cameron was in it and he had good success in B westerns in the late 40's and 50's.  His storylines in those were generally better than average.  Also he had a couple of good cop shows on TV then.  He played a really likeable Pat Garrett sheriff to perk a standard movie up.  Worth a peek.",1420502400,,576,4.135135135135135
8483725,2,B005QROJL8,Rod Cameron was a fine cowboy actor in the 1940s and in the 1950s turned to television. This spaghetti Western from mid-1960s is fairly pathetic movie.,1346889600,2,151,4.846153846153846
