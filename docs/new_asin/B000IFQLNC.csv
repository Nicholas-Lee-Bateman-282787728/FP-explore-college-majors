8145279,5,B000IFQLNC,My granddaughter was very happy to get this and watches it all the time. This movie fits perfectly in her collection and I would say it is very good for all ages.,1309996800,,162,4.09375
8145280,5,B000IFQLNC,It's so fun and I love the music so this is a must for any Bratz fan!,1248998400,,69,3.1176470588235294
8145281,4,B000IFQLNC,Disney has gone thru some Interact games for the TV with sucess. Why not Bratz. There are limitation because of few buttons to press. But it easy enough for a young girl to play. Best on the portable on those long road trips. All the Braztz are here and if your girls into this. This something for their collection.,1178496000,,315,4.3559322033898304
8145282,5,B000IFQLNC,Phenomenal!  Excellent!  My daughter loved it and she is a tough one to please.  This movie is one of the few that lets the viewer (your child) pick which next step the Bratz should take.  This is a lovely interactive DVD that allows time for more than just fashion and makeup.,1178409600,2,277,4.372549019607843
8145283,5,B000IFQLNC,"I was distressed to see that some other Amazon poster gave a ""1-star"" review to this item because it had been delayed from it's original street date to Feb. 6th.  That's certainly no reason to criticize the program, which is actually a wonderful DVD experience.  My niece (and several of her tweenie girlfriends) played with this for over five hours last weekend, trying out every aspect of the ""interactive"" mode to come up with different results.  It's truly a great value for the money, and extremely well produced!  Check it out!!",1176076800,3,534,4.835164835164835
