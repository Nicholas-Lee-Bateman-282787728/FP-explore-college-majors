8493837,4,B0066B54DK,"Susanna(1968) is one of Li Ching's best films. It's dated and it looks and feels likes a 1960's movie, but its entertainment value is still there. Rosamund Kwan's father played Li Ching's stepfather in the film. Li Ching was cast as Susanna, a bratty, self centered school girl. When she finds out that she's dying of cancer, she struggles to clean up her act. It's not going to be easy. Countless soap operas feature a subplot where someone is dying from cancer. The plot for Susanna is very harrowing. Her character is running out of time! Some people might label this film ""too Chinese"".
Li Ching was pure eye candy in the 1960's. My world has been a better place since seeing her in Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968). Li Ching left the Hong Kong film industry in the mid-1980's after her popularity fizzled away. Musician Michael Lai claims that they're friends. Susanna is a gem from the 1960's.",1520726400,,891,4.681528662420382
