2241634,4,B0007TKG30,"Brought back memories of a simpler era. Refreshing to watch, I loved Fury as a child It was because of him that I am still addicted to horses! I know of many women my age who still have this affliction.

Fury was my absolute favorite program as a child, and it is very 50's in

black and white. So I was very excited to find it on Amazon.

Despite being rather dated it bought back so many memories, and I loved watching it again, and catching up with my favorite horse! I recommend it to all who love horses, and westerns, the goody beating the baddy and love a bit of nostalgia.",1181260800,5,442,4.116279069767442
2241638,5,B0007TKG30,"I have been wanting to get copies of the 1950s FURY TV show for years and now I finally have it.  The quality of the DVD is good; it looks the same as I remember from the TV series.  The show would most likely be too ""old-fashioned"" to be enjoyed by today's children--especially those over 10 years of age, but we baby boomers LOVE the old-time TV shows.  I highly recommend this DVD, containing 4 of the early episodes of the FURY TV show, including the pilot episode, to anyone who remembers the FURY TV series, as these will most likely be the ONLY episodes of this show ever available to the general public.",1174521600,4,611,4.342105263157895
2241639,5,B0007TKG30,"Love this DVD. I very fondly remember the ""Fury"" series. I, like many other children of the 50's so wanted a horse of my own.

2241640,3,B0007TKG30,I bought this for my dad who watched the series as a child. He really enjoyed the clean and wholesome family show. It reminded me of the typical TV show of the era. It was predictable yet still entertaining. It reminded me of Lassie with a horse. My dad loved it and it was nice to have something good and clean for the kids.,1168300800,13,325,4.09375

2241642,3,B0007TKG30,"For those of us who long for the DVD Collector's Series of ""Fury"" (the story of a horse and the boy who loved him), this set will have to do for now.

All four episodes in this set are from the earliest shows of the series and the good news is that the pilot episode is up first (the other episodes are 'the Stranger who claims to be Joey's real Father', 'the rabid dog bite' episode and 'the white mare and Joey's jealousy').

The artwork is true to the series with the familiar shot of Bobby Diamond posing with ""Fury"" (from a later season of the show) and this is a sweet little collectible.

Unfortunately, this set appears to be an old video of an old film transferred to DVD.  Fortunately, for fans of the show, the quality is not unlike the television quality a child sitting down to watch reruns of ""Fury"" in the 1960's would have seen.

I saw ""Fury"" reruns in the late 1960's and the early 1970's on KTVI-TV, Channel 2, in St. Louis, Missouri at 7:15 a.m. weekdays where it ran for many years after ""The Lone Ranger"" at 6:45 a.m.

This series originally ran five seasons on NBC (1955-60) and was so hugely popular it ran another six years in reruns on NBC followed by years of syndicated reruns before it disappeared along with most other black-and-white rerun series during American television's strange 1970's obsession with all-color programming.

Bobby Diamond grounded the show with his infectious love for ""Fury"" and was an apparently gracious actor who worked well with potential show rival kid characters ""Pee Wee"" and later ""Packy"" who no doubt came in as the series progressed to give very young viewers someone to relate to as ""Joey"" aged into adolescence.

The cast was uniformly excellent and the writing fun and always enjoyable.

The episode ""The Tornado"" (not on this set) is downright exciting and the same is true of many of the series highlights.

Unlike many TV shows for kids, ""Fury"" always seemed to avoid the traps of oddball camp, excessive sentiment, cartoon violence and, most important, avoided boring stories throughout the run.

""Fury"" extolled masculine pursuits and male role models.

""Fury"" himself was certainly symbolic of Joey's inner healthy pride and strength as both ""Fury"" and Joey made a journey from lost orphans to positions of strength and happiness.

With the coming of DVD series collections, we can hope that ""Fury"" will one day be available on an extensive collection on DVD (it will no doubt be a great hit).

The series grew up and developed through the run and if anyone could see all of the episodes in succession, ""Fury"" would be assured legions of new fans.

""Fury"" could and should be remembered as one of the best and brightest American Television shows ever produced for children (and adults).",1117756800,123,2758,4.728601252609604
2241643,4,B0007TKG30,"First of all, ""hats off"" to Alpha Video for bringing this series to DVD.  For most of us ""baby boomers"" who fondly remember ""Fury"", this is like finding buried treasure.  I can only hope that the rest of the episodes will eventually be released.  The video transfer is good, considering this series will mark it's 50th anniversary in October (2005).  There is a video ""glitch"" in the second episode and some lines in the fourth episode, but this could be an age factor, however it's acceptable.  Veteran actor, Denver Pyle (""Dukes Of Hazzard""), appears in the second episode. In the fourth episode, Ken Osmond, (two years before he made Eddie Haskell a household name), makes one of his first appearances in front of the camera.  For the price and memories..it's a winner!..and you won't have to go through the trauma of looking at an old TV test pattern before it comes on,... like some of us did so long ago on Saturday mornings.",1115856000,47,931,4.680981595092025

we could go a-hunting if that sounds good to you
maybe we'll go fishing or just lie back and dream
if we go high enough we'll jump in, and swim right down the stream

If it should rain and thunder we'll hide out in the caves
and then pretend we're surrounded by 1000 Indian braves
but if it's nice and sunny there's lots to do and see
and Mom won't worry at all today, 'cause she'll know you're with me.

(I felt a mare was safer than a stallion as Fury was) I got my horse when she was 22 months old. Broke her and trained her myself. She was very much like Fury as I was the only person who could ride her. My children tried many times, and many times they were thrown to the ground, then my mare would look a them as if to say, you best not get back on....I would recommend this movie to anyone who trylu loves horses.",1355961600,,569,4.04424778761062

2241704,5,B0007TKG30,"""Fury"" and the first four seasons from ""Lassie"" with Jeff belong to my best childhood memories.
I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,,937,5.124183006535947

The quality of picture and sound is great and, if you can read German, the notes are also a big plus. I don't know why everyone doesn't purchase a region free player and order world wide! It's easy and the players cost no more than restrictive players. Just scroll down under ""Electronics"" to region free DVD player and the world of entertainment is yours. Many hard-to-find items  available, or available at much lower prices can be had from UK(check out the BBC discounts from England!) and Germany.

2241719,3,B0007TKG30,"I loved this show when I was growing up in the 1950s.  New shows were being made by the time I started school and the program continued into production by 1960.  After being out of circulation for so many years, I was happy to see a number of episodes in excellent condition posted on YouTube.  This prompted me to seek out FURY in DVD.  While this set contains some of the episodes I'd found on the Internet, not all of them are included.
And while the quality of the transfers on this set are acceptable, they are not as good as they could be.  The transfers appear to be from several sources, some with watermarks that indicate that they were lifted from other sources, some with ""Fury"" in the lower right hand corner.  Others have some minor video dropouts and tape weave indicating that they are not recent film transfers.  The sound is also a bit hissy, particularly in the opening, which seems to have been edited onto the heads of each episode.

I was rather happy to see these episodes again, but was expecting more than the first season and of slightly better quality.  While it is certainly ""acceptable,""  these episodes do exist in more pristine condition.  I only wish that they could have been presented here.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fury-Vol-2/dp/B00102F5WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fury Vol. 2</a>",1273708800,2,1360,5.053811659192825
