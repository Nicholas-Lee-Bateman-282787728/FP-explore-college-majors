8688481,3,B00PKQLXD2,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, Combat Zone Wrestling, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

P.W.G. Champion Kyle O'Reilly faced off against the man who had been targeting him for the past shows in Roderick Strong in what was an aggressive match that had brawling on the outside along with each man heavily physically working over a specific body part of their opponent throughout the entire match.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutiest Tag Team (Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae) faced off against Johnny Gargano & Chuck Taylor in what had to be the most awkward match in P.W.G. history as it was revealed on social media about the relationship status between Candice & Gargano coming into this match only for them to have a high series of exchanges between each other including one locking the other in their own submission hold as both teams traded momentum throughout the contest along with each team making the same mistakes against each other.  Uhaa Nation made his debut against Brian Cage in what was called ""the biggest match in P.W.G. history"" which is true from a physical stand point if you just look at these two men side by side that started with a test of strength & getting right up from the other's physical but continued on with each man showing a high amount of agility & athleticism that men their size usually don't show with moves you see from crusierweights as they were evenly matched from start to finish.  Biff Busick faced off against his former training partner in Tomasso Chiampa that was the hard hitting match expected from both men that saw chairs launched at their opponent in mid-air along with impactful offense on the mat & off the top rope that got stiff at times with each man being dropped on the top of their heads & clotheslined inside out along with famous MMA star Rhonda Rousey get involved in the action at ringside.  Other matches include A.C.H. & A.R. Fox vs. Young Bucks in a match that saw both teams go high risk various times along with the Bucks getting a taste of their own medicine before the match, Adam Cole vs. Trevor Lee in a back & forth match that had it's comedic moments like one man channeling the energy of a wrestling pimp, and Cedric Alexander vs. Bobby Fish.

Normally I always say you can't miss with a P.W.G. show but this was their weakest show since World's Finest back in March 2012 almost 2 years ago as the show was still good wrestling wise but it wasn't up to par with the previous shows along with the fact that this was only 2 hours long when others have gone close to or over 3 hours.  If your a fan of the participants in the standout matches I mentioned on here then I would get this but otherwise it's an event I would pick up down the line but not go out of my way to get.",1418169600,2,3023,4.587037037037037
