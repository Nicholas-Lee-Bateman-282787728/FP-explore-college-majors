4214235,4,B003WOUP2O,"If a movie ever cried out for a remake, it has to be SON OF THE MASK because that movie was so bloody awful a remake could only improve it. So, of course, instead what we get is a remake of a boyhood classic that didn't need remaking. But here comes the 180 swerve. I saw this new KARATE KID flick in the theater, and maybe it's because I saw it with an audience that surprisingly cheered and applauded quite a bit, but I came out actually liking it. Oh, there are still quibbles. But now my feathers aren't quite so ruffled.

What's the shelf life on that joke that this one should've been titled THE KUNG FU KID? There's this age-old rule of thumb (that I just made up) that if you were a foreign kid newly arrived to China, and a stranger to the local language, and then if your Chinese classmates bully you, chances are you'll simply have to take the beatings. Because wrestling these guys to the ground and retaliating with meaningful noogies ain't gonna cut it. Everyone in China knows kung fu, says the rumor. And if you're a 12-year-old American kid recently relocated from Detroit, you probably shouldn't have been macking on the head bully's girl anyway.

From his first day in Beijing onwards, it's been a sackful of unhappy for young Dre Parker. He right away gets on the bad side of Cheng, the local school toughie and, by the way, formidably adept at martial arts. Cheng seems to really relish pounding on Dre, who puts up a front but, really, he's defenseless. Cheng's venom serves to build the tension and also make Dre a sympathetic character. And then Dre gets an unlikely assist from his apartment building's withdrawn maintenance man, Mr. Han. If you've seen the original then you know where this is going. Mr. Han tells Dre, ""I will teach you real kung fu."" He then proceeds to instruct Dre to take his jacket on and off and on and off and on and off. Part of it is teaching Dre respect. Part of it, of course, is Mr. Han instilling rudimentary skills within his pupil. You get your usual montage bits as Mr. Han prepares Dre for the upcoming kung fu tournament, where Cheng awaits.

Jaden Smith has got his old man's swagger down pat. And he's pretty expressive in those dramatic moments. And unlike Ralph Macchio he actually is the age he's portraying. Macchio was in his 20s playing a high school kid. I doubt that Jaden performs the more dazzling martial arts moves his character unveils late in the film, but even the stuff leading up to it demonstrates how hard the kid worked. One of my favorite moments with Jaden actually takes place outside of kung fu. It's a scene in which he makes a lengthy apology in Chinese. Good stuff, and tough to learn. I wish the film had shown even more scenes in which the Parkers were adapting culturally.

Meantime, I can't honestly say that Jackie Chan's performance equaled that of Pat Morita's in terms of charisma and gravitas. What we do see is a Jackie Chan that's far removed from his usual comical mugging. As Mr. Han, Jackie affects this reclusive demeanor and a weary bandy-legged gait, and in our normal world, this shambling figure would be the last person we'd attribute with profound martial arts skills... except that, of course, by now we're so used to kung fu movie cliches that, actually, this old guy IS someone we'd suspect of being a master. Here, Jackie is very effective when he's just this still presence. The car scene (you'll know which one) may be just a bit smaltsy, though. That bit with Mr. Han rebuilding a car in his living room may or may not feel contrived. Still, Chan and Smith make their surrogate father-son thing work.

This isn't a short movie. Heaps of the running time seem devoted to touristy shots of Beijing and other sundry famous landscapes, and the cinematography deftly captures the stunning vistas. Predictably, plenty of themes from the original film crop up. On a down note, we get the hokey cruel martial arts master. We even get deja vus on the crane position and the ""sweep the leg"" moment. But the fight choreography is really dynamic, especially during the kung fu tournament. And that's one of my quibbles, that this western kid with no former experience could so shortly achieve such a prodigious level, especially for someone whose sole skill in the kung fu department going into his training was that he was athletic. But I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes in. Sadly, but maybe for the best - because the sense here is that this is more Jaden's movie - Jackie Chan only gets one scene to strut his stuff, which is early on when he fends off the gang of bullies beating up on Dre.

If you linger during the closing credits, you won't get Jackie's traditional blooper/stunt reel, but you can hear that song ""Never Say Never"" where Jaden Smith is the featured rapper. Little guy really is following his father's footsteps. But, just like that this movie doesn't quite top the original, the kid isn't quite up there with the likes of the Fresh Prince. But give him time. He's only twelve.",1276300800,,5027,4.58
4214236,4,B003WOUP2O,"""The Karate Kid"" is very much a worthy counterpart to the 1984 film on which it's based, not only in terms of story, but also in terms of quality; the excitement, humor, warmth, and themes of friendship, maturity, and overcoming adversity have been left intact, and better still, there's no sense that any of it has been cheapened or simplified to the sake of appealing to a mass audience. The only exception, and I'm really just nitpicking here, is a glorious but contrived aerial shot of martial arts training directly on the Great Wall of China, the helicopter camera zooming around Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith as they pose dramatically. If there was ever an image that belonged in a Chinese tourism commercial, this would be it.

A more substantial criticism is that, because this is such a faithful remake, there isn't much it can do to surprise us. Anyone familiar with the 1984 film will know exactly how this new version will play out, from the main character's awkward arrival at the start to the climactic tournament at the end. There is a bit of an inconsistency; because it takes place in China, the featured martial art is kung fu, not karate, so the title is technically inaccurate. There's also the convenience of all the important characters being able to speak English, if not fluently, then just enough to get their point across. But it's all done so well that we may find ourselves suppressing the desire to look for flaws and make comparisons. What would be the point? Remake or not, this movie stands entirely on its own as a great entertainment, not just as a sports drama and a spectacle but also as a coming-of-age story, which is just as charming and insightful as it was twenty-six years ago.

Smith plays twelve-year-old Dre Parker, who's forced to move from Detroit to Beijing with his mother (Taraji P. Henson). He doesn't much care for it, although he does immediately develop a crush on a good-natured girl named Mei Ying (Han Wenwen), a violin prodigy. Unfortunately, this introduces him to the sadistic school bully, Cheng (Wang Zhenwei), who quickly and brutally takes him down in full view of the other kids. How did he become so aggressive? A visit to a local kung fu class explains everything: Cheng's teacher, Master Li (Rongguang Yu), has taught him to be merciless when fighting his enemies. Mercy, he says, is for the weak. Dre, both small-statured and a foreigner, is considered a weakling. The idea that the underdog is separated by culture as well as by status is something the original film never had the chance to explore. It's a welcome addition.

So is Jackie Chan, who takes the reins from the late Pat Morita and transforms Mr. Miyagi into Mr. Han, a reclusive janitor who agrees to train Dre for an upcoming kung fu tournament. After his disastrous starring role in ""The Spy Next Door,"" I had my doubts that Chan would be able to pull this off. I was happily proven wrong; this is his most mature and compelling performance to date, having been given the opportunity to genuinely act and not merely be a goofy action star. We see range. We see depth. We can conceivably feel something for his character. And for once, the kung fu moves he built his reputation on are actually in service of the story. He's not a stuntman showing off - he's a wise elder trying to make a point, and just like with Pat Morita's character, it involves a menial task that must be done repeatedly, almost to the point of a compulsion.

Some may object to the puppy love between Dre and Mei Ying, paling in comparison to the original film's teenage love between Ralph Macchio and Elisabeth Shue. While I agree that there's no such thing as romance before puberty, I am aware that those tween years see the emergence of hormones, and I can certainly believe that Dre and Mei Ying would have their first kiss by the light of a rear-screen projector. There's no sense believing that they're falling in love, because they're not. If anything, they form a sweet and innocent friendship, one made stronger by the fact that both are being tested by their own life circumstances. And much like the divide between Dre and Cheng, both are threatened by cultural differences, Mei Ying's parents fearful that a musically uninspired American boy will be a bad influence on her. Like all good boys, he just wants make a fine first impression.

A stretch in the middle of the film reveals views of mist-shrouded mountains and tours of ancient temples, where kung fu students practice rigorously. This is perhaps a bit conventional, but it's also undeniably breathtaking. I'm addressing that last observation to those who can't bring themselves to see this movie for its story or its characters - maybe the visuals will win them over. Still, don't be so quick to dismiss everything else it has to offer. Yes, ""The Karate Kid"" is yet another Hollywood remake, but that doesn't change the fact that it tells an engaging story with interesting characters and features good performances. I greatly enjoyed this movie, and if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will too.",1276214400,127,5088,4.712359550561798
4214237,4,B003WOUP2O,"I saw this movie at a screening last night in Los Angeles and I have to say I enjoyed the movie even more than the original.  So why four stars?  Because the movie which counted amongst its producers mum and dad Will and Jada Smith had about ten minutes to much of vanity shots of their son Jaden.  It needed to adhere to the less is more rule and remember that every frame in a movie must move the story forward. That ten minutes would have been better used by fleshing out the character of the mother who was somewhat of a cardboard character or the token white boy in the cast.

Jaden has inherited his parents work ethic and all of that is visible on the screen.  He does a spectacular job and the camera likes him.  Jackie Chan does a good job in the wise old man role although it's funny that as with most actors he equates a crying scene with good acting. The director does a good job and keeps the story moving.  The first kiss scene is especially well done as is the grand finale showdown.  His commercial directing experience coupled with his being a native of Norway serves him admirably in capturing the full grandeur of the breathtaking scenery in the movie.  It is obvious from the film that the cast and crew had unprecedented access to some of China's treasured historical sites. His inexperience as a director showing through in Jackie Chan's car scene and in the scenes with the mother where we need to see the characters breathe a little more.  All in all a fine night at the movies and a worthy addition to a kids film library if they are aged nine and above.",1276214400,2,1579,4.340136054421769
4214238,1,B003WOUP2O,"Please stop making unnecessary BAD remakes, Hollywood. It's an insult to fans of the original film(s) that this movie was even made. Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan have absolutely NONE of the chemistry or likability that Macchio and Morita had in the 1984 original (and VASTLY superior) version of ""The Karate Kid"" and it's sequels. It's obvious this was made just to jump start Jaden's acting career but it will ultimately prove to be a bad move on his part.

You see, he was chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool, shooting some b-ball out side of school, when a couple of guys (who were up to no good) started making trouble in the neighborhood. He got in 1 little fight and his mom got scared! And said ""You're going to learn kung fu from the maintenance man downstairs"" (I did not come up with this)",1484611200,2,513,4.298969072164948

ON A SIDE NOTE: I am probably being picky here having studied karate myself for several years, but it still was weird seeing a movie CALLED ""Karate Kid,"" but the kid in question does NOT learn *karate* specifically... It was a different martial art. Not all martial arts are karate.",1482883200,,463,4.578313253012048

This story is a black kid in China, a little odd scenario but it made for a pretty good story, your kids will probably like it better than you will, they probably know who Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan more than they know who Ralph Macchio and Noriyuki Morita is. I still prefer the classic. My son wanted to see this one, I was resistant, I didn't want to see Karate kid destoryed by a remake, on its own it is a good family film. As a remake, nothing is ever as good as the original. I grew up with Ralph and Pat, this new movie, Jaden and Jackie did a good job for their film. I am impressed.

There were a ton of scenes that nearly mirrored the original in this. I like Jackie Chan as an actor and he did a good job as ""Mr. Miyagi"" but the original was still the best. I felt that the relationship between Mr Miyagi and Daniel was much more believable and felt more real. I also have to agree with a few of the reviewers here that some parts of this felt over acted. Overall though, it stays true to the philosophy lessons taught by martial arts (discipline, inner strength, focus) and that the intentions of the ""user"" are what make the fighter. It also is of course a feel good film where good triumphs evil and focus on your goals make all of the difference. So overall, it's worth the watch if you're a fan of the series.
