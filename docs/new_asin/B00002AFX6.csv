1251390,5,B00002AFX6,"Scrolling through the offerings on Saturday AM cable,discovered this gem. Watched because noticed Charles Dutton's name in credits. Didn't see entire film,but will when it is on again. What a powerful film,well-acted and directed. Made me outraged at the injustice given the young man,and shabby treatment his uncle received in Court (Remember who you are! by the Judge).Why the thugs who beat on two young men in the park,disgracing their murder victim,reminiscent of Lynch-mania,and no effort to solve his murder,but go all out after Charles,Jr killing a drunken cracker?Highly recommend this film if you're a fan of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Miss Harper Lee and the movie.",1336176000,3,674,5.25

1251392,5,B00002AFX6,"Yesterday while flipping channels I came upon Blind Faith.  My good fortune.  What a powerful look at race and racism in the 1950's, family dynamics, sexuality and the phobias attached.  Charles Dutton, Coutney Vance, Vonetta McGee, Kadeem Hardison( i probably botched the spelling) and all the actors associated with this venture provided strong believable characters.  Having been a child of the 50's this film brought back memories of what it was like.  Not all good memories.  I wanted to shout about this movie with others and found out that neither Blockbuster nor Netfliz has this movie in stock.  Why????? If you have the chance to see Blind Faith you will not be disapointed.  This is a must see for those of us who do remember and those who must remember when!!",1325808000,,771,4.8320610687022905
1251393,5,B00002AFX6,"Excellant Movie that needs to be on DVD format
Got the opportunity to see this on Showtime by accident. A keeper that I would love to have on DVD.
Just tried to queue on Blockbuster, of course no success....as it is probably only in vhs format.
Don't miss the opportunity to view this....",1317600000,,288,4.452830188679245
1251394,4,B00002AFX6,"I never heard of this movie. Didn't know that it even existed until today. I was flipping looking for a picture to watch, and this came up and it was something. I could tell from the get go that something was definitely amiss in this case. I felt that perhaps something wrong something else was being covered up here. I couldn't understand it, but you couldn't 'help but feel the tension. The actors, Courtney B.Vance, Charles S.Dutton, Kadeem Hardison as the three brothers who were in deep conflict with each other was great. Lonetta McKee and supporting cast gave it their all and sadly what is a good movie just don't have much press and should be shown.",1313884800,4,658,4.584745762711864
1251395,5,B00002AFX6,"**Excellent movie, great reviews, and a great cast and plot. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks to understand the complexities that exist between people of color communities and sexuality. This films illuminates the intersection of race, class, sexuality, misogyny.",1256515200,6,273,5.682926829268292
1251396,5,B00002AFX6,"Of all the dozens of excellent films I have in my collection on VHS, this remains the film I would most like to see transferred to DVD. What a gem!

When I originally purchased it without knowing a thing about it, I was slightly intrigued by the fact that the synopsis on the video box makes the film sound like a gritty suspense thriller, one of my favorite genres. The plot sounded interesting - a young black student is accused of murdering a white teen in NYC during the 1950's. OK, sounds like an intriguing piece of drama, I'll take it. So I took it home and was utterly blown away. One plot twist after another, fantastic acting, and a surprise theme, which turns out to be the main point of the film, kept me riveted to my seat for the entire film.

The story was believable, the drama intense, and the ending heartbreaking. I kept thinking about this film for days after I'd seen it, and since then I have lent my VHS to a half dozen friends, all of who were as emotionally effected by its sincerity as I was. This minor masterpiece, which sadly seems to be quite obscure, is a piece of drama that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. If you can manage to find it anywhere, rent it, purchase it, copy it, or steal it. You won't be sorry.",1135641600,22,1254,4.286919831223629
1251397,5,B00002AFX6,"To me this is a story with many simple yet powerful messages.  It quite accurately reflects the social attitudes of the 50s, especially as regards blacks (I won't go further for fear of giving away one of the plot twists).  It forcefully leads us question our own priorities in life when making  important decisions.
The story captures one's interest right away and  doesn't let go of that interest all the rest of the way through.  Going  along with this, I must make the point that one just cannot help constantly  feeling for the young man who is faced with the need of pleasing his  father, on the one hand, and doing what is best for himself on the other.
The acting performances, especially by the young man, his father, and  his lawyer, are powerful and forceful and don't sacrifice reality for the  sake of dramatic effect.  In fact, I found it very easy to put myself into  the shoes of all of these characters and feel the stresses each one was  experiencing.
The story is very true to life.  It doesn't pull any  punches and is told very straightforwardly and honestly.
In closing, I  say that if I could give this movie a sixth star, I would do so.  It goes  without saying that it is a ""must see,"" especially for those of  us who are interested in facing life as it is rather than living constantly  in a fantasy world.",950054400,31,1332,4.448132780082988

7915473,5,B00002AFX6,"My husband and i were cleaning the room and he happen to find a movie that was a vhs film that was not in the greatest condition but it was excellent when we played in the dvd/vcr player. My husband knows that i am not into racism films due to the sadness and pain that african americans have suffered. so he told me that this film is not really like that at all this is a murder mystery film. so i told him i was in to watch this movie.

From the moment the film started to the moment the film end i was emotionally connected to this film and the characters involved in this film. It seems like its a open and shut case about a african male name charles williams jr. who was accused of killing a white boy and it seems like its just other racism film but this was so good because its more than just that. It was a interesting murder mystery about why an african american male would confess to killing a white boy and not try to defend himself against the charges that was made about him. As the story goes on its a desperate fight for John williams played by courtney vance to save his nephew from the electric chair everything from asking the prosecutor for a plea to begging his own big brother on his knee to save his own child which i will not give too much of the movie away because i want to audience to be surprise about this movie. When the movie is over you will see how John Williams amazing journey out of the darkness and found the light in what was in fact the most terrible experience this man has ever been thru and the damage that came to his family and yet still found a new strength to fight for justice and for peace.

I wanted to start with the performance Charle Dutton had this been a movie in the theater should of been nominated for best supporting actor for his amazing work as Charle William. This was very complex performance because  there were times when you wanted to hate this man and there was times when you felt sorry for this man because of what his beliefs were. This character had interesting contradiction like he would be loving to his wife but he was a very sexist person when it comes to women voicing to him. Charles believed that women were kept in their place. Charle by the time the movie ends you will think that he was a uncle tom but really he was a very confused individual who didn't take pride in who he was only in what he wanted to be and wanted to be accepted by whites in a time where blacks were not considered people in the late 50's. This was before MLK, Malcolm X. JFK and others who were involved in the civil rights moment wanted to show people that black is not a curse that you don't have to accept ways that shaped a person perception of race and sexuality. Charle Dutton did a brilliant job in showing how people like charles thought in that time period and still think like that today. I really hated this character because of what he did to his own son and i personally felted that this character should of been punished . I have to remember that hate is baggage.
Courtney Vance should been nominated for best actor. This is one of his performance of a life time. Courtney played John Williams so perfectly that you almost believe that this was a true story. John williams amazing discovery about himself thru this disturbing journey into the world where change was not going to happen over night. John's journey for justice for his nephew was everything that you would except a disperate man to do my favorite scene is when the verdict of his nephew came in. John telling him don't lose faith was such a tear jerker that my husband and i were crying thru most if all of the movie. Amazing work by this terrific actor.

The message that i got from this movie was that people are not going to hold their true feelings in about their true self. that if you have a family member that is into dating out of his race or gay or lesbian or just different for whatever reason. Don't let pride take over because underneath the change is still the person you loved from day one. No matter how successful you can be, the greatest success is that love of your family and that you should never let your material items and bias change your views about a person's discovery about themselves and embrace that love that they still have for you.

Brilliant story, powerful cast and most of all amazing message that still runs in my head which is no justice no peace.",1390780800,3,4416,4.2965186074429775
7915474,5,B00002AFX6,Omg. This is indeed my favorite movie. Written so well. Excellent actors and it was played well to the very end. This is also the same director that worked on a few episodes of the L Word.,1385769600,,188,4.108108108108108
7915475,5,B00002AFX6,"There is lessons of ""blind faith"" from many angles. The attorney and uncle of the accused was bind to the possibility of his nephew potential capability of committing the crime. As society as a whole of being blind to how bigotry and rejection can be so cruel and harmful that not only destroys its victims, but their selves, an entire family and society as a whole. That not only stems from blind faith in what religion and society views as acceptable. As well as in the society being self righteous to decide what is acceptable and not acceptable bigotry and hatred. Rather than being awaken ands enlighten to understand ""ALL"" bigotry and hatred should not be an acceptable practice. Blind Faith by the Father of the accused in his own narrow selfish view of what he thinks is right and what he thinks is courage. Blind Faith by his son the accused is wanting to please his father rather than exercise his true courage that put him into a situation that prompted the charges leveled against him. Can't reveal that without giving away the secret of the film. Very moving performance by Courtney Vance, and Charles Dutton is very convincing of his character!",1378771200,3,1158,4.70935960591133
7915476,5,B00002AFX6,"I was surprised to find myself caught up in this movie so much.  The story keeps you guessing, taking you from one preconceived notion to another.  Every single actor and each of their relationships comes fully alive under the stellar cast. Because the story and its characters ring so true, the challenging issues being confronted are easy to empathize with.  You can feel the tension and suspense in your bones, along with the fears being faced.  Actors Charles Dutton and Courtney Vance own their roles. Dutton actually came to life and rattled me for a second with his raw anger that seemed to erupt from deep down in his soul.  So why watch Blind Faith with all its intensity?  Maybe just to live in another man's shoes for a spell. Excellent Drama!",1378598400,,754,4.674242424242424

It saddens me that racism was actually a way & fact of life during my life time. This movie will open your eyes to the tradgey that racism caused & could possibly still cause.",1341100800,,352,3.77027027027027
