8500245,2,B006L61KJ2,"It is nice to see asian films being released for western market but Secret Pleasures by First Run Features could have produced a better product.
Pros - Audio OK and some good films on DVD
Cons - With the exception of Ghosted the other three films are presented as non-anamorphic 1.85:1 embedded in a 4:3 frame so you are stuck with black bars on all 4 sides of TV screen or a stretched picture. Take your pick. I can understand this from DVDs produced between 1995-2005 when 4:3 analogues were common but doing this in 2012 is suggests either poor standards or laziness by re-branding old transfers.  I suspect this is the case since the sub-titles have different fonts for each movies. Not good enough.
The subtitles are also hard so you cannot turn them on or off.
There is a shortened documentary ""Tigerwomen Grow Wings"" included on the Ghosted DVD.
For the asking price of $30-40 this set does not provide value owing to poor quality screen aspects an lazy sub-titling.",1408147200,5,973,4.656976744186046
