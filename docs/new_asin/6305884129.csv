1087084,5,6305884129,"While there are several multi volume Wing Chun tapes out there on the market, there is not in this writer's opinion any even nearly as good as this one. The late Wong Shun Leung was without a doubt a Master of Wing Chun and gives a Masterful demonstration of theory and practice. I have studied Wing Chun since 1962 and they just don't get any better than this video. It is the one I reccomend to my beginners.",990403200,15,410,4.269230769230769
1087085,5,6305884129,"There are quite a number of videos now available on the Wing Chun combat system, some of which run into several volumes and have running times of over two or more hours. This tape, however, while one of, if not the  earliest of those available, and with a running time well under an hour, is  far and away the best of the bunch and offers so much more than products  running three times as long. Featuring the late Sifu Wong Shun-Leung,  teacher and classmate of the legendary Bruce Lee, the tape offers an  overview of the fighting system made famous in Hong Kong in the '50s and  '60s through the real life exploits of Sifu Wong in so-called  ""contests"" against various other combat systems, where he emerged  the victor on each and every occasion. The tape is basically broken down  into the following sections: 1) Wing Chun History, 2) Basic Concepts  (including footwork and ""Centreline Theory""), 3) 'Siu Nim Tau'  form and form breakdown/applications, 4) 'Chi Sau' concepts and  applications, and 5) a brief discussion of further forms and weapons. While  no where near as in-depth as more recent tapes may have tried to be, this  particular tape illustrates perfectly the Wing Chun concepts of SIMPLICITY,  DIRECTNESS and EFFICIENCY by offering so much to the viewer by way of it's  non-complicated approach. A fine introduction to Wing Chun for the  uninitiated, and a valuable reference and tribute to a real life legend in  the system for the serious devotee. This video is a definite MUST HAVE for  martial arts fans. If there is anything negative to be said about it, it is  that, sadly, the sequel tape mentioned at the end of the program, was never  produced, ...more's the pity since the death of Sifu Wong in 1997. Buy this  tape, ...you won't regret it!",963532800,134,1770,4.7344262295081965

The music and the narrative is a little dated but make no mistake the fundamentals of Wing Chun are there, I have trained in Martial Arts in the past and have met many Wing Chin practitioners, a lot of the things they told me about ""katas"" and form are mentioned in this video!

The teaching moves kind of fast but honestly you could just hit the rewind button until you ""get it"". But I do see how the fast teaching style can be a bit intimidating for those without an in depth knowledge of a martial art. My wife even said that the information was a bit overwhelming and that we would have to watch the DVD ""in sections"" to break down all the information!

There are explanations of all the underlying principles (centerline theory, economy of motion, etc) and explanations of things like Sil Lim Tao (one of the open handed forms).  This was made by one of Bruce Lee's trainers under Yip Man, and judging from the production quality, Bruce was still very much alive when this was made :P  What really makes this a must have for any 70's kung fu enthusiast is the soundtrack!

Even though it was produced in the 70s, it was very-well filmed and even a novice can learn from it. I would rate this dvd superior to many instructional martial arts being produced with today's technology which seem to be more about theatrics & CGI than instruction.

I keep watching it over and over again, and it really reinforces what I am learing at the wing chun school I attend. The teacher here clearly really knows his art. What I especially like is the slow detailing of each concept, but also they show the applications. For instance, they show sil lim dao (the first form in wing chun), and the next chapter is the ""street application"" of each part of sil lim dao. There is a lot ""hidden"" in wing chun, that you can only see on film (i.e. not from a book), and you get to see it here. Wing chun is really a lot more flexible and also more aggressive than many people think (what I mean by flexible is that, the forms show you the moves, but it is like chess, just because you know the moves individually doesn't mean you can put them together to win a chess match. The application side is how you use the moves, and like chess, it is almost infinite). A lot of people will see something and then say, ""wow I didn't know that was in wing chun"", but it is. It is really a good DVD on wing chun. I highly recommend it.",1162944000,7,1182,4.211453744493392

It covers some useful basic theories and concepts of Wing chun such as simultaneous block/attack, attack/protect centerline, redirecting force, deflection, armtrapping, minimum movement maximum efficiency. Shows 1 or 2 application usage for each of the 8 blocking/attacking forms of Wing chun.

Of the 3 empty hand forms of Wing Chun, this DVD does not cover any Chum kiu or Biu gee or barely. Only Sil lim tao and form breakdown, Chi sao one/two hand demonstration, retreat/advance footwork, shifting angles, and basic kick attacks.

A great start off DVD. I learned some useful fighting concepts and strategies that I can use almost immediately in a few days! Wing Chun is a very effective fighting system even on the streets. I can almost say it has an advantage over boxing because it uses simultaneous arms and leg attacks. Only a few DVDs ever found starring Sifu Wong Shun Leung. If you want to learn the other two empty hand forms or other advanced Wing Chun, also look for DVDs that has William Cheung or Gary Lam.",1153440000,6,1075,4.805405405405406

Master Wong Shun Leung's demonstration of using Wing Chun techniques to overcome an opponent in sticky hands are outstanding.

More Wing Chun instruction DVDs from Master Wong are available from [...] However, these other DVDs are very expensive.

Another resource in top quality Wing Chun instruction are DVDs from Master Chu Shong Tin, also available from [...] (hopefully from amazon.com soon). While Master Wong concentrates on the fighting skills of Wing Chun in this 40 minute DVD, Master Chu explains body mechanics and demonstrates using no muscular force to uproot an opponent twice his size in sticky hands in details in DVDs lasting 10 hours.

1087943,2,6305884129,"I have been studying Wing Chun for several months now, and purchased the DVD to supplement my training.  In fact, it seems that this video would be much better suited to the Wing Chun student that has yet to go to his/her first class and is evaluating the art before truly diving in.

As one reviewer notes, Master Leung does goes through the various hand and foot techniques, Wing Chun's most simple form - Siu Lim Tau, and even the one-inch punch made famous by Bruce Lee.  That said, only parts of Siu Lim Tao are demonstrated slowly, making learning the form from this DVD next to impossible.  The same is true of the one-inch punch.  The force Master Leung uses in displaying his one-inch punch in the video is truly incredible, but no effort is made to show how he successfully completes the tactic.

Master Leung is an incredibly talented practitioner, but for the student looking for outside-the-classroom supplemental instruction - I would NOT recommend this DVD...I wouldn't even classify it as a primer.",1115683200,10,1014,4.765714285714286
1087944,3,6305884129,"The instructor defintely knows what he is doing as far as ing Chun is concerned, but the presentation for learning purposes is weak.  You do not get multiple angles, instead, just about everything come right at you.  There's also no way of selecting a sequnce from the menu.  You have to make you way through the entire chapter to view the information you are interested in.  It's good for watching Wing Chun and getting some information, but for learning techniques and the first form, you might want to look elsewhere.

The DVD is itself is not high quality.  Somebody else mentioned VCD quality, I would give it a little less.  Definitely looks like a video transfer.  My chapter selections also did not work correctly.  Most did, but one went nowhere and one which looks like it should go to blocks instead goes to kicks.

Finally, depending on your DVD player, you may have problems.  I can only guess, but I think the DVDs are not DVD-ROMS (which is what Hollywood and most DVD companies use).  I think they are either DVD-R or DVD+R format (just guessing).  It won't play in my main DVD player (an older Sony).  It will play on a newer portable DVD player I have and on my computer DVD player.  So if you have a DVD player you know does not play all DVD-R and DVD+R discs, you may have problems.",1109462400,8,1302,4.480851063829787
1087945,5,6305884129,"This was my introduction to Wing Chun.  Wong Shun Leung demonstrates the economy of motion that makes Wing Chun famous.  I found a local Wing Chun school to study at after watching this.  As a style, Wing Chun is so direct and economical that one may be tempted to think it is ineffective,  but that is not the case.  This style is real, effective, and a wonderful gift from China.

This tape is not suited for instruction, but is wonderful for motivation.  I was unable (unlike other reviewers) to learn the Si Lum Tao form from watching this video (and suspect most people won't be able to either), but after learning the form at my local school, I could go back to this and appreciate how masterfully it is presented in the video.

The soundtrack features some playfully goofy 70s style music, and the silly striking sounds (all too familiar from the kung fu movies of the era) are a bit too much, but these are minor nits in an otherwise enjoyable presentation.",1105056000,14,965,4.53757225433526

""Wing Chun: The Science of In-Fighting"" is expertly produced and filmed from perfect angles which allows the viewer to accurately discern all the subtle nuances of each move/technique that is shown. Master Cheung is incredible! Obviously an experienced teacher and Wing Chun player. He goes through everything you need to know to get started or brush up your chops in Wing Chun basics. I also appreciate that the techniques are repeated, sometimes in slow motion, which allows for good comprehension without the need for incessant ""rewinding"". All the presented material is extremely solid. Even the background music is perfect in that it keeps the presentation flowing seamlessly. Take my advice and don't listen to the knucklehead who gave this dvd a bad review. Click the link and check out his other reviews. He isn't even into martial arts and probably has never viewed this dvd. Also, I think most people are sick of all the condescending jackasses who keep giving the same advice about not being able to learn martial arts from a book, video, movie or whatever. I think most people who hear this overstated advice think the same thing as if someone had just told them 1 + 1 = 2. MOST, not ALL, people who buy martial arts dvds, books, etc. are TRULY martial artists (who have learned from teachers, lessons, classes, etc.) who use the materials in a variety of ways, i.e. inspiration, further knowledge, comparative analysis, familiarization with different styles, etc., etc., etc. (plus, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that a person could become a self-taught expert... why discourage someone?) Anyway, this dvd is a must-have. I can't say a bad thing about it. Even the added (promotional) material is great. You will enjoy (and learn from) this dvd over and over. It never gets stale.

Good demonstration of the basic footwork and how to apply it. Brief run through of the first form: Sil Lim Tao and applications.
What I enjoyed the most was towards the end with the 2-man scenarios. Sifu Wong would demonstrate a technique taken from Sil Lim Tao which one of his students would counter, then the next scene would be his counter to the counter.
You won't be able to learn Wing Chun from this DVD, but it is a good overview of the Wing Chun philosophy and some very well filmed sequences. I'm sure I will dip into this periodically as my own Wing Chun training progresses.
Sifu Wong died in 1997 so there is no follow up video demonstrating the next form: Chum Kiu (Searching for the Bridge). A great shame.",1069632000,39,977,4.556818181818182

All of the Wing Chun principles are demonstrated and explained, and shot very well.  It is a shame that the footage at the end supposedly for more advanced editions was only test footage.
But all minor niggles aside, not only is this one of the best presented Wing Chun instructional films out there - no displaying of Siu Lim Tao from all angles over and over, or specific techniques displayed without exaplanation as to how they apply to Wing Chun principles for example) - but it is also the only time the late Master Wong Shun Leung was captured on film in this way.

1088042,5,6305884129,"This video, while definitely dated (which can be noted by the early 80's cheesy music and sound effects in the opening sequence), is an excellent training tool to begin learning the basics of Wing Chun.
Like any video, it doesn't cover everything, it can't.  However, I found that it did an excellent job of covering the basic hand forms, chi sao (sticky hands), and explaining the principals behind them.  Wong Shun Leung shows slowly how to do the moves, then quickly, and then 'shows the movement in application'.  This is very important, as just knowing how to do the move does not tell you what to do with it.
He also shows you how to do the first of the Wing Chun forms, ""Sil Lim Tao"" (sometimes called Siu Nim Tao, don't be fooled, they're the same thing, neither is incorrect).
The video does lack in the area of footwork, movement, and sticky legs.  It covers the basic stance and front to back movement, but little more.
Don't let that discourage you though, because with the purchase of another video (like Augustine Fong's Wing Chun Fundamental Techniques - which covers footwork & sticky legs nicely, but is lacking in the hands forms area) you can easily supplement the learning.
This video is very well laid out, but i definitely recommend getting something to supplement it, like I mentioned above, and also look at the book Wing Chun Kung Fu by James Yimm Lee.  This will help in learning the Sil Lim Tao form.

I have watched a few other Wing Chun videos by different instructors and usually came away disappointed becuase of the low production quality, poor audio, and meandering content (some of them look like they're filmed with home video cameras on the spur of the moment with no planning).  This video is different however.  You can tell that some thought and planning went into how it was laid out, with different sections being announced by a title page, quality narration, and very useful content.  I liked the fact that the video shows you the actual applications behind the techniques in the Siu Nim Tao form.  My appreciation for this form grew greatly after watching the video.  I also liked how he showed the basics of Dan Chi Sao and Chi Sao (Sticking Hands).  It's too bad that Master Wong passed away a few years ago, it would have been nice to see some more quality videos from him (by the way, the end of the video mentions a never-released sequel and even shows some clips of Master Wong doing the Chum Kiu, wooden dummy, & weapons forms; someone should find that stock footage and release it as a new video!).
