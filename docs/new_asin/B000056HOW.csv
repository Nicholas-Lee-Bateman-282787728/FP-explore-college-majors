1397534,4,B000056HOW,"This movie is great. The d.v.d. has an incredible sound and picture but it falls short on the extras, thats why I give it 4 stars and not 5. But besides that there is nothing bad about this d.v.d. If you are not a fan of samurai X(a.k.a. Rurouni kenshin) you will be after you see this movie.",987552000,,292,4.051724137931035
1397535,5,B000056HOW,"First thing that came to my mind when I first watched the movie was: It's the TV series! I thought the motion picture was going to take place when Kenshin becomes a wanderer, but it doesn't. In fact, the viewer should only watch this movie after the OVAs and the TV series. I have watched the first two seasons thus far and the series gets better and better each time I watch it. The motion picture's animation is similar to the TV series and the character designs are still as extensive. I personally didn't enjoy the opening song but the end credits song is pretty good. You really become concerned about the characters in the movie which is a sign that the direction of the character development is excellent. This motion picture explains further about Yahiko's father's clan which I like a lot because even in the TV series, the young samurai's life has never really been explored. In all, I highly recommend this motion picture to anyone who loves the story and character development in Rurouni Kenshin TV series and in the Samurai X OVAs.",986774400,10,1044,4.618279569892473
1397536,5,B000056HOW,"After watching the Samurai X OVAs and the two seasons of Rurouni Kenshin, I knew I had to get the Samurai X TMP. I just finished watching it and I loved it! Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The movie was drawn in the same manner as the tv series, along with the same characters, so please watch the series first before watching this! Trust me, it will be even more enjoyable and watching the OVAs first is even better. I love this storyline and it ties both series together rather nicely. My only complaints are that there is a skimpy offering of trailers (none that I really want to watch) and the really bad opening song. Trust me, none of those things are important once you start watching the movie!",986428800,,711,4.393939393939394
1397537,4,B000056HOW,"Samurai X the movie or Rurouni Kenshin the movie.  It's actually the later of the two.  When I first saw the title, Samurai X, I was expecting to see a new addition to the OVA 4 part series.  This film, however, is based on the TV show.  I was not as impressed with the animation, but I got over it eventually,and started to enjoy the film. There were several well done fight scenes, especially the climatic battle at the end.  It reminded me of the Kung-Fu style filming you see in Hong Kong flicks.  I had to give this movie 4 stars, however, mainly because of the misleading packaging.  If your going to call a movie Samurai X, and use the same logo as the 4 part series, then that should be the movie you put out.  Now I have to go back and watch the Rorouni Kenshin series which is long and extensive.  I'm not putting the movie down.  I'm just warning those of you who are expecting a Samurai X style movie.  It's got the same charcaters, but it's not OVA's Samurai X.",986342400,4,974,4.210810810810811
1397538,5,B000056HOW,"When the ""Rurouni Kenshin OVA"" came out in 1998, people were stunned. The animation, the gorgeous music, the fantastic plot which finally revealed how Kenshin received his cross-scar... everything. When it was released in America a year ago, people were again stunned. With its increasing popularity, ADV Films released the motion picture, which takes place after both the OVA and TV series. And is it comparable? With its amazing animation, marvelous music, incredible plot, and talented voice actors, you cannot complain.
The animation is very fluid, and in no way could I complain. Okay, maybe I can a little. The battle sequences are similar to the TV series, with mere cuts being slashed on a still frame. What's bad about this is that the sound effects are still going with all the slashes and grunts. A few times (namely the beginning and end) were drawn in the OVA's type of fighting (where you can actually see what's going on). These were extremely enjoyable, and a few were even more action-packed than the OVA.
Fortunately, the original company that produced this decided not to use any CG effects. Thank God. They came off poorly in the OVA, due to the mixing of artistry and special effects.
According to the back cover, the movie got a remastered VHS source. Comparing it to the Rurouni Kenshin OVA, you can indefinitely see a major difference. But on its own, the movie looks fairly nice. There weren't any major rainbows or any line noise that I could detect.
During the entire viewing session, I listened to the Japanese audio. There are no real flaws here, technically. Unlike ""Endless Waltz""'s 5.1 mix, this one only received a 2.0; it still sounds good, though. What's my complaint? The opening and ending songs. Ugh... they're just so... terrible. It's basically a man singing with some background music, but it doesn't fit at all with the actual movie's mood. The composer, Taro Iwashiro, seemed to copy the OVA's composer, Taku Iwakasi (who did the best job that could have been done). The only thing Iwashiro did wrong was that he made the songs too repetitive.
Packaging was extremely nice for this one. It's simplistic and very cool. The front cover sports Kenshin with the opponent yelling (extremely lame, might I add) in the background. The back cover is much nicer, though! There is a black background with a greyscale image of Kenshin blended in. The image of Kenshin holding Kaoru is stamped on and looks marvelous. In addition, there are nice little screenshots that are decorated in a nice white border work very well, as they mix beautifully. Nitpicks? Heck yes. The last two screenshots are, at closer inspection, very blurry and poorly captured. The top two of Toki and Yahiko must not have been screenshots; but rather scans. The listings of the cast and crew enhance the feel of it being a ""movie.""
While many people hated the Samurai X title (as do I), ADV actually gave us a nice looking ""X"". The actual DVD disc looks incredible. It has the picture of half of a 3D blue X, with three signs of ADV Films, DVD Video, and Dolby Digital. The insert is amazing. Though it first is terrible, once you flip it over you seem something much cooler. The colors (black, grey, red, and white) work extremely well. A greyscale modified image of Sanosuke screaming in the background, with a sharp full-color image of Kenshin about to slash his sword, layered over works on so many levels. ^^;
Extras? What extras? The only... *ahem* ""extra"" was the trailers for the movie and OVA. Extremely weak. ADV could of at least shown us some effort! Even textless versions of the opening and ending themes would have satisfied me! Bah...
Nothing new here: the same cast did the same magnificent job. After hearing Mayo Suzukaze's serious role in the OVA a million times, it's nice to hear her go back to the wackier Kenshin. All the others are on par, as well. A definite A+ job.
In Media Blasters's production of the domestic TV series, they list attacks as their pronunciation (for example: do-ryu-sen). However, ADV decided to list their translations and I had to resist the urge to break out in laughter. In the middle of the last fight, Kenshin yelled out the battle cry, ""Dragon Hammer Flash!"" Come on, people! This is turning into Pokmon, for crying out loud!
Content-wise, the movie is humorous, dark, and at the same time, dramatic. Though I've only seen the OVAs and 20-or-so episodes of the TV series, I can definitely say that this was an attempt to ""combine"" the two together. The result is incredible. While it does have a few chuckles here and there, the main theme is fairly dark; it deals a lot with Kenshin's past (a definite plus to all the people that hate this ""wimp"" version) as Hitokiri Battousai. We even learn that there are more ""hitokiris"" than just Kenshin! Cool!
Kenshin's opponent is just like many of the television episodes; a former Bakumatsu samurai, wanting to destroy the new Meiji government. But this one actually ties in with everything, if not a bit cliched.
Believe it or not, I enjoyed it just a bit more than the OVA (although watching it about thirty times might have helped). I've heard many people complain about it, but I rather enjoyed this 90-minute presentation.",986256000,4,5232,4.7759381898454745
1397539,4,B000056HOW,"Let me start first by saying that RK is currently my favorite Anime - I think the Trust/Betrayal set and the entire TV series so far are FANTASTIC and worth 5+ stars.  Unfortunately, Samurai X - The Motion Picture is neither ""here nor there"".
The Trust/Betrayal series takes a little getting used to (because it's different from the TV series), but the pair is a masterpiece - the quality of the Anime, the music, and most of all, the storyline, are all first rate.  At first, when I saw the cross scar on Kenshin, I thought the Anime may be somewhat cheesy, but the Trust/Betrayal series totally dispelled that idea...
The TV series from Media Blasters isn't as deep or dark as the pair, but the storylines are tight, the action fast, and there's a great mix of lighthearted situations along with deeper tales - you'll care about the bad guys as much as the good!
Now, we get the Samurai X - TMP.  The animation is in the style of the TV series, but it's as long as a movie.  The story is flabby and doesn't get anywhere until the second half (not as well written as the TV series) and the animation quality tries to be more than the TV series, but doesn't quite do it.  If you are an RK fan, there's nothing I can write here to convince you of anything, but I would just suggest that you RENT this one first.
So far, I have purchased ALL the RK DVDs and I intend to purchase the entire TV series on DVD.  The one exception is this one - I've cancelled my order after having rented it.  It truly deserves 3.5 stars - suggestion:  rent it first, before you buy.",984787200,15,1561,4.285714285714286

1397558,2,B000056HOW,"I love the show Rurouni Kenshin, but this movie has different actors speaking for all the main characters and it sounds so screwed up. Yahiko sounds like a much older guy while Sanosake and Kenshin just sound way off. The silly and serious voices of Kenshin sound so wrong that it is quite difficult to ignore unfortunately. But hey, that's what $2.00 gets ya sometimes :] Everything else was overall fine, except right at the beginning, its somewhat awkward how Kenshin kinda explains why he doesn't kill and use a normal sword; he sort of just says it out of context. Again, I don't want to be completely negative because its a good movie but it was just so hard to ignore the crazy, new voices.",1362182400,,697,4.5396825396825395
1397559,4,B000056HOW,"This movie is best watched in Japanese. The English voice actors are different, and it gives the movie a sense of not fitting in with the series. If you watch the Japanese it seems more cohesive. Kenshin, Kaoru, Sano, and Yahiko are going on a train ride to Yokohama. Upon arriving they encounter trouble, and receive help from a man Shigure. He seems noble and befriends the residents at Kamiya dojo. He is secretly plotting a rebellion and the assassination of a foreign diplomat. When he learns that Kenshin is the Battousai, he engages Kenshin in a battle to the death. The 2 friends fight may determine the country's future.

This is a very good movie. As I said before the English dub is really bad. Other than that this movie has the same stuff that made the TV show great. I personally enjoyed it a lot. I think most fans of Kenshin will like it too.",1353196800,,858,4.464968152866242

1397564,4,B000056HOW,"The motion picture set a few years after the end of the series is a nice look into the continuing saga of Kenshin and his gang.  This anima is always at it's best when they bring in people from Kenshin's past and the era of the Meiji Restoration.

My one gripe about the anime, in general. After learning the Amakakeru Ryu No Hirameki (the Hiten Ryu's final attack) it's suddenly become the only way Kenshin can defeat enemies.  I can see that being the case against Makoto Shisio, but against everybody?  C'mon.

Otherwise a wonderful anime.",1174262400,,542,4.604166666666667

1397566,5,B000056HOW,I saw Samurai X on Cartoon Network. So I picked up a copy. The DVD come with front end trailers. Kenshin must take up his sword once again. To stop the fall up the Meiji Government. The uncut version of this movie is even better. There are many swords fights in this movie. If you love Rorouni Kenshin this is the Movie to get.,1154822400,,327,4.125
1397567,2,B000056HOW,"Let's get this out in the open:  I love Kenshin, I've read the whole manga, own the first 2 arcs of the anime, and both OVA's.  This movie had high potential to be good, but poor subtitling and voice acting ruined it for me.

Plot was good, and the movie gave some good fan-service to avid watchers.  It was very self contained, but you get to learn alot about Kenshin if you had never seen the series before.  I love the intro scene, it's one of my favorites in all anime.

I have a big problem with the English VA cast and the script, because there are huge differences between the 2 English and Japanese scripts that do not need to be there.  To top that off, many of the voices sound too dissimilar to their series counterparts.  The subtitling were good, but they decided to translate the attack names to English, which was very different from every other Kenshin dvd I've seen.  Not bad, but I found myself wondering which move the 'dragon hammer flash' was.

If you love Kenshin and must own this, buy it.  However, for a quality product, I'd have to reccommend against it, hence the 2 stars.  Go spend your money on the OVAs or manga instead.",1142726400,,1150,4.372641509433962
1397568,4,B000056HOW,"Samurai X the movie is an amazing film but the voice actors are terribly weak and any true fan of the series will realize this as soon as they start talking. They take so much away from the film, Kenshin sounds like a young and inexperienced child, Kaoru's always whining and I mean way more than she does on the series, Yahiko might as well have grown a few feet and a beard cause he sounds like a grown man, and Sanosuke's new voice isn't deep enough.

The Samurai X Movie is just another story of how Kenshins past catches up with him. Of course once again Kenshin is faced against a furious man obsessed with revenge and confused of how the deadly Battousai that once took someone from him could turn into Kenshin. I suggest watching Samurai X - The Motion Picture with the Japanese audio and English subtitles because it will hurt your ears to hear these amazing characters with these horrible voices.",1140134400,3,906,4.490909090909091

if you are a diehard ruroken fan then by all means get this,if not then there are better anime movies out there.

The characters are just as good as the ones in the TV series in that they developed very well and they're not annoying.  The video is OUTSTANDING I wish they did the TV series swords and weapons like this.  The only problem with the video quality is that they make Kenshin's hair look very orange when it's red but that doesn't really matter.  Just so people know this movie is a stand alone which means that it does actually have anything to do with the main storyline.  I would recommend this to ANY Rurouni Kenshin fan or just an anime fan.

I hated the widescreen on this movie, the animation is not even all that great like the Rurouni Kenshin series is. I hated when Kaour slap Yahiko just because he ran off to go train at a better ninja school he had hope's to becoming a soilder and she was just jealous. The only part I like that was my favorite in this movie was when on the dvd I click on blood bath and it was a war going on between the Japanese and the English it last a pretty good while that part is the only reason why I would watch this movie.

Kenshin, Kaoru, Sano, and Yahiko travel to Yokohama for a vacation and later spot a raid of drunk sailors, which comes the entrance of a new character, Shigure Takimi, to help them get rid of the sailors. Takimi then befriends with Kenshin and begins to trust him, little does Shigure know that Kenshin was the one who killed Shigure's friend, Gentatsu Takatsuki.

Meanwhile, Shigure leads a tribe of warriors who took part in a war in the time of the Tokugawa Shogunate, reason being is that they aren't happy with how the Revolution ended. He and the warriors plan to attack and destroy the british commander who started it all. But Kenshin comes in to stop Shigure's plans, who soon finds out that Kenshin killed Gentatsu. Shigure's plan fails, but his new goal is to kill Kenshin. (Can't tell you what happens after that, spoiled)

1397575,4,B000056HOW,"this movie is of fantastic quality and idea; but it seems more of an episode serial than a real, live movie. For instance, characters like saitoh just keep popping up, having so significance stability to the movie; but all in all it is impressive.

When Kenshin Himura was Hitokiri Battosai, he happened to kill a man named Gentatsu of the iwano group opposing the meiji government. Kenshin; after his reformation meets a man named Shigure Takimi; Gentatsu's friend who takes care of Gentatsu's siter, Toki. Shigure blames himself for Gentatsu's death having not listened to him and sent him for another mission and feels even more horrible having witnessed Gentatsu's death; but Shigure doesn't recognize Kenshin. Shigure, meanwhile in order to honour all those who died, like Gentatsu for the cause commands a band of rebels. Th rebels oppose the corrupt Meiji government and consist of either those who lost loved ones in the Bakamatsu or those who survived it; but his right-hand man conspires against him with the captain of the Japanese police; Tamano. Meanwhile, during a fight with the police, Kenshin has no choice but to fight Shigure and Shigure identifies his fighting style as the one which, killed Gentatsu. Hence, later after the rebels' defeat, Kenshin goes to meet Shigure and settle the score bloodlessly. Shigure and Kenshin fight; and end up wounding eachother before Kenshin menitons Toki, who loves Shigure and how he has made her cry. He mentions also that Gentatsu would not want Toki to cry. This seems to get to Shigure, who gives up; and lets Toki tend to his wounds while promising her to give himself up to the authorities. But his right-hand man's fellow conspirator, Tamano betrays him and shows up with a bunch of cannons and starts killing the defenceless fighters. They aim at Toki and in order to save her, Shigure jumps in front and takes five bullets and dies.

Kenshin is outraged and has that yellow gleam in his eyes to indicate he is battosai mode. He attacks Tamano just when General Yamagata comes to command the troops and we last see Toki crying over Shigure's dead body.

The ending is quite nice, really. Toki goes to Shigure's hometown to bury his belongings and she wants her schoolchildren(Shes a teacher) to dream like Shigure of a world without bloodshed and we see Kenshin looking up at the sky and saying, ""So what about it, Gentatsu? The sky should always go high and be blue, no matter waht.""",1114732800,,2448,4.837708830548926

This takes place right after ""Legend of Kyoto"" there on vacation from all the cammotion from Kyoto. They run into a person that was involved in the Tokugawa Shoganate ten years ago. Listen I'm not going to ruin the story but it is good. But the bad thing about this DVD is the idiotic dubbing, Kenshins voice is okay but Sanosuke,Yahiko and Kaoru have ugly voices that don't fit them at all, plus there is nothing special besides the trailers so you might as well get a subtitled VHS version.",1104364800,,660,4.373983739837398

1397580,4,B000056HOW,"I love Rurouni Kenshin, (the TV series, I haven't seen Samurai X) First of all, you should know that this movie, allthough called Samurai X, has nothing to do with the OVA's. It deals with Kenshin, Kaoru, Yahiko, and Sanosuke from the TV series and a couple other characters. Though it does show a bit of Kenshin's past, in the Bakumutsu. Anyway, I would give this movie 5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible dubbing! They don't even use the lovely character's voices that we've come to love in the TV series. And that threw it off alot, but it's a good plot if you can kind-of ignore the voices. I plan on watching the japanese version, since they're voices haven't changed on there, and it's much better to hear Kenshin shout out his Hiten Mitsugri techniques like they're so supposed to be rather then translating them into what they mean. Anyway! This falls in line somewhere with the TV series, so I suggest you watch the series to the ending of the Kyoto Arc and you'll be okay to watch this movie! ^_^",1091145600,,1008,4.454054054054054

The animation is as beautiful and the colors are as vibrant as the series.  As for the story- it says that it occurs in the 12th year of the Meiji so I'm assuming that it takes place after the adventures in the original televised series.  It's a wonderful continuation of Kenshin's life as someone who chooses to fight when necessary, but not to kill.  Kenshin is, as always, goofy, sweet, and the most unassuming former manslayer you'd ever meet.  I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the Reflections OVA as this one was right in line with what I feel Kensin is all about.  I'd recommend viewing this after seeing the Kyoto arc of the original series.",1090195200,2,798,4.394557823129252
1397582,5,B000056HOW,Samurai X is more of the anime series instead of the ova and the title was just created by A.D.Vision so don't get confused with the title. Samurai X (Rurouni Kenshin) The Motion Picture is about Kenshin Himura Dealing with his own past back during the revolution. When Kenshin and his go to Yokohama for a little vacation they run into a swordsman that was alaso in the revolution that wants to have revenge against the man that killed his best friend in the revolution. This movie was alright but the story was kinda boring and I had to see the same scene about 6 times during the movie. Get this if you want to if you are a real RUROUNI KENSHIN fan because this may not satisfy you.,1089936000,,685,4.317829457364341

The story starts out with a backround of kenshins life during the revolution(CAUTION:this scene comes out a few times so you might get tired of seeing it).Then later Kenshin and his friend's meet up with a guy named Shigure that was also in the revlution 10 years ago. My favorite scene was when Kenshin fighting shigure in the last battle in the whole movie. This feature is preety much about revenge and making a name for them selves, it's actually very stupid. Like I said in my review the story is alright the fighting was alright the movie is alright I just did not like the dubbing it was just horrible I just had to ger used to it. Only get this if yu are a true rurouni kenshin fan like I am.",1086652800,,856,4.257668711656442
1397584,4,B000056HOW,"At the start of ""Samurai X: The Motion Picture"" (""Rurni Kenshin: Ishin shishi e no Requiem"") we are clearly in the same bloody world of ""Samurai X: Betrayal"" and ""Samurai X: Trust.""  But then the titles come along and we are back to the world of ""Rurni Kenshin"" the series, with Kaoru Kamiya, Sanosuke Sagara, and Yahiko Myjin on the train to Yokohama.  Apparently the violent prologue was only a reminder of Kenshin's life as the ""Hitokiri Battousai"" (""the man who slashes even as he draws his sword"").
Within the context of the character's history the point of this story is to contrive a situation in which Kenshin Himura might break his vow and actually kill somebody with his reverse blade sword.  As is often the case in the series although the war against the Tokugawa Shogunate ended years earlier with the Meiji Restoration there are those who are not happy with the new world order in Japan.  Shigare Takimi is haunted by the death of his friend Takatsuki Gentatsu and now leads a band of desparate rebels who intended to kill a foreign ambassador.  But when Kenshin helps to protect Takatsuki Toki from the brutality of foreign sailors, the two men become friends.  Shigure asks Kenshime to take care of Toki if anything should ever happen to him.  Of course it is a small world even in Japan Toki is the sister of Gentatsu, who was killed by Kenshin (in the prologue).
Still, there are plans within plans in Meiji Japan as someone else is trying to use Shigure to his own ends and in the end it seems inevitable that Shigure and Kenshin will cross swords.  This is another example of a  ""Rurni Kenshin"" story in which the stranger with a past whose path has crossed our hero before ends up being the most interesting character.  It also remind those of us who enjoyed the anime series that things had ended there with Kaoru and Kenshin finally getting together and now we have apparently reset to an earlier time (the trip to Yokohama) and we can only ask, what is up with that?  Still, you have to admit that this is ""movie"" version is representative of the series, where a long string of former foes cross Kenshin's path once again.
I accidentally started watching the movie with the English dub and the English subtitles and kept it going just because there were so few times when they came close to matching.  So if you are not enthralled by the sword fighting and the human drama you can check out the dueling translations.",1086220800,4,2440,4.596774193548387
1397585,3,B000056HOW,"Samurai X The Motion Picture is an interesting movie that features some of the better post Kyoto fighting but other than that the movie itself in fairly unremarkable.  The movie begins with a flashback of Kenshin as the Battousai in the waning days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  He fights and kills a rival clan and one of its master swordsmen.  It is a good fight, short but well done.  This segment is done in muted colors with the exception of the blood which looks almost neon red.  The movie features most of the characters we have come to expect throughout the Kyoto story arc-Sano, Kaoru, Yahiko, and Saito.  The movie revolves around Takami, a central figure of the rival clan featured in the opening sequence.  He is man riddled with guilt over the death of his friend.  Now he wishes to topple the Meji government to bring a ""true restoration.""  In the end the movie has some great fight scenes, a few comical moments, and a solid enough story that keeps the movie rolling along.  The English voice cast is different than that of the Series, so if you prefer the English dub, well suffice to say it leaves ALOT to be desired.  The anime purists will tell you watch it in Japanese with the subtitles anyway.  The reason I did not rate it higher was that this movie lacked some of the charm of the Series and the fights, while very well done, were not that numerous and the movie does plod a bit because of the lack of action.  If the characters inroduced in this movie were also better developed then the action could have been absent but not missed.  As it is the movie is good but not great.  Hope this helps.",1084579200,,1618,4.437288135593221
1397586,5,B000056HOW,"In my opinion, Rurouni Kenshin is in my top 3 anime series of all time. Filled with humor, action, lovable characters, great storylines(although the sumo wrestler from season 1 was odd). So hearing of this movie, having watched the pre tv-OVA's, decided to watch this. Despite certain things that nagged me, this is a very good film to watch.
It starts with a flashback as a man named Gentatsu is killed by Kenshin, otherwise known as Hitokiri Battousai, a feared assassin and master swordsman. Back to present day, Kenshin and his 3 friends from the series(minus Megumi) are in a city. There they meet Takimi, an equally good swordsmen. Kenshin later finds out that Takimi is haunted by the death of his friend Gentatsu and wants to get rid of Japan's government. Kenshin finds himself in a predicament as not only does he have to stop Takimi from starting a war, he's got to stop Takimi and not kill him over the wishes of Toki, a woman who secretly loves him.
Phew. It's easier to watch. Bit of storyline details. This takes place during the Kyoto Arc after Kenshin has met Saito, and after Sanosuke learns a new punch.  It was rather sad to not see Megumi but you do see Ayume and and Sazume so that's a plus. Animation's great(although the blood looks odd in some parts) and Kenshin oddly looks a bit different here.
Now for some bad stuff.  The killing of Tentatsu is repeated many times throughout the film. While it is a reminder of the problems of Kenshin and Takimi, you don't have to have it 5 times, literally. Another thing is the dub. I watched the English dub and it's rather bad. One thing that made Rurouni Kenshin funny was Kenshin having a darker voice when he was about to fight and a more lighthearted voice during the slapstick moments, then of course there's ""oro"". And Sanosuke has a bit of an australian accent which doesn't sound right. However, Kenshin's english voice is good despite him not saying ""oro"" once.
If you're a big Kenshin, you might as well check it out, won't hurt. If you're not, I recommend the watching the series up until the first half of Season 1 and if you want to know about Saito, watch some of Season 2 but I recommend watching it.",1082851200,,2183,4.538071065989848
1397587,3,B000056HOW,"I saw the whole Kenshin series before buying the movie, and let me tell you the voices from the series were terrific!  However in this movie, they changed all the voices!  I could tolerate Kenshin's new voice since it sounded a little similar to his old voice, but everyone else's just plain sucked.  I watched it in English first and didn't like it, but then I watched it in Japanese to find it much better (even though I watched the whole series in English).  If you want to give it a chance in English, go ahead but you will probably just end up hating it.  Watch it subbed.
Anyway now that I'm done with my rant, let me review the actual movie.  It wasn't that special, just an extremely long Kenshin episode.  There's waaay too much talking and not enough action, but the few times they fight are pretty cool.  The quality of the animation seems sloppier than in the series, which was  a suprise since this is a movie.  It doesn't seem that much more fluid than the series either, but the series was done very well so I'm not complaining that much.  All of the music was the same from the series (other than the opening song and ending song) so that was a bit of a dissapointment.
The extras are lacking as well.  The only extras are a trailer for the movie, a trailer for the Samurai X OVA's (or OAV, whatever you wanna call it), and some trailers for other ADV Dvd's.  Nothing exciting.
Overall this is a pretty average movie.  I had very high expectations for it since I'm a huge fan of the series, so I was pretty dissapointed when I first saw it.  Don't think very highly of it when you first watch it and you probably won't dislike it as much as I do.
By the way, this movie does not have anything to do with the Samurai X OVA's.  This is a movie that takes place during the Kyoto arc of the Kenshin series.  Why they decided to name it 'Samurai X the Movie' and not 'Rurouni Kenshin the Movie' is a mystery to me, but keep this in mind so you won't be confused when/if you decide to watch it.",1082764800,,2004,4.231578947368421
1397588,4,B000056HOW,"I think this movie is pretty cool. I wouldnt give it 5 stars becuase of a few quirks, like dubbing, and other things. The sotry line is great because everytime kenshin says that he is repenting for the people that he killed, you can never put a face to it. In this movie we are able to take a glimpse into the pain that his assasin days cause in the maji era. We now have an idea of what kenshin put people through. And for that i beleive that all kenshin fans should get it. But if you haven't seen the seriese you can watch it too, and it will still be a great story, but then i suggest you should get the other samurai x movies trust and betrayal, then there are rourouni kenshin boxed sets you can buy if you are curious about his days as a wonderer. If you don't want to buy the seriese you can buy relfection, which has short flashbacks on the seriese and concludes the kenshin saga.
Here you have it. I think this movie is great, expect for the voice changes ( like yakkio sounding like he's 20, and Sanoske sounding like a cali surfer boy/midwest farmer)
but don't let that bother you b/c the japanese version sounds ok
happy watching!!",1081641600,,1144,4.228310502283105
1397589,5,B000056HOW,"After getting pretty deep into the TV series, I searched out the rest of Kenshin's world. Fortunately, the manga is being released here. I have also seen the OVA, which explains Kenshin's past before the TV series and the manga. Then I got into the movie.
This--is--awesome! Like the OVA, it moved me in a way that few (if any) anime ever have. Unlike the OVA, there are many funny parts in addition to the depressing parts. I love it when Yahiko is told to grow up to be an honorable man worthy of respect, and he thinks of his two role models, Kenshin and Sanosuke. The look on his face when he thinks of the older pair in some of their goofier aspects is great!
The focus, however, is on the dramatic rather than the humorous. Kenshin is forced to relive a part of his life he would in all honesty rather forget, even erase. His past once again taints a relationship that otherwise would have gone smoothly, and in the end he and his new ally are forced to fight on opposite sides. Again. However, this time it ends, not with the reconciliation of the pair, but in tragedy.
The fight scenes in this movie are of the same quality you've come to expect from this incredible series. The fight between Shigure and Kenshin is just jaw-dropping! I actually said ""Wow!"" the first time I saw it.
Oh, and there is something I should mention. One fight is shown several times through several different angles. This fact may turn a lot of people off, but it IS important to the story. And that is (understandably) the only time he fights this particular man, so they have to keep showing the same small battle. It certainly didn't hurt me to see the same fight three or four times.
Like the series, the English dub SUCKS! I hate it! *imagines taking the dub track from the people at the studio and stomping on it* The Japanese is SO much better! Kenshin as a character is supposed to have one of those voices that could be either male or female--that is part of the whole joke surrounding the character. He is supposed to be mistaken for a teenage boy at best, a young woman at worst. However, in the English dub, he is given a definite male voice. That alone is worth burning the tape with dub track on it. But combined with the questionable talents of the other English actors...Anyway, I prefer the Japanese version, not just for the (correct) voices but also for the correct pronounciation of the names. And for the excellent subbing. The subbers actually translate the names of Kenshin's attacks. This is both good and bad, as I love to hear him say the names, but on the other hand I get to (finally) learn what those attacks really are.
In keeping with the somewhat darker tone of this movie, much of the action takes place at night or in dark buildings. What scenes are done in daylight are very well-done--these are often the more humorous scenes. Except for the battle scene: there wasn't supposed to be anything funny about that. However, when I showed it to two of my friends, they found that scene really funny for some reason. But they were also laughing during the climax of the battle between Shigure and Kenshin. Grr...
I fully recommend this to any and all Kenshin fans, though if you don't know at least a little of the backstory than this probably won't make much sense.",1080086400,,3282,4.480801335559265
1397590,5,B000056HOW,"This is divided into two parts, the first part pertains to those who are Kenshin fans, the second part pertains to those who are not familiar with Kenshin.
Let me start by saying that if you are a Kenshin fan, you'll want to have this movie.  It shows an aspect of Kenshin's character we rarely get to see- the results of his prior days as the manslayer.  While in the t.v. series Kenshin suffers in a more generic, non-specific kind of way for his past sins, that is, he doesn't see the direct results of his actions, such as  the suffering of the families of those he killed, in this movie he is slapped in the face with it.  He learns of the suffering first hand, from the relatives of one he had previously slain in the name of justice.  This is much the same as the first movies, Trust and Betrayal.  The only thing I could complain about was the difference in the voices of the English dub of the series and the English dub of this movie.  While most of the changes weren't distracting, the voice of Sanosuke was absolutely horrendous to the point of distracting me.  Other than that, kudos to this film for being entertaining and giving a little further development into the Kenshin character.
For those who are not Kenshin fans, this movie might be confusing.  It is chock full of history and characters that are prevalent throughout the series but are not exactly things you would hear or be able to relate to in every day life.  The movie is rather violent if you are not used to Kenshin, but no more so than any of the other animes out there that contain violence.  Again, I would suggest watching the series first, and then trying the movies out.
Finally,Kenshin remains true to the ideal of the series, trying to resolve differences, atone for his sins and make up for the hurt he has caused in the past, to the point where he is willing to die to even the score.  Kenshin is a man who is gentle and full of compassion, but can also kick butt and protect those who need protecting.  He rocks in the movies just like he rocks on the series.",1074038400,5,2052,4.368421052631579
1397591,5,B000056HOW,"I'm a HUGE fan of Rurouni Kenshin, and this my favorite movie. After watching the TV series and OVAs, I needed some more Kenshin, and I bought this movie, and it was excellent. The animation is superb, the soundtrack (which I'm listening to as I write this) is a masterpiece and the story is very good (altough it has some flaws...). We all know the characters, Kenshin, Kaoru, Sanosuke and Yahiko, and we are also introduced to Shigure Takimi and Takatsuki Toki. These two characters play a big roll on this movie, specially Shigure. There's politic involved in this story, and some good (but somewhat cliched) plot twists, with the usual greediness, betrayal and last-minute realizations that you were walking the wrong path. The fighting scenes are pretty cool, involving Kenshin, Saitou (something on this later), Sanosuke and Shigure. Near the ending, Kenshin does a new move, one never before seen thats pretty cool and I don't wanna spoil it. The chronological order is a little confusing if you want to put it ""within"" the series, but it is safe to watch after seeing the second season. What I mean is that, like some other reviewers have said, Kenshin after the second season has ""suppressed"" or ""overcome"" his hitokkiri nature, and in this movie he was ""possesed"" once again by his anger. Also Saitou...well...something happens to him on the ending of the Kyoto Arc, and he still appears here, so this has something that put it after the Kyoto Arc (knowing the Amakkakeru Ryu no Hirameki and Sano's Futae no Kiwami) and other things that put it before the Kyoto Arc (the appearance of Saitou and Kenshin's manslayer nature emerging), so we'll never know for sure. Still, this is a pretty good story, with a sad but satisfiying (to me at least) ending, pretty good animation and extremly cool fighting scenes.

I mean they obviously have some kind of connection like when Kauro knew that Kenshin was wounded in the final battle and how she keeps on caring for him even though he has done bad things in the past. Also some things were unaccurate. Isn't that police cheif dead? And if Kenshin is really 28 than why does everyone call him a kid or boy? I know he is short but this really had unrealistic heights. And doesn't Kenshin believe that Cyto is dead? I'm assuming that ths is set after he beats Shishio because Sano uses the Futainokiwaga or whatever it is. And since when is Kenshin that vulnarable? He is the Battosai! He would never let himself get kicked in the stomach or anything like that. But I'm still glad that there was at least one more Kenshin anime!",1070755200,,907,4.404761904761905
1397596,4,B000056HOW,"In a mood to see some anime and samurai swordplay, I picked up this DVD having not seen any of the series.  I am reviewing this film independent from the series.
From a basic standpoint, ""Samurai X"" gave me what I wanted to see:
-a compelling, unique, and initially mysterious main character
-some excellent fight scenes
-better than usual art work
-adequate English dubs and music
-a story that did not get in the way of the action
The initial fight scene, which takes place years before the rest of the story, really gripped me and made me want to continue on with the film.  Gripping tension and excellent fighting action.
After that there was a lot of story setup where I was lost for the most part.  This is probably because I never saw the series.  Basically there was a civil war but some are angry with the new regime and wish to overthrow it.  There is much intrigue that unfolds throughout the rest of the story as characters chose a side and then in some cases betrayed that side in the struggle.
In some cases I thought the double-crosses became too many, but the plot advanced just fine and brought about enough fight scenes.
One thing I will admit to admiring about this movie was how it moved me emotionally at some points.  I felt tension when young Yahiko got trapped by the rebels.  I felt a bit of sorrow in the end for Takimi and Toki.  I could understand Takimi's rage at Kenshin.  This was one of the strong points of the movie, and the music did a decent job of adding to the emotion.
All in all, maybe not one of the greatest movies of all time, but certainly entertaining and superior within its own genre.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in anime set in a historical samurai time period.",1066867200,,1726,4.416403785488959
1397603,2,B000056HOW,"This was an utterly ridiculous movie....First of all, the movie and the series are very different from one another.  So much in fact, that the two have almost nothing in common.  This story takes place a little after the second arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series.  If you've seen the second arc then you know Kenshin has already conquered the manslayer within him, Saito is supposedly dead, and Sanosuke Seighara has mastered a punch called the Tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap).  In this movie, however, Kenshin allows the manslayer within to emerge, Saito reappears and Sanosuke has no knowledge of the tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap).
This storty, plainly putting it, makes no sense whatsoever.  Do not get this movie.  If you do, you will surely regret it.",1061596800,4,791,5.046153846153846
1397604,5,B000056HOW,"I have seen this movie as well as the series and the OVA's about 8 times total and I still have yet to see what is wrong with this movie besides the fact that you need some knowledge of the series to understand it. The writers did a good job into not potraying the two opposing sides (kenshin and takimi) as either good or bad as we see that the main point was that although killing was necessary to create or defend a government during what is potrayed as the Dark Ages of Japan which was during the time of the Tokugawa Shogunate there is no such thing as a perfect government thereby making all that bloodshed very much pointless. The animation is a little better than the series and it is good for it's time. The music is by far the best with the exception of the intro song. The music provides a melancholy tone and makes the listener feel pitiful with the events that are going on. I do somewhat agree with some reviewers that the plot is predictiable but this movie is supposed to reinforce the fact the eventhough kenshin has seen the light and is bound by his will to keep the promise he made after killing another man slayer named Gentatsu who's death haunt's Takimi constantly and is portrayed as such in the movie by a constant flashback of that moment. For the reviewer who did not see the artistic side of the fact that the same scene was repeated over and over you need to understand that if you were to see a loved one die in front of you while you could not do anything about it you will have the same exact harsh memory in your head it's part of the human mentality. Since I am cutting it close to 1,000 words I will just say that the movie is Worth buying if you are mature enough to understand the plot.",1061596800,5,1723,4.240121580547113

  In the beginning of the movie,they show a scene...all right?
 then during the first thirty minutes, Kenshin,Kaoru,Sanoske,yahiko talk...then they show the the scene at the beginning of the movie again.
Then  Kenshin and his group meet this new person with really THICK eyebrows,then they show the scene at the beginning again.
  They just kept on showing THE FIRST SCENE!I was like! OKAY THAT""S ENOUGH NOW!YOU DONT HAVE TO KEEP ON REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER!
  but toward the end it got interesting,there was action and it was really good then romance then drama.

1397611,4,B000056HOW,"The timing of this film is after the 'Samurai X' OVA's.  The year is 1879, sometime during the progress of the 'Rurouni Kenshin' television series.  The bloody overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate has been followed by the Meiji restoration, but all is not well.  Samurai led by Takimi Shigure regret the passing of the old days and plan to start a counter-revolution.  Himura Kenshin, one of the samurai who fought to overthrow the Shogunate, finds himself forced by destiny to oppose Shigure.  In the past, a mistake by Shigure left his closest friend, Takatsuki Gentatsu without sufficient resources for a raid.  Unknown to Shigure, Kenshin is the samurai who killed Gentatsu.  Both men were deeply affected by this, at the restoration of the Meiji, Shigure was sworn to vengeance.  And Kenshin had his sword blade reversed, determined never to kill with his sword again.
Now, in Yokohama, Shigure plots the death of the British Governor.  When Kenshin helps protect Takatsuki Toki (Gentatsu's sister) Shigure befriends Kenshin and eventually asks him to take care of Toki if something should happen to him.  In the meantime, forces in the government intend to use Shigure as a means for achieving their own ends, creating a multi-layered scenario of betrayals that will culminate in the final battle between the two honorable opponents.
Despite (or perhaps because of) the highly romanticized depiction of samurai behavior and swordmanship, this becomes a dramatically engaging story instead of a simple tale of blood and swashbuckling.  Kenshin's youthful appearance and the antics of his friends keep the film from being overwhelmingly tragic.  Thus it is a well-balanced plot with many subtexts to add to its richness.
Artistically, the film is first-class.  The battle scenes are cleanly detailed, and the choreography of the sword fights is beautifully done, if a bit fantastical.  The scenes have a fluid grace that will cause the viewer to stop action often, just to admire the illustration.  This film, and the related tales of Rurouni Kenshin set a new standard for Samurai based anime, that is rarely equaled.  Watching the OVA series before seeing the movie version will provide the viewer with useful background information, but the film stands quite well on its own, making it a fitting introduction to this popular and long-running series.",1042329600,27,2355,5.157894736842105
1397612,4,B000056HOW,"To date (12/2/02), this is the only theatrical film based upon the story and characters of the Rurouni Kenshin series. I will skip a summary of the plot, since this will have been covered adequately in other reviews.
ADV, not AnimeWorks, produced this American release, and the dubbing team is the same actors who voiced the OVA miniseries (i.e., not the main series crew). This is one of the chief problems with the film (insofar as its American release is concerned); for while the dubbing crew did an outstanding job for the OVA, in my opinion, they had a hard time shifting to the occasionally light-hearted and comic tone required for the theatrical film. (They do much better when the tone shifts to drama.)
The dubbing writers chose the odd tactic of representing the antagonist (he isn't really a villain) as being someone who can mimic and improve upon other people's fighting styles--in this case, Kenshin's Hiten Mitsurugi. It's a novel notion, and almost works; but it doesn't really match what is happening on the screen, and certainly doesn't match the original dialogue (so far as I know--the subtitles say he's using his own style, and that fits the series psych-philosophy of dueling much better.)
The storyline takes place during the continuity of the main series. Exactly when, is a matter of debate. Internal evidence (as well as production characteristics) indicate that it should be placed after the main series Kyoto arc, but before the concluding feng shui arc of season 3 (when most of the government buildings in Tokyo are wiped out). There are some secondary thematic similarities to the 3rd season Shimabara arc; but the film has a more dramatically satisfying conclusion, in my opinion. (At least the fight scenes are better--so far as they go; they aren't better than the majority of fights during the Kyoto arc...)
Artistic values are fairly high 3rd-season level, although not yet at the level of the final main series ep nor the OVA. I found no music in the movie (or on its soundtrack, which I've bought) from the 1st or 2nd seasons; it's all from the 3rd season. (Or it may be that the 3rd season borrows music liberally from this movie, the 2nd season, and a little from the 1st season... The 'new' music first appears in the aforementioned Shimabara arc.)
Although the ep isn't strictly canonical (it isn't borrowed from the manga, so far as I know, and other eps don't reference it), I still recommend it as part of a series watch-through.
Personally, I prefer to watch it just prior to the beginning of the Kyoto Arc (essentially the whole of the 2nd season).
There is nothing too far out of line for shifting the order this early, except for Sano's one use of the futonokiwami move: but in English this is ignored (I don't remember if he says the name of the move in Japanese); and all throughout the 3rd season he is unable to punch with that hand (having broken every bone trying to use the punch on Mikoto Shishio). Besides, as is common for 'strong man' characters in most fictional stories, the RuroKen writers tend to ramp Sano's strength up and down however necessary for the situation at hand: he's splitting huge trees in half with one punch in season 2, partly for comedy-value, _before_ he learns the futo', for instance! Punching a blockade out of the way is in the same vein, I think.
Hajime Saito's involvement with the story may seem problematic; but I argue that it can still fit a pre-2nd season 'ep'. We know from season 2 that Kenshin knows Saito is alive; that Saito has been keeping an eye on Kenshin; and that Kenshin wasn't expecting Saito to come after him in _this_ fashion (maybe come after him some day, but not like _this_). This is commensurate with Kenshin meeting Saito briefly in this film. Nothing in season 2 indicates that Kenshin is surprised to learn Saito is a police officer. Saito meets virtually no one in the film who has any bearing to the Kyoto Arc. Saito's involvement in the film is admittedly abrupt, in terms of a 'plot introduction'; but if the film is screened right before Kyoto starts, then the hanging question ""Who _was_ that guy!?"" is satisfactorily answered right from the beginning.
Thus, my recommendation of view order: Season 1 (skipping the False Prophet DVD 4, as to taste), temporarily skip the train robbery ep (DVD 5), then do the short arc introducing Sano's friend (DVD 6), then do the train robbery ep, which the theatrical feature could be seen as beginning with. (The 'modern day' majority of the movie begins with Sano and Kaoru doing their steam/ghost argument while riding the train to Yokohama. Title credit song is highly annoying, btw. |g|) Then after the theatrical, go straight to Kyoto Arc and play out from there. (The coastal pirate arc of Season 1 can be skipped, or put in earlier, as to taste.)",1038787200,3,4818,4.743742550655543
1397613,3,B000056HOW,"Samurai X: The Motion Picture follows the journeys of Kenshin Himura, the wandering samurai, as he, Sanosuke Sagara, Miss Kaoru, and Yahigo travel to Kyoto. After rescuing a woman from a band of British Sailors, Kenshin is haunted by visions of his past as a man slayer. He even comes against an old adversary who is bent  on exacting revenge on the Meiji government for crimes against him and his soldiers. Kenshin must now fight to maintain the peace, and keep a promise.
This movie is well done, but requires knowledge of the Kenshin series. If you have never seen Kenshin before, the various references to characters will make no sense at all. There are even moves used by Sanosuke that make absolutely no sense, unless you had prior knowledge of his character and how he was trained. I could not decipher where this movie fits into the whole Kenshin universe. Samurai X: The Motion Picture features techniques learned after the second season as well as inexperienced fighting from before the second season. This unbalance hurts the movie for those who have not been watching the Rurouni Kenshin series from the beginning.
Fights are definitely well drawn. They do suffer from the preverbal announcing your attack syndrome as seen in most fighting video games. This can get annoying the first few times you watch the movie, but once you get past this,  Samurai X will be just like any other anime.
I recommend this movie for Kenshin fans. If you are new to the series, it still is a good anime, but there are some parts that may be difficult to understand. See a few episodes of Rurouni Kenshin before seeing Samurai X, otherwise you will find yourself at a lost for some of the important characters.",1038355200,,1704,4.734006734006734

I thought that the plot was interesting and while the blood and gore might seem fake to some it is done so to provide the sharpness of a remembered scene.

as for the Trust/Betrayl OVA's  YOUR BETTER OFF NOT GETTING THEM OR WATCHING TILL YOU FINISH THE ENTIRE SERIES.....trust me it'll just be better than.

1397617,3,B000056HOW,"Okay, first off, this has nothing to do with the Kenshin OVA.  The Kenshin OVA is only 2 DVDs long, no more.  ADV films has made this confusing by giving the dubbed versions of the OVA and the movie the same title. (Which I shudder to every time I hear it).
First off, I'd like to state that I'm a huge Kenshin fan and I'd have to say it's the best anim series I have seen 'thus far.(And I've seen many in the past 3 years).  But for some reason the movie didn't live up to the TV series potential.
Why?  Well, in my opinion it was to much related to the OVA, plot twist wise, and there was to many politics.  Which brings me to another point.  If you watch the movie in spurts it doesn't seem to be that bad.  I watched it in one sitting the first time, felt in different, watched the movie a 2nd time in 2 or 3 sittings and actually liked it better.  Why?  I think it was because I wasn't having a political over load.
Over all if you're a huge Kenshin fan it's worth a peek, but I don't suggest buying it on DVD, maybe VHS(subbed o' 'course ^^x).  Stick to the OVA and the TV series and you'll be alright ~,^x",1001203200,8,1112,3.990950226244344

1397620,4,B000056HOW,"The Samurai X Motion Picture, sometimes known as the Rurouni Kenshin movie, takes slivers from both parts of the Rurouni Kenshin universe and combines them. This can be a surprise if you're not expecting it and can be a disappointment if you're not prepared.

For the most part, the animation style is based on that of the TV series, which is characterized by brighter colors and spiky hair. In addition, the characters are drawn from their incarnations in the TV show. This means that Kenshin is no longer the Battousai but rather a 'rurouni' or wanderer who will not kill, quite different from his OAV personality.

There are some portions where the animation resembles that of the OAV but this turns out to be merely one fight, inserted a number of times into different parts of the movie. There is little else that resembles the OAV though, which can be a disappointment for its fans. The movie takes place well after the OAV, with even the flashbacks to Kenshin as the Battousai coming after the events in the OAV. No set time is given for where it takes place in the TV series, if it even happened according to the series timeline at all.

The plot takes a while to get off the ground, struggling through the first 30 minutes or so. It does draw you in eventually, if you let it, but it feels like a bit of a let down from what you've come to expect from the TV series or the OAV. Kenshin has one serious fight at the end, leaving you feeling cheated. The plot resolution feels a bit weak as well, though they do manage to tie up the loose ends.

For those who are used to the voices in the English dub of the TV series, the voices in the English dub of the movie are not the same. The DVD offers the movie in Japanese with English subtitles or in English, which gives the viewer a choice. The art is slightly different from that of the TV series, though clearly based on it. It is more gory than the TV series however.

All in all, as a fan of both Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X, I found the movie to be a little bit of both. It didn't rate 5 stars because of the problems I felt it had, but it is still worth getting if you're prepared for the differences. The film still manages to present Kenshin with some beautifully done emotional conflicts and it's worthwhile to see how he reacts. It's not the perfect movie for either series, but it does share a little bit of both.",998697600,7,2381,4.329596412556054
1397621,5,B000056HOW,"Samurai X, The Motion Picture, is by far one of the most beautiful works of art I have ever seen. It shows the world through young sword master Kenshin's eyes, who fights for justice in hard times for Japan. But it is not easy for Kenshin, who vowed long ago never to kill again. Althought the movie is a bit gory, it shows what evil violence can bring, and only staying true to your heart can you bring an end to corruption and injustice.
Nudity: none Language: some, but no f-words Blood: lots and lots, (which, interestingly, changes from bright orange to deep purple.) I would personaly rate this 15 and up for violence.",998265600,,624,4.482456140350878

First of all, ADV, who released the OAV's went and released the Movie...without letting people know that the movie was based on the character personalitys of the origional seres. (released by Anime Works) The movie takes place somewhere in the storyline after the Kyoto arc of the TV series, which is quite a few years after the OAV's which took place at the end of the bakumatsu. (The revolution Japan underwent before the Meiji era began.) In the OAV (Trust/Betrayal released by ADV) Kenshin was a ruthless murderer.

1397627,4,B000056HOW,"I've read many reviews on this film at Amazon, and it seems that OVA lovers hate it, and the Kenshin TV lovers accept it.  I happen to appreciate BOTH series.  I like the OVAs (Betrayal/Trust) for the more cinematic/artsy style and non-googly face scenes of the TV series, plus the harsh, dramatic story (though quite bloody at times)and the dark style treatment for dark times.  The TV series (episodes 1-95) I appreciate because the violence is not as extreme and the stories are filled with drama, morals, and humor.
Now for Samurai X, the motion picture.  This, I believe, is a perfect blend of the OVA series and the TV series.  The artwork is more consistent with the TV series, as you see Kenshin's friends like Yahiko & Sanosuke, and Kenshin has the vibrant red hair & purple outfit.  It seems suitable to me because he is trying now to rid of his dark past (which had a darker look to it).  The only thing that made it difficult for me to get into this picture at first was the English dub; though I like BOTH the English and Japanese voices on the TV series, this movie, I thought, was TERRIBLE in the English voice department.  So I switched to the original Japanese track and was very happy to find the voices from the Japanese TV version.
The story of the film is great, the characters are dynamic and the action is excellent.  I read someone complain that they reused the open of the film 7 times throughout the picture... I was relieved to discover that each time they repeated they were not in their entirety, only mere images so it was fine and worked with the story... how could I FORGET about the OPEN?!  The open to this film is what made me purchase it right away.  Though the rest of the film doesn't have much of the feel or look as the open does (kind of like an OVA open, slightly watered down - but VERY well executed) it WAS a flashback of a different era.  I cannot rave enough about the opening sequence, but I'll stop to spare you.
I think each Kenshin series has something good for anime lovers.  The goofy faces / head bumps of the TV series is the only thing that has ever bothered me, but I get used to it.  Fortunately, Samurai X, the Motion Picture doesn't have that element.  Anyone think Toki & Kaoru look VERY similar?  Anyway, this was an excellent movie - give it a chance!

1397628,2,B000056HOW,"The two Samurai X videos released last year by ADV Films, titled ""Trust"" and ""Betrayal"", are two examples of an anime gone right - great story, great animation, great characters, etc. The story of Kenshin, a great swordsman, assassin, but more importantly, a kid. Literature could take a clue from this display of ""innocence to experience."" This 4 episode series is perhaps my favourite of all time.
Enter Samurai X - The Motion Picture, a standalone movie that some friends and I have been looking forward to ever since the two before mentioned tapes. Rather than repeat the synopsis, I'll just tell you what's wrong with it, and why you shouldn't buy it.
For starters, this is not the same animation studio that brought you the original. Instead of the gruesome, depressing, dark atmosphere that was the 4 episode series, now we see happier drawn characters and locale. Our heroes now sport the famous `embarassment bubble' that is found in corny anime such as ""Sailor Moon"" and ""Sakura Diaries"". Worst of all, we now see Kenshin sporting a pink outfit? If this is supposed to take place 10 years in the future, why does Kenshin look younger? Horrible - it boggles the mind at every turn.
The story isn't interesting. There is no plot twist, no interwoven storyline - nothing. There's hardly any action to keep you interested, mostly political talk that doesn't mean a damn. They'll play the same flashback scene from the introduction (the only good part) over 7 times during the course of the movie!
Let me finish with this - if you liked the 4-part OVA released by ADV Films, you will not enjoy this video. It will pain you to watch it. If you liked the TV series, you might like this.
