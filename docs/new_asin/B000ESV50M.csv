8114070,5,B000ESV50M,"I've used Brillantes' video in a few of my classes.  Students raise questions about their cultural commitments to medical practices and how we rarely live inside the categories of academic specialties.  I recommend Brillantes' work to anyone interested in cultural studies of medicine, health and power.",1159401600,,303,5.565217391304348
8114071,5,B000ESV50M,"The SHAMANS OF SIQUIJOR is a fascinating film! Particularly adept, is the way we watch the healers and the hopefulls participate, without any intrusive overview. It's as if we've come upon the village ourselves, and met up with this fascinating old (but not ancient, as it includes Catholicism) culture of faith. I found the mix of the indigenous and the Catholic especially interesting. The real people who come from all over the world, including the rural US, are absolutely fascinating. Brillantes knows how to let the story unfold.",1151884800,4,535,5.090909090909091

8114073,5,B000ESV50M,"Brillantes smartly leaves out voice over narration that often steers a documentary towards a particular point of view.  Instead, the filmmaker gives space to people's words and actions to tell the story.  One of the main characters of this film is the island of Siquijor itself which is shot both beautifully and truthfully, without romanticizing the setting.  This is an excellent introduction to a rich and little known topic that will leave you asking more questions.",1150675200,5,470,5.157894736842105
