7131735,1,B00WFN4MJK,"The movie shamelessly promotes KISS.  Scooby Doo and the gang are there as window dressing.  It's a KISS theme park.  KISS has super powers and sings.  KISS's manager keeps selling KISS labeled products to meet every need.  It's a KISS alternate reality.

I am a Scooby Doo fan.  This is the worst Scooby Doo animated movie I have watched.  I almost stopped watching it in the middle, but since I had just bought the movie, I pushed on through.  If I could return it and get my money back, I would.",1437091200,21,498,4.384615384615385

7131739,5,B00WFN4MJK,"Great to see the production team of Scooby Doo find a worthy project and really give it an A+ effort this time. KISS has always been a phantasmagorical explosion of color, comic book fantasy, Halloween masks, amusement park lights, pinball magic and it all comes together here in an off the wall story that fits perfectly into a Scooby mystery. Fans of both will find many in-jokes and other delights, the music will ROCK your world. Loved it...best Scooby movie yet.

7131750,5,B00WFN4MJK,"Been watching some Scooby-Doo Mysteries Incorporated lately. Saw a clip of this film on youtube and decided to rent it from the local library. I had a blast. So many references to KISS songs. Every time i look up info on this film i learn a new connection. The shameless merchandising band manager in this.... played by their real band manager!

You get lots of good animation and great music. The story is a far better version of the 70s film KISS did called KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park. That did not even have a phantom. This film is outlandishly fun. This is coming from an adult. If you like KISS or Scooby Doo you will probably like this one. I saw a different Scooby Doo film from just a few years earlier and did not care for it. This i really enjoyed.",1503187200,,766,4.2827586206896555

7131783,5,B00WFN4MJK,"Scooby-Doo! & KISS: Rock & Roll Mystery is an awesome feature for both kids, parents, and older brothers who grew up with both. I grew up on Scooby-Doo cartoons, like everyone my age did as a kid, and to this day still watch the adventures of Mystery Inc. when I can. I also grew up on KISS as my Dad was a huge KISS fan back in the day. My first concert was KISS in 2004 and in 2009 my Dad, brother, cousin, and I got to meet them before my second big concert. Scooby-Doo and KISS have always been in my life.

The Rock & Roll Mystery film is fun, entertaining, engaging, and just plain silly, but with enough ""in-jokes"" on both the Scooby and KISS side of things for parents and kids to be laughing along with the film. Plus, the music numbers are absolutely fantastic. I actually got this film on Blu-Ray because I was so excited about it's release, and boy was I not disappointed!

I actually watched it with my Dad, longtime KISS fan, and my younger sister, longtime Scooby-Doo fan, and we all had a good time for a little over an hour on one summer afternoon. Definitely worth a watch, and the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Set was great too with extra Scooby-Doo episodes as well as bonus material!

7131786,5,B00WFN4MJK,"After seeing another new Scooby movie just prior, this was a breath of fresh air. This seemed clever, and warm, and funny - by comparison. Even on it's own it is an entertaining and coherent story. There are two types of Scooby mysteries: 1) There's no such thing as ghosts; 2) There are ghosts. The modern ones explore either option more than past versions did. I found the anime homages amusing. The strong Sailor Moon vibes had me giggling because it's big strong guys (albeit in high heels, spandex, and makeup). There may have been hints of Dragonball or X-Men cartoons too. As someone who is not a fan of KISS I could still enjoy the movie because it was a good story where the gang helped solve a mystery with their guest stars. I even recognized one of the songs! I can also appreciate the smidgens of science. The date of Halloween was only a plot device - like when your town permanently cancels Halloween because kids will want to dress up like rockstars and instead you just have a harvest festival where everyone is served squash drinks and no one has any fun ever again.
Spoiler : How old is Daphne supposed to be? It detracted just a little that someone referred to as a kid in once scene ends up sharing her first on screen kiss with a rockstar instead of her boyfriend. Think that's why they named the movie Kiss?

It is all the normal scooby doo fair, but then halfway through it goes off the rails into surreal land reminding me of trippy cartoons like Heavy Metal (except this being kid friendly). The music is way over the top awesome, and the kiss characters aren't the placeholder characters typical in the movies. Actually I think they upstaged the scooby doo gang.

Since there hasn't been a new Scooby movie released, I just purchased for my 2 sons (ages 11 and 8). We were looking forward to but upon viewing were sorely disappointed. I give this one star for three reasons: (1) neither of my boys laughed once during the film and I found it equally dull, (2) this movie was more about KISS than Scooby Doo, and (3) the animation was not up to par with previous releases. Upon conclusion of the film: my 11 year old: ""that was lame,"" my 8 year old: ""that was horrible."" I concur. Save your money.

The KISS fans liked that there were a lot of KISS references that didn't suffer from being overexplained. Plus, it was fun to see how many references we could catch. Also fun-the KISS theme park, which had a bunch of rolling in laughter and/or awe at the creativity of the park. Having fun poked at KISS for their merchandising madness was a nice touch. And who better than the Scooby gang to solve a mystery at a theme park, as the gang themselves explain.

This is a definite good time as evidenced by how much laughter or ""oh, look at thaaaaaaat""  type comments were uttered. If you've got a KISS and/or Scooby fan, this is particularly enjoyable.",1455667200,5,783,4.507042253521127

My son loves how Scooby and Shaggy can overcome their fear and that the Mystery Gang always solves the mystery. While he watched I would ask him questions as to what he thinks the gang is doing and he would tell me his ideas. When I would ask why they would look for clues, who they are helping, and what they are trying to solve, he can tell me without any problems exactly what's been going on. Sometimes I ask what he would think the gang would do if they didn't find the clue and how he thinks the gang could solve the mystery. This would bring us to a whole what if's scenarios and turn it into a critical thinking exercise.

The movie basically starts with the mystery gang (sans Fred) in KISS makeup. Fred thinks the band is juvenile and nothing next to his favorite band. No spoilers but it is as awesome as you think it is.

Eventually the Gang strips makeup and searches for clues, only to team up with the mass marketed band. In a battle in a cosmic realm. Yes, it is fantastic. Yes, along the way ridiculous merchandise gets ads. Yes, the space battle is a mass LSD experience. What?! No, Gene reveals to Shaggy and Scoob it was real. Yes, Gene and Scooby lick each other with their monster tongues. And yes, KISS shifts into energy and fly away.

Fallen angels; portals to hell; freeing the devil.

OK, back to the DVD, I remembered there was a ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" [Halloween] episode with KISS in it. I was never a ""fan"" of KISS, but I thought they were OK. Paring these two entertainment entities with STRONG 1970s connections [hey, don't deny it!][:-)] is actually a cool idea after I SAW this.

This has the coolest opening title sequence EVER in a Scooby-Doo film -- to me anyway. The animation style is a break-away from the ""norm"" and is so much LIKE a 1960s/70s Art/House film! The amount of actual KISS songs used was just right. The Scooby Characters are just right. But they introduce another ""scenario"" [I don't want to be a spoiler for those who haven't seen it yet] that they have never used in a SD shows to date......at least to my knowledge which gives it a.....well ""freaky"" aspect. You'll know when you see it.

I normally don't care for episodes where they ""bring in"" [or ""drag in""] already existing people & characters from other places [like the ""Wrestling"" movie, but it's cool for what it is] but THIS film justifies having KISS in it.

This movie not only comes at a perfect time, as my 13-year-old and 7-year-old sons have become extremely interested in playing guitar, and shortly before this movie was released, they had both become enamored with KISS.

Not only has this movie become a regular feature in our house, my kids have become bigger fans of not only KISS and Scooby-Doo, but have also become more determined to try to play the KISS songs on guitar. Even my 4-year-old daughter loves the movie. The movie has a perfect blend of the two elements. It's not necessarily a KISS movie featuring the Scooby gang, nor is it a Scooby movie that features KISS. It's an equal representation of the two.

There's a little extra for KISS fans as well. There are numerous references to songs and albums throughout KISS' history, such as Detroit Rock City, Black Diamond, The Elder, Modern Day Delilah, Beth, Christine Sixteen, Destroyer, and many more. there's even a short, hidden throwback to Eric Carr (The Fox) and Vinnie Vincent (The Ankh Warrior).",1442966400,,1145,4.663366336633663

Typical modern day Scooby and gang cartoon, but it's loaded w/ KISS music, a TON of subtle and not so subtle KISS references, a a baddie that looks like a Marvel villain, plus the movie inexplicably,  blatantly rips off Jack Kirby at times. Srsly, blatantly.
The credits sequence is pretty amazing. I was impressed!
If you have fond memories of the awful TV movie KISS MEETS THE PHANTOM OF THE PARK, this is the movie that movie wanted to be but better. So much better.

I was delighted with the result. The movie features several KISS classics as the soundtrack, fantastic animation, and a wicked villain. The over-hyped marketing of KISS products was a hoot, as was Daphne's crush on one of the band. Those who grew up loving the original version of KISS will be pleased to know that none of the band is referred to by name, but rather by their stage personas; therefore, you're free to imagine it's still Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter (which I did!).

7131972,5,B00WFN4MJK,"This film has everything that we love about a classic Scooby Doo mystery and seamlessly marries it with a totally rockin' KISS adventure! Right from the start we have design maverick, Robert Valley's eye popping opening credits which are playfully punctuated by title cards featuring graphics by Michael Doret, the original graphic designer of KISS's Rock and Roll Over. In fact, fans of the band will be blown away by how many homages there are to their unique and unparalleled brand of showmanship, design iconography and innovative self promotion.

Producer/Director, Tony Cervone has taken Demon, Starchild, Catman and Spaceman and made wonderfully compelling, bigger than life characters that fit surprisingly well in the world of Scooby Doo. That said, these are more than just hand drawn renditions of the real band members. The film gives them a rich and complex backstory that begs for either a sequel or even better, their own spin-off series.

That said, Scooby and the gang aren't playing second fiddle here. Though never losing sight of their classic relationships, the filmmakers give the foursome some fresh dynamics. Fred's jealousy of Daphne's school girl crush on Starchild offers a fun riff on classic teen romance and veteran voice talent Grey Griffen imbues Daphne's flirtation with just the right amount of girlish enthusiasm and feminine wile.

There are also some notable guest stars including Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, Jennifer Carpenter, Gary Marshall and Pauley Perette, but for me, the biggest surprise came when the Elder speaks with the voice of Penny Marshall. I didn't think there could be more bridges to the nostalgia of my youth but these filmmakers have made a Scooby movie that never ceases to amaze.

7132008,5,B00WFN4MJK,"Content: Super-Awesome. Other than 1 or 2 of the McFarlane action figures and a handful of the McFarlane comic books, I really have never owned any of KISSs stuff. I neither loved nor hated their music, but admired their merchandising strategy and as someone who spent the 90s working in a Heavy Metal record store, we made sure to order every crazy KISS item we could.

But after watching this movie it is hard to not be a KISS fan. I found myself singing Rock N Roll All Night while cutting open the packaging. KISS songs are peppered throughout the movie and they all sound great. The cartoon versions of the band are thinner and younger than their real-life counterparts and possess super-powers. Everything the band does in this movie is mind-blowingly cool.

The Scooby Doo end of this movie is spot on and done to perfection. And when Shaggy and Scooby take The Demons advice, I cheered very loud because it was super-cool. Fred and Daphne have some great stuff with 2 love triangles involving The Star Child and the scientist lady that makes Fred pull out his creepy evil smile at one point. Velma gets some one-on-one time with The Spaceman as she grips tightly to hold on to her skepticism.

Only having read a few of the Psycho Circus comics, I am not sure what lore other comics created for KISS, but this movie expands the mythos surrounding the band in exciting, imaginative and fairly logical ways. The titles of Songs, Albums and more take on deeper meanings. The movie keeps pushing the boundaries on what you could possibly expect from it.

Bruce Kulick did tweet a post about how this movie does give a shout out to past members of KISS. There is a screenshot and if you are familiar with the lore of KISS, it is right there.

Special Features: Good. KISS Cut-Ups is just out takes of KISS doing some promotion for this movie. The finished version of which is not on this release. These bloopers are not really funny.

Are You A Scooby or a Shaggy? is KISS, Abby from NCIS and Jay & Silent Bob saying if they relate more to Scooby or Shaggy. Points to Thayer for his out of the box answer, even if he cant land on the exact name.

Trailers: Nothing new. Opens with Legos: DC Heroes: Attack of the Legion of Doom. (first seen on Tom & Jerry vs Jonny Quest) and Tom & Jerry vs Jonny Quest. In the Special Features section trailers for Scooby Doo vs WWE and Lego Dimensions which may be a video game, but the trailer features Joel McHale. (Amazon has 2 different trailers, one feat. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown.) (BTW DC Lego movies have more action and less dumb comedy than Star Wars Lego movies.)

Blu Ray special features also include 2 episodes from the 3rd season of Scooby Doo Where Are You (Part of the Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour) S03E04 To Switch A Witch and S03E11 The Diabolical Disc Demon.

Buy/Dont Buy: Yes. Buy. This movie does not disappoint in any way. I want more. This is a great format for KISS. Our passport to the KISS realm is the Scooby gang so KISS gets to be mysterious. I would love it if Warner Animation created a Hanna Barbera-style cartoon series for Cartoon Network with a group of Mystery Solving Teens who summon KISS whenever they find themselves in trouble. Like the Godzilla Power Hour with the trouble alert.",1437696000,5,3263,4.526315789473684

7132011,5,B00WFN4MJK,"I loved this movie.  I grew up on Scooby Doo and the original series was still the best in my opinion.  This movie does a great job trying to capture all the fun from those original cartoons.  The same set ups, Shaggy and Scooby becoming the bait, and lots of nods to the classic show.  However, you have to be a Kiss fan to really enjoy this.  The mystery and general plot is a nod to the cheesy movie Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park.  I love Kiss and enjoyed that movie as a kid so this new movie is all the things I loved rolled up in one.  Is it over the top?  Absolutely.  There is a mystery to solve but you also get a wacky sci-fi and fantasy plot as well.  The last few Scooby Doo movies have already incorporated plots like this before (ie the monsters and magic are real).  That's here too.  But it works.  Kiss, like in their old movie, are super heroes in a sense.  But it's a cartoon and it works.  I won't give the rest away, but if you're willing to suspend some disbelief, (hey there's a talking dog after all), and view it as a kid or a kid at heart, I think you'll have a good time.  There are three or four classic Kiss songs used in the chase scenes too.  All in all, this was a blast!",1437609600,,1208,3.98744769874477
7132012,5,B00WFN4MJK,"I uhhhh bought ...MY KIDS the Scooby DVD and we just watched it.

Disclaimers- fan since I saw HTH in the racks at 'Two Guys,' first album was RnROver (because $6 for ALIVE! was too steep), first show was July '79 at MSG... not a hater but Ace & Peter are strongly preferred, I dated their wardrobe manager and she (very thoughtfully- awesome person) got me several meets and peeks behind the curtain (guess I add that just to try and feel special about myself).
Also, I was always a classic Bugs Bunny/old-time violent WB cartoon kid and *hated* Scooby Doo.  Awful except for the Harlem Globetrotter one.  God, I hated Scooby Doo.
...I thoroughly expected to see a cheap, Tommy-and-Eric-heavy (or maybe a 100% Paul-&-Gene-ego-fest w/no irrelevant hired guns) production whipped up for a quick buck...all set in the despised, lame Scooby Doo world.

Wrong, wrong, wrong I was, was, was.

I missed pieces due to excited 4yr olds repeating the funny lines and jumping around like KISS, so I am sure there were cool winks'n nods to old fart fans like me which I missed in the 1st viewing.

The 85% I digested was hilarious and true to KISS- even an eeensy, semi-hater like me.
All eras were referenced in costume, make up or Album cover to some degree, nice Fox and Ankh image thrown in, the re-recorded tunes were great, Tommy & Eric got lots of lines and were a hoot, the 'Don't Touch My Ascot' was good (ala 'Happy Trails' or 'Big Bad Bill' by VH), and best of all; they poked fun at themselves throughout the story.

Doc McGhee, Darius Rucker, Natalie from 'Facts of Life,' Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith??  Awesome. (Doc really gets some great lines/digs in at the merchandising!)  Debra from 'Dexter'...a hot hottie even in animation.  Mama Mia.
And the, shall we say, ""ethnic"" stylings of Laver....err Penny Marshall and her dad was a brilliant stroke.  Where is a Totie Fields one-liner when you need it?!

Fantastic word play and the names of the female characters were genius.  Naming 'B' characters generic names could've been left to some 22yr old assistant or one of the Asian staff ....and who would've noticed?  But taking care enough and being involved enough to name people Christine, Delilah, Chikara, Beth, Shandi... nice touch, boys.  Nice touch.
The only trick they missed was to have Eric's lines done by Michael Bell (who did Pete's voice in KMtPotP).  That would've been kind of funny.",1437609600,,2403,4.726618705035971

7132022,1,B00WFN4MJK,"I have been a life long Scooby fan, and I even like kiss, but it's like mixing pizza and ice cream. While Shaggy might like that combo, it's terrible. I suppose if I were a huge kiss fan I'd really love it, because the theme songs are all kiss tunes, Gene's slithering tongue is a foot long, and they constantly poke fun at the band's hyper marketing and over the top antics. Animation is awesome.  But the mystery aspect falls very flat. Ok, here is the spoiler alert..... Introducing the villain as a real out of this world menace seeking the Band's black power diamond isn't in keeping with the spirit of the show IMHO. It's true they explain the cosmic realm as a mass hallucination, but obviously it's the heart of the plot and it's a waste of time watching because it's not well written, being ""filler"" with a long chase and redundant antics. In the end the solution to the crime was a dues ex machina with all of the clues being based on things that were never shown in the movie. Really lame. My nephews disliked it and lost interest after really trying to like it for about 40 mins.",1437523200,14,1091,4.374384236453202

I think Kiss must have written it.  My 8 year old Scooby Doo fan, however, LOVED it, and accused me of being a ""harsh critic."" So be prepared for a lot of sillyness, not a lot of sense, and lot's of Kiss songs. The animation is great, and the songs are pretty good (if you like Kiss, of course). If you have a die hard young Scooby fan, it's worth it. Otherwise, I'd skip this.",1437523200,4,531,3.9166666666666665

Most recent ones from camp scare and up. The second I watch one Im impressed and I count the days for the next one. I really hated frankencreepy and moon monster madness because animation was much lower quality and the movies were less entertaining. At least the voices were the same. This KISS movie that just came out I was thrilled about it but just didn't turn out great like all the others. The animation was pretty close to normal again but I didn't like how the kiss band had super powers the villain kept saying the same thing and they enter an alternate universe.

8713251,5,B00WFN4MJK,"I seriously can't believe I'm saying this, but ""Scooby-Doo and KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery"" might be one of the best Scooby movies ever.

After the goofiness of the WWE films, it's nice to see a crossover that's worth its weight on gold...or maybe patent leather boots. I'll admit...when I first heard about this movie I thought it would be goofy and pointless. I mean come on. Scooby-Doo and the gang teaming up with glam/metal band KISS? This sounds as cash-hungry as you can get. But after watching it? Wow! I was totally proven wrong!

So let me get this out of the way. The story is pretty generic and the mystery isn't that good. But that's not the point of the movie. What makes it great is the characters. In a way, it's as close to the original series as you can get, a mixture of the New Scooby-Doo Movies and 90s-era Zombie Island films where the monsters are real.

The comedy in the film is top-notch, some of the best to come out of a Scooby-Doo movie and Warner Bros. Animation in general. It almost feels like a longer episode of Freakazoid and Animaniacs (Please do a KISS crossover with these guys! Please, Warner Bros!). Deadpan delivery, vicious sarcasm, and overly violent slapstick make this movie well worth watching.

Another great factor is the chemistry between the characters, which has always made Scooby-Doo such a great series. Still, the filmmakers took liberties to make them relatable and pretty mean-spirited at times, which was refreshing for me. Fred has been turned into a conservative jerkface who gets some really snarky lines here and there. Daphne is an overbearing girl-child who is constantly flirting with Starchild. Velma is a know-it-all snob who is always delivering snappy comebacks like a boss. Shaggy and Scooby FINALLY aren't cowardly and don't obsess over food. Yeah, I know I'm nitpicking, but I love how the updated Shaggy and Scooby are brave and charming, just like the versions in the 70s.

Now let's get to KISS themselves. Are they represented well? Short answer: you bet. Seeing this film makes me wish KISS gets their own TV series or movie series, maybe in the DC Comics Universe. The band performs well, and I love how their newer music from Sonic Boom is used, rather than updated versions of 70s and 80s recordings. The Demon, Starchild, Catman, and Spaceman are sarcastic, grumpy, pompous, and fun-loving guys pictured as brotherly frat boys dressed in glitter and leather. And I'll give kudos to Paul Stanley for giving a SUPER funny performance. He really does steal the spotlight in this.

And the best and most important part? This film appeals to everyone. It's for KISS fans. It's for Scooby fans. It's for people who love both. It's for comic book fans. There's something in it for everybody.

Overall, it might not have the strongest story or greatest mystery, but this film is a pleasant, must-see surprise for anyone who loves KISS and Scooby-Doo.",1525392000,,2923,4.79920477137177
