8200819,4,B00000JZJP,"Okay so the main reason i bought this was for the Christian Death Vid. on here. Great quality vid for christian death and you get to see Rozz live. Most videos on here are cheaply made,or live performances, but what do you expect from goth groups, they don't have much money anyways. Some vids look like they are from the 80's. but over all its real damn good goth. If for nothing else get this for Christian Death. Its a must have for any Rozz Williams fan.

The only crappy thing about this is that Cleopatra records got cheap on us & put everything on just 1 disc, instead of the vids on one DVD & the 12 bonus songs on a separate audio disc. but for the money its not bad. all n all i recommend this to any goth kid.",1278201600,,720,4.070422535211268
8200820,1,B00000JZJP,"this is by far the most pitiful exemple of what goth is (goth by the way is an attitude, not a dress code kids...) whining no tallent bands that are videotaped live by what looks like a cellphone, and even if they were in a studio, the majority would still suck. the only group that was decent was Switchblabe Symphony but i alreghty have it.... the rest well, dissapointed isn't a strong enough word, but i'll use it to make my description easy to swallow.",1234915200,,457,4.3882352941176475
8200821,1,B00000JZJP,"I DJ three different Industrial/Goth clubs and playing videos is a part of what I do and I am always on the look out for videos as they are hard to come by! I was excited to get this and it had to be one of the worst music DVD's I have ever purchased!
First of all I really don't care too much for how good a video is as I understand goth/industrial bands are not rich and can't always make high end videos (they were all horrible anyway), however what I do care about is SOUND QUALITY. The sound on this DVD is just utter crap, I couldn't play one video off this DVD at the club, not one! Not only was the sound quality horrible the song/band selection needs a lot of help (for a DJ or club anyway) as they had to of picked the most boring songs possible for this!
As a fan of this type of music and a DJ who plays it, I would recommend hanging on to your money.",1067299200,11,863,3.909090909090909
8200822,4,B00000JZJP,"Not a bad collection.  Sure some of the stuff sucks, but what do you expect with a compilation.  The Switchblade Symphony video that starts it all off is a good one, and the only video that I've actually seen on TV.  Next we get The Wake slumming around in graveyards trying their best to look and sound like The Sisters of Mercy.  I was excited to see a video for Nosferatu's the Haunting, one of their best songs.  It mixes footage from the movie Nosferatu with some footage of them live.  The live performance is the most boring I have ever seen.  The band stands on stage like statues.  You'd think they wouldn't want this footage in a video, as it shows how lame of a show they have if you go to see them live.  The videos start to get really good with Deeper Blue by Ghost Dance.  Ann Marie (ex-skeletal family) and Gary Marx (ex-sisters) put on a great live show, and the song is very catchy.  The Lords of the New Church follow with an even better song and another fine live performance.  We then get The Chameleons doing In Shreds live.  The Skeletal Family have a good song, but a poor video.  It really looks like it was shot in one take, and the band doesn't even know what to do.  The last video worth watching is Corpus Delecti, who simply have to be seen live.  The rest of the videos are a bit boring, but hey, its a dvd, you don't have to watch it straight through.",1046995200,7,1382,4.217557251908397
8200823,2,B00000JZJP,"I have to say that I'm quite disappointed with this DVD.  It seems to come off as a sampler of videos that Cleopatra Records has managed to attain the rights to - perhaps due to contract agreements with the featured artists.  If this is true, then I'm sure that Cleopatra can offer much better than this.  The videos vary in quality and content from quite good to quite poor and subsequently a bit humorous.  I like perhaps 4 or 5 videos on here and consider the rest to be throw aways.  This might be okay if there was some sort of chronology here or perhaps interviews with some of the featured artists - but this is lacking as well.  Further, there is absolutely no information what so ever reagrding these videos.  What you get is just a DVD with a menu that allows you to select to watch the videos or listen to the audio tracks.  I suppose that I was expecting to get some information on the history or development of what is/was considered to be goth or at least some information on the featured artists.  For example, what incarnation of Christian Death is featured in concert here.  Rozz Williams is the vocalist and is pretty much the only focal point of the video.  His attire seems conservative and he is very well received by the audience.  This seems to be some sort of reunion between Rozz Williams and other members of the band - but you'd have to research on your own to confirm this as no information is provided here.  You do get 12 bonus audio tracks with the DVD - so I suppose the quantity of audio content may justify the retail price.  However, if one views this as an audio disk featuring some videos, then one must ask why didn't Cleopatra just put this out as an ECD?",985219200,4,1694,4.3706070287539935
8200824,4,B00000JZJP,"This DVD is a 'must buy' if you're a fan of ANY of the bands on the disc, simply because it contains video material which isn't available anywhere else. It's a bit of a mixture of old and new, good and really awful and is mostly live performance videos. The  video tracks are as follows: (1)Switchblade Symphony - Clown (2)The Wake - Christine (3)Christian Death - Romeo's Distress (4)Nosferatu - The Haunting (5)Eva O -Children Of The Night (6) Alien Sex Fiend - Ignore The Machine (7)Red Lorry Yellow Lorry - Spinning Around (8)The Prophetess - Avalon (9)Ghost Dance - Deeper Blue (10)Lords Of The New Church - Open Your Eyes (11)The Chameleons - In Shreds (12)Skeletal Family - Lost In Paradise (13)Executive Slacks - Fire&Ice (14) Usherhouse - Surrender Down (15)Corpus Delicti - Absent Friend. PLUS 12 bonus audio tracks selected from the Goth Box CD set. Personal highlights are:- the Nosferatu video which intersperses live footage with old horror movie (Nosferatu) clips, RLYL 's Spinning Around (live performance with audio overdubbed), The Chameleons live and Ross Williams, as he was, (a)live.",978652800,14,1104,5.032786885245901
8200825,3,B00000JZJP,"A companion to the ""Goth Box"" CD set, the DVD distributed by Cleopatra Records (who else?) is suited to the more serious Goth fans.  It features a mainstream debut of Switchblade Symphony's ""Clown"", as  well as old favorites like Christian Death and Alien Sex Fiend.  Most of  the video tracks are old and new favorites, but there is a kind of slump in  the middle.  3 or 4 tracks from bands like Chameleons U.K. seem more like  early 80's pop or punk rather than goth.  I would have liked to have seen  videos from the heavy hitters, Bauhaus, Fields of the Nephilim, ect.  Overall, if you're into goth, this is a must have.  Along with the 4 CD  music box set, this makes a perfect gift for the dark, freaky friends you  may have.",945993600,2,731,4.365671641791045
