They did a wonderful job animating the cartoons just like the books.  My child loves reading the books & then seeing the ""movie"". We have all the beatrix potter VHS. He is 5 and still will sit & watch them. WONDERFUL!",1324080000,,356,4.786885245901639
7934989,5,B000059XW4,My son (2.5 years) howls with delight when the naughty mice trash the doll house. He has seen this movie countless times and never tires of it. I find this series to be my favorite of all the various children's dvds that we own. It is so lovely and true to the books. The opening live action scenes are relaxing and so well done. I find this entire series (it comes in dvd as a set!) to be a pleasure for both children and parents. Highly recommended!,1302566400,,451,4.195402298850575
