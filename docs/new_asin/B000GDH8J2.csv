2605186,3,B000GDH8J2,"It's alright but it's so incomplete without the killer awesome original theme song ""I'm Always There"". It's dubbed with some second rate song. Yes, this isn't really season 1, it is season 2 and I do not like it that the last episode with Shauni and Eddie is not included in this DVD set which is when they get married. Lots of the other songs are dubbed too, I guess they are too cheap to pay the copyrights. I was really disappointed when I bought this 8 years ago. I did buy the video tape called ""Nightmare Bay"" and Thank God it includes the original theme song so since I have a DVD/VCR player I first play Nightmare Bay and then watch the DVD episode I want. The DVD versions are just so incomplete without ""I'm Always There"" and the ending song ""Current of Love"". Baywatch with David Hasselhoff, Erika Eleniak, Billy Warlock, young Jeremy Jackson or Hobie, and Richard Jaeckel and Tim McTigue were the best and glory days of this show. It was so sad when Shauni and Eddie left the show.",1437955200,,993,4.4021739130434785

Unfortunately, this season lacks the video quality which I would hope to have with the DVD version. The company made a straight copy without improving it. Overall a little disappointed.

2605198,2,B000GDH8J2,"This 1991-92 Season was okay and probably the best season of the revived BAYWATCH series since this season at least had Shawni(Erika Elenaik) and Eddie(Billy Warlock)from DAYS OF OUR LIVES & GENERAL HOSPITAL, but when Eddie and Shawni departed in the 1992-93 Season, this show seemed to have gradually lost its touch and was starting to become less and less interesting and more and more overrated along with the fact that this season didn't even have Craig Pomeroy(Parker Stevenson)from THE HARDY BOYS either.

Therefore this First Season DVD was only the 1st Season from the resurrected series of BAYWATCH that had returned in syndication after it tanked the 1st time since NBC had cancelled this show all of the sudden when this show took a huge tumble in the ratings in the Spring of 1990 after Jill Reilly(Shawn Weatherly)had died off due to Shawn Weatherly getting laid off from the show in March of 1990.

Now I realize that BAYWATCH was actually overrated all along when it was shown in syndication throughout its whole 10-year run and that the only real reason that kept this show running for so long was the female co-stars in their bathing suits and the girls in bikinis which was making this show become more like a tit show afterwhile since numerous guys used to tune in to watch this show every week just to watch sexy women run around in their underwear on the beach and basically nothing more, which was another thing that kept the ratings on this show up for so long and another thing that made this show the so-called most popular TV show in the world back then, but now I cant even stand this show anymore since I now realize it was overrated and that this show seemed to have become phonier and phonier and more and more unrealistic every year, especially since this show was running out of steam in the last 3 seasons which prompted David Hasselhoff(Mitch)to leave BAYWATCH since this show was no longer going in the right direction since more and more co-stars kept dying off one by one in the last few seasons, including Mitch and Lt. Stephanie Holden(Alexandra Paul), plus everybody on BAYWATCH was obviously getting tired too since all the co-stars were getting burned out on this show, especially David Hasselhoff especially since BAYWATCH had lasted way too long overstaying its welcome resulting in a big sink in ratings, especially after David Hasselhoff's departure from the show.

In addition; it seems like BAYWATCH has K.O.'d David Hasselhoff's acting career too since David Hasselhoff's showbiz career has gone downhill immensely since BAYWATCH cancelled for the 2nd time.

No wonder this BAYWATCH DVD season 1 box set has been discontinued and no wonder most of the BAYWATCH DVD seasons are being discontinued by its manufacturer.",1249776000,,2765,4.86411889596603

The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages.

After reading the reviews that it was really season 2, I took it back to the store and got my money back. Thank you to all of the reviewers out there. Now I am going to go the German Amazon site and buy yhem. At that site, season 1 is really season from the NBC network. Season 2, is the syndicated start of the series. And so on. They also have 9 seasons released. And not to worry, I am going to buy a region free DVD player on Bay. It will be worth it in the long run.

2605203,3,B000GDH8J2,I watched all 3 seasons and sometimes a little confused. I was really disappointed with them. At the beginning of the season it was almost as if I missed a whole season. There was nothing on Shawnie and Eddie wedding. The begining of the second season I remember Summer and Matt first meeting and that was not on that set. I did enjoy watching the episodes that I haven't seen in awhile because I am a big baywatch fan.,1176076800,,419,4.3164556962025316
2605204,2,B000GDH8J2,"Buyers, take heed. The series has been altered.

The series is indeed Baywatch, but they have taken out the opening song, ""I'm Always Here."" and closing song ""Current of Love"" both which were sung by David Hasselhoff.

I was looking forward to seeing this series again. But am disappointed that the music was tampered with. It's like taking the opening music out of the series CHiPs, or any other series that has it's signature opening.

And, as stated by other people, the seasons are being released out of order. And there are episodes missing.

If you want the series Baywatch, just to have it. Then get these. However, if you want the series in it's entirety, music included, then I would wait until they release the series correctly.

They need to go back to the drawing board on  this one. :(",1170547200,4,798,4.624113475177305
2605205,3,B000GDH8J2,Okay - did anybody actually buy this thing & keep it? Because I got it & Season 2 & by the looks of it Eddie & Shauni's wedding is on NEITHER of them!!!! Same with that storm drain episode where Hobie (Jeremy Jackson) pulls that prank & Mitch yells at him for it later on. They showed clips of all this in the episode where Mitch almost dies because he free-style dived too deep - but I haven't seen them & Eddie & Shauni aren't in Season '2' so how the Heck am I to see their wedding!?!?!?!?! Or is their wedding in the REAL Season 1??? And has anybody else's DVDs skipped like a VHS tape would when the tracking is off??? Please Help!!!!!,1168646400,7,640,4.128

This is actually season two and season two is actually season three as ""Summer"" never joined Baywatch till season three. Also season one has ""Jill"" character as well as ""Craig"" Parker Stevenson and the famous shark episode where one lifeguard gets attack.

I enjoyed the dvd however as the first three seasons were my favourite, would of liked season one to be the original though. Good to see Australia companies got it right. I've already pre-booked my order for the complete ""original"" season one.",1168300800,,571,4.767676767676767

2605208,4,B000GDH8J2,"Since DVD format came out I wondered when they would release series on it, and, off course, for me, growing up watching Baywatch, I wanted so much the series to come to DVD...

In Brazil, we only had a few seasons on TV, but it was enough for me to become a fan of the show: great mood, lots of sun, beautiful people and some nonsense stories!!!!

I mean, you can't take this series ""seriously"" !!! It's about relaxing after a day of stress,hard working or something like that and you just want to relax watching a nice show of people with no(almost!!!) problems, living on the beach, surrounded by beautiful people !!!!!!!!!

That's Baywatch, and I like it the way it is !

About the DVD release? Well, of course the original songs of opening and closing credits are missed, but to be honest after the 5th episode I get used to it !!!

It's nice to see this series again, I could remember a lot of things from the time when I watched, it's like a ""trip to memory lane"" when you see something from your past!

Anyway, I will buy all seasons as the keep releasing, highly recomended if you are simpathetic to what I said about the show, otherwize, not recomended!",1168300800,,1162,4.381395348837209
2605209,1,B000GDH8J2,"I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.

Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.

The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.

2605213,3,B000GDH8J2,"It was great to see some of the episoids that I haven't seen uncut in more than 10 years; unfortunately, whoever has packed this DVD collection made some critical mistakes.  First of all, the episodes that are in this season 1 collection are not actually from season 1.  In fact, I believe that they are actually from season 3.  In the actual season 1, there were the episodes that in addition to David Hasselhoff, Billy Warlock, and Erika Eleniak also starred Parker Stevenson, Brandon Call, Peter Phelps, and Shawn Wetherly.  I'm sure all Baywatch fans remember the episodes that I'm talking about like the JetSki Murder, Earthquake, Mitch's Hangliding Accident, Shawni's abusive boyfriend, Jill's Death by Shark, and many more.  To make matters worse, whoever recorded these episodes has changed most if not all of the music including the opening credits.  In some cases, it doesn't really matter, but in others for instance the episode ""Thin or Die"" where scences were originally cut to fit the music that was originally there, and now it just doesn't quite work as well as it used to do.  Other than these two mistakes (big though they may be), like I said before it's great to see them again.",1164412800,3,1198,4.814634146341463

2605215,1,B000GDH8J2,"As a big Baywatch fan, I resisted dubbing some old VHS Baywatch in lieu of awaiting the DVDs. And while I heard there were some changes, I decided to give the first set a try anyway. But anyone who remembers the episodes from TV will no doubt be very disappointed. The new music is terrible - canned music that all sounds like the same song. Not even Hasselhoff sings, and he produced the show to begin with! I can live with a couple missing episodes, and a few music changes, but nearly ALL the music has changed, and very much for the worse. And, the quality of the video is not nearly as crisp as it should be, especially ""Panic at Malibu Pier"". I will not buy any more of these season sets, and will look to the UK to get uncut, original versions, or dub my own VHS copies to DVD instead. Even for 20 bucks, its a big waste.",1162339200,19,828,4.149068322981367
2605216,1,B000GDH8J2,"BUYERS BEWARE!  As you may have noted from other reviewers here, this is NOT the true first season of Baywatch, but rather the first season of Syndication after their were cancelled by NBC and Hasselhoff worked to get the money to syndicate.

But that's not the only reason to avoid this release of the Baywatch series.  The well-known main-title theme has been replaced with some cheap piece of music that does not suit the series at all.  I love and miss the original theme; that was half the pleasure in the show.  The same with the rest of the great music from the show.

Also they've completely left out the first 2-part episode, ""Nightmare Bay"", billing it as a so-called complete 20-episode premiere season.  Don't make me gag.

Apparently, if you end up wasting you're money on the entire 10 syndicated seasons of this release from FirstWatch Studios, you do eventually end up with the first Network seasons, as they are included as bonus episodes in each season.  This first season includes the series network pilot, ""Panic at Malibu Pier,"" which aired  originally on April 23, 1989 and the first episode from the actual season, ""In Deep,"" which aired Sept 22, 1989.

Fortunately, I only rented this from Netflix.  Apparently the series has been properly released in Europe and is available in Region 2 format from Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de for those of you with multi-region players.

Please stay away from and protest this FirstWatch Studios release of Baywatch and petition the powers-that-be to release the series properly in North America.  If you really need your Baywatch fix in the meantime, look for reruns on tv or rent it from Netflix.",1162339200,24,1656,4.867857142857143

Network are a small independant company but they release some really good classic tv shows mainly uk stuff all intact just like they were shown on tv which is what we all want. I for 1 would rather pay more and get unedited box sets so its with deep dissapointment ive canceled all 3 of my reigon 1 baywatch season sets and am opting for the network uk box sets.
They are reigon 2 so please be aware of that if you do purchase but you won't be dissapointed if you do i buy a lot of reigon 1 stuff as it just doesnt get released here in reigon 2 so im lucky to have a multi reigon dvd player don't know how common they are in the us but you can pick them up here quite cheap. Its just a shame the us distributor is treating such a great show so poorly.

UPDATE AS OF OCTOBER 2007:

In my quest to get baywatch on dvd for my collection i have discoverd that the german amazon site has all seasons  on dvd right now for around 35 euros each set now according to reviewers on the uk site the packageing appears in german but  the audio is in english confused ? i know i have been about this series the uk distributor had season 2 out last year then it never happened it was pulled and no news there on that the us distributor has only put out 3 seasons so what do you do i for 1 cant wait no longer and have ordered season 10 from the german site if this when it comes is in english and has all episodes in tact then i for 1 am buying the whole series i can put up with german packageing if i can watch every episode in tact. its quite funny really that this show has the record of the most watched tv show in history around the world but you cant buy it appart from in germany who was one of the partners that help financed the show along with tv companies from the us and uk why cant neither of them get it right when the germans can?? if this sample set ive ordered is the real deal then im selling my uk season 1 set and buying german!! will keep you updated when the set arrives.

UPDATE:

Season 10 arrived today and yes the packaging is in german writing but it comes with a little episode guide booklet with the episode titles in english aswell as german the dics are all single sided and packaged very nicley in a fold out design with cardboard slip case but most of all you can choose german or english language  so i have now ordered all 10 seasons remaining and the price works out at 26.00 uk or 35,00 euros per season cheap if you compare the uk season 1 boxset which is currentley selling in hmv in uk for 40! buy these sets you will not be dissapointed",1161475200,10,3236,4.06269592476489

2605219,4,B000GDH8J2,"I really am confused over this release....

I had also read that season 1 is actually season 2 and that each release will contain episodes from the ""real"" season 1. Once you have collected the whole series, you will have the complete season 1 and can purchase a box to put the discs in...

So, in looking at netflix and the shows listed on the individual discs, they do not have Nightmare Bay 1 & 2 (first 2 episodes from season 2)listed at all... On disc 5, they have Panic at Malibu Bay (don't even know where that one came from) and In Deep (which is the first episode from the real season 1).

If we are supposed to collect the last disc from each season to build the ""real"" season 1, why have other episodes on that disc as well? Doesn't make sense at all.........

They should have just started with Season 1.......sounds like they are just trying to make more money with this scheme....

After all, it's all about the buck......

2605220,1,B000GDH8J2,"Let me first say this is complete BS. First look Studios needs to learn how to count! Season 1 is NBC! and in my opinion the BEST season of BAYWATCH! Baywatch aired on NBC Friday nights at 8pm up against ABC's TGIF and Full House, I still can't stand that show. First Look has decided to call season 2 season 1??? and for us die-hard NBC Baywatch fans call that season the lost or pilot season. First look is including a bonus disk with the original season 1 NBC episodes on it just a few though. So in order to have the original Season 1 NBC episodes you have to buy every Baywatch DVD box set they release to have one!!! Thats BS!!!!!!!!! Do they think NBC Baywatch won't sell so they have to do this to us? Have you ever heard of a Studio doing this! Hum Lets just skip that season and call it this and just release the next season? This has got to be the most $%#@&* things ever to happen as far as tv shows getting released on DVD. You people at First Look can go to %$#&!!!! I will just buy the PAL season 1 DVD release atleast they know which season is which!!",1160265600,6,1067,4.085714285714285
2605221,4,B000GDH8J2,"**Buyers looking for the real first season beware!  As indicated by other reviewers, this is NOT the true first season of Baywatch originally aired by NBC, but rather it begins with the next season.**

IF the production details listed above are correct, then this is the true, first season of Baywatch which initially premiered on NBC back in 1989.  One of the reasons that I believe this to be true, is because the cast list corresponds with the NBC production.  Most of the cast was scrapped after the first season.  Only David Hasselhoff, Erika Eleniak, Billy Warlock, and Gregory Allan-Williams remained for another season. If I am wrong, and the production details are incorrect, then I will pass on this ""first"" season.

To me, this is the only season of Baywatch that is worth watching.  The acting and stories are much better than what you'd find in the subsequent seasons.  While it's true, that the show flaunted female parts, it did focus, to some degree, on the lives and jobs of lifeguards of L.A. County.  Granted, they took some liberties with these roles, as you often found Mitch and his then friend, Craig Pomeroy (Parker Stevenson) employing themselves as crime-stoppers as well as lifeguards.

You even had such veteran actors as Monte Markham playing the authoritarian Captain Don Thorpe, who always took his job as a lifeguard captain very seriously, and usually at the expense of all junior lifeguards around him.

I think in some regards, the reason the show was so much better, was that they had a bigger budget to work with, being initially with NBC.  NBC was also interested in making sure that along with the ""extra skin"" that the show might be used to inspire saftey-consciousness as well.

First season sees Mitch battling his ex-wife for custody of Hobe (who was then played by Brandon Call).  Call was brilliant in the role, and I felt that Jeremy Jackson wasn't as good in the seasons that followed.

Also, Mitch was NOT revealed to be an ex-Navy Seal.  While buddy, Cort (John Allen Nelson) was later added to the cast, he was the only one who was considered a former SEAL.  As the personal history suggests from this season, Mitch has been a lifeguard for a long time, perhaps going back to high school, along-side best friend, Craig Pomeroy.

Eddie Kramer (Billy Warlock) was a rookie lifeguard, alongside Shaunie McClane(Erika Eleniak). Eddie was the hot-headed kid from the wrong side of Philadelphia who loved to spend his free hours boxing.  The writers of the show quickly saw that the ""meat"" of their storyline was the relationship between Eddie and Shaunie.  Several episodes had storylines surrounding the romance.  Warlock and Eleniak eventually became engaged in real life.

The cast also included Peter Phelps (Trevor) who played a rogue, Australian lifeguard.  He left the show halfway in.  Parker Stevenson played Craig Pomeroy, a veteran lifeguard who is torn between being a lifeguard and being a lawyer.  His wife, Gina, was played by Holly Gagnier.  Finally, there was also Shawn Weatherly (Jill Riley) who was another veteran lifeguard who was famously killed off by a shark attack in the middle of the season.

NBC cancelled the show after the first season.  The final episode included a marriage proposal by Eddie to Shaunie.  Obviously after the show was given the ""go ahead"" by a new network, many of the storylines and origins were either removed altogether or altered in some way.

Mitch's budding teenage son, Hobe, was reverted back to a young boy of about 10 or 11.

Eddie and Shaunie's proposal was pretty much ditched.  Eddie would propose again toward the end of the next season.

Craig Pomeroy would be written out of the show altogether.  One can assume that he quit.

The show as actually good during this first season before it went ""playmate"" crazy.  This is the only season that I'm interested in purchasing.  For me, Baywatch began and ended after its first season.",1160006400,22,3938,4.867669172932331

season being released was not actually

the first season. I read on another

web site that is was actually the first

season. I also checked out Bestbuy's web

site since they also have and episode

list with each season set that you buy.

They also have the orginal first season.

I hope they are right because I really only

liked the first 3 Seasons.",1159833600,,394,4.361111111111111
2605223,4,B000GDH8J2,"Be aware that this ""1st season"" is actually the first season Baywatch was in ""Syndication"".  It is not actually the first season of Baywatch.  Before Baywatch was in syndication it aired for one season on NBC.  Unfortunately, from the news I have heard on tvshowsondvd.com, you will only be able to get the real first season from buying all of the Baywatch season sets (they say there will be a bonus disc in each box set featuring episodes from the NBC season), which is a bummer if you lost interest after a few years like I did and don't want to buy every season. Oh well, maybe they will change their mind and put out the real first season for people to buy who don't want to buy every season.  Amazon has not mentioned this bonus disc on their page so maybe the studio has changed their mind from the original posting.
 Overall this season of Baywatch (season 1 on the box but really season 2) is a good season.  It had my 2 favorite characters Eddie and Shauni, who were only on for the first 2 seasons as well as Mitch and a new little Hobie (the original Hobie from the NBC season was hired for Step by Step and therefore didn't return for the second season, Jeremy Jackson was hired instead).

8130835,4,B000GDH8J2,"Baywatch has been around for a long time, however, in my opinion, the only seasons worth watching are the ones with Billy Warlock, and Erika Eleniak in them. I believe they both were only in the first 2 or 3 seasons before moving on to other things. If you like beach scenes, and lifeguards, you will love this series. They always had some small side plot to try and keep things different from one episode to the next, however, nobody watches Baywatch for the plots. At least not in the first few seasons. later it seems it was all about plots, and nothing about saving people or working towers.",1489622400,4,595,4.467889908256881
