8471846,5,B001AR4KDK,"Can't tell you how exciting it was for me to see that Jeff Linsky has cut an album. Discovered him about eight years ago. About four years ago my friend's house burned down, along with my Jeff Linsky's CDs!! I speak as a Brazilian, Jeff has a Brazilian soul. Over the years his sound has only gotten more soulful and seductive.

Muito bom.",1236038400,,339,4.380952380952381
