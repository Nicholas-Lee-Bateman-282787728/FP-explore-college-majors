7733396,5,B01E9D9N92,"Every now and again we are fortunate enough to witness  genius - the cast and the writing make this one of those moments. I honestly didn't want this show to end, and because of that, it felt a little rushed. That said it was wonderful that the cast of this marvious show was able to come together to give the show's fans a bit of closure. It will be missed!",1466380800,15,358,4.114285714285714
7733397,5,B01E9D9N92,"As others have said, this was a wonderful and fitting end to this one of a kind show. I love British comedy and this has been one of the best in my opinion. I have to say that watching Iwan Rheon's final episode in Game of Thrones, and then his final episode in this show an hour later was odd emotionally.",1466380800,12,306,4.032786885245901
7733398,5,B01E9D9N92,"FINALLY something happy and heartwarming on t.v.! I LOVE this show and EVERYONE that stars in it. ALL of the actors are excellent.
That being said, this episode wraps it all up making me feel like I have just said good-bye to some very dear and much loved friends. I was so hoping it would get renewed. We get to see how everyone's lives turn out. I was so happy no one died or anything. You might want some kleenex! I cried and cried! I will miss this show a lot. I have purchased all the D.V.D.'s and watch them about every 3 months!
I wish the cast well and hope they get new shows so  we can still be entertained with their wonderful talent.
Thank-you, thank-you to all of you for bringing me joy in the worst time of my life. I lost my husband of 40 yrs., my best friend, my cat, my Mother, my daughter and my sister in the past 2 years. I escape the depression I'm in when I watch this show. Again, thank-you.
God bless all of the actors and I hope many good parts come your way and we see your beautiful faces back on the screen real soon!",1466294400,41,1046,4.077669902912621
7733399,5,B01E9D9N92,"In a week that began with the murders in Orlando, it is a mitzvah that VICIOUS ends as a life-affirming story about two men and the aftermath of their wedding after 50 years together.

7733423,5,B01E9D9N92,I hope they will do another season or at least another episode. I know it says Finale but in show biz nothing is ever really final.

I didn't like any of the story lines, the dialogue was weird and artificial and the actors seemed rushed and uncomfortable on set.  So, I re-wrote the entire thing with new story lines and full dialogue for each character.  I originally stumbled across the Vicious series on my local PBS station one night and set the DVR to record the entire show.  It is one of my favorite shows and I watch it all the time... except for that awful final episode.  The writing was excellent, the acting superb, the interview clips with the actors at the end of each episode was a very special treat!  In fact, it was during one of the interviews that I learned that Game of Thrones was an actual television show and not something played on an xbox....go figure.  All in all, I think it is one of the best productions ever....a sweet and funny gem of a show that I will always love.  My sincere thanks to everyone involved in the series.

When Ash tells Freddie and Stuart goodbye, it brought tears.  Marcia Warren as Penelope, and Frances De La Tour as Vi get special notice as giving great support Anyone who enjoys british sitcoms will like this the most.",1470528000,2,348,4.507936507936508
7733486,3,B01E9D9N92,"The is our good-bye to the irascible couple of Freddie and Stuart. The goodbye takes place over a year, with little story lines for Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. I think it suffers for that, because that's less than 15 minutes to set up each of the four story arcs. That said, there is still comedy and one-liners. It returns to the vicious-ness of Series 1, but it is not as funny as either 1 or 2 (series 2 was the funniest). I hate to write this, because I enjoyed Series 1 and 2 so much, but The Finale is rather mediocre for me, 3.4 stars rounded down to 3.

SPRING
Stuart and Freddie are able to go on a shopping spree with funds from an inheritance. Freddie can't help himself, saying, ""Once you have money, you really notice how revolting everyone who doesn't have it is.""

SUMMER
It's Freddie's birthday. He is more than pleased to receive a card from the cast and crew of Downton Abbey. Remember? He carried potatoes spectacularly in a scene.

AUTUMN
Freddie wonders if he should get a facelift, and demonstrates that he has a lot of face to lift. I'v written before, that Ian McKellen's face is like its own character. More important, Ash is considering going to college in New York City. Stuart is appalled, ""But it's filled with Americans.""

WINTER
The Christmas tree is up, and everybody gathers to hear Freddie's newest acting job, a radio drama with Dame Eileen Atkins.

This isn't a Series 3 as it is just one show less than 60 minutes long without commercials. In a turnaround, ""Vicious  The Finale"" originally aired in the United States in June 2016. It won't air in the UK until December 2016, as a Christmas special. The DVD of ""The Finale"" is recorded in widescreen with English SDH subtitles available. There are no DVD Bonus Extras.

Farewell Freddie and Stuart. It ends on a lovely note, with Stuart murmuring, ""I'm so happy.""

7733487,5,B01E9D9N92,"The entire series is great. I bought the Finale sight unseen and have no regrets doing so. It is a nice way for the story lines to end. Sad to see ""Vicious"" go, but this is a good finale for everyone.",1470268800,2,200,3.902439024390244
7733488,1,B01E9D9N92,"Excuse me? Am I to understand that the final episode of Season Two is NOT included in The Season Two box-set? But that we have to buy it separately...at roughly the same price as a full season? May I say a very polite F*** Y** to PBS for so blatantly gouging the fans of their show. At a point when shelf space is at a premium (especially for those of us who are still buying [vs. streaming] shows, this is the last kind of nonsense we need.",1470096000,7,441,4.080459770114943

7733492,5,B01E9D9N92,Glad to own the last of this gem of a show. Have had less than one month and play over and over with seasons one and two. Is my favorite sitcom out there is most entertaining. Am sorry PBS removed this from TV fans  on a silly bases not for all views when there is so mush sex and filthy talk on on TV already on sitcoms in america and no program warnings for children. So I don't accept there explanation for taking it off PBS. Seller gave 5-star rating for shipping of this DVD and offering fair price.,1469491200,6,504,4.090909090909091

7733494,5,B01E9D9N92,"I loved this movie on PBS recently! Decided to buy it on Amazon.com instead of PBS.com because PBS.con was $10.00 more for the same DVD! I have enjoyed this DVD of the Finale of Vicious series and I also have from Amazon.com bought the other Vicious shows in only two DVDS! Highly recommend them to watch! I have a good time laughing, even though the actors are rude to each other!",1468540800,2,381,4.380281690140845

7733497,5,B01E9D9N92,This was great series finally wished it lasted longer but two years is still great.  The final episode ties a ribbon on it all and to prove life goes on even when changes occure. Great series although gone to soon,1468022400,4,213,4.325
7733498,3,B01E9D9N92,What a sad way to end a fine series especially when season 2 opened so many possibilities. There are 4 scenes of varying quality but all could use editing but they looked rushed into production. It's a pity the it was PBS that decided to cancel the series as both stars said that they looked forward to season 3. There are also no extras.,1467936000,4,338,4.296875
