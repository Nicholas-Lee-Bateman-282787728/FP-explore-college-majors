1204335,5,B00000F4EO,"John Wycliffe was among the earliest of the reformers.  This film is a good account of his work,and has some wonderful scenes that show what  Engand and Europe were like when he started the work that would be, before Luther, the seeds of the Protestant Reformation. Each scene is well done, and there is a nice flow of sequence.  The acting is not overdone, but very good. The trial is, as in the case of the film John Hus, excellent to show why change was so needed.",1174003200,,467,4.344827586206897
1204336,4,B00000F4EO,"If interested in bible history this is a 5 star, good information presented; however it you are looking for entertainment you would be very dissatified. Very slow moving and could be hard to hold some people attention.  I personally love the movie.",1168300800,3,248,4.904761904761905
1204337,4,B00000F4EO,"JOHN WYCLIFFE is the first in Vision Video's Reformation series that includes John Hus, The Radicals: The Anabaptists, Martin Luther, and God's Otlaw: William Tyndale.  The movie begins with written paragraphs of contextual background that scroll much too fast to read, but say that it's England in the 14th century, 1/3 of Europe's dead from the Black Death, resources are drained due to the 100 Year War, the suffering peasants are restless, and the powerful Church has departed from the Bible in both doctrine and practice.  Then the drama begins (and it is a drama, not a documentary), with Wyclif's bones being dug up for posthumous burning as a boy looks on with his father, John Purvey, through whom the Wyclif story is told in flashback as Purvey recounts Wyclif's life to his son.  (Purvey was a former student of Wyclif's at Oxford and later worked with Wyclif on the Bible translation, but under persecution recanted of his involvement.)

Unlike other reformers who had to flee, Wyclif (or Wycliffe) remained in his home country, though exiled from Oxford, so this story doesn't have some of the dramatic adrenaline rush scenes that other Reformation movies have.  Rather, the movie's strength is in its historically faithful representation of a compassionate, bold and brilliant pioneer of the Reformation who challenged Church doctrine and practice some 130 years before Luther.  His influence spread beyond England as his return-to-the-Bible ideas were taken by followers to Bohemia inspiring John (Jan) Huss, who was martyred upon order of the Council of Constance meeting some 30 years after Wyclif's natural death and which also ordered Wyclif's bones dug up and burned.  His advocacy of an English Bible for the average person was foundational in motivating and setting the stage for the English Bible dramas that ensued in the next 2 centuries, with Tyndale's Bible smuggling and martyrdom, the Geneva Bible popularity, the KJV, etc.

The movie's lead actor, Peter Howell, gives a fine, believable performance as Wyclif, and even resembles in appearance the woodcut prints of the reformer.  Another important movie character is a fancily-dressed man, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster who pops up repeatedly and was actually the son of King Edward III, and for this reason was influential in protecting Wyclif somewhat--at least until Wyclif moved from early criticisms of the Church to more specific and extreme calls for reform, such as stating that the doctrine of transubstantiation (that the eucharist is Christ) was a later unbiblical doctrine added by the Church.

The movie emphasizes Wyclif's heart for the poor and his high view of both the authority and power of the Bible that led him and his followers to translate the Bible (from Latin into average man English)during Wyclif's blessing-in-disguise banishment from Oxford.  The Word was then disseminated through Wyclif's itinerant poor preachers.  The movie, educational and inspiring as it is, probably would be too long and boring for most children's attention spans, although there is a brief summary of Wyclif that is included as a Special Feature of the DVD.",1161820800,38,3145,5.181459566074951
1204338,5,B00000F4EO,"I have to admit that the name of John Wycliffe was no more than vaguely familiar to me before watching this film - this is unfortunate because here is a man who deserves to be honored in the hearts of all English-speaking Christians.  Dubbed ""the morning star of the Reformation,"" Wycliffe attacked the corruption of the mother church with great courage and spiritual determination - and he did this in the 14th century, well over a century before Martin Luther and others ushered in the Protestant Reformation.  The life of this religious scholar and champion of the common people is a truly inspiring one.  Wycliffe, born in 1324, died in 1384 but his guiding spirit still lives and thrives today.

The church feared and despised Wycliffe.  From his academic post at Oxford University, Wycliffe penned a number of controversial books criticizing or condemning church doctrines, developed a set of scholars among his students and sent them out to spread the true word of God, and truly brought the word of God to the people.  The church put him on trial on three different occasions for heresy (the third taking place while he was on his death bed), but important supporters such as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and the Queen Mother helped him maintain his position and continue his work in the critical years of his life and career.

This was a dramatic period in history.  The Black Plague was still a fresh memory across the land, the Hundred Years War was exhausting the country's resources (the English peasants saw their suffering increase year after year and staged a failed revolt in 1831 - the church saw the rebellion as a consequence of Wycliffe's dangerous teachings), a child sat on the throne of England, and - during Wycliffe's most productive years - the Catholic Church itself was split along geopolitical lines, with one pope in Rome and a rival pope in Avignon.  This film basically starts out with the second of Wycliffe's trials, and the corruption and greed of the church is clearly shown in the words and deeds of Wycliffe's opponents.  Wycliffe railed against such corrupt practices as the issuance of indulgences, insisting that salvation could not be bought.  He criticized the church for hoarding its great wealth (it owned a third of the land in England) and ignoring the increasingly destitute lives of the people.  His greatest heresy came later, however, when he felt God's call to translate the Bible into the English language and thus give the people access to God's Holy word.  It seems unbelievable today, but the church regarded the translation of the Bible into the ""vulgar"" tongue and its presentation to the people as the greatest heresy of all.  The Church zealously guarded the Bible as its own property, believing the ecclesiastical order alone capable of understanding the word of God.  Despite the persecution he faced, Wycliffe and a number of his former students completed the translation and defied the church by taking it to the people.  In short, Wycliffe's work did much to help set the stage for the Reformation of the 16th century, particularly in England.

This is an excellent video, and Peter Howell gives an impassioned yet beautifully subtle performance as John Wycliffe.  I am not sure how closely the movie follows the actual timeline of the great man's life, however, as the character in the film looks much older than the historical figure who lived only sixty years and the bulk of Wycliffe's achievements seems to be densely packed into a short period of time.  Still, Wycliffe's greatness, commitment to God, and undaunted courage shine throughout the 75 minutes of the film.  This is a marvelous, truly inspirational film, and Christians in particular will get something much more worthwhile than entertainment value out of it.",1117497600,110,3798,4.9418238993710695

1204540,5,B00000F4EO,"As the opening explains: ""In the fourteenth century, the medieval world is ending and the modern world is not yet born.""

Oxford is a leading university of Christendom and Wycliffe is the leading scholar of Oxford. This film presents one reason for the modern world, Wycliffe and his Bible.

Two important reasons are presented for Wycliffe's impact,
1) His deep scholarship and devotion to the Bible
2) His life of personal integrity and warm affection for people.

The academic world of Oxford admired Wycliffe and protected him for decades. John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, protected him also, perhaps with political motives along with religious ones. His ""aclocytes"", as his enemies called the Lollards, went throughput England preaching the word of God. Before he died, they carried the first translation of the Bible into English.

Students at Oxford from Prague copied all Wycliffe's writing and carried it upon returning, (much of Wycliffe's writing is now only found at the state library of Vienna). Hus and Hussites influenced Europe for centuries. Luther was affected. The modern world is beginning.

This story presents some the the controversial teachings that Wycliffe developed.
1) Spoke against the custom of assigning ""forgein churchmen"" to high paying jobs on England. However, they did not ever arrive! Nevertheless, collected the wages for decades!

2) The church owned one third of England. He said Christ lived in poverty and the churchmen should copy that example.

3) Wycliffe said ""Transubstantion"" (priest changes bread to the flesh of Christ) is untrue and unscriptural. In this film, he explains that this idea was unknown to the early Christians. In fact, his research found this teaching is only two centuries old!

4) All Christians can and should read and understand the Bible, in their own language.

5) Poor and rich are equally important in the eyes of God.

This was explosive. In fact, the peasant rebellion at this time was laid at Wycliffe's feet. All these new ideas of Wycliffe reduced the status, wealth, power, and influence of the clergy (interesting to realize, that Henry VIII, about one hundred and fifty years later, implemented many of Wycliffe's ideas).

He was forbidden to teach at Oxford. So he went to small town of Lutterworth and translated the Bible into English. Started the tradition of the ""dissenters"" and the ""independents"", who have had so much influence on English history. Also laid the basis for Tyndale.

Story finishes with workmen digging up his bones and burning them, putting ashes into the river Swift. This is real hatred!

Outstanding review of Wycliffe and his life. I only wish it was longer than eighty five minutes. Wycliffe's life and work is facinating and inspiring.",1454371200,12,2748,5.120805369127517

I recently showed this to a group of students age 8-13 on Reformation Day. I was a little afraid that I might lose their attention or interest or that the story line might shoot a little over their heads. However, I found that they enjoyed the video and seemed to grasp the historical events that it depicts.
I don't know of any other video that offers such a clear, inspiring, and engaging view into the life and times of Wycliffe.",1415404800,4,706,4.701612903225806
1204621,5,B00000F4EO,"Although the acting is just a tiny bit stiff and the story comes in somewhat disconnected packages, like a series of episodes, it greatly succeeds in taking you back to John Wycliffe's time and showing you how that man thought.  His enemies are also well-presented - not just ""the bad guys"", but real people. We can see how they think, too.  It leaves us inspired.  The lesson is, if you really believe something - stick with it!

In addition to not staying entirely true to all the facts, they make a biased assumption to say that his success was due his scholarship and made no consideration to the Holy Spirit or God's divine intervention.

I would look elsewhere for a film about the reformers or John Wycliffe.",1353715200,3,480,4.829268292682927

1204908,5,B00000F4EO,"I invited about a dozen neighbors into my office to see this film with me and a young man whom I am helping with his history lessons for his senior year in high school.  We were all deeply impressed.  In fact, I now plan to show it on a larger screen to the entire congregation this coming weekend.  The grainy picture and other technical shortcomings did not diminish in the least, for us, the effectiveness of the movie.  I understand that people requiring high-tech presentation and used to action-packed entertainment may have reasons to complain about it, but serious students of history and of the story of Christ and his people will certainly be touched by the well-acted portrayals of major characters of the momentous events of the late 14th century.  It is well worth taking the 75 minutes it takes to watch this film.",1347494400,3,828,4.682758620689655

1204912,5,B00000F4EO,"Admittedly, the production is a little bit cheesy at times, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this brief overview of the life of John Wycliffe.  Principle to this man was the centrality of the Scripture and his radiant faith in Christ, even when standing in situations of his life's peril.  There are many valuable lessons that can be brought away from this film, namely Wycliffe's compassion and vigilance for the rights of the poor peasants of 14th century England, his love of teaching his students, as well as the beauty of Wycliffe's love of the Scriptures and his desire to see it translated into English.  This is a wonderful piece of history, easy to follow, and ideal for a small group study or a family worship time (the film is very tame, with the only questionable content being a couple dead men following one of the peasant revolts.)",1327622400,,844,4.727891156462585
1204972,4,B00000F4EO,"We learned both English history and Christian history in this biography of a Bible translation pioneer.  A contemporary of Chaucer, Wycliffe saw the need for the English people to have the Bible in English.  Although persecuted and harrassed, he faithfully pursued his goal.  Although 200 years before Martin Luther, he saw the changes needed in the church and spoke out.",1311465600,,371,5.15
1204973,5,B00000F4EO,"It's good to be reminded again that free and easy access to the Bible in our own language is something to be constantly treasured. Wycliffe, a spiritual and intellectual giant, was mightily used by God. The movie is well done. I, along with other reviewers, would have preferred to see him portrayed as a younger man as the film began, but certainly the film portrays the essence of Wycliffe's life and ministry. Highly recommended.",1306022400,,432,4.851351351351352

1204975,5,B00000F4EO,"""The movie drags,"" says one reviewer; true, but life was slower then, so not a problem.  The product description states that Wyclif translated the Bible into English.  Actually he did not; his disciples, the Lollards, did, along with some scholarly friends.  See

[...]

Over the years we've watched this at least 30 times and still appreciate the fact that a life lived for God ""will suffer persecution.""  Lastly, we always enjoy the irony that, when the Roman pontiff wanted to burn yet another godly man, he was already dead - safe in the arms of Jesus.  So, honoring(?) St. Peter's directive to follow Jesus' example (1Peter 2:21), Rome had his bones exhumed and burned.  That'll teach him, huh?",1295222400,6,699,4.864406779661017
1204976,5,B00000F4EO,"This is a great film. It captures not only the historical context of the times but the spirit of Wycliffe.

1204980,5,B00000F4EO,"The string of Wycliffe to Hus to Luther is truly amazing in the similarities:  lovers of the Scriptures, desire to translate Word of God into people's language, and proclamation of gospel, and thus, resistance and eventual persecution by the church.

This does an admirable job of highlighting this servant of the Word's career and his influence.

Excellent for Bible study and application in our day.",1179360000,3,401,5.138461538461539
1204981,3,B00000F4EO,"This one is a good orientation for the history of the first English Bible, produced by Wycliff [1375-1425]. There are some references to Wycliff's followers and the movement which occurred in the latter 14th century. Wycliff's followers were known as Lollards but the movie did not note that.

Wycliff has a problem in that he never changes in age over the course of action, encompassing years. Same flowing white beard, clean and coifed. The acting is spotty and I am not sure if this one is worth the price tag for some. For me, it was. Where else will you see an attempt at the history of Wycliff? It's educational value is its selling point. It has some nice English scenes so the settings are good. This is not a high budget movie.

It's a little rough around the edges. Still, it is a recommendation.",1174694400,28,806,4.551724137931035

7907179,5,B00000F4EO,This is a wonderful movie about the first English scholar who gave his life to translate the Bible into English so that common people could find salvation.
