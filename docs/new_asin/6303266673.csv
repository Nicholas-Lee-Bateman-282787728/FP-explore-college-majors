8176649,5,6303266673,"So this film was brought to my attention by a friend who claimed it was ""like Hal Hartley on acid.""  I usually like to stay away from anything with a reference of being ""on acid"" but Hal Hartley  would be a kick in that state, so I checked it out.  She was right.
I've  never laughed so hard at a movie, and yes, you're supposed to laugh.  This  film is basically an overdone spoof of indie New York films within the  context of a Spanish soap opera.  Throw in some of the most ridiculous  dialogue and scenarios (all meant to be ridiculous mind you) and you've got  The Golden Boat.  Oh, and the soundtrack!  John Zorn did the soundtrack and  it's hilarious.  There are scenes where the entire score pauses and  restarts again (very funny.)
Follow Austin and Israel on their madcap  adventure through New York City, trying to find Amelia Lopes.  The cameos  are great from Kathy Acker to Barbet Schroeder to Jim Jarmusch(the  godfather of NY Indie film!)
If you watch this movie, watch it with  friends who like to laugh.  My only other advise is don't try to figure it  out.  It'll ruin the fun.",953769600,10,1097,4.429292929292929
