8534529,4,B00921MC1S,"I totally agreed with previous review by Doctor Bob. During the approach to japan Crew executed  missed approach and whole section for missed approach is missing in the video. I believe that s the best part, we, as viewers wanted to see...  I guess politics get in the way again as usual and it didn't get approved by Turkish Airlines Authorities  to release a missed approach section since they truly think that  they are  number one airline in Europe with their safety rating sinking faster than titanic.",1434067200,,506,4.7701149425287355

8534531,4,B00921MC1S,"Another of the Blu-Rays from Just Planes, this one takes us on only two flights, from Istanbul to Tokyo and back.  While I prefer videos with more shorter flights, this one works well.  Some of the material is just filler, to give it a good length, which rarely happens when we have short flights.  There is excellent coverage of the takeoffs and landings, plus good in flight information.  Flying Turkish is just like Southwest -- your dinner is cooked to order by the on-board chef -- oh wait, maybe not like Southwest.  One huge flaw, however, is that they do a go around because of bad weather, but we lose the video!  One second we are in descent a couple hundred feet up, and the next we are climbing up to the go around altitude!  We miss the whole fun part, which is interesting since Just Planes had 4 -- FOUR -- cameras going.  We assume, therefore, that something weird happened and they don't want us to see it!  Overall, a fun video, but I want the missing minutes back!",1354320000,5,983,4.416666666666667
