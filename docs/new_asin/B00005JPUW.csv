1582746,5,B00005JPUW,"WAR starring Jet Li burst onto the screen this weekend in what has to be one action packed film from the beginning credits to the ending ones. Not much time to breathe. The basic plot is Triad gangs against Yakuza gangs in San Francisco, and Jet Li plays an assassin that cleverly works both camps against each other for his own benefit. The film starts off with the massacre of an FBI agent and his wife and child by an assassin sent to kill them. His partner spends the rest of the film trying to capture this assassin. Jason Stathan takes on this gritty role as an agent out for revenge who looses his wife and his family because he refuses to give up the hunt. John Lone plays the Triad boss, and Ryo Ishibashi the Yakuza boss headquartered in Tokyo who sends his cold hearted daughter (Devon Aoki) to oversee his USA operations. Jet Li plays one group against the other in a very clever production which gives us plenty of gang shootouts, assassinations, motor cycle and car chases, and enough over the top violence for the most hardened of viewers. One blood bath takes place in a Japanese tea house in SF's Chinatown where a room full of Yakuza and their kimono clad waitress are reduced to so much dead meat. The FBI arrives to clean up this mess eliminating a few more of the gang in the process. Another slaughter is in a Triad nightclub where one of the owners guard dogs is returned complete with a collar booby trapped to blow up, and does it ever. Pay very close attention to ALL the ensuing action because a surprise ending is in store at the conclusion of this one hour and forty minute film. I have not seen Jet Li in a role like this before. Hopefully I will in future productions! Excellent film! Enjoy!",1188086400,5,1722,4.418238993710692
1582747,5,B00005JPUW,"""War"" is great! The cast led by Jet Li (as Rogue) and Jason Statham (as Jack Crawford), both who have worked together in ""The One"" (2001) is great.

1582748,5,B00005JPUW,"Although, I was somewhat confused about the ending, I'd have to see it again to understand what happened more clearly. This movie is great, and is the best movie when it comes to depicting Asian mafias.",1187913600,2,202,4.638888888888889
1582749,3,B00005JPUW,"After losing his partner (Terry Chen) to the hands of mysterious assassin Rogue (Jet Li), FBI agent John Crawford (Jason Statham) has spent the last three years of his life trying to get revenge, costing him his marriage. He gets his opportunity when the assassin resurfaces to begin a war between the Triad and Yakuza crime organizations. In between all this, Rogue and Crawford are engaged in a cat-and-mouse chase where both learn about their past.

Jet Li and Jason Statham. Who could go wrong with a showdown between two of this generation's martial arts stars. This is agreeably why I anticipated ""War"", helmed by Phillip G. Altwell (a music video vet who doubled in directing an episode of ""The Shield"" and second unit directing for ""National Treasure"". The film delivers very well on the action side, and Li and Statham are terrific, but suffice to say, I felt disappointed.

Altwell does get ""War"" started on solid, if familiar territory. The music video vet often gets carried away with the visuals, but he is able to relish in the moment during any action scenes or whenever Li or Statham come into conflict. For any fan of martial arts films, Altwell has a good present for you.

But it's a shame that he wants more from this package than inviting fans to see the main event. Altwell piles upon meaningless subplot over meaningless subplots involving Crawford's estranged family (wake me up when that cliche dies down, please?), dirty cops hijacking weapons, a crime boss's wife (Nadine Velazquez) whom Rogue sympathizes for, and many more. So we're here to see Li and Statham exchange fisticuffs in a 99 minute movie, but have to sit through endless scenes of expository dialogue and some plot holes to get to it? And for some reason that only Altwell can explain, there's a ""Usual Suspects""-type twist involving what REALLY happened to Tom Lone. A really bad move on his part.

Probably one of the subplots that had me riveted was the one involving Devon Aoki. As the daughter of Yakuza boss Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi), Aoki manages to give her somewhat limited role some life. My favorite scene involved her holding a knife to one guy's throat, while aiming a gun to the other guy's head. Scenes like that give ""Rogue"" the much needed life it lacks.

Altwell does good when giving Li and Statham screen time to confront each other. Scenes like that have plenty of suspense, raw drama, and an extra punch of fun. Unfortunately, due to the uncalled-for twist at the end, their final fight becomes a major disappointment. And the film ends after Crawford gets shot and Rogue drives off in a car. ""War"" has a lot going for it, and it's very action-packed, but it leaves a stench of disappointment of what it could've been.",1187913600,3,2728,4.758985200845666
1582750,3,B00005JPUW,"What the hell happened? This movie did not at all live up to expectations. I love both these action stars, Jason Statham and Jet Li, and what they bring to the table. I believed it was a can't miss premise: that of Statham and Li facing off against each other. Was I ever wrong!

The slaughter of his partner and his partner's family causes federal agent John Crawford (Jason Statham) to go on a personal vendetta against a legendary assassin named Rogue. After three years, he finally gets a whiff of a lead. But, as Crawford hunts him down, Rogue (Jet Li) follows his own mysterious agenda. Having snaked his way into the Triad's inner circle, he schemes and manipulates the Triad into warfare with the Yakuza. All the while, he is relentlessly hounded by Crawford and his task force.

Jason Statham brings his virility and patented angry intensity onto the screen. Jet Li, however, sleepwalks and delivers his lines without any type of conviction. Only in the action sequences does Jet spruce up, and, even then, we don't get to see him much in full out action. In an interview, Jet claims that WAR isn't a martial arts film and I guess he's got the picture pegged perfectly. Oh, there's a ton of shooting with guns. But with namebrands like Jet Li and Jason Statham, with the latter having rapidly garnered a film rep as a martial artist (based on The Transporter series), I expected wushu mayhem. But Jet Li only gets to really cut loose in one sequence when he goes up against ninja-clad Yakuza. Statham sees even less action, although he does have a pulse-pounding tussle in a teahouse. But, other than that, you'd never know Jason was well versed in the martial arts.

I was hugely anticipating Statham pitting his brawn and ferociousness against Li's agileness and speed. But, basically, the momumental throwdown between them never happens. They do get it on at the warehouse climax, but it comes off as more an amateurish and unfulfilling clash of wrestling, punching, and throwing each other thru things. Definitely not what the audience was hankering for. These guys both have built in fan bases, and, in my opinion, the fans were just let down. I am sorely vexed.

Then, on top of that disappointment, you throw in the plodding nature of the story. Rogue persists in his machinations to set the two crime cartels against each other, forcing the audience to endure all the resulting dreary plot convolutions. Given, these aren't really dead spots in the film as much as the camera tending to hone in on sordid characters and situations I didn't give a crap about. But, even when things were happening, the film felt like it dragged. There are times when Statham's storyline is relegated to the background. Frankly, more focus should've been given to Crawford's pursuit of Rogue, especially since Statham, to me, is the more charismatic actor. We are introduced to one promising character - the Yakuza head's capable and ambitious daughter - but nothing really comes of her story arc. However, I did appreciate the present she received.

There's one positive here in that a very nice twist is introduced late in the film, and it did surprise me. But, in the long run, too many things turned me off. When Jet Li and Jason Statham finally meet each other face to face, I expected fireworks. Not necessarily a fight, but...something, I dunno. But that scene left me cold. Sad to say, but these two lack chemistry together. The ending, when it came - and an unsatisfying and abrupt ending it was - couldn't have come any sooner. Two and a half stars of bitterness for this one.",1187913600,,3584,4.728

1582858,2,B00005JPUW,"I gave this two stars for two reasons.  One is for the wasted potential.  Jet Li and Jason Statham and a fine supporting cast are talent that is squandered in this movie due to a poor script . . . a very poor script.

They say don't bring a knife to a gun fight, but this script and director brought guns to what should have been a martial arts extravaganza.  The extraordinary talents of Li and Statham are about as underutilized as Gorden Ramsay working at McDonalds.  Gunfights from a distance and cold stares seem to be the main items on the menu.  Even the grand finale fight scene has our stars basically swinging shovels and sledge hammers at each other for most of the battle. I suppose this is the ""War"" the movie gets it title from.  Not sure because other than this Li and Statham interact very little.  Li does have some fun with a sword and a few short lived action scenes and these help pull you through an otherwise sluggish film.  Characters are never really developed too deeply and that fact, along with the boring dialog, music video-like editing, and the lackluster, somewhat confusing plot, never really draws you into the film too deeply.

There is just enough interest and action to suck you along to the completely far-fetched, wanna-be-clever ending.  And that is reason number two for the low rating.  The more you think about the absurd ending and its supposed big reveal the less sense it makes.  It also takes the films protagonist and turns him into the bad guy in the final minute of the film.  That jarring twist just doesn't seem to fit no matter how hard you try.  We are also left to guess as to the final fate of Stratham, as the movie hints but doesn't make this clear.  All in all, this farcical ending takes what could have been a passable movie and turns it into a joke. The potential was here for a decent flick but it just never materialized.",1518134400,,1884,4.464912280701754
1582859,4,B00005JPUW,"Jason Statam as FBI agent Jack Crawford is obsessed with finding the assassin who murdered his partner and partner's family and will do anything he can to find the mysterious Rouge (Jet Li)even while his family life is falling apart in this entertaining yet forgettable action romp helmed by rap video director Philip Atwell.

While this film doesn't possess the emotion of Li's ""Fearless"" nor the breath-taking fight choreography as his ""Kiss of the Dragon"" (or hell, the balls to the wall attitude of Statham's earlier ""Crank""), it's still a pleasant enough diversion and the action as well as the charisma of the two main leads does make up quite a bit for a convoluted, clichd storyline. I did like the film and everyone acted well enough (save for Andrea Roth who got stuck with most of the more inane dialog, which is a shame as much as she's insufferable in this movie, I quite enjoy her in ""Rescue Me"") All in all entertaining, but highly forgettable action movie fluff.",1517529600,,978,4.752941176470588

1583251,1,B00005JPUW,"The worst thing about this movie is the instant deflation of the twist of plot that actually was the best thing about it.

There are a lot of things about this movie I did not like. This Jet Li character... he is just too cool. He out-sword-fights ninjas with their own swords, out-motorcycles Yakuza motorcycle gangs, out-fights, out-drives, out-runs and out-thinks everybody. One guy has attack dogs; he out-masters the dogs' master. He can drive through red lights without stopping or even looking for cross traffic, never sweats and never wipes the slight smirk off his face. He is always in control even when out-numbered 10 to 1 by professional killers. He also drives a car that looks like a fighter craft from a Star Wars movie, yet attracts no attention and cannot be followed home.

The ending plot twist only leaves one wondering even more just how this Jet Li character gained all these fantastic skills and James-Bond-world international connections.

The Jason Statham character seems too wise, too cynical. Yet at the end what could have been the movie's major clever plot twist is shattered into rubbish as we are asked to believe this same street-smart guy is absolutely, preposterously, mind-bogglingly gullible.

Sadly, this could have been a pretty good movie, if the Jason Statham guy had somehow done what he did accidentally instead of out of greed and gullibility. Then the movie might have played up the psychological aspect more, with him brooding and foaming at the mouth more obviously for revenge throughout the film, motivated by an unjustified sense of guilt. As it was, I could not tell if his more out-of-control scenes were supposed to represent rage and internal conflict, or just his normal hardened character.",1451692800,,1746,5.010344827586207

1583798,3,B00005JPUW,"Format: Blu Ray

I picked up this film from a local store for $5 on BR. When I saw it was Jason Statham and Jet Li, I figured there would be some pretty good action scenes with a few bits of spiky dialog. While I will always be a fan of both these fine action stars, I cannot say I am a fan of the movie. Given the talent both of the actors give, I feel like they were under utilized. Li did get to show off a little swordplay skill and the two did have a fight scene where they faced each other, but it wasn't enough to make this a great action film. The editor did a lot of fast cutting which is usually added to films to make them seem as if the action is playing faster than it really is. I'm not crazy about these kinds of action scenes and thats all you get from this film. The story is alright and it does have a very interesting twist you won't see coming, but ultimately it felt a little flat and I kept hoping it would get better the longer I watched. It didn't.

Some people who like this type of action movie might get something out of this, but in the end I'm glad I only paid $5 for the Blu Ray.

As far as the Blu Ray transfer, it's not bad...but not amazing either. There are a few times where the voices of the actors get very low and you have to adjust the volume only to then be in an action scene and have to turn it down again. That is a major pet peeve of mine. The picture looked alright, although there were a few scenes where the grain really obstructed the scene and became distracting.

1583824,4,B00005JPUW,"War(released Aug/07)stars actioners Jet Li as Rogue,Jason Statham as Crawford,along with John Lone as Chang,Devon Aoki as Kira,Luis Guzmn as Benny,Saul Rubinek as Dr. Sherman,Ryo Ishibashi as
Shiro,Sung Kang as Goi,Mathew St. Patrick as Wick,among others. This is a straight up violent melee' with a twist ending. Although the plot is a been-there,done-that scenario,director Ellis handles his chores with a deft touch,along with the nice editing and a driving musical score.
The story finds us in San Fran. There are two crime bosses,one Yakuza,Shiro,who has never stepped foot on U.S.soil but has underlings working there for him and controlling his interests. The second group is a Chinese Triad gang run by Chang. The Yakuza has slowly been encroaching upon his turf for years,which has dried up his liquid assets. Shiro is shipping a couple of priceless gold statues to the U.S.to sell on the black market and Chang intends to get them for himself. The money he obtains from their sale will more than put he and his empire on a better footing.
Entering this picture comes Crawford and Tom Lone,as two FBI partners. They take part in a bust of a Yakuza operation and a special hit man called the Rogue is shot in the incident. The Yakuza want revenge so they let the Rogue loose who ""kills"" Lone,his wife and child and sets the house on fire. Crawford is beside himself with grief,but revenge soon enters his heart. In the meantime we are privy to the Rogues disposition. That being he likes to think of himself as masterless,accountable to no one. With that mind set he has a penchant for working for one side while playing the other against itself.
As Crawford seeks out the Rogue,who leaves a signature titanium shell casing at every crime scene,the Rogue is busy stirring up the Triads and/or the Yakuza.
The Rogue,as the shipment of special statues arrive from Japan,is ""working"" for Chang,to secure them for him. This he accomplishes with relative ease. In the meantime Crawford finds the last of three remaining independent plastic surgeons who worked on the Rogues face,hiding in Mexico. He identifies a picture Crawford shows him of the Rogue. On the way out of the building the doctor goes down.
Back in the U.S.the Rogue finally meets Shiro,who has come to personally supervise the statues arrival. It seems the Rogue has been working for him all along. The Rogue delivers the stolen statues back to his boss,but his boss has been tipped off that the Rogue didn`t kill Chang`s wife and daughter as ordered. Shiro now wants the Rogue dead for disobedience. A battle royale ensues with everyone eliminated but the Rogue and Shiro,who then proceed to match swords. When asked by Shiro why he has turned on him,the Rogue says he ordered one hit too many...on his wife and daughter. In a flashback we see that Crawford`s partner,the day of the hit,did NOT die as we first thought. The Rogue was actually killed that day by Lone. To get revenge Lone had his own face altered and pretended to be the Rogue from then on,playing everyone off each other until he could get to Shiro. Shiro,just before he dies,informs Lone/Rogue,that his partner knew about the upcoming hit on his family.
Lone sets up a face to face meeting with his old partner Crawford at a pier. An FBI sniper is hidden above to take the Rogue down. The two end up tussling and the truth comes out. Lone outs himself while Crawford reveals he indeed did know of the upcoming visit by the Rogue,but it was supposed to be just a rough up,not a murder. Crawford asks for Lone`s forgiveness. Just as the sniper is about to fire,Crawford steps into his line of sight and Lone shoots Crawford in the back and flees. The movie ends as Lone,now the Rogue,flees across the Golden Gate bridge.
The film moves along at quite a good clip and the action,when it comes,comes fast and furious. Both Statham and Li are in fine form fighting in each of their trademark styles. The film is directed very nicely and where others movies can often lose the viewer with such back and forth storyline changes,this one seems to be able to generally keep us in the loop consistently through plot and visual cues. There are many good and well known Asian actors present also,in the form of the crime bosses and their underlings,and they all do a terrific job. Watch for Canadian actor Saul Rubinek as the doctor and a nice part done by Luis Guzman,who plays his part with a calm and straightforward touch. He`s usually playing some off beat weirdo scumbag,so it was nice to see him in this kind of role for a change.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/ a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound here with several commentaries,deleted scenes,a gag reel and featurettes.
All in all a nicely done cops versus crime gangs in San Francisco. Li and Statham are in fine form as the two former FBI mates that end up on opposite sides...with a twist. 3 1/2-4 stars,and I`m leaning towards the 4th on this one.",1361145600,,4965,4.7277970011534025

1583930,4,B00005JPUW,"With conflicts on several fronts, director Philip G. Atwell's, War (2007), is a violent, relentless, crime drama, with a bold and stimulating storyline, that is hard to anticipate.  Mostly set in San Francisco, the principal players are the FBI, a California based organized crime group run by Li Chang (John Lone), a group of Yakuza run from Japan by Shiro Yanagawa (Ryo Ishibashi), and a mysterious killer known only as `Rogue'.

FBI agents Crawford (Jason Statham) and Tom Lone (Terry Chen), encounter Rogue on the San Francisco waterfront.  Crawford is shot, but Lone returns fire, and the shooter they believe is Rogue is hit, and falls into the ocean.  Rogue is known for using bullets with titanium shells, and Crawford finds one at the scene.  Tom Lone and his wife and daughter, later become the target of a vicious hit.  Lone's house goes up in flames, and three burned bodies are found in the remains.  Sifting through the debris, Crawford finds another titanium shell.

Skipping forward three years, a group of Yanagawa's Yakuza is attacked at club.  The killer approaches a dying gangster, and shoots him in the head, expending a shell.  When, Crawford arrives on the scene, he finds another titanium shell.  The man known as Rogue has apparently returned.

Once employed by Yanagawa as a hit man, the man that Crawford believes is Rogue (Jet Li), now goes by the name of Victor Shaw, and has made his services available to triad boss Li Chang.  With Rogue's assistance, a valuable cargo is stolen from Yanagawa, and more of his men are killed.  A gang war between the Yakuza and the triads is about to erupt, and the FBI is in the middle, trying to deal with both of them.  Rogue says that he has no master, and that seems to be the case, as he fans the flames, playing each side against the other.  Things come to a boil, after a massive shootout in a tea house (masterfully directed by Corey Yuen), as Yanagawa flies in from Japan to oversee matters.

War is a stylish, well-written and executed affair, that dazzles and thrills, while building up to an inventive twist.  Jet Li is a charismatic performer, that lets his actions do most of the talking, as he showcases his fighting and shooting skills.  Jason Statham is very solid in a serious role, again demonstrating that he is capable of much more that just cartoonish action flicks.  It is rather disappointing that third billed Devon Aoki, who plays Yanagawa's daughter, does not do any real fighting, in what is a actually a supporting role.  On the other hand, Terry Chen makes an enormously impactful contribution, in a very brief appearance.  The remainder of the cast, do nothing but add to the momentum and effectiveness, of what is a very entertaining ride.

The DVD is well stocked with bonus material, including two commentary tracks, and a number of cool extras, including a compilation called The Action of War, that in total, provide a fairly comprehensive look at the creative process involved in this very fine production.",1272672000,2,3009,4.788759689922481

1583932,4,B00005JPUW,"""War"" is a serious, sophisticated, powerful action-thriller with a decent plot and good performances, especially by Jet Li. There is great action and fighting in this movie, there is one fight scene where it becomes so furious, even in the beginning, that it's impossible to follow what is happening to whom whereby the story gets jumbled and collapses partially - becoming fighting for fighting sake whereas a great director would have been able to save the plot outline even in this complicated and physically well-executed stretch of the movie. Jason Statham's seems to have martial arts skills above his job classification which make it sometimes a bit incredible, but still enjoyable. By the time the twist comes along, it's actually quite a nice one, but not executed with the greatest of credibility. This is overall a good, compelling, and rather complicatedly sublime movie.

1583938,3,B00005JPUW,"WAR is trumpeted as a collision between the two reigning stars of the martial arts world, Jet Li and Jason Statham.  Their meeting is less a collision than a bump.  For most of the film, they speak to each other on a cell, challenge one another with enigmas and quips, but do not meet face to face until very near the end, and when they do, their collision is fraught with overlapping identity confusion and plot inconsistencies.

Statham is FBI agent Crawford whose partner and family were murdered by a mysterious assassin called the Rogue (Li).  The plot involves how the Rogue acts as a fulcrum to create a war between the Triads and the Yakuza.  Statham as Crawford pursues a leaky trail to find out his partner's killer and to head off this war. There is surprisingly little true martial arts anywhere.  One would think that the climax would feature a showdown between the leads.  What we get instead is the usual cinema mix of car crashes, motorcycle chases, sword fights, and gun duels, all of which have their charm, but given that this film highlights the skills of Statham and Li, one would think there would be less mass violence by nameless lackeys and more mano a mano between the stars.  The plot hinges on identity swapping and this is where I was confused. I hoped to get a martial arts version of HIGH NOON.  What I got was a preachy version of I LED THREE LIVES.",1248825600,,1381,4.514056224899599
1583959,4,B00005JPUW,"Hey, if you're interested in seeing a mostly-violent flick with a big body count, gratuitous in nature half the time, and a lot of hostility, anger, betrayal, a big twist near the end and tons of testosterone, then this movie is for you. If you want a quiet, low-key thriller, skip this one.

This is somewhat brainless blood-and-guts, slice 'n dice. In other words: know what you're going to get here. We get many, many gunshots to head., long range to up-close-and personal, swords into mouths and through back of head and through just about any other body part, a car chase, motorcycle chases, a few bare breasts and a bunch of attention-grabbing scenes of brutality, which definitely outnumber the quieter scenes.

Jason Statham seems to be the new macho man of the day, playing this kind of role in numerous films the past few years. Jet Li.....well, you know him. Statham versus Li? Yes, but not really. The two are only in the same scene twice, once for a couple of minutes of Jason giving threats and Jet standing there passively, and then in the finale fight scene. The latter, unlike most of these action films of today, is not overdone and go on and on. It's just about the right length.

The best part of this ultra-violent movie dealing with rival Asian gangs and FBI agent (s) in the middle in the BIG twist near the end of the film. At least it makes this a little more than a brainless action movie. I think it's kind of cool, although don't try to analyze it for credibility.",1245715200,,1492,4.5390334572490705

Rarely has such a unique and promising premise been squandered as badly as director Philip Atwell did when he had Jet Li and Jason Statham in the same movie and did next to nothing with them; what could have been an action lover's wet dream was turned into a toothless talkfest with minimal action and endless quick-cut editing that's to tick off even the most devote follower of Michael Bay.

The plot starts off fairly straight-forward - FBI agent Jack Crawford (Statham,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>) seeks revenge on a mysterious assassin known as Rogue (Li,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>) amidst an Asian mafia rivalry-turned-war run by the Triad leader Chang (John Lone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Emperor/dp/B001EOQCMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Emperor</a>) and Yakuza boss Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grudge/dp/B0006SGYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grudge</a>) - but eventually becomes quite convoluted, since every other scene becomes an instance of betrayal and leaves you really wondering who is on whose side and why. To the writers' credit, there is an unexpected twist at the end concerning Rogue's identity that is surprisingly good and very nearly enough to make up for the rest of the plot's wannabe-smart tomfoolery...but not quite. Still, if you're going to remember anything about the movie, that'll be it.

Action? - what action? With the legendary Corey Yuen acting as fight choreographer, I was expecting his usual explosion of wireworked excitement, but I now think that he spent most of his time on the set napping: amidst some lackluster shootouts that any fool could've shot, there are only a handful of kung fu scenes that are worth waking up for. The better of these include Li in a short but cool hand-to-hand fight with a Yakuza henchmen (I think it's Don Lew) and a swordfight against Ishibashi that's pretty good even though it's entirely grounded. Statham has one short, mandatory beat-`em-up against a group of mob thugs before he fights Li in the last five minutes of the movie. Without exaggeration, their fight is less than a minute long and features next to no martial arts - it's just the two of them pushing eachother against walls and through windows. I could go on for hours about the injustice of finally getting two top-tier action heroes into the same fight and seeing them do only this, but since it won't do any good, let me leave it at this: Li didn't become a national wushu champion so he could get into shoving matches with other martial artists.

The acting is decent, as action flicks go, but nobody from Li to Statham and Lone to Ishibashi shines at all. Luis Guzman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>), Sung Kang (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Furious/dp/B002AT4K9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast & Furious</a>), Nadine Velazquez (""My Name is Earl""), and Matthew St. Patrick (""Six Feet Under"") have forgettable supporting parts, and even though Devon Aoki rocked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>&nbsp;by pretending to know how to fight, she gets in on none of the action.

At the end of the 103 minutes of ""War"", you'll have seen about half-a-dozen fights of which five do not top ninety seconds in duration, about three or four meh-level car chases, and a lot of shouting from Mr. Statham, but nothing even reminiscent of the large-scale conflict the title refers to. I'm very tempted to give this movie a one-star rating simply because it botched one of action cinema's dream match-ups so very badly, but in light of a handful of good parts, I can't really go through with it. Two stars is generous for a movie I never want to see again in my life, so...

Now on to the movie....

Was very hesitant about buying this one. Not because of Statham, but because of Li. I'd gotten the Chan/Li movie and was very disappointed in the collaboration. Now we have the action heroes of Statham and Li...

Good combination. The storyline holds up, the action is great, the cars are to die for, and the confusion about what the heck is going on is constant.  Basic plot: two good guys, one is killed by the psycho ROGUE. The good guy left (Statham) is all-consumed with the need to hunt him down, even tho it costs him his marriage and normal life. Meanwhile, bad guy Rogue (Li) is playing Chinese Mafia warlords against one another to the point where no one knows why or where he is headed in this. When the light finally dawns (close to the end) it will be a shocker. For those who claim they guessed somewhere in the middle, don't believe it.

The ending was, in a lot of ways, pretty unresolved.  You have an idea of what happened - perhaps - but there was also a little bit of wiggle room.

for an action fan, the expectations are going to be very high considering the actors. Jet Lee and Jason Statham are arguably the best action stars around these days.

while the action doesnt quite deliver as heavily as i hoped, the movie was fantastic. essentially its a cat and mouse story, Statham plays the vengeful federal agent, hellbent on tracking down his criminal. Jet Lee plays an international hitman, who killed Statham's partner. its going to be nearly impossible to find because he's always getting reconstructive surgery and changing his identity. now, four years later, he may just be back on the trail, thanks to a rare bullet, the exact same style used to kill his partner.

its a much darker story with little or no of the comedy found in a lot of Statham's roles, but its a strong, dark, well written action-drama that pushes all the right buttons. the acting was good all around, just as solid as you'd expect from the leads, all the minor characters play their roles believably.

the fight scenes didn't quite stack up to my expectations, but anyone older than five should realize, when the movies done, there was a lot more going on than a straight ""shoot em up"" action movie. not that it would've been a bad thing. i would give Crank that generalization, and its my favorite of Statham's films.

Really you have Jet Li on one side who is an extraordinary martial artist and on the other you have also another great action hero Jason Statham what can go wrong?

The movie isn't completely bad, it's actually recovers its pace at the end, around the last half hour it becomes one gruesome action movie. From a cool car chase scene, to a shootout at a bar, and the last fight scene involving katanas.

1584022,4,B00005JPUW,"Let's be honest, it's all about Jet Li vs Jason Statham when referring to War, at least, that's what I thought until I watched the movie.  Overall, War was a pretty good film, but when it came to Li vs Statham, it just wasn't anywhere as good as I had hoped.  You would think the film's title refer's to an all-out conflict between Statham and Li, but that's not exactly what War is about.  In fact, there isn't as much interaction or fight between the two, and the final fight of the film is just over a minute in length, and does not showcase these guys abilites near the extent that could be possible.  The bright side of the film is that the story is always interesting, and I would never have guessed the twist of the climax in a million years.

Jason Statham plays a character that you would come to expect out of the actor.  He is involved with several action sequences, but there really isn't much martial arts for Statham, and that was a shame seeing his abilities in the Transporter movies.  Jet Li doesn't exactly play a straight out villain (such as his role in Lethal Weapon 4) that we probably expected while seeing the previews for War.  His character is definetly interesting, maybe even confusing, right up to the unexpected twist.  Ironicly, I loved his character (Rogue) but Jet Li appeared rather average in the role, where as I enjoyed Statham's performance more than his character (Jack Crawford).

Getting back to my original point, this is ment to be an action film, and I think many of us (myself included) expected martial arts in the mix.  There is really very little and the final fight in the wearhouse consists of Li and Statham tossing each other around.  About 3/4 of the action are shootouts, which was nothing much above the ordinary as far as good shootouts go.

War comes off good in areas you wouldn't expect much out of in an action film, but not so great as far as action goes.  Even if the overall performances and scenes with Statham and Li could have been better, its still fun to watch a film with the combination of both stars included.  Die hard fans will appreciate this film for that, all other action fans, don't hold your breath.

Pro: This movie has some exquisite action sequences that have you, truly on the edge of your seat. The Shootout in the Chinese Tea House and the Car Chase between Statham and Li are two of the more memorable scenes in this entire film.

Con/Pro: This film has a very clich story base as it's the typical ""Cops partner's killed, Cop seeks revenge, Cop catches bad guy"" movie. It is actually reminiscent of the old corny, but cool 80s action movies like Die Hard which some would agree is what gives this film its charm.

1584064,3,B00005JPUW,"WARNING: RANT REVIEW

Many movies are so well-made that any incredulities are swept away by one's ""willing suspension of disbelief."" Not so with ""War."" There are too many black holes that suck in belief in this mess of a movie. After it was over, the thought was, Why was it made? To validate revenge? To rack up murder counts? To show the stupidity of rival factions and obsession with violence? To show that madmen can produce mad progeny? To show the devastating effects of corruption?

Whatever, both Jet Li and Jason Statham are wasted in this atmospheric film devoted to violence and the madness of men and one cold babe (think another b word). Jet Li is required to wield all manner of guns (none of this is a spoiler as the opening scene shows such). What is it with all these martial arts movies that EVERYONE is as good as the next guy? Is this reality? Are there that many people who have studied long enough to fight anyone, everyone? Correction: This is not a martial arts movie, it is a bloodbath!

Two rival factions, one Chinese, one Japanese, allow the same man in their organizations to defeat the other. Each side is clueless, yet he is there on the scene every time. Who is this Rogue? An urban legend? A CIA operative? An FBI man? A rogue from what?

Are there really FBI men like Jason Statham, whose character seems to have no one as his manager? Is such a one really free to operate the way he does in this movie? Don't say, It's only a movie. Movies should have a seeming of realism, not vigilantism by government.

And the ending, the ending. Both men spoke their final lines in a mumble, leaving this viewer partially clueless as to the meaning of the ending.

If the point of this movie references any of the questions asked at the beginning of this review, then how sad. How wasted. What does it say for America that we condone this sort of violence. Have we reached a point where violence is the answer to crime? Jason Statham and Jet Li were wasted in this production. There should be a rematch in a better vehicle for the talents of these two actors. Justice, if any is left, demands it.

Addendum
While this movie does not live up to expectations (see other reviews as well), it does have its merits. This addition is for balance. ""War"" is a wonderfully atmospheric film, one of the best. Shot in darkened places to connote dark doings, it never flinches in maintaining the darkness of men's souls. Even when mob leaders, Chinese or Japanese, demonstrate their heartless natures, there will be an immediate family scene that shows these men, particularly the Japanese leader, as wonderfully loving and caring family men. Perhaps the implication is facade. However, once a man acts in certain ways over and over, a modus operandi is established, making the next heinous act easier and so on.

This was the first film I have seen of Jason Statham and would like more. From other reviews I learned he is quite the action hero. I have a soft spot in my heart for Jet Li because of his character in ""Unleashed,"" a movie I love and gave five stars. I still contend that a rematch between these two in a action film more characteristic of them, perhaps pairing them together rather than against each other is a great idea. I would also like to see the Chinese daughter in another film as she has a commanding presence. Ditto for Jason's two FBI partners.",1201824000,6,3380,4.538587848932677

Eventually, the two face off, but sadly, everything in between is kind of disappointing.  There are some nice twists to be found in War, but when your two main attractions are Jet Li and Jason Statham, you'd more than likely expect some heaping moments of high flying, over the top, martial arts action.  You get it, but you don't get enough of it, and a majority of the action in War just comes off as being watered down.

There are some notable supporting actors to be found in War as well, including the gorgeous Devon Aoki (Sin City) and a surprising appearance from John Lone.

1584089,2,B00005JPUW,"This is not an example of genius moviemaking.  The movie stars Statham and Jet Li, so you really shouldn't have been expecting it to be.  Both are impressive action stars, neither is a great actor.  Pair those strengths and weaknesses with a pedestrian script and you get ""War.""  A fun diversion, but not something you should analyse too closely.

Statham plays an FBI agent who's partner is killed by a triad hitman called ""Rogue.""  Flash forward three years and most of the cliches that go with ""man on a mission"" movies have occurred.  Statham is divorced and estranged from his child as a result of his single-minded pursuit of the killer, blah, blah, blah.  I know, I know... this sounds like every movie where someone is holding a gun on the promotional poster.  But wait...

Statham's character picks up the trail of the killer and we are treated to some tough-cop scenes.  Meanwhile, Jet Li provides us with an oddly human assassin that somehow doesn't quite jib with the picture that's so far been painted of ""Rogue.""  Li sets out to pit a Yakuza clan against a Triad one.  Killing upon killing commences.

Once the clans are out of the picture, it's time for the big showdown and a twist that while you didn't exactly see it coming, you're not exactly surprised by it either.  I won't put the details out as I'm usually irritated by reviews that give away the point.

I've admittedly glossed over the action scenes in the movie.  There's a reason for that.  People familiar with Statham and Li know that anytime fighting goes on in one of their movies, they'll be just fine.  They are here as well.  You'll walk away with two complaints.  The first is that Statham and Li never really square off in the kind of hand-to-hand showdown that you paid the money to see.

1584090,2,B00005JPUW,"I have mixed feelings when it comes to watching martial arts movies. I enjoy them when there is a good story, energetic action sequences, and engaging actors filling the roles. However, I'm not a big fan of the martial arts epics where I have to read subtitles all the time to know what exactly is being said, and I generally don't get much out of the fantasy-style fight scenes in the martial arts films that seem to be more popular these days. Sure, they can be fun to watch, but they are so obviously fake that it's distracting, that type of fighting style belongs in science-fiction (""The Matrix"" for example), but not here. Me, I prefer to see the kind of martial arts films that are set in a more realistic world, where the fights seem to be natural and don't appear to use as much obvious wirework, though I don't mind if some of the fight sequences get a little out there in terms of believability, after all something must be said for style, just so much as it's not all the time. Examples of the kind of martial arts films I prefer to watch would be the `Transporter' films starring Jason Statham or ""Unleashed"" starring Jet Li. Both Jet Li and Jason Statham generally make successful box office action movies, though I tend to prefer Jason Statham's movies over Jet Li's (Li tends to make more of the fantastical, martial arts epics that aren't my cup of tea), but when the two came together in the recent action film ""War"", I figured this movie has the possibility of being one of the best martial arts action films to date, I mean with these two together how could it miss. So, after it was released to DVD I proceeded to rent it at my earliest convenience, and once home I was ready to sit back and enjoy a thrill-a-minute, action packed ride. But did this ""War"" live up to its potential or was it merely good for absolutely nothing?

""War"" focuses on FBI agent Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) who has spent many years of his career endlessly pursuing the world's deadliest assassin named Rogue (Jet Li). Most believe that Jack is pursuing a ghost, that Rogue is merely a mythical figure created by the Asian gangs to gain more power and instill fear into their enemies. However, after Jack's partner was killed by a man who leaves all the familiar traces of Rogue, Jack vows to hunt the killer down no matter the cost. As his quest for vengeance intensifies, Jack finds himself being pulled deeper and deeper into the middle of a war between two rival Asian gangs, where death is but a misstep away, and nothing is what it seems.

Here's a movie that really frustrated me after I finished watching it. For the most part, I enjoyed ""War"", I felt that it had a good story, incredible action sequences, the acting was solid, and the characters even had some depth to them, which is surprising for this type of movie. So, after enjoying the movie for roughly 85% of the almost 2 hours running time, about 15 minutes from the end of the movie the whole experience just falls completely to pieces. What went wrong, you ask? Well, sometimes a film tries too hard to throw the audience for a loop by inserting a sudden twist in the story, and as a result sometimes everything ends up crumbling faster than it was built over the duration of the film.

Such was the case with ""War"", the writers Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley (first feature film for each) had crafted a fairly solid story that managed to keep my attention from the very beginning of the film, but then with one little twist intended to shock the audience, they managed to ruin the entire story and their engaging characters that had been created in the process. I was left feeling like I had basically wasted the last 2 hours of my life, the time I had invested in the story and the characters was pretty much erased by one pointless plot point created by two writers that wanted to shake things up in their story to avoid the, albeit predictable, obligatory showdown between the two leads that should have been the highlight for the entire film. What we were left with was the most disappointing moment in the entire film, resulting in a letdown of a martial arts film that could have been one of the better of the genre given the talents brought together.

As disappointed as I was by ""War"", there were some high points to the film along the way. The actors were all good, at least the primary actors, the countless thugs working for the Asian gangs were essentially stock villains good for nothing other than being beaten by FBI agent Jack Crawford (Jason Statham). Jason Statham was very good as Jack, he played him as a man obviously torn by the decisions that he's made since his partner's death, and the results of those decisions, yet he was filled with an unyielding resolve to bring his partner's killer to justice. Jet Li delivered yet another good performance, though not as nuanced or emotional as his character in ""Unleashed"", he still manages to give audiences a strong, yet conflicted character that will kill without hesitation one moment then show compassion for others the next, and above all else he will remain true to himself. The direction under first time feature film director Philip G. Atwell was fairly typical for an action film, full of quick cuts, frantic camera movements, and of course filling the entire screen with as much mayhem as possible during the overblown and entertaining action sequences. Sadly, these positives, along with some other ones that I didn't list, were not enough to keep ""War"" going strong from start to finish.

Overall, ""War"" is an entertaining action film for a majority of the running time, but one plot twist manages to ruin the entire movie. If you're a fan of Jet Li or Jason Statham, do yourself a favor and rent one of their better movies that will leave you with much more of a satisfactory ending, such as ""Unleashed"" or ""The Transporter"".

Everybody seems to be very disappointed in this movie given the outstanding martial arts capabilities of the two leading actors. Perhaps that's why this movie fails to impress viewers as EVERYBODY expected a martial arts showdown. I actually thought the movie was pretty good and the surprise twist at the end definitely caught me by surprise as I'm sure so did many others. Jet Li's performance in this movie is a typical ""Jet Li"" type of role as a somewhat stiff, no-emotion, few spoken words antagonist with quick but short killing skills either by hand or a quick gun shot. I think the role of Rouge suits him. The plot of Jet Li's character Rouge bouncing back and fourth between the Chinese Triad gang and the Japanese Yakuza gang in order to insight violence between them reminded me of Clint Eastwood's classic role in ""A Fistful of Dollars"".

Given Jason Statham's recent performances in Transporter 1 and 2 showcasing his fantastic martial arts skills, this wasn't exactly the type of role everybody was expecting of Jason Statham. In fact I think ""War"" could have replaced Statham with a different lead actor of much less capable fighting skills such as Colin Farrel, Christian Bale or a Tom Cruise type of actor since Jason Statham's character of Crawford struck me as more of an angry detective type that is more harassing with a gun and his angry words instead of his hands. Makes you wonder how different the anticipated reaction would have been if Jason Statham was NOT in this film? If you can watch and enjoy this movie for what it is and stop expecting the martial arts showdown everybody was waiting for, this movie is worth watching.",1199318400,2,1844,5.226351351351352
1584130,3,B00005JPUW,"WAR sets up the viewer with promises (Jason Statham, Jet Li in his first movie as a straight actor i.e. post-martial arts), but for the most part those promises are not delivered.  What is put on the screen for what seems like an endless evening is more killing with guns, knives, fire, explosions, and every other kind of death device imaginable delivered by minimal story and substandard acting.  It is loud, gory, and boring - until the final few minutes when the story actually gains a plot.

Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley came up with a minimal tale taking place in San Francisco, a rivalry between a Chinese gang and a Japanese gang, peppered by revenge, contraband goods, and a hefty dose of non-balletic fighting.  Jason Statham sleepwalks his way through his role as FBI agent Jack Crawford with an attitude and a grudge, assisted by his partner Special Agent Wick (given a nice turn by Mathew St. Patrick of 'Six Feet Under') and Benny (the always fine character actor Luis Guzmn, even here!).  The head of the wealthy Chang gang (John Lone of 'The Last Emperor') is obtaining a prize antiquity from Japan's Shiro Yanagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) and gang and Rogue (Jet Li) is the agent. After what seems like hours of car chases, motorcycle chases, constant killing, beheadings, sleazy tearoom scenes, etc the identity of the Rogue (apparently much changed by multiple plastic surgeons who likewise loose their lives...) is made clear - a fact that provides some answers to Agent Jack's grumpy personality.

This is a film without a core and one that is easy to understand its box office failure. And unless the viewer is in need of a 103 minutes of steady violence, this film is a must miss - even for fans of Statham and Li.  Grady Harp, January 08",1199318400,3,1765,4.711038961038961

1584133,3,B00005JPUW,"War stars two popular action stars - Jet Li and Jason Statham, and in any other circumstances, could easily be seen as a standout action film.

1584136,2,B00005JPUW,"If you're anticipating the lighthearted action and wacky characters of Statham's previous martial arts flicks, guess again. War keeps the action heavy and the violence brutal with almost no pause for comedy relief. The red flows freely throughout, creating a more extreme and intense action experience, one that actually suits Statham's demeanor more readily than the sugarcoated PG-13 of late, and the action star certainly feels at home cursing and drawing blood. Though War is relatively light on actual martial arts fighting, there are still plenty of fierce shootouts, wild car chases, and fiery explosions. The darker and more intricate storyline might lead you to believe that some real depth exists in the plot, but the seasoned genre viewer will quickly catch on to the plot holes created just to bridge one scene of action to another. But ultimately one goes to a Jet Li-versus-Jason Statham movie for anything but a poignant story, and if it's action you crave, then War delivers.

When the partner of FBI agent Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) is viciously killed by the ghostly assassin known as Rogue (Jet Li), the desperate cop will stop at nothing to exact his revenge. Hunting down Rogue, Jack becomes caught up in the hitman's web of deception and betrayal as he pits the Yakuza against the Triad to start an all-out war.

While it's refreshing to see hard-hitting, blood-letting violence in a world of PG-13, dumbed-down action films, War fails to put all of its noteworthy elements to good use. Namely, Jet Li, who is a staple of adult martial arts films, is underused and underappreciated in his role as ultra-secretive assassin Rogue. Like Jackie Chan, who during his long career making American films caters toward humorous, prop-based violence, Jet Li has a specific brand of movie that fans frequent cinemas to witness. His films generally make use of plenty of blood and bone-breaking martial arts, and harsh language and nudity always seem to make an appearance. His films are of a mature action nature that most studios slink away from because of box office sales. But fans of the genre want the brutality and bloodshed, and while War undeniably includes all of the above, Jet Li doesn't get much of a chance to showcase his uncanny prowess and physical impeccability. The film is filled with far more gunfights and car chases than martial arts action, and Li shies away from no-hold-barred hand-to-hand combat.

It seems the creators chose Li only for his name, and not because fight choreographer Cory Yuen had an abundance of unequaled martial arts stunt sequences. Jason Statham likewise doesn't go toe-to-toe with Yakuza gangsters with bare fists for more than a couple of scenes. The inclusion of Devon Aoki is even unimpressive, as she too is snubbed the honors of unleashing Samurai swordplay. The cannonade of machinegun fire and explosions are duly noted, and appreciated in a non-stop action film like this, but we're always left to wonder why large-scale gun-free fight sequences aren't more readily available. Certainly no one comes to these films looking for exceptional acting or a thought-provoking story.

To fully appreciate a film like War, one must be in the right mindset. They must accept that action and violence take priority over plot, death is a necessity and can strike anyone, and the terms ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" are almost interchangeable and rarely presented with much clarity. If ruthless violence and hard-edged action isn't your cup of tea, then this is likely a War not to get involved in. But if the phrase ""Yojimbo on acid"" peaks your interest (and ""deep plot"" doesn't) then prepare to enlist.

You want action, we got action. You want T&A, we got T&A. You want Jet Li as Mr Supercool Bad-a** Killing Machine... well, he is.

The film starts out as a fairly standard ""revenger,"" with Statham's puzzlingly Cockney Federal Agent ""John Crawford"" out to avenge the death of his partner at the hands of uber-assassin ""Rogue,"" nicely underplayed by Jet Li.

The two protagonists are as different as chalk and cheese; Crawford is a no-nonsense bull-in-a-china-shop, barging in with guns blazing, squinty-eyed, furiously chewing gum, or a toothpick, whilst snarling his dialogue into the faces of the bad guys. Rogue is ""Ah-nalds"" Terminator in human form, cold, calculating, and relentlessly unstoppable. In fact, he's so cool and bad-a** that he has his Teflon-coated titanium ammunition hand-made in Europe, and keeps one step ahead of the law by going under the plastic surgeons knife so there're no up-to-date photos of him in the police files.

Once you have the basic set-up straight, and are just sitting there waiting for Li and Statham to have at it, the plot suddenly veers off into unexpected territory; it would appear that Rogue has his own agenda, and this involves playing the Yakuza and the Triads off, one against the other. Exactly why he's doing this is ultimately revealed with a couple of twists during the final minutes of the film that I did NOT see coming. In fact one of these is SOOOO outlandish that it's going to have you either choking on your popcorn and soda spluttering ""WHAAAAT?!?!?!"" and will ruin the whole movie for you, or you'll just say ""cool..."" and roll with it.

1584159,4,B00005JPUW,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I went in expecting a violent action film and that is exactly what I got.  A popcorn flick.  Yes, the camera could get annoying, but not enough to ruin it (certainly no more than the jerking camera in Bourne Supremacy).  Statham and Li fight their way to an ending that, for once, was not completely predictable.  There was a GREAT twist in the plot -  yes! there was a plot - at the end that improved the overall experience of the film.  I was happy that the filmakers didn't feel the need to tone it down for a PG-13.  Sometimes, a movie just needs to be R; like this one.

My criteria for a good movie is simple - was I entertained?  YES.  Then again, I thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crank-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000K7UBSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crank (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;was entertaining too, if you don't take it too seriously.

1584160,3,B00005JPUW,"What the hell happened? This movie did not at all live up to expectations. I love both these action stars, Jason Statham and Jet Li, and what they bring to the table. I believed it was a can't miss premise: that of Statham and Li facing off against each other. Was I ever wrong!

Here's the plot: The slaughter of his partner and his partner's family causes federal agent John Crawford (Jason Statham) to go on a personal vendetta against a legendary assassin named Rogue. After three years, he finally gets a whiff of a lead. But, as Crawford hunts him down, Rogue (Jet Li) follows his own mysterious agenda. Having snaked his way into the Triad's inner circle, Rogue schemes and manipulates the Triad into engaging in warfare with the Yakuza. All the while, he is relentlessly hounded by Crawford and his task force.

Jason Statham brings his virility and patented angry intensity onto the screen. Jet Li, however, sleepwalks and delivers his lines without any type of conviction. Only in the action sequences does Jet spruce up, and, even then, we don't get to see him much in full out action. In an interview, Jet claimed that WAR isn't a martial arts film and I guess he's got this picture pegged perfectly. Oh, there's a ton of shooting with guns. But with namebrands like Jet Li and Jason Statham, with the latter having rapidly garnered a film rep as a martial artist (based on The Transporter series), I expected serious wushu mayhem. But Jet Li only gets to really cut loose wushu-style in one sequence when he goes up against ninja-clad Yakuza. Statham sees even less action, although he does have a pulse-pounding tussle in a teahouse. But, other than that, you'd never know Jason was well versed in the martial arts.

I was hugely anticipating Statham pitting his brawn and ferociousness against Li's agileness and speed. But, basically, the momumental throwdown between them never happens. They do get it on at the warehouse climax, but it comes off as more an amateurish and unfulfilling clash which emphasized wrestling, punching, and the two throwing each other thru things. Definitely not what I was hankering for. These guys both have built-in fan bases, and, in my opinion, the fans were just let down. I am sorely vexed.

Then, on top of that disappointment, you throw in the plodding nature of the story. Rogue persists in his machinations to set the two crime cartels against each other, forcing the audience to endure all the resulting dreary plot convolutions. Given, these aren't really dead spots in the film as much as the camera tending to hone in on sordid characters and situations I didn't give a crap about. But, even when things were happening, the film felt like it dragged. There are times when Statham's storyline is relegated to the background. Frankly, more focus should've been given to Crawford's pursuit of Rogue, especially since Statham, to me, is the more charismatic actor here. We're introduced to one promising character - the Yakuza head's capable and ambitious daughter - but nothing really comes of her story arc. However, I did appreciate the present she received.

There's one positive here in that a very nice twist is introduced late in the film, and it did surprise me. But, in the long run, too many things turned me off. When Jet Li and Jason Statham finally meet each other face to face, I expected fireworks. Not necessarily a fight, but...something, I dunno. But that scene left me cold. Sad to say, but these two lack chemistry together. The ending, when it came - and an unsatisfying and abrupt ending it was - couldn't have come any sooner. Two and a half stars of bitterness for this one.",1196812800,42,3653,4.764612954186414

1584163,4,B00005JPUW,"WAR (aka. ROGUE ASSASSIN, Asian title) is the 2nd movie that puts together Jason Statham and Jet Li. Remember, ""The One""? I don't blame you; I barely recall the film myself. This film has a very interesting cast; two popular action stars set to collide in the big screen. With fight choreography by Corey Yuen, it looks very promising. Did it deliver on its expectations? (I've been reviewing too many Korean films of late so I thought I'd review one that I saw in theaters months ago, my draft has just been sitting in my computer)

An F.B.I. agent named Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) is obsessed in finding his partner's killer and bringing the assassin called ""Rogue"" (Jet Li) to justice. Rogue is a ruthless killer, apparently if the Yakuza wants someone taken care of; they send this cold and accurate assassin. After disappearing from sight for a few years, Rogue resurfaces in the San Francisco Bay Area. Apparently, he has switched sides, and is now working for the Chinese Triad headed by Chang (John Lone). Jack is so fixated in nabbing Rogue that his very presence fills him with rage. However, Rogue takes Jack's presence as very entertaining and quite amusing. It seems that Rogue has a hidden agenda...

Music video director Philip Atwell is at the helm with ""War""; his experience filming music videos certainly shows in this outing. The style is pretty routine and nothing is spectacular. One thing I can say, is that most of the sequences weren't shot in San Francisco; (I live in San Francisco so I can tell) wherever it WAS filmed it was so convenient. Yakuza territory is made of Sushi bars and Triad territory is mostly, well, Chinese food places. The Asian gangsters have the usual stereotype inherent in other action films. I did find the fetish in Asian clubs quite amusing.

The last time I saw Jet Li as the antagonist was in Lethal Weapon 4; Li upstages Statham in terms of dynamic charisma, he portrays Rogue as a silent but intense presence. Statham's character seemed a bit too clichd, and suffers too much from the same old ""cop-on-the-edge"" gimmick. Li plays a good anti-hero as Rogue, with his classic manipulations to set the Triad against Yakuza. The classic manipulations kind of reminded me of older films, I couldn't put my finger on it until my friend mentioned Yojimbo and Shogun Assassin. The Yakuza crime lord is played by Ryu Ishibashi (Cure) with his daughter played by hottie Devon Aoki (D.O.A.). It was obvious that Aoki is in the film for eye-candy and not much else.

Not to say that the screenplay lacked inspiration. The interesting plot twists seemed poised to turn the film into something quite good. The first twist showed some promise although it may require a large suspension of disbelief; we are expected to believe that everything is just so well executed and calculated. I almost don't want to mention the 2nd twist, because they should have stopped with the first one. The second twist made the movie seemed a bit overcooked; it seemed too forced. It called too much attention to itself to astonish without any credibility. I cannot disclose anymore information because I may end up spoiling the film a little. I really felt like the film would have ended better. (I'm curious to see if the dvd will have an alternate ending, It certainly needs one) The plot devices/twists seemed more fit in a police morality drama, but in a standard action film, the pacing seemed to hamper the film a little.

Now did the film at least actually deliver on the fight sequences? Well, there are ninjas and a decent routine swordfight. We even see Kane Kosuji in action (for a few seconds anyway). The film is pretty solid as a commercial/mainstream action movie. There is a lot of marketing devices; gang conflicts with a few effective twists and turns, a hint of nudity, some T & A, cardboard cutout characters, blood with kinetic action sequences. The film isn't so bad as long as one remembers its target audience; testosterone-laden males (like me). Action director Corey Yuen made better action scenes before, but for action junkies, it may still prove diverting.

WAR is a MIXED bag, it doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before. It has the potential to become a truly fresh and entertaining action film, but it stumbles in the standard plot devices and the routine conflicts. The action sequences are decent, but somewhat lacking in intensity and emotion. Emotion plays an important part an excellent fight scene; the direction just didn't make the effort to show such emotional impact.

There is just something missing in ""War"" that it wasn't as effective as I wanted it to be. I've seen a lot of great action sequences, and the ones in ""War"" are definitely not in the upper tier. If you're a Jet Li fan, you've definitely seen him in MUCH better fight sequences such as in my personal favorite; ""Kiss of the Dragon"" (modern action) or in his past Hong Kong films. To its credit, (at the very least) the fight scenes are better than the ones in ""Cradle to the Grave"" but only by a hair.
Maybe I've just seen too many Asian action films.

1584165,2,B00005JPUW,"This poorly directed movie is also a big letdown as the viewer is looking for an epic fight between the two biggest martial arts stars that never really happens (they fight uninspired for about 30 seconds).  There was also the possibility of either star taking on the female martial artist from Sin City and that never happens either.

In this one Statham is an FBI Agent who is hunting Rogue (Li), an assassin who supposedly killed his partner and partner's family.  Rogue seems to switch sides between the Yakuza and the Triads and also seems to have ample opportunities to kill Statham but never does.  When all is explained in the end, you will leave the movie shaking your head.

Statham is not the likeable character that he was in the Transporter films and that also really detracts from any enjoyment I may have gotten out of this movie.  Better to wait for this to end up on cable than to buy it.",1188950400,,905,4.521472392638037

1584167,5,B00005JPUW,"WAR starring Jet Li burst onto the screen this weekend in what has to be one action packed film from the beginning credits to the ending ones. Not much time to breathe. The basic plot is Triad gangs against Yakuza gangs in San Francisco, and Jet Li plays an assassin that cleverly works both camps against each other for his own benefit. The film starts off with the massacre of an FBI agent and his wife and child by an assassin sent to kill them. His partner spends the rest of the film trying to capture this assassin. Jason Stathan takes on this gritty role as an agent out for revenge who looses his wife and his family because he refuses to give up the hunt. John Lone plays the Triad boss, and Ryo Ishibashi the Yakuza boss headquartered in Tokyo who sends his cold hearted daughter (Devon Aoki) to oversee his USA operations. Jet Li plays one group against the other in a very clever production which gives us plenty of gang shootouts, assassinations, motor cycle and car chases, and enough over the top violence for the most hardened of viewers. One blood bath takes place in a Japanese tea house in SF's Chinatown where a room full of Yakuza and their kimono clad waitress are reduced to so much dead meat. The FBI arrives to clean up this mess eliminating a few more of the gang in the process. Another slaughter is in a Triad nightclub where one of the owners guard dogs is returned complete with a collar booby trapped to blow up, and does it ever. Pay very close attention to ALL the ensuing action because a surprise ending is in store at the conclusion of this one hour and forty minute film. I have not seen Jet Li in a role like this before. Hopefully I will in future productions! Excellent film! Enjoy!",1188259200,,1722,4.418238993710692
