8242286,5,B0011TN70E,"I was truly delighted to receive this DVD. It informed me of so much more historical and cultural detail then the textbook I use with my Graduate students in Tourism Geography.

I was delighted with the high quality of video production and historical detail and I will purchase more of these travelogues for use in my classes.
