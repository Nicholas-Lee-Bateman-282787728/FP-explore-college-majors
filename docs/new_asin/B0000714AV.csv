1797856,3,B0000714AV,I was so excited to see a Russian version of Anna Karenina.  The Russians in general have such a flare for romantic drama.  This version is a let down.  I  enjoyed some scenes but in general the camera shot in wide shots of the rooms they were not close ups so that we could feel what the characters are going through.  There is a scene that artfully expresses desire.  I will continue to search for the perfect screen adaptation of this tragic tale. Has anyone got some suggestions?,1320451200,4,483,4.431818181818182

1797858,4,B0000714AV,"I think that Aleksandr Zarkhi's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel ""Anna Karenina"" is one of the best screen versions of the book. It was filmed on the locations where the novel's events took place, its characters speak in the original language, and the spirit of the book was successfully transferred to the screen mostly due to the performances and the cinematography by Leonid Kalashnikov.

Tatiana Samoylova (radiant Veronica of ""The Cranes Are Flying"") plays Anna exactly as Leo Tolstoy had intended her to be, a victim of overwhelming passion, a woman who had lost herself to love, for whom the whole world had concentrated in her beloved Alexei Vronskiy, and once she felt he had became tired of her, she simply could not and did not want to live. The world famous Soviet ballerina, Maya Plisetskaya took a role of Anna's friend, Princess Betsy Tverskaya and just to see her walk is worth watching the movie. There is much more in it. Some scenes are unforgettable after so many years. Among them, the Vronsky's horse race with the rapid cuts from the faces to horses' heads scene that has to be seen to believe; the first dance of Anna and Vronsky - during the dance the lives of many people had changed forever, or the scene in the theater where Anna dared to show up after she had left her husband and moved in with Vronsky. For a woman of her social position, it was absolutely shocking and totally unforgiving. She was crucified with the looks of the St. Petersburg's Aristocracy but she was standing on the balcony all alone, beautiful and smiling and no one knew what she was going through.

The original music for the film was written by Rodion Shchedrin who would write later the ballet based on ""Anna Karenina"" and his wife, Maya Plisetskaya will be dancing Anna - but it is a different story altogether",1188172800,19,1826,4.685358255451713
1797859,3,B0000714AV,"This movie by far keeps the essence of the classic Russian masterpiece. The English versions were awful, and I was very delighted to have the pleasure of viewing this Russian production. The quality of the film is lacking, but nothing terrible. This movie sticks closely to the story except for the absence of ""Levin's story"". His relationship with Kitty is there, but briefly. No detailed perspective on the importance of his charcter, and no mention of his brother. Also, there was no revelation for Kitty's transformed outlook on life after her sickness and before marrying Levin.
The main storyline with Anna, husband Karenin, and Vronsky was well done. I enjoyed it.
Overall, it was good. I'm glad to have it on my shelf in my colection of Russian movies.",1078704000,20,760,4.89922480620155
1797860,3,B0000714AV,"If the flickering of the film doesn't give you a headache, then maybe the fact that the English Audio track has roughly 15 - 20 minutes of russian with subtitles that just come and go. The color is all washed out, though the picture is sharp??? Why did they only go halfway with this? Then there's the two disk thing, this film is only 2hrs 20mins long, it would easily have fit on one disk.
The film itself is okay, a bit short for such a long novel (why can't they just give this a 3hr treatment?) There is still alot missing from this adaptation though it is the most exhaustive I've ever seen.",1054771200,15,597,4.245614035087719
1797861,5,B0000714AV,"The picture of this DVD may not be the perfect one (which is a pity) but it is definitely worth watching. This is one on those rare films which prove that a long and complicated book can be filmed. Everything... from actors, who gave some outstanding performances, to sets, is almost exactly as I imagined it while reading the novel. It is not just a romantic story as it is shown in the other film versions, but a very serious, tragic social drama. This film is by far the best adaptation of the great novel.",1047686400,29,509,4.368421052631579
7973505,3,B0000714AV,"I've been watching this movie a few minutes at a time, & so far it's pretty good. I was a little dismayed to find out that not all of the dialogue was dubbed in English. I selected English for the spoken language, but some of the spoken dialogue is still in what sounds like Russian, & some of it is in what sounds like French. The subtitles help, but I still would have preferred to hear the movie in English. So I feel the dvd doesn't rate 5 stars. The color is ok--no black & white stuff. I also selected English for the spoken dialogue on the 2nd dvd. The spoken dialogue for one video on Tolstoy started out in English, & then switched to Russian. I haven't watched or read everything on the second dvd yet, but I would expect it to be the same as the Tolstoy video that I am watching. The pause/resume that's usually on dvds wasn't on the first dvd--the one that had the movie on it, but it was on the second dvd.",1512777600,,919,4.139664804469274
7973506,3,B0000714AV,"Rich and beautiful Anna falls in love with the dashing soldier, Vronsky and must choose between true love and her husband and child. This Russian film features great cinematography with colorful costumes and beautiful scenery. Visually stunning. Well-done film with good acting. The film at times races through parts of the novels plot with little nuance or detail. Its interesting to see a Russian-made version of the classic Russian novel. Worth watching.",1503792000,,457,5.361111111111111

7973508,5,B0000714AV,"The novel's opening sequence is the prelude for this classical story, of infidelity and boredom (In the same mood of Madame Bovary, Tess and Effie Briest).

The theatrical ambiance is a feast for the eye. The marevlous travellings, outdoor locations (The railroad station, the snowy forest, the glamorous opera theater or the fabulous skating park sequence are exquisite).

Tamara Samoilova (The crane of flies) was probably the greatest Russian actress of her generation: to watch her is to admire her and to fall in love with her, her perfect face keeps narrow resmblance with Ava Gardner's one.

The rest of the cast is impeccable, as well as the artistic direction and handle camera. In sum a sumptuous masterpiece that you shouldn't be missed.",1438819200,,748,5.065040650406504

7973510,5,B0000714AV,Wanted to watch it as an antidote to the one with Keira Knightley. So bought it for my wife and actually liked it myself. You just have to make an effort to slow down to enjoy it as with pretty much all Russian 19th century literature. Some wine helps too.,1411776000,,256,4.14
7973511,5,B0000714AV,"This is the best version ever, just for the fact it was played by Russians.  Russians understand Leo Tolstov's story, I find a lot other versions aren't as good, because the director doesn't put the actor's through culture training and understand how to be Russian it only always them playing themselves.  Or the director doesn't understand Russian culture during that time and the story always falls flat.",1377388800,4,406,5.044776119402985

7973514,5,B0000714AV,"There's a reason Russians do the best film versions of their own literary masterpieces.  Educated
Russians, at least until very recent times, have been steeped in their culture and have too much respect
for their literary treasures to go about ""improving"" them in the Hollywood manner. For them, the question often bandied about in America--""Which was better, the book or the film version?""--is an idiotic one. They know that
no film can ultimately do justice to a great book. A great book ultimately requires the reader to get involved with
it in a way that no film, even a great one, ever can.  Images from a film can provoke thought, but they cannot involve the viewer to the overwhelming degree that a conscientious reader can be involved by great literature.  This is not to discount the power of images. But it is to recognize the inherent difference between reading and watching, between thinking and looking. Russians know their great works of fiction, and they know that when a film is successful, it is a kind of exaltation of the main themes, characters, and ideas of the book, an invitation to and celebration of the book.  Because this is so, Russian moviemakers have traditionally
kept rather close to the essentials of character and plot that are in the book.  To do anything less would call down the wrath of the nation.
  Hollywood, of course, and other non-Russian moviemakers are bound by no such scruples.  Hollywood sees free material (not bound by copyright problems) and instant name recognition in the great classics of the 19th century (not just Russian, but books in other literatures).  Hollywood sees a chance to remake the classics in its own image,
where the artist is not bound by the same societal rules as the ordinary mortal.  Thus, in ""Anna Karenina,""
in the Garbo sound version and in the Vivian Leigh version, it becomes necessary to make her husband
as unpleasant as possible, to make Anna's conduct excusable.  The only problem with that is that both films
just mentioned turn Aleksei Karenin into a caricature of the bad husband.  This does violence to the portrayal in the book.  Karenin is more complex as drawn by Tolstoy, with both flaws and virtues; he also suffers, quite unlike the portraits in black delineated by Basil Rathbone and Ralph Richardson, respectively, in the aforementioned English-language films. The Russian actor who portrays Karenin does a masterful job
of embodying the complexity of this character.
  Tatiana Samoileva also does a masterful job of portraying Anna as do the other principals in their roles. The actor who portrays Levin, whose model, according to Tolstoy's wife, was Tolstoy himself, even resembles Tolstoy physically!  Such was the care, even in casting, which the Russians lavished when they made screen versions of their literary treasures.  They knew their public expected nothing less.  BTW, Anastasia Vertinskaya, one of the great beauties in Soviet cinema, is made up to look rather plain in this version,
so that we are able to understand why Vronsky (played by an actor once Samoileva's husband!) abandons her for Anna. Most of the subplots in the novel are given some acknowlegement in this film, except for the ones involving Levin's radical revolutionary brother Nikolai.  To have included him in the film in those days probably would have complicated the making of the picture due to political considerations.
  This Ruscico version is in widescreen format on two discs, with some interesting extras, such as interviews with Samoileva and other participants.  Subtitles are available in both French and English.  It is also possible to watch the film with Russian subtitles if one does not chose either the English or French subtitle option.
  I haven't seen the new ""Anna Karenina"" with Keira Knightley, but on the evidence of this 1967 version and what I've read about the new version, they needn't have bothered.  Only thoroughgoing Russophobes and those requiring  Hollywood values to be imposed on Tolstoy's book could fail to appreciate this Russian version as the best adaptation, with the 1930s Garbo version probably bringing up the rear.",1355529600,9,4143,5.045521292217328
