6776956,1,B00OYT32CQ,Unreal and unfounded religious conclusion.  No real science here.,1483488000,3,65,6.222222222222222
6776957,5,B00OYT32CQ,Excellent Scientific review that opposes the incorrect dogma of geologists.,1482883200,,75,6.6
6776958,1,B00OYT32CQ,"This is not science, but mythology dressed up as a documentary.",1481241600,4,63,4.818181818181818
6776959,5,B00OYT32CQ,"This documentary clearly explains the cause and outcomes of the Great Missoula Flood.  The evidence is compelling for one great flood event whereas many scientists continue to promote the theory of multiple floods.  Watch this documentary and view the visual evidence, from onsite locations on the ground, as well as aerial shots and Google Earth visuals, in order to determine your own conclusions concerning this great geologic event.",1480550400,,436,5.397058823529412
6776960,5,B00OYT32CQ,"Often traveling from western Washington to Great Falls, MT I have wondered about the geological features of this interesting landscape.  This documentary uncovers the mystery behind those features.  In a logical convincing manner Michael Oard helps us make sense of not only this piece of real estate, but also many of the other dramatic features in the world around us.",1474588800,,370,5.15

6776962,5,B00OYT32CQ,"This video was very informative.  I had to watch it a couple times to get a handle on the info.  Almost like taking a couple lectures on geology.

I never knew water and wind gaps existed.  Or if I did hear of them, I'm sure it didn't sink in that there is no real good explanation in secular science.  The only good explanation is a catastrophic flood over-topping the mountain ridges and boring through them in certain planes.

The Missoula flood and related recent ice-age that caused it, is so much stronger evidence for catastrophism than uniformitarianism.  Everyone has a bias, its just which one is the right bias to be biased with.

Along that line, it was interesting to learn a bit of history... how the Quaternary Geologic Society resisted a catastrophic explanation  for decades, relying on a philosophical bias (uniformitarianism/naturalism), rather than taking the evidence for what it seemed to indicate... catastrophic flooding over Montana, Idaho, Washington and Oregon and spilling off into the Pacific",1449014400,2,1021,5.065868263473054
8685462,1,B00OYT32CQ,"Was hoping to watch a science based documentary on a fascinating topic.  Stopped watching when I realized this was framing the ""Genesis"" flood.",1513468800,2,143,5.217391304347826
8685463,5,B00OYT32CQ,Educational material you don't get bored with....nothing tedious to make a yawner out of you.  Very educational with most of the material I was not aware of but other stuff I'd seen documented before.,1506470400,,200,4.882352941176471

8685465,1,B00OYT32CQ,"DO NOT BUY THIS THINLY VEILED RELIGIOUS B.S., unless  of course you want to, in which case you and the program deserve each other!!  If I could award ZERO stars, I would do so!",1486771200,2,176,4.147058823529412
8685466,5,B00OYT32CQ,"I actually watched this, and noticed that the author was extremely well informed, not reading from cue cards, but explaining geologic events, locations and processes, and noting that scientists that believe in uniformitarianism are stymied in trying to explain these phenomena, without admitting of the obvious flood that took place. That was obviously in an effort to avoid admitting of even the possibility of a ""Genesis"" flood. So secular scientists will spin dozens of ridiculous unproven yarns to explain what is BLATANTLY obvious, just to avoid something they're afraid might agree with what is in the BIBLE. I mean, is that ridiculous???? Paranoid much??? It shows HORRIFIC lack of professional integrity, and a preoccupation with their own spiritual insecurities. I have heard and read MANY geologists ramble on, at many locations in the world, but most are just parroting what they were told, and don't seem to really know geology,and quite frankly, seem dishonest and confused. This guy does not. Agree with his scientific conclusions or not, share his faith or not, but this is definitely a science-rich production, plain and simple.",1486598400,3,1144,5.291208791208791
8685467,3,B00OYT32CQ,I felt like I was watching a high school instructional video. same information could have been given in less than 30 minutes.,1486166400,,125,4.7272727272727275
8685468,3,B00OYT32CQ,The documentary was somewhat repetitive.  It made its point that there was just one flood in the. first 30 minutes. Was interesting.,1485561600,,132,5.0

8685470,5,B00OYT32CQ,refreshingly new material and very logical.  Liked it. Informative.,1484870400,,67,6.444444444444445
