4447075,4,B004QLX0N8,"This is a film in the horror genre. It takes, as its subject, twin brothers Seth and Jonah, who have the ability of telekinesis or as it is sometimes referred `psychokinesis' . This is the ability to control physical matter by the exertion of brain power, put simply they can make stuff happen.

The film opens with a house party where some of the jocks are upstairs playing Russian Roulette, the only object of the game being to absolutely positively kill everyone. The twins are recording the whole thing on video camera, and then the titles roll. Yep it gets to the blood splats before the credits have finished.

The twins played eerily and brilliantly by brothers Edmund and Gary Entin, do everything alike. They dress act, talk and even sleep together (in the same bed that is). They let us know from the start that they are working on a project, that involves getting a certain feeling - hence the repeated question, `can you feel it?'.

The cops are soon involved and the main investigator is Orlando Jones (Evolution etc). He knows they have something to do with it, but can not find any evidence. What does become obvious is that they are at their most dangerous when they are together. Then a new girl turns up and hits it off with one of the brothers. That is when the older (by a few seconds) starts to realise his ordered world is under threat.

Orlando Jones tells his story by flash backs and we realise he has more than his share of demons too.

This is a well crafted, acted and directed (Antonio Negret) teen horror. It is more psychological than blood and gore. It is only 91 minutes long and is well paced for all of it, and comes across as being quite believable. It has the obligatory twists, but it will keep you guessing. If psycho, horror is your thing this will definitely tick your boxes.",1309996800,2,1816,4.507598784194529
4447076,3,B004QLX0N8,"Real life twins Edmund and Gary Entin play a pair of telekinetic twins who use their powers to inflict bloody carnage on those around them, and record most of it with a camcorder to boot.  Though they've been at it for quite a while, they run afoul of a driven, tragedy-ridden cop (Orlando Jones) and soon find a cute classmate (Samantha Droke) possibly coming between them.  One of the better entries of this year's After Dark Original lineup, Seconds Apart is chilling and bloody, and provides most of the goods that horror fans are here looking for in the first place.  Though the acting is solid, the film plods along quite a bit, and the ending is a bit of a predictable letdown as well.  Still though, Seconds Apart is a worthwhile endeavor, and one of the better films in this relatively weak After Dark lineup.",1309564800,2,818,4.582191780821918
4447077,4,B004QLX0N8,"This film has all the ingredients of a really good psychological thriller: good acting, the evocative atmosphere of moss-covered Louisiana trees, a cleanly enucleated color palette, and the always fascinating premise of sinister twins. But it doesn't mix these ingredients quite right. It ends up with something that's a little too much of a hodgepodge and not enough of a proper three course meal.

I had hoped that the Director and the Entin twins would fill in some of the gaps by voicing their own interpretations in the DVD Commentary. But no, in the Commentary, the three mostly chat about the technical and interpersonal aspects of making the movie, rather than offering any insights into the movie's themes. So the viewer is left with a lot of unanswered questions.

What exactly is the twins' ""program?""

What are they attempting to ""feel?"" Is it their victims' terror? However, that can't quite be right, because some of their victims act robotically, without any gratifying emotional awareness.

What is the meaning of the twist ending? You might think you grasp it, but then when you start to unravel the logic of it, you find it could be explained in several different ways, or else it defies explanation.

But the most nagging question of all - why is the Detective smoking Marvel cigarettes, a brand that was popular during WWII, but that was discontinued in the 60's?

Still, this is an engrossing, treacherous double feature of a film with some brilliant visual metaphors for the eerie synchronicity of the twins - such as the two pieces of bread popping out of the toaster.",1308787200,2,1591,4.895910780669145

""But all the elements are there.""
""Then why can't we feel it?""

If this exchange sounds creepy, imagine it with twins talking. Seconds Apart deals with the twins Seth (Gary Entin - Rest Stop: Don't Look Back) and Jonah (Edmond Entin - Rest Stop: Don't Look Back), and the games they play using their twin power. Unfortunately for them, their plans are disrupted by two events. First is the persistent Detective Lampkin (Orlando Jones - The Replacements), who has a story of his own, and the demons to go with it. Second is the appearance of new student Eve (Samantha Droke - The Secret Life of the American Teenager), who has unknowingly driven a wedge between Seth and Jonah.

The twins in Seconds Apart draw attention to themselves when one of their experiments results in the mysterious suicides of several football players. While investigating their deaths, Detective Lampkin gets the feeling that the twins are involved, and that somehow they use a power associated with twins. Seth and Jonah's twin power is their ability to manipulate people's senses, what they are experiencing. Things were fine as long as they just creeped their fellow classmates out, but when people started dying, their antics couldn't be ignored any further. But not only do they have Detective Lampkin breathing down their necks, but Eve has shown up and is creating an irreparable rift between the brothers. But only when their lives fall into complete disarray, do we see the extent of their powers.
The side plot in Seconds Apart appears to have little to do with the movie, but Detective Lampkin's story and disfigurement give the twins a way to toy with him, and feeds into the end of the movie. But let's face it, its twins, and the Entin boys can be creepy. Their ability to dress alike, choreograph their motions, and sound alike gives them their disturbing presence, and makes their breakdown even more disturbing.

After Dark Originals has done it again and found a way to take a much used theme and put a twist on it to make you go ""Oh my"". The use of twins is a well used, but effective vehicle, but the real draw for Seconds Apart is the inspired performance given by Orlando Jones. Known mainly for his comedic roles, and hawking 7-Up, Jones is riveting as the tortured soul looking for solace in his work. The movie is fairly predictable, but the twists keep you glued to the film. Unlike Jenny and Jamie in Eurotrip, Seth and Jonah aren't the worst twins ever, but they are pretty bad.

4447079,4,B004QLX0N8,"There's a lot of potential not realized in this new After Dark original.  This evil twin movie suffers from unanswered questions:  What exactly is the twins ""program?""  What are the twins looking ""to feel?""  What happened to the cop's wife and what is his involvement, if any?
SECONDS APART is well made and gets top notch performances from the cast.  Edmund and Gary Entin are suitably chilling and hard to differentiate at times.  Orlando Jones, usually a comic actor, is surprisingly good as the guilt-ridden cop, and Samantha Droke is a fetching ingenue.
It held my interest but the aforementioned questions left me disappointed.  It still manages to prove the new After Dark original movies are trying hard to give horror/thriller audiences new and original films.",1306627200,,769,5.055555555555555
4447080,5,B004QLX0N8,"SECONDS APART is the best AFTER DARK film I've seen since FRONTIER(S), and quite possibly the best yet. Seth and Jonah are identical twins w/ a secret. They are working on a ""project"" that somehow leads to the apparent suicides of its subjects. A cop (a brilliantly serious Orlando Jones) tries to figure out why so many deaths seem to involve the twins in some way. Filled w/ a nice, suffocating atmosphere of dread, SECONDS APART plays like the ultimate X-FILES episode, scoring high marks for originality and delivery. I haven't seen an eeevil twin movie this good since THE OTHER! Buy immediately...",1306368000,5,603,4.864077669902913
4447081,4,B004QLX0N8,"First of all, this film is not for everyone. If you are expecting a ""slasher"" flick, then this is not for you. But if you want a movie that makes you stop and think a little, and one that boasts some good acting performances, this might be right up your alley. The Entin twins are spectacularly creepy in their roles as sinister forces of evil with telekinetic powers, and Orlando Jones is brilliant as the detective trying to solve the puzzle that the two twins leave behind. There are a few spots toward the middle of the film where it kind of drags on, but the ending makes it worthwhile to keep watching. The clashing forces that occur when one of the twins becomes distracted by a beautiful young woman is really fun to watch, and Jones is very convincing as he wrestles not only with seemingly unstoppable forces throughout, but also a few demons of his own.

Usually the After Dark films don't have a plot this deep or contain performances this good, so if you are looking for a little change of pace, this is certainly a film that might interest you. Most movies in this genre tend to be re-heated versions of films that have already been made, but this film at least attempts to go for something more original, and quite frankly, it's all the better for it.",1306281600,5,1266,4.456896551724138
4447082,5,B004QLX0N8,"Seconds Apart is the third of the After Dark films I have seen this year and so far the best.
Orlando Jones is perfect in his role as A detective who lost his wife in a fire as are the twins played by Gary and Edmund Entin whom you might have seen as the strange twins in the Rest Stop movies.

The story came together beautifully regardless of a couple of plot holes or unanswered questions.
The story was fast moving and interesting with great acting and a couple of good kill scenes.

It has some good effects and a bit of gore, although not not a gore fest but a psychological thriller that has two stories going on,one being with the twins and one being with Orlando Jones' character, they intertwine beautifully.

A girl comes into the picture and charms one of the twins and that throws a monkey wrench into the plans of the more evil of the twins,their powers only work when both are willing so it becomes a battle of wits. Who will win? will either win?
There are a couple of twists that I didn't see coming.
I was very pleased with this effort and was engrossed up until the very last second.",1304380800,13,1102,4.288461538461538

4447115,3,B004QLX0N8,"Seconds Apart is one of those movies where the writing just isn't strong enough to make it a memorable film overall, however it does have a few really appealing qualities going for it.  For one the acting on the part of the twin brothers is excellent.  They're not quite as twisted and evil as I was expecting (which would have probably been a clich&eacute; by this point if they *had* been twisted and evil) but instead they're more like clever, often times likeable and normal teens with a darker edge to their personality.  Do not underestimate this subtle darker edge however- secretly these twins are capable of doing unthinkable things.

The parents are also rather awesome, especially the mother who comes off so innocent, caring and normal only to suddenly do or say something totally unexpected.  I'm thinking of a hilarious line she says after she discovers Orlando Jones punched her son.  And yeah, the detective played by Orlando Jones is amazing in his role in trying to figure out how people die under mysterious conditions whenever the twins are around.  The twins have the power to possess people into killing themselves.

Now here's where the problem lies- the story usually isn't particularly scary.  This is due to the twins not being very sinister when the moment calls for it, so the deaths that occur (a woman slicing her throat with a piece of glass and the most laughable one of all, a priests' leg arteries bursting as he screams and dies while pulling a worm out of his leg) are all very weak scares/deaths.  In fact the only shocking death is the game of Russian roulette played in the beginning where these teens can be seen blowing their brains out with a revolver.  Now THAT is a very shocking segment!

Plus, despite Orlando Jones being a great believable actor, it never seems like there's ever enough suspense in the way he goes about his detective duties in cracking the case of the evil twins being responsible for the deaths.  Everything feels like it's bordering on making a mockery of the whole ""evil twin"" concept.  That's the impression I got at least.  It's obviously not a coincidence that so many people die whenever the twins are around, but more could have been done to make the story more interesting.  In fact maybe I'm crazy but the tone of the film overall reminds me of the Twilight Saga series (minus a couple really strong deaths of course).  I couldn't shake the Twilight Saga similarities in the way Seconds Apart's fantasy elements are presented and the style of characters which both make me instantly draw similarities to Twilight Saga.  Maybe I'm alone with that feeling.

Also, often times the story jumps around awkwardly confusing the viewer in the process.  A dream Orlando Jones had earlier in the movie is an example.  I couldn't figure out what was going on for a couple minutes here.  Expect this type of awkwardness to pursue throughout the movie in small doses, but at least it's never overwhelming or a mess of confusion.  The story usually gets back on track.  Unfortunately if you add up all the little temporary confusing moments, it gets annoying over the course of the movie.

Overall not one of the better horror movies out there but for 85 minutes of entertainment you could do a lot worse.  That's Seconds Apart.",1404432000,,3289,4.746478873239437
4447116,3,B004QLX0N8,"Twins are a creepy mix of sexy and deadly.  Overall plot isn't all that new, but has a couple grotesque additions.  Okay movie.  Prolly wouldn't watch it again.",1388620800,,160,4.642857142857143
4447117,5,B004QLX0N8,"Although several years old, shouldn't be missed.  Hopefully you'll find it the same way I did...from reading a review from another customer who tends to lean towards the same type - this may not be your cup of tea.  I'm just now discovering the ""After Dark""  & ""Horrorfest"" series, which, for the most part have been fabulous - quality films, creative stories, decent actors and big on thrills and chills. I'm fairly  new to Amazon and I've learned to rely on review to make selections.  Now for the movie.....

SECONDS APART was creepy and I love it when a story surprises me.  Man, oh man, this one got me good-sure didn't see that coming!.  The story I THOUGHT I was watching was great but then.....throw in the twists and seriously folks, so good.  The twins were spot on with their performances as the detective and the love interest.  This movie kept my attention throughout and is recommended.  Not much on blood and guts, more on the let's see how creative we can make this one die.  The twins' project definitely goes off track and things go from bad to worse - don't want to give too much away so I'll CUT and IT'S A WRAP.",1385424000,,1132,4.46829268292683

4447143,3,B004QLX0N8,"And it's a wrap for 2011's SECONDS APART, movie deux in my Halloween Horror Movie Marathon. This is another After Dark Originals release, most of which I've enjoyed a great deal to date.

Basic story has two creepy twins going all Carrie on your ass, with their no-good tele-whatcha-macallit. The lads themselves appear harmless enough, if a little Tim Burton esque, with their side-combed haircuts, buttoned-up shirts and Victorian looking bicycles. Yet, everywhere they go, trouble doth follow, and our hero, the troubled Detective Lampkin, smells a rat.

I enjoyed SECONDS APART. Although not just as strong as the likes of HYBRID and PROWL, this movie still proved entertaining in its own right. This movie looked good and the acting was strong across the board. But the pacing seemed off. My mind was wandering a little during the mid-section of the movie. The script could have been tighter.

A fun, quirky little horror that you should have a good time with.",1351641600,,965,4.9813664596273295
4447144,1,B004QLX0N8,"I thought there was a potential of Evil Twins wreaking havoc on a community.  But, the acting by these twin unknowns, is terrible at best.  The Direction is weak, and the plot is thin.  Add that with terrible acting, and you have tossed several bucks in the toilet, not to mention the 20 minutes or so to realize how bad this cheap-ola production really is. And, it doesn't get any better.  I have bought hundreds of Horror and Sci-fi movies, so I believe my opinion is based on volume of movies watched.  Save yourself the money, and select something better.",1341532800,,559,4.55

4447148,3,B004QLX0N8,"I have ambivalent feelings towards this movie; it was rather tame, with no genuine surprises.  I found the twins more annoying than scary.  It is a fascinating idea though, I will admit that, but I found myself questioning a lot of what went on because it simply didn't make sense after the not-so-big reveal at the very end.  (Oddly enough, all through this movie I kept thinking of Billy Mumy in ""It's a Good Life"" episode of The Twilight Zone, now there was a scary kid with super powers!)

I didn't hate this movie, it was easy enough to watch, it didn't bring up any adverse reactions, it was just....eh.  Which I suppose, is not the best recommendation.
I'm definitely not keeping it as I have no desire to watch it again.",1315785600,,728,4.484848484848484
4447149,3,B004QLX0N8,"It's not bad. But it's not great.

First the good: the twins are really cool, played their roles very well, suitably creepy and sinister. I also liked the girlfriend. And the detective, Orlando Jones, was great.

The not so good: I found it too jumbled and didn't really get the ending. And there were many unexplained things as well. I mean, I get what happened. But I think it could have been done better. Also, the movie would be ok to watch with teens but for the first ten minutes. If they hadn't put the swearing and the sex scene in there, it would be an ok suspense to watch with your teens. Why do they always have to do that?

I can't say I was disappointed since I had no expectations. But it certainly isn't something I will watch again or recommend to a friend as a 'must-see'.

Most of these films have been as advertised, but no one has a hundred percent success rate. Seconds Apart follows Seth and Jonah, two nerdy twins, with extreme twin powers, mainly telepathy. They have fun pulling pranks and using it against the people they perceive to have wronged them, leaving them in a world all their own, but that all changes when a girl gets in the middle of things. The inherit problem with this film, is that these twins aren't creepy at all. Casting decided to go with looks over horror and these two look like they should be on magazines, like they would never have problems with bullies or girls, and as for psychotic killers with superpowers go, these two are so mild-mannered, that it made the story completely unbelievable. When you add to that the fact that Orlando Jones is the investigating detective at this upscale religious school, cracking jokes that no one gets, the film itself becomes the horror show. The story itself wasn't terrible, but the problem here is one we see all too often, the casting. These twins may be good for the Disney channel, but they aren't cut out to be psychopaths. I just found the whole film to be full of cliche's and very poorly done.",1451779200,,1297,4.668122270742358
