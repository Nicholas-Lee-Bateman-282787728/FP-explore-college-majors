8322430,2,B001MYIPZA,"This show is a waste of time - keeps repeating that the brain has ""plasticity"" for the first 50 minutes.
These are the ""5 key points"" this episode makes in the last 7 minutes:
1. Keep what you have - keep and engage what you know/have
2. Be socially active - conversation keeps communication abilities strong
3. Maintain focus and attention - will keep you better engaged in tasks
4. Positive attitude and effort - better purpose and effort results
5. Don't accept decline as inevitable - science will stop aging...",1436227200,2,515,4.670329670329671

8322434,4,B001MYIPZA,My husband and I have just begun to use Brain Fitness 2: Sight & Sound.  We're both enjoying it.  It's interesting to use and I have great hope it will help me keep the level of 'fitness' I now enjoy and perhaps improve it as I age.  I'll get back to you with further updates.,1263081600,2,276,3.981818181818182
8322435,3,B001MYIPZA,I caught part of this show on TV and then went out to purchase it.  The program goes into the causes and effects of sight and sound in relationship to age and other factors.  I am using it in my art class to tell students how they see and how they can train their eyes and brain to work together to really see the world as it is vs. how our brain tells it is.,1248393600,11,359,3.7733333333333334
8322436,1,B001MYIPZA,"I contacted the sellers with my new address to send it to once the package was returned to them.  I went back to the old address for a week and nothing came.  I asked some else to check the following week but to no adval.  I contacted the seller to let them be aware of the change in address if returned, I heard nothing from them.  This is not the service from your sub-contators I am use to.  I hope you can straighten them out.
