2620720,4,B000GYI3C2,"Loved it. Saw it on TV but missed the first half. Loved the re-enactments and the scenery. Wished it went into further detail on the earlier monarchs, as well as covered the monarchs after BPC.",1168732800,2,193,4.542857142857143
2620721,3,B000GYI3C2,"This is a great series but although advertised and labeled as close-captioned, my copy is not close captioned and does not even list close-captioning or sub-titles as a menu option.  Is mine defective or has anyone else had this problem?",1168300800,5,237,4.925
2620722,5,B000GYI3C2,"I received this as a Christmas gift, and it is now one of my favorites! The costumes are gorgeous, the narration compelling. I consider myself to be an amateur Tudor historian, and I learned a lot watching this documentary. Fans of this might enjoy Henry VIII's ""Six Wives,"" also by Starkey. I lent out my copy, and never got it back. That's how good it is!

(I plan on buying a replacement shortly.)",1167177600,5,400,4.47945205479452
2620723,5,B000GYI3C2,"All Starkey's work is a careful and accurate study of whatever or whomever the subject may be.  Met him in London and he signed my Elizabeth I.  He's so very knowledgeable, kind, and warm with his fans!  This one is terrific, too!",1163030400,5,230,4.428571428571429
2620724,4,B000GYI3C2,"I watched this entire series on PBS, and it has to be one of the best historical series I have ever seen.  Starkey is great.  He covers the material very well and does a great job bringing out the importance of the events and ideas of the English monarchy throughout its 1,000 year history.  The series ends with the Restoration of the Stuarts to the throne of England and Scotland, a convient place to end an episode, certainly, but it left me wanting more.  The monarchy of Charles II is still a far cry from the British Monarchy of today or the American presidency (Starkey makes it clear that monarchies can have elected heads with titles other than king or queen).

Where is the coverage of the crises surrounding James II, The Glorious Revolution, or the ways in which the monarchy changed in the 18th and 19th century under the Hanovers?  The Abdication of Edward VII and the divorce of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer?  What might the reign of Charles III or William V be like?  I hope Starkey makes a second series of Monarchy, it is needed.",1161561600,19,1051,4.523809523809524
2620755,5,B000GYI3C2,"I know the title of this collection is ""Monarchy"" but the history of the monarchy in England is the history of England.  This rendition is particularly good.  The backgrounds for the telling of the history are the actual places the events took place.  The art, architecture, and scenery are very much a part of the telling.  The programs are informative and beautiful.  Part 2 of this two part series is just as good!",1240185600,3,417,4.657534246575342
2620756,4,B000GYI3C2,"will still leave a person wanting more.  For what it is, an introduction to the political relationship between the British monarchs and their subjects, this is a fascinating series.  This set examines the British monarchy from the period just after the collapse of the Roman empire until the return of Charles II and the restoration of the Crown following the death of Cromwell, the Lord Protector.  It accomplishes all this in just 6 hour-long episodes, and so, necessarily, moves at a breakneck speed, over more than a thousand years of British history.  As a result, much gets glossed over, and even more gets left out.  Queen Boudicca of the Iceni, who led a brutal revolt against the Romans in the 1st century isn't even mentioned. Alfred the Great (the only British monarch so styled) whizzes past so quickly that if you're not prepared for it, you might get whiplash.  Richard II's remarkable role in quelling a peasant uprising while still a mere boy is unremarked upon, I could go on, and on.

Instead, I'll focus on the series strengths, which is an in-depth look at how the relationship between the monarchy and its people shaped not just the British government, but also that of the United States. The people of the British Isles, this series notes, were less tolerant of absolute monarchy than those of the Continent, and therefore, demanded and received more constraints on the power of their kings and queens.  Dr. Starkey focuses on the delicate balancing act that most monarchs had to maintain in order to stay in power.  Another great strength of this series is its discussion of the Protestant Reformation and its effect on the monarchy and the British people.  The religious conflicts of that age are a reminder of the law of unintended consequences.  Henry VIII just wanted to divorce his wife, and marry a woman whom he thought might give him a male heir.  His desperate actions in furtherance of this goal led to more than a hundred years of religious fighting, and tremendous loss of life.  He got his boy, eventually, but the kid didn't last much past his father.

As good as this series was, to me the most frustrating and inexplicable aspect of it is the knowledge that the series, as put out by the BBC in  the UK is actually much longer.  We're only getting a small slice of the delish pie.  I'd like to ask the Beeb, what gives?  Think your Merkin cousins don't have the stomach for the whole thing?  I'd suggest that they think again, and issue the whole series here in the US, the way they did  across the Pond. We've got enough appetite for the whole thing.

Therefore, I'm deducting one star for the insulting abridgment of this fine series.  I don't like being shorted.",1220140800,3,2704,4.6963906581740975
2620757,5,B000GYI3C2,"This is a wonderful way to learn all about the English Monarchy.  With so many movies out there with only entertainment value and no real historical value, it's refreshing to watch true history told to you truthfully and in a way that's entertaining.  It makes one enjoy learning some history!",1209340800,2,293,4.84
2620758,4,B000GYI3C2,"Very informative and entertaining series, but is stronger on the side of entertainment. Does not replace reading history books.",1204156800,,127,5.7368421052631575
2620759,1,B000GYI3C2,"This is an abridgement of Monarchy Series One and Monarchy Series Two, released in the UK. These were originally 11 episodes, but have been condensed into 6 episodes for the US release. Do yourself a favor and purchase the UK release of Series One and Two and see the story as it was meant to be told. You may need to buy an all-region DVD player to view DVDs from the UK, but given that US releases are often bastardized, this is not a bad investment.

Don't be fooled by the release of 'Set 2' in the US. That starts with Charles II and is equivalent to 'Series Three' of the UK release.",1187654400,93,589,4.212389380530974
2620760,5,B000GYI3C2,"David Starkey is a great historian. Sometimes he's a bit histrionic for my taste, but he's nonetheless a compelling storyteller. The material agrees with everything I have ever learned about the English monarchy. The presentation of  makes it 'come alive,' and allows the viewer to understand the agendas and motivations of the primary players in the drama. Well done.

However, where's the rest of the story? Ending at the beginning of Charles IIs Restoration period, there's lots left out. Is there a Series II?",1183334400,3,513,5.095238095238095
2620761,5,B000GYI3C2,"I agree with other reviewers that David Starkey's ""Monarchy"" provides a wonderful overview of the British monarchy from William the Conqueror to Charles II.  Given the constraints of fitting so much history into just six hours, much background information is lost.

For those wanting more comprehensive information, an excellent resource is a 48-lecture college course ""History of England From the Tudors to the Stuarts,"" taught by Dr. Robert Bucholz, Loyola University of Chicago.  The course is available on DVD from The Teaching Company.",1180396800,39,540,5.481927710843373
2620762,5,B000GYI3C2,"In this pageant, the history of the British monarchy is traced from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day House of Windsor. That covers a lot of ground and, even in a multi part documentary, would be hard to do with justice. This program succeeds by not focusing upon the individuals but upon the issues that shaped the monarchy. This usually devolves to whether or not the king has the upper hand in dealing with the crisis du jour.

This does not mean that the fascinating personalities that have comprised the monarchy are skimped over. Indeed, it is largely those personalities (and pecadillos) that shaped the crises and the responses to them. What emerges is a grand tapestry. I would highly recommend it. I could easily wish that more time would be spent on times and person who interest me more but to do so would detract from the grand sweep of things.",1180310400,6,871,4.583333333333333
2620763,2,B000GYI3C2,"I am dismayed to have to return this item. The content is fascinating. The volume was not. All thoughout both discs, the volume fluctuated wildly. I assume it is a problem with the reproducing of the digital signal and the man doing the reproducing was asleep at the volume knob.

Too bad. I would have loved to own this and watch it often as a study material. Not sure how to get a good copy.",1175990400,3,393,4.24
2620764,5,B000GYI3C2,"Dr. Starkey takes us on an epic adventure of intrigue, murder, revenge, and triumph. He makes the story of Britain's monarchy come alive through his energetic delivery, use of fine costumes and actors playing the historical characters, and the use of actual historical artifacts and historic settings. Not only is the series dramatic, but it's also highly informative, exploring in depth the development of Britain's monarchy as a political institution.

When Dr. Starkey describes with such great intensity things like the execution of Mary Queen of Scots, in the actual room where the execution took place 450 years ago, it's hard not to get caught up in the great intrigue and drama of Britain's monarchy.",1171238400,25,708,5.156521739130435

8135157,1,B000GYI3C2,"I was quite peeved when I got this expecting to be able to see series 3 and 4 which are missing from Netflix. it was COMPLETELY confusing on the website what was included in each set. I really wanted the entire series and this one said ""complete"" on it. VERY disappointed.",1307836800,2,272,4.352941176470588
8135158,5,B000GYI3C2,"I loved watching this series, despite Dr. Starkey's fondness for the word ""overweening.""  It's a great walk through British History.  However, the set I bought on Amazon only contains Episodes 1-16, which ends with the reign of Victoria.  There evidently is an episode 17 which covers the period from Queen Victoria's death and Edward's accession to the throne and goes through to the present reign of Elizabeth II.  I watched some of episode 17 on youtube.  However, it's not as nice as having the DVD to go with the rest of the episodes.  Amazon doesn't appear to be selling Episode 17 separately, so maybe it's not available in this country yet?  In any event, I recommend this series if you enjoy British history.",1306281600,,717,4.780487804878049
8135159,2,B000GYI3C2,"This BBC series started out mildly irritating (narrator David Starkey has an overly-dramatic voice that grates on me), but fairly informative.  As the timeline on England's monarchy continued, however, the writer's bias began to show through.

William the Conqueror is portrayed as the bad guy to beat all bad guys, while Henry II is portrayed as saint-like, with very little to back up the assertions being made on screen.  They managed to turn Henry II's argument with Thomas Becket into a good guy versus bad guy thing (talk about simplification!).  Perhaps the producers felt the general public was incapable of understanding anything more than that (an idea I very much disagree with).

Additionally, if you hope to find any mention of the women who were so important to English history, don't go looking for it here.  The production only mentions the women that they absolutely must (ie, a short bit on Matilda who briefly reigned over England).  Eleanor of Aquitaine, the woman who had as much influence on English history as Elizabeth I, gets *one* brief mention of her name only as Henry II's wife.

At this point, I stopped watching such biased history.

The focus was on ""manly exploits and accomplishments"" and heavily biased against the Church, women and any foreign influences (aside from the ones they couldn't avoid, such as the Norman Conquest) and it resulted in a heavily biased and unsatisfactory show.",1298419200,4,1422,5.017021276595744
