2542540,5,B000EWBOCW,"This is a great workout, I collect a lot of workout DVD's, some of them collect dust, but not this one. This workout has a martial arts cardio section first, then Violet moves you into a martial arts inspired strength training workout, which is fantastic!!!! Being a Black Belt already with this DVD my moves have become stronger!",1167782400,2,330,4.706896551724138
2542541,3,B000EWBOCW,"Overall, this is a good supplement to a fitness routine.  It will probably not get you in shape like running or other cardio-intense activities, but it is good for toning and a little variety.  The best part are the squats - I can never seem to make myself do them on my own.

The annoying issues are:

1.  The two commercials that appear before you can get to the main screen.  You cannot fast-forward or skip these, so I turn the dvd on a few minutes before I want to start.

2.  The breaks between the segments are a bit too long, so it's hard to keep your  heart rate up.  If these breaks were shorter, the workout would be shorter.",1160697600,5,636,4.181818181818182
2542542,4,B000EWBOCW,"I've seen Violet's work in some of the Self dvds, and I thought she was good then and so I wanted to add this to my collection to do a little kickboxing.  She's a Kiwi and she's not quite as outgoing as other instructors I've seen, but she still knows her stuff and is motivating.  It's a low impact routine and the moves are fairly basic so you shouldn't find it hard to follow at all.  It's designed to burn fat and shape your whole body.  You will feel this the next day for sure.

You start with basic kickboxing moves and then your upper body by using slow movements and a body bar (you can't get them here in Australia - don't know why - so you could use a broom instead) and move onto faster moves using dumbells.  There are the usual kicks and squats but using the body bar to make it a bit more intense and then there is finally a great ab routine to finish it all off.  If you do this dvd right through from start to finish, it's about 50 minutes, and while it's not hard to follow, it's sure gonna make you sweat and burn fat.  I really like it.",1159228800,2,1056,4.043269230769231
2542543,4,B000EWBOCW,"After doing the DVD a few times, I'm finding my kicks and punches are so much better. Violet (a pretty Australian) does a great job of explaining all the moves - I love kickboxing but realised that I wasn't doing it correctly. I'm hoping to be able to take kickboxing classes at my gym. Violet is friendly without being overbearing - her cueing is great and is easy to follow. I get a great workout everytime. The person who gave her one star, was obviously not putting much muscle behind it - maybe she should work a little harder. I hope to see Violet in more DVDs.",1152662400,3,567,4.308411214953271
2542544,5,B000EWBOCW,"I LOVE this workout. I have always wanted to get into kickboxing and this DVD was perfect for me! I really like Violet and the way she breaks everything down. Apparently she is a black belt, and certainly looks the part. The workout is great - I really felt it the next day. If you follow the instructions, and do the workout with precision, you will see result. I do the DVD every other day and find that it has made a difference. I hope to see Violet in other DVDs. She also has abs of steel - something I'm striving for.",1152662400,4,523,4.137254901960785
2542545,1,B000EWBOCW,As much as I love Violet this one is really dissaponting. I had such high expectations and it turned out to be very slow not your cardio program at all.,1152316800,5,152,4.1
8115183,3,B000EWBOCW,"There are a few commercials at the beginning of this that takes 4 minutes and there's no way to fast forward or skip them. It's really frustrating. I don't want to do this DVD sometimes because, as a mother of two small children, every minute counts. The workout itself is okay, though kind of dull.",1327968000,,299,4.454545454545454
8115184,5,B000EWBOCW,"I have to say this is my second workout video, by Violet Zaki.  I like this DVD because it's not complicated to follow.  I'm still in my beginning stages of aerobic execise routines, but by far I'm not a beginner to cardio execise.  I really like this DVD.  The better condition I get in, the more I can step it up a notch beyond what she is doing, and still stay in sync with her.  I really believe Violet Zaki is great at what she does.  Violet Zaki has a easy personality, and really keeps me motivated.  While using her DVD my mind seems to not wander to different things.  She's a great conditioning coach.",1323561600,,611,4.252173913043478
8115185,5,B000EWBOCW,A very good workout also purchased 2 other Violet Zaki dvd workouts and they are great too.  I workout 5-6 days a week.,1269561600,,119,4.173913043478261
8115186,3,B000EWBOCW,"I too was expecting from the cover and title a kick butt cardio workout.  Instead, I got a DVD for beginners who want to strength train to build up to kickboxing.  I enjoyed the workout, but treated it as something I woudl do on a recovery day rather than a tough workout.  It is great for beginners in that it teaches you intermediary steps to doing punches and kicks, as well as teaching your form.",1225929600,3,400,4.306666666666667
8115187,3,B000EWBOCW,"I liked this dvd overall but it loses a star for the ads. As others have pointed out, the ads at the beginning should be optional. It might be interesting to check out promos for the others in the series, but not more than once.

The breaks between segments were fine for me. I did jumping jacks and kept the heart rate up.

The thing I liked most about this video was the way she taught the back kick. I have a hard time doing them and her method helped.

The ""mambo bonus"" was only 5 minutes long, so don't figure it in to your purchase price. I think that bonus workouts under 10 minutes are a joke!",1208736000,,602,4.084745762711864
8115188,2,B000EWBOCW,"I guess I didn't read the other reviews that closely because the several minutes of inescapable commercials caught me by surprise (maybe because I've never seen that on an exercise DVD before?).  That was super annoying -- I have a new baby and hardly any time to myself to exercise, and I don't need the exercise dvd itself to give me a reason NOT to exercise.

On to the kickboxing -- I used to take Violet's classes regularly in Equinox gyms in NYC. She is amazing, high energy, with fast music and her class always attracts a group of people who are really motivated to be there and to work out. She will walk around and demonstrate moves right next to you if you are doing it wrong.  The video unfortunately was slow in comparison, with boring music and no energy.  I guess that if I could get through the ads in the beginning and then actually made myself do the whole workout, I would see some benefit, but it sits on the shelf, so it's not doing me any good.",1197849600,,966,4.320441988950276
8115189,4,B000EWBOCW,"Having been a fan of Violet since I discovered Cardiosculpt, I was anxious to add this DVD to my mix of exercise programs. It requires minimal coordination and no fancy footwork, so it didn't take me long to master the moves so I can focus on form and I really do feel it the next day or the day after. I am sweating at the end and that's what counts. It also makes good use of a body bar, which I had purchased some time ago and it's good to actually use it :). The workout covers both upper and lower body and has a nice challenging abs segment at the end. As for the lulls in action during the segments, I just keep my body moving and/or use the opportunity to have drink of water.",1183593600,,684,4.036764705882353
8115190,4,B000EWBOCW,I definitely am improving on my punches and kicks with this video.  Violet Zaki is a great instructor! At first I didn't really feel like this was a cardio workout but then I began focussing more on my form and I definitely began feeling it.  The one thing I think the video could improve on is the background. Very bland and sterile not bright and fun.,1178496000,,353,4.333333333333333
8115191,3,B000EWBOCW,"I'm not a beginner when it comes to home exercise dvds but I'm not an expert either.  As someone else has said on the board, there are 2 very annoying things about the dvd:

One, the first 5 minutes of the program are advertisements that you cannot fast forward or skip through.

Second, the breaks between each circuit is way too long.  I barely broke a sweat and if they kept it going faster, it might feel like I was doing a cardio workout.

On a plus side, the instructor explains proper form and goes through every move pretty thoroughly.  Overall, it's great for someone who is new but I wouldn't say this workout will kick your butt.",1173571200,12,640,4.38135593220339
8115192,5,B000EWBOCW,"This workout video will kick your [...]. If done properly, you will feel your efforts. I like it because it is not too difficult that I can't follow, but it is hard enough to work me out. I recommend this to anyone who wants results.",1167868800,,233,4.2
