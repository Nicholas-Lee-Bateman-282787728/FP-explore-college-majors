8206423,1,B000SQLC30,"This is an unauthorized autobiography.  The author is not critical of Kirk Franklin, but it is a low budget production.  There are interviews with people who are not close to Franklin.  The author did not spend much money for video clips. There is narration with still pictures, not very captivating.  There is a picture of Jeremiah Wright with no mention of his association with Kirk Franklin, if any.  Chronologically disjointed with some repetition.  What a testimony Kirk Franklin has!  They should have done much better.",1242432000,2,525,5.105882352941176
8206424,2,B000SQLC30,This was not at the deep look at Kirk Franklin I thought it would be.  I expected insite into the man who has changed lives through his music.  I was looking for interviews with Kirk and those who know him.  What I got instead was a recitation of already well known facts over snapshots taken from published articles and appearances.  In addition the quality of film was not very good.  It was certainly a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.  If you are looking for interviews and an up close look at the man and his music skip this.,1212451200,5,548,4.43
8206425,1,B000SQLC30,"Do not buy this DVD. It is an unauthorized biography that shows photographs of Kirk Franklin and interviews of people on the streets. They actually did re-enactments of ""supposed"" events in his life. A total waste of money. If I could give it a score of zero, I would.",1196294400,23,268,4.489795918367347
