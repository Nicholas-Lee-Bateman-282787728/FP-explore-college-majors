8133026,4,B000GIXICI,"Somewhat hyped at the time of it's release due to the dearth of intelligent documentaries about the hard `n' heavy end of the musical spectrum this DVD is not as good as Metal: A Headbangers Journey but does approach the level of goodness contained in Global Metal.

The main plus sides of this release is it doesn't get bogged down into some fandom style argument over what is metal. It takes the broad view of the whole hard rock/heavy metal genre being able to be lumped together into one overarching spectrum - which is a pleasant, mature and intelligent way of looking at things. A whole string of talking heads are used from the musicians themselves (Dio, Mustaine, Johnathon Davis, Paul Di Anno, Geezer Butler, Stephen Pearcy amongst others) to a bunch of behind the scenes chaps like producers and managers. As such it does give a broad overview of whatever facet is being discussed.

The documentary cruises along from some rough definitions of metal to the beginnings of the genre and certain aspects of its make up. The segments segue into one another quite nicely and this gradual movement through the DVD is perhaps where the filmmakers art has shone most brightly - it allows the viewer to feel like they are being carried along by the current. Truth to tell, the conversational style of the interviews actually makes the extended length of this work feel less of a burden and such is the richness of the overall genre at hand I could have sat through even more of it, quite willing to watch the DVD in hour long chunks.

Problems with this release are few however the way it is so US/UK centric is a little weird given that since the early to mid 90's most useful metal has quite pointedly NOT been coming from those areas for the most part. And while I have no doubt that Korn has it's place in metal history (whether I'm a fan or not) the simple fact is that Mr Davis seriously needs some elocution lessons - it's like listening to an expressionless teenager mumbling through some sort of play recital at school.

The extras were OK, mostly just added anecdotes that didn't make the final cut and a few odds `n' sods though the `mystery headbanger' segment will have you reaching for the fast forward button.

All up I'd buy this and the aforementioned Metal; A Headbangers Journey and Global Metal as an unholy triumvirate of intelligent discussion of this much maligned musical form.",1267228800,,2402,4.65566037735849
8133027,4,B000GIXICI,"You know you're dealing with a VH1-type of documentary the moment Dee Snyder rears his ugly head - which he does within the first 30 seconds of this DVD. I have no clue what Twisted Sister's contribution to Heavy Metal is supposed to have been; IMO, they were one of those bands that cleverly cashed in on the commercially successful hair and show metal bands of the 80s by pretending to persiflage them while actually taking themselves very seriously - but I digress.

I enjoyed this film because there don't seem to be that many intelligent documentaries about Heavy Metal around and this is one of them. Like any documentary about any genre of music, ""Heavy Metal - Louder Than Life"" cannot (and, as the directors explain in their commentary, does not even attempt to) present a complete history of the genre or mention all the bands that have contributed to it over the years. However, I think it gives a good overview over why and how Heavy Metal came into being and how it developed over the years. The documentary consists exclusively of (parts of) concert or video clips and interviews, which made it more interesting to me than a voice-over, distant, quasi-academic style documentary.",1263772800,,1193,4.79126213592233
8133028,2,B000GIXICI,"Not nearly as comprehensive as I had hoped,this book attempts to trace the history of the genre from it's inception in the late 60s through the modern day.
Alot of cool people are interviewed like Dio,Dee Snider,Dave Mustaine,Geezer Butler among others,but the information falls flat often.
The film has a difficult time defining the difference between Hard Rock and Heavy Metal,and misses many interesting bands to focus on newer acts like Korn and Slipknot,in an obvious stab at the youth market.
It never really works fully and many important eras like Thrash and the entire area of Power and Prog are eliminated.
Some music video clips,which are welcome,but it all feels somewhat hobbled together.
The result is rather glaring,too,considering the in depth examination offered on the superior,""Metal:A Headbanger's Journey"" documentary.
Sadly,even the take of the genre presented on VH1 was more enteratining.

Die hards may want to give this a glance,all others can feel free to skip.",1233014400,4,988,5.292993630573249
8133029,3,B000GIXICI,"The central purpose of the film is to set up a panoramic view of the heavy metal scene from its begining with Black Sabbath to recent efforts such as Korn and Slipknot. In this way, the documentary fullfills its objective. Well informed, with key commentors such as Dee Snyder and Jonhattan Davis, and enough examples of the sounds they're talking about. Perhaps the only fault (but this is something common in this kind of TV oriented pieces) is the lack of analysis of the Extreme Heavy Metal Movement around the world. But, if you're looking for some informed entertainment the picture is quite good.",1209772800,,603,4.8076923076923075
8133030,2,B000GIXICI,"Not considering the content, this documentary has one design defect, which is not presenting labels between the chapters. In one scene, it's talking about vocals in Heavy Metal....and in another, changes to drums, or other topic, without any further explanation. Of course one can understand what is been talking about, but a bit of organization of the content would be welcome.
Now talking about the content: the documentary has great moments, especially at first half, which discuss the origins of heavy metal (the pro-metal bands of 60's and 70's, and the further development of heavy metal in 80's). But, with rare exceptions, it's focused just in the heavy metal of United States and U.K, as the rest of the world didn't exist. The storyline considered that the heavy metal in 80's was represented by trash metal in U.S (and few considerations about death metal). Further, it's explained that in beginning of the 90's, the great force of metal was Pantera. Ok, I agree that Pantera was a great band, but there was some overreacting. After, the reputation of the documentary is put on the ground: it considerer that KORN (yes, believe me, KORN!!!) were the great heroes and innovators of heavy metal in 90's! And it didn't stop, Slipknot is considered a great band too, with comments that really pissed me off, like: ""They get various influences, from trash, death, black, hip-hop, and get the ""best"" (believe me....he used this word) from it at their music"". The ""noise"" that this band does can barely be considered METAL...but considerer that what they do is the ""best"" of many glorious styles is a big heresy....
It's difficult to understand why many good and influent bands (like Kreator, Destruction, Mercyful Fate, Sepultura, Death, Dimmu Borgir, among many others) are not even cited, while those garbage bands like Korn and Slipknot are raised to status of ""Metal God's"". This is the main reason to the low rate of my review.",1204502400,4,1937,4.9447852760736195
8133031,3,B000GIXICI,"Rock anthology is of a great historic value for, especially, a volume of not-so-often-aired recording provided, although tunes might be longer as commentaries shorter for better appreciating of this comprehensive three-hours-something work.",1196121600,,240,6.53125
8133032,4,B000GIXICI,"This is a good documentary of the origins and the development of what has become to be known as heavy metal. This has a ton of first hand interviews with Geezer Butler, Dave Mustaine, Dio, Steven Pearcy, Dee Snyder, Scott Ian and others...  The list goes on.  They tell some of their stories, confirm some of the legends, and give thier opinions on why Metal is here, and why it's going to stay.  This does not give a great timeline, nor a history of Metal, just a rough family tree, but not as much of an in depth look at the different genres like ""metal: a headbangers journey"".  Between this film and ""Metal"", rock fans can become enlightened about their music they are listening too.  Worth a rent or a buy.",1174089600,5,711,4.396946564885496
8133033,5,B000GIXICI,"Get it!  Buy it!  Hell, steal it!  This is great material for any lover of HM and what makes it tick.  Dee Snider at his best, and a host of metal icons keep it true.  Prepare to revel in the music of your heart.  Cat",1167782400,2,217,3.7111111111111112
