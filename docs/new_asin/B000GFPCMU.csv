2607601,5,B000GFPCMU,"I love this TV movie, but it seems that it is on at inconvenient times for me - time, programming conflicts, etc.  By having my own DVD of the movie I can watch it any time I want to.  The price was right, the speed with which I received it was good and the condition in which it was received was excellent. There are a few other movies I want (especially TV movies which aren't on very often), if at all), and I now definitely now plan on ordering them, in fact, today.",1306368000,4,470,4.043010752688172

2607603,5,B000GFPCMU,"I watched this last night , and I loved it Vanessa marcil is a great actress. I loved that hunky detective Great pair vanessa and him. I really hated her husband.  but It had great acting and a great cast.",1217030400,7,205,4.125
2607604,3,B000GFPCMU,"TO LOVE HONOR AND DECEIVE is one of those somber, serious-themed tv movies of the late 90s that offers competent performances wasted on a connect the dot script, that once again shows the underhandedness of our dear friends with the FBI.

Vanessa Marcil gives a good performance as Sydnee, a devoted mother whose world is shattered when her husband and young son are killed in a boating accident.  After their deaths, however, Sydnee finds out some disturbing news:  hubby had an affair with her best friend (Rosalind Chao), and lo and behold, he was a smuggler, extortionist, and quite a few other things she never dreamed about.  Thomas Gibson (Greg and Dharma) sleepwalks through his role; James Wilder plays the handsome detective who falls in love with Sydnee; and Leland Orser plays the asthma-plagued FBI agent with his own agenda.

It isn't a bad movie, but it's slow pacing and excess padding keep it from being truly memorable.",1154736000,17,937,4.905063291139241
2607605,5,B000GFPCMU,"I purchased this movie because one of the actors (Fred Nash) was a dear friend who had recently passed away, and I wanted the opportunity to 'see and hear' him one more time. It was surreal, and I cried. And yes, I did keep going back to his scenes and replaying them - many times. But then I let the movie continue. And I really liked it. I love mysteries, and a strong, likable heroine. It's one of those movies I'll watch many times, and not just to see and hear my friend. xoxo Love you, Mr. Fred Nash, and miss you terribly.",1408233600,5,529,4.145631067961165

2607607,3,B000GFPCMU,"I guess better than this. Sydney is a former film editor who now is married with a six year old son, Adam, living in a beautiful huge house and doing whatever she wants to do. However, she has nightmares that she cannot find her son. It's her gut telling her something. She wants to invite her husband's parents to Adam's birthday party, but her husband puts the kibosh on that - at least he's tells her not to.

The next thing she knows he's taking her son out in a boat on a stormy day (or says he's going to anyway). The Coast Guard searches for them but finds nothing. Sydney holds a memorial service, then finds out that her ever present best friend had an affair with her husband.

Sydney is told there are discrepancies with her husband's accounting and there is no money. She continues to live in the huge house and drive her Volvo, so she is not affected by this news.  She slowly figures out that her husband is a con man and liar (she looks for his parents without success) and believes that he has run off with her son. Why? A psychopath would not take the kid unless it would do him some good, instead of weigh him down. So this premise is faulty.

Detective Sanders (James Wilder) tries to help her when her house is broken into but instead of being much of a help, he becomes infatuated with her and seems to lose his reasoning abilities. The FBI character, Special Agent Lassiter, is totally goofy and weird. Do they expect us to believe that the FBI would actually hire such a person? Are they that hard up? Of course he has to have asthma and use his inhaler whenever he gets nervous, which is a lot.

Sydney does all the investigating herself. She is strong and sure and never really upset about not having her son or knowing if he's really alive or his whereabouts. She goes out and has a good time with Det. Sanders. I will say Vanessa Marcil is beautiful, has beautiful hair, and whoever picked her outfits did a good job as they look timeless and not trendy for the 90's.

Nicholas Bennett (William Moses) is the ""bad"" guy; very slick, smooth and brags on his sociopathy. Moses appears to have come straight from the School of Soap Opera Acting. I could picture him better on ""Days of Our Lives.""

The end is kind of silly and certainly not what I would have done as I would have been gone, not waiting around for anyone....but Sydney does have a snappy comeback line in there that made me laugh.",1404172800,,2419,4.362222222222222

8131418,5,B000GFPCMU,Ordered a copy of this movie to finally see myself on-camera.  This movie was shot in NC with portions shot in Charlotte.  I was an extra in the scene where all the PTA mom's are at the lead characters house.  I'm on-screen for all of about 2 seconds but its 2 seconds I'll never forget.,1431216000,,287,4.181818181818182
8131419,4,B000GFPCMU,"This is a pretty good movie of it's type.  I've seen better and I've certainly seen worse.  It got sort of bogged down in whether or not the husband was a criminal or an FBI informant turned rogue.  Some of it was never explained.  Like how did the FBI ""know where he was all along""?  But, the heroine, though not a terrific actress, is adequate.  It was never explained how she continued to live in the huge gorgeous home when she was ""broke"".  I didn't understand why, when she finally found her son, she didn't just grab him and run back to her car but that wouldn't have fit with the last scenes, the big reveal so to speak.  The film continued to hold my interest and I enjoyed it.  I wished the detective hero would cut his hair instead of messing with it all the time but that is just a personal dislike.  I recommend it as an interesting, while away a couple of hours movie.",1428710400,,882,4.227544910179641
