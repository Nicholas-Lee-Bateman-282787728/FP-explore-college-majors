8544150,5,B009SRALXM,Steve does an amazing job guiding and directing people through Church history.  I was very impressed with the information and found it well researched and accurate.  I believe both Catholics and especially non Catholics would benefit from this series.  There are also some areas that very clearly explain some heretical attacks on the Church and assist the listener in understanding how to defend the truth of the Church.,1410739200,3,421,5.161764705882353
