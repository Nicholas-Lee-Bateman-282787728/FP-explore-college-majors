I would have preferred it took itself seriously as it was touching upon a very ""sensitive"" and serious topic. And that is, where the heck did Kennyboy suddenly go?  He just disappeared.  (Not likely!) It was as if the director needed to have a bit more courage (and take his topic seriously) and avoid much of the harmless jocular knocking about. The banks win again.",1464998400,,506,4.43010752688172

8550264,5,B00ADU2EQ0,"Loved this first effort from director Justin Wood.  A delightful, entertaining tour through pop culture in the form of a sly action flick. Screened at the Buffalo Film Festival and at Seattle's True Independent Film Festival to excellent reviews.  Appropriate for ages 10 and up--my teens enjoyed it too.",1354838400,,304,5.183673469387755
