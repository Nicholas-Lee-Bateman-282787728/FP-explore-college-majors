8695551,1,B00RM5VBQ8,"So far as I remember this author had a degree from a diploma mill and advertised herself as a doctor for years. She is very quick to jump and label all doctors as quacks when she herself was advertising herself as a doctor from an unaccredited school for many years. Now she claims to have an honorary degree which is what any celebrity like kanye west got. That does not make you a doctor .In addition she orders blood under a chiropractors name who is not practicing on the premises. She is practicing medicine without a license in California .Who is a fraud here? Up to 8 holistic physicians connected to Florida or residing in florida have been killed or deaths are mysterious including Dr. Jeff Bradshaw,Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez etc..These people were not quacks and lost their life and you wonder why doctors are paranoid. Medical boards are taking their licenses if they try do anything outside the box as well as the FDA is raiding their offices. And yet these people like Joyce Johnson are so quick to call us quacks. You need to remove the speck out of your own eye first as Jesus said. Do not judge someone unless you have walked in their shoes which you have not .",1443657600,,1173,4.511737089201878
