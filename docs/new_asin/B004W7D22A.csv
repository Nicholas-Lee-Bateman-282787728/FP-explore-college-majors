It's pretty fast at times. However, if you are into Blues you can never have too many DVD instructions. Is not really clear on WHAT are you supposed to know by the end of week 1 since it covers several concepts. I did not watch the whole thing yet, only about 1/3 of it.",1394150400,,445,4.186046511627907
8444729,5,B004W7D22A,I purchased this item a month ago and just got around to watching it.  I actually really like the material as the instructor does keep it simple and does not spend 15-20 minutes of the tape tuning a guitar and another 30 minutes showing off and about 5-10 minutes of instruction.  This tape jumps right into it the teacher assumes that you do know some guitar but if you know no guitar it will just take a little longer to get what he is saying.  This tape is head and shoulders above most other beginner titles and can easily be entitled the first 2-4 weeks of instruction rather than week 1.  A lot of material is covered and is worth the purchase price.  If the other volumes are as good as this it you will make a great headway into the blues.,1289174400,2,747,4.232394366197183
