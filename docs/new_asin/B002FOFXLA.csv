8369291,3,B002FOFXLA,"After I bought this DVD that only has 4 episodes, I found out that Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian.  The complete series should be ready roughly around December 2014.",1319500800,2,443,4.986486486486487
