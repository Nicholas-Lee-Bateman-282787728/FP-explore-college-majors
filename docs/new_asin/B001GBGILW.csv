3598572,5,B001GBGILW,"I have other workout dvd's by Tom Stroup and in each one he promises to work you out from your head to your toes and delivers each and every time!

Instructor: I have a library of over 100 fitness dvds and he is truly one of the best. He walks the walk and gets into the workout with you, but has none of that nervousness or silliness or filling any silences with silly comments...he's charming, funny, and a great coach that gives me enthusiasm.

Cueing: one of the best. You'll be able to follow every move with ease, know whats coming next and therefore utilize every second of the video. There is no stumbling or having to rewind to learn your moves in this video...great cueing

Set: I enjoy the settings in each of his 3 dvds that I have. Always hip and fun indoors with lots of really fit and energetic girls motivating you all around Tom. You will feel like you are in the midst of a really great workout class with a top instructor.

The moves: As you do the band you'll feel your muscles working. As you advance you can change your band so you continue to have results. But yowza, this one works like no other! It is impossible for you to not gain muscle with this one!! And I'm all about that because muscle burns calories even while you sleep and increases that metabolism!

Caloric burn: While strength training is a must, most of us love to burn some calories while doing a fitness dvd and I am no exception. My heart rate monitor gives this one  an A plus for strength training AND caloric burn!

Results...ladies and gentleman, the next day you will have NO DOUBT you had a great and effective workout.

tips: I don't think you need to do the warmup on this one. The beginning of the dvd is a good enough warm up so I often skip that.

ONLY NEGATIVE: the band that comes with this is different than the ""hose"" style resistance bands seen in the video which could be confusing on some moves to some. It was fine for me but I prefer more resistence anyway so I just used my bands at home. Either will actually work fine.

Level: this will push an advanced fitness buff but will work fine for a beginner as well because his instruction is always mega clear so you do everything perfect with no injuries. You can just slow your reps if you are a beginner.

CONCLUSION: He remains one of my favorite instructors and this dvd packs a punch in building muscle and burning calories for any use. LOVE IT!",1244505600,18,2411,4.335555555555556
3598573,5,B001GBGILW,"This is my third S.W.A.T. workout and all three are good workouts. This workout is challenging, yet Commander Tom is a great instructor and makes the workout enjoyable. I will buy any new S.W.A.T. workouts that come out in the future",1233360000,6,233,4.7073170731707314
3598574,3,B001GBGILW,"I like working the the handled tubing; this product comes with a band, not tubing like they use in the workout but if you don't have the tubing this will do. Typical exercises: curls, squats, overhead presses, push-ups. It is an okay workout.  I have a couple other SWAT workouts and use them as an alternate to my regular routine of Forza.",1230768000,9,340,4.483870967741935
3598575,4,B001GBGILW,"My Dr. told me I needed to start doing some resistance training.  They suggested I get a band.  So I bought a set with different weight ranges for each band but the instructions were not clear.  I searched for a workout video that I could do with it.  There are not many out there for tube band resistance.  After reading reviews for this dvd about the band that comes with video not being good.  I figured I had my tube band was not sure but I decided might as well get it.  I have to say this is really a great resistance toning workout.  I'm a beginner to resistance training but the instructions are very clear on how to do the exercises.  Just the warm up works all the major muscles.  I switch sometimes between the warm up and doing the toning work out for my resistance training workouts.  I bought a set of bands that has a different band for each weight (5,10,15) I don't see myself getting bored with this workout for a long time since as i progress I have the other weight ranges to use and build on and I know that will be a while.  There is also a core/ab workout I'm a beginner so I have not been able to get thru that workout alittle to advance for me.  If you are looking for a resistance training workout that you can do at home or anywhere I recommend this workout. Oh and as far as the tube bands go over time you may have to buy new ones since they can become warn out and you don't want them to snap on you. I would not read too much into the reviews about the bands it is worth it to buy it seperate.  The video is worth the price.",1378598400,,1554,4.052459016393443
3598576,5,B001GBGILW,Excellent toning exercise program.  Resistance bands are not helpful.  They are really short for a beginner like me. Count not use them.,1371513600,,136,5.136363636363637
3598577,1,B001GBGILW,"I'm sure that the workout is great, but I couldn't even get through the warm up because the band that they include is entirely too short to use.",1365120000,,144,4.178571428571429
3598578,5,B001GBGILW,Band was not as useful- but not necessary to get a great workout with this video. Tom does a great job!,1362528000,,103,3.9523809523809526
3598579,1,B001GBGILW,This product came to me twice without the resistance band and I was trying not to open tne sealed CD until I got the Band but as I said no band came with it.,1360281600,,157,3.6470588235294117
3598580,5,B001GBGILW,"This is an excellent strength and tone workout that easily substitutes for the gym on days you can't or don't want to go. Commander Tom moves quickly from one exercise to the next but not so fast that you can't follow and the cueing is good.

I appreciated other reviewers noting that the resistance band that's included with the DVD is not the same kind that they use on the DVD. (Its a flat band rather than the tubing with handles.) I was fine with that, figuring I'd check out the workout first before investing in the tubing. Given that, I was pretty dissappointed to find that I couldn't do the very first exercise in the warm up (overhead shoulder presses) because the band was too short! (And no, I""m not abnormally tall..) I'm glad I didn't give up though. I bought a resistance band for about $16 and tried again and it was really worth it. Yes, that increases the price of the workout beyond what some might be willing to pay, but for me it was worth it. I like the DVD and will incorporate it into my weekly routine.

As for which band to get? I bought the ""light"" one and admit that the first time through the program I still struggled to complete all the reps on some of the exercises. I'm just getting back to strength training after many years away and this worked well for me. I almost bought the ""very light"" one but I think that would have been too easy. Of course, if you are already doing weight training or are a more serious fitness buff, you may want to try the ""medium"". But even Commander Tom starts with the light one, so keep that in mind.

Hope others like this DVD as well. I'll be trying the SWAT Ultimate Body Definition one next. Fingers crossed...",1358035200,5,1681,4.3471337579617835
3598581,4,B001GBGILW,Great Resistance Band Workout.  The commander has concise instructions and good workout.  It was not as strenous as I thought it would be.  I would definitely recommend it for a change of pace.,1356652800,,193,4.787878787878788
3598582,5,B001GBGILW,"I didn't know what to expect from this DVD workout. I recently switched over to resistance bands
And wanted a good resistance band workout DVD.Well....all I have to say is that this is Awesome!!!
The workout is 23 minutes, but thats enough for me. It also has a 10 minute warm up and followed
By an extra 10 minute workout that just focus on core/abs.

After 30 years of hard core free weights, at the age of 51, i finally switched over to resistance bands
to avoid The joint pains and tendernitus. Well I still get a great workout and I still get gains.

5 Stars for this DVD.

3598583,1,B001GBGILW,"Be warned: this product may not come with the resistance band. Because of this, I feel the price is not justified. Receiving a product like this is of course disappointing. I did leave feedback about the packaging with Amazon, but as of yet have had no reply. This leaves me with going to the trouble of returning it or buying bands separately. I have bought many many items from Amazon and this is only the second time I have had something that didn't work - or is missing a part, as in this case. Save yourself a hassle and buy a different product!",1344643200,,550,4.349514563106796

3598585,5,B001GBGILW,"This a great 20 minute workout video, exactly what I was looking for. The only problem is the resistance band was not included in the package. I sent it back to Amazon and asked for a replacement which I recieved the same day I sent the first one back. The second package also did not contain the resistance band so I sent that back as well and asked for a refund. I'm very happy I did not order this as a gift for someone. I give the video 5 stars but Amazon gets zip on fulfilment but 5 stars on service. The return process couldn't have been easier. There are other mail order companies who would do well to follow Amazon's example and make returning a product as easy as it is to order one.",1325289600,4,694,4.148148148148148
3598586,1,B001GBGILW,Can't say enough bad things about this dvd. I own tons of fitness videos and this is one of the worst I've used.  It's short and not a challenge at all. SWAT is the wrong title for this dvd.  No one who has any physical fitness background would use this,1318896000,2,253,4.04
3598587,5,B001GBGILW,"Ok, so the first time I watched this video I was laughing because of the staging and the girls but honestly, it's a great workout video.  They all grow on you, he's funny and motivating, the girls do a great job with form and 20 minutes flies by in no time.  I love resistance band workouts and I highly recommend it.  Just get over the initial hokeyness and the rest is great!",1306108800,5,377,4.208333333333333
3598588,1,B001GBGILW,"I really looked forward to doing this workout, but when I started playing the dvd, I was laughing too much to be able to effectively do it.  The instructor is a physically fit man who seems to know his stuff, but it's laughably distracting that he is surrounded by hard bodied women with large breast implants who wear extremely tight hot pants throughout the workout.  If it weren't so ridiculous, I would be offended.  Too bad that I can't return this.  The Jillian Michaels workouts are much more worth the money.",1303344000,9,516,4.637362637362638
3598589,4,B001GBGILW,Good toning work-out.  Can use bands or weights.  It also includes a 15 minute ab workout as well.,1282262400,,98,4.388888888888889
3598590,3,B001GBGILW,"I work out consistently, usually rotating yoga, cardio, cycling, and weights. I purchased this DVD to switch up using weights with the band instead. The workout is pretty basic, in that you probably won't find it particularly challenging if you are maintain a high-intermediate to advanced level of fitness.  However, the instructor makes this interesting, keeps it moving, and he's funny. I feel it burning, especially the ab portion of the workout, but I have to get different tubular bands. The workout itself is heavy on the arms and chest muscles and kind of glosses over the legs and no bun work out and I didn't find it aerobic in the least. If you want to mix up your routine, this offers an alternative worthy of including in the weekly or bi-weekly rotation.",1279065600,9,768,4.774436090225564
3598591,5,B001GBGILW,"I love these SWAT workouts!  I have every one of the now, and each are different.  Great for toning, great for weights, great for cardio!  2 different kinds of ABS workouts on two different DVDs, and all are quite worth the money and time investment!",1268179200,,250,4.511111111111111
3598592,4,B001GBGILW,I used weights instead of resistance bands and did leg lifts during the arm segment to kick the workout up a notch. Great ab section. I enjoy this workout and recommend it.,1252800000,,172,4.40625
3598593,5,B001GBGILW,"I was looking for something that was not just another boring 1-2-3 workout & this is it!  The pacing is excellent, ""Commander Tom"" is personable & keeps you motivated throughout this fast-paced DVD.

Time is at a premium for me & this DVD lets me do a challenging workout quickly.  If you haven't been in shape before, you'll have to work up to this slowly.  If you HAVE been in shape & want to get there again quickly, this is your answer! You'll work all major muscle groups in a workout that takes about 20 minutes (& seems to fly by quicker than that--it's really fast paced & fun).

You'll work your shoulders, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, calves, chest & back muscles.  As you advance, feel free to ""up"" the level of resistance with higher resistance bands (I'd advise you to start with a light resistance band until you see how many reps you can comfortably do--remember, ""Form is King"").

Very nice optional warm-up workout, too.  Not a necessity, since the main workout itself has its own warmup set, but the light warm-up workout would be a great place for a beginner to learn how effective resistance band workouts really are.

The extra ab workout will work wonders on your tummy in no time (if you can keep up with Tom--I'm not quite there yet & spend some of my ab time recovering on the floor : ).  He DEFINITELY practices what he preaches--his abs are tight & strong & yours will be too if you can do this workout from start to finish.

Resistance work is a health necessity for ANYONE over 40; if you think you can keep in optimum shape by doing cardio alone, you are sadly mistaken.  Get with the program!  Muscle mass = stronger body = younger body.  Also, more muscle means a higher resting metabolic rate (you'll burn lots more calories even when just sitting still).

The PLUS side of that story is that by investing in this DVD and an inexpensive set of resistance bands (like these:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SPRI-ES501R-Xertube-Resistance-Band-with-Door-Attachment-and-Exercise-Charts-Red-Medium/dp/B0000AJ050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SPRI ES501R Xertube Resistance Band with Door Attachment and Exercise Charts (Red, Medium)</a>), you can equal the results of an expensive home gym (think Bowflex, Hoist).

This workout really is a lot of fun & will definitely tone your body quickly--highly recommended!",1248393600,24,2375,5.098191214470284

8304801,5,B001GBGILW,"As I age, I look to STILL exercise BUT utilize a safer way of doing it. Resistance Bands fit the bill perfectly and may I add ,is just not for an older guy. Young and old can get a GREAT workout with resistance bands AND this DVD. Commander Tom is very personable and very easy to follow. The DVD has a number of sections starting with a good warm up, followed by a regular routine . One important note, don't expect to use the resistance band enclosed. It is a flat latex sheet and really can't be used to follow any routines that utilize TUBE resistance bands. I had purchased a Bodylastic set of resistance bands, that are reasonably priced on Amazon and work great with this workout DVD. The set included very comfortable handles, a door attachment and I love the idea of metal clips to attach the bands to the handles. But BACK to this DVD. Commander Tom makes it very easy to follow different routines. Your not too rushed but you can still work up a good sweat. He ALWAYS stresses FORM over speed and more resistance. He adds in push-ups, and lunges  with options of doing them in a safer way. As you progress, you can either increase your speed , add a harder band or both. My suggestion is to take it slow and GRADUALLY proceed . You won't believe the options there are in purchasing more intense bands to give you an even more strength training workout. All in all the best DVD I have found utilizing resistance bands.",1422748800,6,1428,4.388679245283019

After reading the reviews of this product from other customers I went in expecting not to receive the bands. A numebr of reviews have the samecomplaint (NOTE TO AMAZON).  But other than that the CD is awesome. The instructor is very precise and seems to be excited about the workout. This is my first time using bands and I am now hooked!
