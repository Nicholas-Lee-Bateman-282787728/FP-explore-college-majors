8674061,5,B00MQSCJJE,"This dvd is worth it for KONTAKTE alone in surround sound.  This is the first time that this work, probably the most important electroacoustic work of all time (and which still sounds fresh and astounding) has been available to the public in its intended form as a spatial experience.  The performance of MIKROPHONIE I is a bit too ""calm"" for my tastes, but REFRAIN, SCHLAGTRIO are both fine renditions.
