3966189,4,B002Q3NPSS,"It's Christian. Crisply so. But watch the bonus REAL murderess interview first. It's potent, and will demonstrate who realistic and powerful the film's portrayal truly was. In reality: Karla Faye Tucker was arrested Sep 1983, convicted 1984, and executed Feb 3, 1998. It was the amazing personal reversal of her life inside prison, and the media coverage, that made her case so noteworthy. This DVD depicts what happened as good as any I've seen. She was a religious-witnessing icon, so expect the movie to take that approach.

Overall, Karla (Karen Jezek) is played (and looks) like the real killer. The actress has a Dolly Parton voice and a couple/three scenes seeming a bit hokey, like the arrest flashback, and the prep to the execution. A bit over-the-top; but overall, acting was realistic, as shown by the footage of the real pick-axe murder.
A summation KFT quotation: ""It's about God, about redemption."" She was forgiven and saved but still required to pay the costs of her sin. God is forgiving but also just. This film shows both--unlike many other faith-based movies. In real life, killer KFT truly accepted judgment with God's love, grace, and forgiveness. It made real-life headlines.
Speaking of Judge; the film's Judge actress (Pamela Carter) was also producer and make-up. She looked overdone when first shown entering her office, more like a hooker than judge.
A prison official actress (Helen Gibson) was more influential to this film as producer, director, and writer. Some of the script was the real KTF's words.

NO SUBTITLES or CC. Bonus: 2 min Dir interview; 30 mins of interview with the real KFT; 70 pix slideshow with music; 5 trailers

You will also hear a Ray Boltz and a Phil Driscoll music performance. Good points.
Only 4 stars awarded since there was a few improbable scenes. But yet recommended teens-and-up viewing. This criminal was a beautiful but preachy gal, expect it. I'm trying to help buyers, so if you don't like preachy, don't purchase this DVD.",1321056000,15,1991,4.972972972972973
3966190,5,B002Q3NPSS,This is a powerful story. Whhat she destroyed during her free gave her a opportunity to be a testament to the mercy of God at the end. It showed hope for everyone to be forgiven dispite what they have done. God is much bigger,1431907200,,225,4.136363636363637

3966197,5,B002Q3NPSS,"This is a very touching movie that really shows how God can change people's lives.  She was a murderer who got the death penalty in Texas... and the prison guards just loved her because in her 14 years there she became an incredible loving person. They felt bad tying her down for injection..., and even then she said,  ""It's OK. You didn't put me here, my sins put me here.""

3966203,1,B002Q3NPSS,"I don't understand the praise for this movie. It's supposedly about the religious awakening of Karla Faye Tucker, and it focuses a lot on her relationship with Dana Brown. The problem is in the script, that doesn't let the viewer get to know Karla and see her character develop. She gets converted to Christianity in the very beginning of the movie and then the Christian message is repeated again, and again, and again, for the next two hours when it feels like there's no more story to tell. So instead of any real plot we get random scenes like the lengthy scene where Karla performs a gospel song in sign language.

Karen Jezek does a pretty good job as Karla Faye Tucker, as does Ann Ault as a chaplain. The director, Helen Gibson, is laughable as the prison warden, as are some of the flashback sequences.

The Karla Faye Tucker story could have been made into a good movie, but ""Forevermore"" fails. Helen Gibson seems to have had good intentions but she should have hired a competent writer. The DVD bonus features were more interesting than the movie itself.",1383868800,4,1066,4.634920634920635

3966207,5,B002Q3NPSS,"I can say without a doubt, that Forevermore is one of the most moving and wonderfully done movies that I have ever watched.  And I love the acting, the storyline and how the movie was put together.

Forevermore is an emotional movie.  I cannot say enough good things about the acting.  I felt as though I were right there, witnessing events as the movie unfolded.  Karen Jazek gave such a perfect performance as Karla Faye Tucker.  I have recommended Forevermore to everyone I could.

This movie will be remembered long after most movies are forgotten.  It is that unforgettable.  I highly recommend Forevermore, and any movie made by the production company, Pure Flix.",1374624000,,669,4.849557522123894
3966208,3,B002Q3NPSS,"I first heard about Karla Faye Tucker through a Word Pictures/Cross TV film called ""Pardon for the Worst of Sinners"" which talks about Karla Faye, David Berkowitz, and some other criminals who become forgiven by Christ through the power of salvation. ""Forevermore"" depicts the life of Karla Faye, her crimes, conversion to Christianity, her and her husband's relationship, her influence on others, and finally, her death. I actually recently saw the film on a Youtube station that put the movie up with the filmmakers' permission. I'm pretty sure that I saw a few interviews of Karla Faye's testimony on that youtube channel first, which led me to watch the film. This movie definitely brought tears to my eyes and I was able to relate to it on so many levels, just to be able to remember that not only can Christ save anyone so true Christians need to be fervently sharing the Gospel with others, but I was also able to see that because of Christ's forgiveness, believers do have the power to forgive and love others, just like Karla was able to forgive those who thought that her testimony was ""fake."" Karla's testimony gives me hope and encouragement in the Lord, and the characters do a wonderful job portraying their roles. (I especially love how the relationship between Karla and her husband is depicted and played out; I never even knew that she was married while in prison until I saw this movie).

The only ""con"" that I find with the movie is that even though I believe that Karla was a genuine believer, some of the parts of the movie are a little bit too ""Charismatic"" for my taste; I also don't like a lot some of the interviews done with the cast members in which some charismatic terminology and extra-biblical phrases are used (such as the 'mantle of Karla' being present with them; 1 Samuel 28 clearly tells us that it's wrong to talk to the dead and that dead people are not present with us--this is a wrong view that some charismatics have picked up from catholic mysticism beliefs and those views are very dangerous and I believe soul damning if not forsaken). However, I do recommend the film overall and the interviews done with the real Karla Faye Tucker are definitely encouraging and inspirational; it's also wonderful to watch the real Karla dancing at the end of the film.",1373500800,3,2299,4.6905940594059405

I remember the day she was executed it was on the radio and I thought to myself, well she's paid her dues. Then once I watched the movie I saw how evil was part of her life until she found God. Kept wanting it to end differently but knew it wouldn't. Tissues definitely needed. And the actress did a great job and she even resembled her. A must see movie.",1349827200,4,453,4.341176470588235

8377463,5,B002Q3NPSS,"To say that this movie was a tearjerker for me would be under-estimating the power of this movie to touch one's heart and soul. I can't remember when I've cried so much--not just tears--sobbing. We lost an angel when we lost Karla Faye Tucker. She could have done so much more good than she'd already done by turning people away from drugs and towards a life with the Lord. There is beautiful Christian music throughout this film which creates an extremely stirring effect. At the very end we get to see Karla Faye Tucker herself doing the sign language for a Christian song. We see how much she was loved by her husband (yes, she got married by proxy on Death Row). But there were no conjugal visits. Her husband was such a fine Christian himself that he was able to love her completely without ever experiencing a sexual relationship with her. Their dream was to have a prison ministry together.  Her death in 1998 by lethal injection for the pick-ax murder of a man and a woman broke her husband's heart, her prison chaplain's heart, and the hearts of countless Christians all over the world. Karla Faye Tucker was transformed by God, reminiscent of Paul's conversion in the New Testament. She went to her death filled with Christian love and kindness. One of the men assigned to putting her to death states as she lay on the gurney that he doesn't know how he can do his job--that he is Catholic and it's not in keeping with his faith. Karla states that she has sinned and that she is paying for her sins and that he shouldn't feel guilty. She was positively radiant with the love of the Lord. I just recently finished the book on her life which made me cry, but the movie really did a number on me! I recommend it highly.",1486425600,,1726,4.462025316455696

8377470,3,B002Q3NPSS,"Karla Faye Tucker Forevermore

 This is a tough sell.  A drug involved women hideously commits murder with a pick ax-and over a trivial dispute to boot.  How can she possibly transform into a sympathetic character?  Karla Faye Tucker under goes a transformation in the time, the years, she had to live between her conviction and her execution.  She came to know the Lord in a very personal way and to experience his love and forgiveness.
 In the end, this spiritual transformation could not save her from her worldly crime and she did suffer the ultimate penalty.
 This very low budget film had Helen Gibson as writer, producer, director and even actress in a supporting role.  But she had a bundle of solid professionals to help in the production.  But this film is important not because of the spectacular production values, which frankly are not present, but in the message that the film imparts.  Just as each of us are sinners and fall short of the Glory of God, so does Karla Tucker.  But just as she found peace, love and forgiveness through the scriptures and the intervention of a strong prison pastor so each of us can fine similar peace in the Lord.  The power of that message over comes any quibbles over the polish in the making of the film.  At the end of the film we have a brief clip of the real Karla Faye Tucker in worship which made me cry.
 It is a miracle that the film was made at all.
 Long after the introduction of the movie, it has found a useful purpose in the Christian ministry to those incarcerated in prisons across the world, not just in the USA.
 This film has an interest and an importance far beyond the possibilities allowed by the tiny budget.
 Get a copy, show it to your church group and use it as a place to begin a conversation.",1435795200,,1769,4.457943925233645
