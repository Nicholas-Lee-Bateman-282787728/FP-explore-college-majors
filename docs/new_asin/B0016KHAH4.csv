3157748,2,B0016KHAH4,"Review  Journey to 10.000 BC

I was hoping  naively -- that this documentary series would be good. How humans came to North America, how they survived, and the changes they wrought, should be a good story, and should make a great subject for a prehistory documentary. Journey to 10.000 BC is a round up tour of some of the conflicting theories of how prehistoric human beings colonized this continent.
Unfortunately, it is spoiled by some of the worse science writing I have seen. It makes me wish the producers had spent a little less money on dramatic re-enactments of humans hunting Mammoths, Saber-toothed cats hunting humans, and Mammoths trampling over humans, and spent a little to hire some writers who could actually write. Producer-writer David Padrusch and writer Ian Stoker-Long apparently cannot.
As soon as I heard the first few lines, I suspected it was going to be bad. It is almost all written in the present tense (aside from an occasional slip up back into good sense). Bad documentary writers think the present tense gives their writing a sense of  importance, of immediacy  they are wrong. When writing about history, especially pre-history, it is even worse. Inevitably, the reader or listener will end up confused about what thing came before what other thing. As this series rambles about back and forth in time, it is sometimes impossible to figure what came before what. The past tense, and the past perfect tense, evolved in our language so that we could avoid some of those confusions  for a writer to discard the past tense is just hubris.
 And as the series droned on, and I sat listening to one flub after another, I lost any confidence these writers knew a thing about what they were writing about, or that they had even been able to ask the right questions, or understand and convey the answers to us. I even started to suspect they were making it up us they went along. For instance,  early on they say that Smilodon, (the North American saber-tooth cat of 10,000 BC) is the prehistoric  ancestor of all big cats roaming the earth today. Where did these writers they get this stuff? Did they never even stop to wonder how Smilodon would cross the ocean, before spreading big cats all over Africa and Asia in only 10,000 years?
Eventually, I just started laughing at some of the howlers.
A return to Ice Age conditions caused the global climate to change. I guess it did! I guess they meant,  Cold weather caused cold weather.
Describing the curved impression left by a hut post on a bit of adobe: The curve is the exact diameter of an aspen tree trunk. Wow! Aspen trees have an exact size.
But my favorite was when they discussed fullerenes  minerals some scientist claim came here on a large meteor around 10,000 BC. Fullerenes are named for scientist Buckminster Fuller , who discovered them. Really!  If you do not know that Buckminster Fuller was an architect, not a scientist, and that fullerenes, discovered two years after he died, were named after him because they resemble the geodesic domes he built, then you really should not be writing about science.

As for the rest of the show  the interviews with archeologists, discussions of their competing theories, and the animations and prehistoric re-enactments   it was all predictable. The one laugh I did get was when they discussed the idea that North America might have been colonized by two different peoples  Asian coming across the Bering Sea land-bridge and Europeans crossing the Atlantic in boats. Eventually, the two leaders of these two groups met somewhere in the middle, and decided to have it out.
Proponents of the European theory must have delighted in the scene in which the big, bearded, Nordic looking cave man beat down the Asian-descended Amerindian. I do not know if these writers realized that this scene was politically sensitive, or they were trying to champion the Europeans First crowd. They did replay the scene a couple of times.
Is this show worth watching? If you know little about North American pre-history, and want to see a survey of some of the  more or less  questionable theories about it, then perhaps it is. If you appreciate bad writing, and want a few chuckles, then it definitely is. Else, you would be better of reading a book.

The creatures are mammoths, saber-tooth tigers, sloths, bears, wolves and other predatory carnivores.  The people are said to be first the Clovis people, followed much later by the Folsom people. They are named after the hunting tools made by flint knapping, used for spear tips, arrow tips, knives, and scraping.  The Clovis style flint tool was discovered in New Mexico, but primarily has the most occurrence in subsequent archaeological discovery off the New England coastline near Connecticut and Vermont.  The Folsom style flint tool seems to have its prominence in Colorado, such as the Lindenmeier site.  This video tells of the ""adaladal"" which is a spear throwing device that propels the spear much faster by sling-shot effect leverage, to speeds in excess of 60 mph, and creates a great advantage in hunting because of the distance the hunter wants to keep between themselves and the target, and because some creatures were difficult to kill.  The video also explores possible origins and methods of migration from Siberia, France, Spain, and parts of Asia, across oceans, land masses, and explains time period allowances for a lower sea level, in relationship to what effect ice sheets in Canada would have on the Americas.  There are theories shared about what caused the climate changes and dust storms, from changes in river flow, ocean currents, and winds, to the ice sheet being impacted by meteorites.  The documentary has some slow dry spots in the delivery and unfortunately a lot of repetition for the drawings and animations that make it almost amateurish and lets your attention sag.  Of course this type of documentary is based upon speculation and theory more than just about any other subject, so about all the aim of the video has is to stimulate the possibilities in the mind of the viewer.  The one thing it did for me was made me want to visit the George C. Page Museum near the Rancho La Brae Tar Pits at 5801 Wilshire BLVD in Los Angeles, California.  Some scholars say the people of that time period were likely to band together when they met for sharing their knowledge, skills, experiences, food, and their women.  Other scholars say they probably knew the resources were very limited and large groups are slower at migrating than smaller groups, so it is more likely they fought to the death, beginning with the leader of the two clans - which weakened the chances for survival of the clan whose leader died.  Mostly though, I came away feeling like the producer, editor, and director of the documentary knew much more than they were willing to share, and that somehow they felt it was necessary not to tell me the big secrets, or show me the archaeological discoveries first hand.

sometimes at odds with each other, but with so little hard evidence that is to be expected.
The theories are presented without bias (well, without much bias anyway) so that you get a good picture of several veiwpoints.
If you are looking for a lot of flashy cgi animations, you will not find a lot of it in this film. And what there is tends to
be of fairly low quality. But if you are looking for information, you will find a wealth of it.
Would be excellent for use in a middle school or high school science class, or great for anyone who has an interest in pre-history.",1265500800,21,827,4.3076923076923075

Your students won't be asking for a burned copy, but they will learn from it.

After the unfortunate popularity of Hollywood's ""10,000 BC"" (a movie so horrible it makes every self-respecting history teacher cringe), this is heaven-sent. It paints a much more accurate picture of the time period, while being extremely relevant.

10,000 BC (History Channel) is fast enough paced to allow students to view the whole DVD, but I would recommend showing it in clips to maximize its impact. Some of my favorite parts include their hunting tactics, ability to survive prehistoric animals, and the segment explaining several theories as to how people ""settled"" the North American continent.

The theories are presented without bias (well, without much bias anyway) so that you get a good picture of several veiwpoints.
If you are looking for a lot of flashy cgi animations, you will not find a lot of it in this film. And what there is tends to
be of fairly low quality. But if you are looking for information, you will find a wealth of it.
Would be excellent for use in a middle school or high school science class, or great for anyone who has an interest in pre-history.",1265500800,21,827,4.3076923076923075

3392273,5,B0016KHAH4,"As a high school history teacher, I definitely include this DVD on my ""must have"" list. It keeps student interest...enough said? To a teacher, I know that's gold. I have had many positive reviews from past and present students about this one. However, keep it in perspective, it is what it is: a history video. Your students won't be asking for a burned copy, but they will learn from it.

After the unfortunate popularity of Hollywood's ""10,000 BC"" (a movie so horrible it makes every self-respecting history teacher cringe), this is heaven-sent. It paints a much more accurate picture of the time period, while being extremely relevant.

10,000 BC (History Channel) is fast enough paced to allow students to view the whole DVD, but I would recommend showing it in clips to maximize its impact. Some of my favorite parts include their hunting tactics, ability to survive prehistoric animals, and the segment explaining several theories as to how people ""settled"" the North American continent.

It's worth the investment to your teaching collection.",1246924800,35,1049,5.087209302325581
