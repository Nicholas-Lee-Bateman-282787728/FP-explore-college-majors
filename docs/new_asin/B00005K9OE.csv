1617045,2,B00005K9OE,"The premise of Mickey's Magical Christmas has a lot of potential to be a fun holiday movie. But, simply put, they blew it.
Okay, here's more detail. A bunch of Disney characters old and new are trapped at the House of Mouse on Christmas Eve due to a snowstorm. What first comes into your head? I pictured a bunch of characters having to cope with the crowded conditions and a bunch of cute scenes coming from all the characters from the different movies interacting.
What do we get for real? A ""movie"" that is 70% old Disney cartoons, 20% trying to cheer Donald up, and 10% other stuff. Yes, Donald is the ONLY character who has any problem with being snowed in. Everyone else is perfectly content to be trapped, and the movie's entire ""plot"" is about cheering Donald up! And you're thinking ""Wait a minute. Why doesn't Aladdin complain that he's stuck in the House of Mouse with Jafar?""
I was expecting something more like the cheerful chaos that emerged from all the Muppets being trapped in Mrs. Bear's house in the similarly-plotted, and far superior, TV special, ""Muppet Family Christmas,"" which I just love. That special actually took advantage of the plot: worrying where everyone's going to sleep, a few complaints about now having a quiet Christmas, but all resolved with the joy of the season (without getting too sappy!). Mickey's Magical Christmas did none of that.
Now, back to Mickey. What did the movie characters actually do? Not much. There are two brief ""interview"" segments in which a few movie characters talk about what they want for Christmas and what they're thankful for. These are amusing, but they don't do enough of it. The large majority of the characters only make brief camios, or they just say one cheep line.
Blink and you'll miss the second-long camio of Mulan, who you have to squint to see. The entire Winnie the Pooh cast is here, but Eeyore is the only one who speaks. And get this. One of Jafar's two lines is ""It's so good to see that everyone is having a Merry Christmas!"" Huh? Since when does JAFAR care about other people having a Merry Christmas??? Am I the only one who thinks there's something a little whatever about vilains like Jafar and Hades singing joyfully with everyone else? And, this is a personal note but I have to say this, there was absolutly NO ONE from my absolute-all-time-most-favorite Disney movie, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame!"" Not even brief camios!! WHY?? Why did Disney forget them??? There were no ""Tarzan"" characters either.
Now, about the cartoons that Mickey shows to cheer Donald up. As cartoons, they're great, but as part of a movie, they're time-killers. Okay, Donald on Ice and Pluto's Christmas tree I can accept: they're short and sweet. And I loved Mickey's Nutcracker with it's hectic narrator and hillarious script, but still, it was an old Mouse Works cartoon which took up more time. And why, why, WHY include Mickey's Christmas Carol, a long holiday classic that EVERYONE'S seen??? It took up a good 20 minutes that could for used for new stuff! Why not just release these cartoons on DVD as a seperate collection instead of taking up so much time on this ""movie?""
Now if you're going to make a holiday movie, make a holiday movie. Don't use up half the time with old cartoons, and the rest of the time with cheap scriptwriting. This film could have been GREAT, but, simply put, they blew it.",1006560000,3,3378,4.698145025295109
1617046,3,B00005K9OE,"I have to admit, the video is fun.  Like all Disney animated
adventures the graphics are excellent and it is nice to see the
'House of Mouse' gang together.  However, the one and only real
complaint is that the Disney advertising machine has once again
pulled the wool over the eyes of the buying public.  True, there
is a lot of the mouse gang available, but the majority of the
movie consists of an old Pluto/Chip n' Dale cartoon and the more
recent 'Mickey's Christmas Carol'.  For anyone who has a collection of Disney animation, and especially the Christmas
releases, disappointment will follow purchase.  The T.V. ads are
deceptive and the write up on back of the VHS and DVD does not
mention that it is basically a reprint.  For those who do not own a great deal of Disney animation or the Christmas Carol starring Mickey and Uncle Scrooge, it will be a treat.  For those
who do, beware.",1005696000,,894,4.55
1617047,1,B00005K9OE,"This movie is nothing more than corporately sponsored fan fiction
as well as toxic waste for the brain. I've been against THE HOUSE
OF MOUSE from the beginning and SNOWED IN is a horrifically bad
idea. For those of you who aren't familiar with my tastes,
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is actually my favorite film. I cannot
stand to watch yet another desecration of Belle or The Beast(or
if Disney had actually had the courage,the Prince)as I'm sure the hacks responsible here have perpetuated. I've  discredited THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS,and it was neccessary to do so. This isn't the least bit important.",1005609600,,595,4.891089108910891
1617048,5,B00005K9OE,"Whether you have children, or just want to venture into your own past, remembering the magical spirit of Mickey Mouse, this video is perfect.  This video has a little something for everyone, and those of you with children, like myself, will see the holiday magic light up on their faces.
MICKEY'S MAGICAL CHRISTMAS is simply about friends getting together during the holiday season.  With unexpected visits from a plethora of Disney characters, the storyline has Mickey and friends trying to cheer up Donald Duck.  To bring out the smiles, the Disney gang watches old movies together, and the fun is just beginning.
Two of the four movies shown are fairly recent, but ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" still brings a warm, fuzzy feeling to my stomach, let alone, huge smiles to the faces of my three daughters.  Another classic, ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" is also included, and for those of you who can remember this one, Pluto and Chip & Dale are at their best.  This humorous cartoon is sure to bring lots of laughter to your family.
John Cleese as the narrator was an excellent addition, and the sound and color is absolutely phenominal.  This truly is a wonderful video that culminates with the tremendously heartwarming song ""The Best Christmas of All,"" sung by this outstanding cast of Disney characters.  This is the perfect holiday gift for any fan of Disney.  It is sure to make you smile.",1005523200,4,1389,4.8559322033898304
1617049,5,B00005K9OE,"I have been hoping that ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" would be released on DVD. Now, it is a part of this fun filled Christmas production from Disney. The transfer is wonderful, clear, good color and wonderful sound. This particular version of ""Christmas Carol"" has always been the ""fun"" version and a great way to introduce the classic story to children. Plus adults can smile and feel good watching the familiar Disney characters playing the well known parts.
Even if a viewer is not thrilled with the rest of the production, the chapter stops can be used to watch just the ""Christmas Carol"" section. But there is a classic Disney cartoon with Chip and Dale, Pluto and a Christmas tree that I've always enjoyed and a fun version of ""The Nutcracker"" with Mickey and Minnie as the Nutcracker and Marie - the little girl plus Donald in mouse ears as the Mouse King and Goofy as, believe it or not, the sugar plum fairy.
This is an extremely enjoyable Christmas DVD that can easily be viewed in the individual sections if you don't care for the whole thing.",1005523200,,1052,4.661290322580645
1617050,5,B00005K9OE,"Wonderful! A great value, packed and well considered DVD release.
I fail to see why people don't like this Disney DVD - who could resist a title that features many characters from Disney's finest films who all come together to sing a finale of a show on a Christmas high? Belle, Hades, Jafar, Snow White, Lumiere....The list goes on as they sing the new Disney song `Very Best Christmas of All'.
This effort from Disney not only features two Christmas sing alongs and the fist ever House of Mouse cartoon but it also included the timeless Disney short where Mickey and Pluto dress their tree only for Pluto to realise that the two chipmunks have moved in to it!
Additionally, this DVD includes the award-winning Disney's `A Christmas Carol' - the famous one with Scrooge MacDuck, Jiminy Cricket and cute little Tiny Tim. This feature-length animation is available individually on VHS - so what a bargain this DVD is! It's a Christmas Classic!
How many Disney characters did you spot? I saw characters from Pete's Dragon, Song of the South, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Aladdin, Hercules, Mary Poppins and some from old Disney shorts - children will love to pause the DVD player and zoom in on the characters! It works best on the swooping CGI shots over the heads of the audience. What a game to play on Christmas Day!
Ignore the bah-humbug reviews - this DVD is full of seasonal cheer. Sit through it, suspend your disbelief and rekindle that `glow' of Christmas you felt when you were a child!",1005436800,3,1498,4.699619771863118
1617051,1,B00005K9OE,"All the classic Disney stars are here but only for a split second! Don't blink, you might miss Snow White even though she's featured on the cover. The animation is not up to Disney standards nor are the songs! Stick with ""Mickey's Christmas Carol""!",1005264000,,248,4.659090909090909
1617052,5,B00005K9OE,"Curiosity won out when I was considering buying Mickey's Magical Christmas on DVD. I thought the idea to make an all star Christmas movie was a good one, I did not know at the time that a TV show of this existed. The animation is the quality of a TV show, but to see many characters that span Disney's long legacy is worth getting the video.
The movie centers around everyone trying to get Donald into the spirit, by showing old Christmas videos. Two of the 4 videos shown are recent, but the real gems are two old cartoons from my childhood. One is about Pluto vs Chip & Dale, when they sneak into Mickey's Christmas Tree and the other is ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" (a title that I was hoping would have a DVD release one day, and it surprisingly came this week).
The DTS 5.1 Soundtrack isn't extraordinary, but more than adequate for this type of release. Most of the surround is used to split the music.
Mickey's Magical Christmas will without a doubt keep kids in front of the TV and quite possibly, the movie fans who grew up with all of these characters with be right there with them.",1005091200,11,1090,4.400990099009901

1617071,5,B00005K9OE,"It was 15 years ago this month, when I typed this review, that Mickey's Magical Christmas debuted on VHS and DVD! Since it debuted on Toon Disney in 2002 and had it on a homemade videotape (now transferred to DVD before the tape was eaten by a dud combo player), it's been a family tradition of ours since! Too bad other, much older, Disney Christmas compilations have never surfaced on authorized DVDs, such as From All of US To All of You from 1958, A Disney Channel Christmas in 1983, Jiminy Cricket's Christmas in 1986, A Walt Disney Christmas (in full) from 1981, or A Disney Christmas Gift in 1982. At any rate, Mickey's Magical Christmas lives up to those compilations' greatness, with classic shorts as well as some from the Mickey MouseWorks/House of Mouse era! This movie was rereleased in 2009 on DVD, but it was merely a reissue of the 2001 DVD in all-new packaging, via Roy E. Disney's personal ban on the Mickey MouseWorks/House of Mouse shorts being on home video since 2005! Where else you can you see a star-studded, toon-filled Christmas party on Christmas Eve with the party place snowed in, with classic and new Disney shorts in it, AND a star-studded, toon-filled finale? Mickey's House of Villains took similar measures for Halloween in 2002, causing it to be an all-time fave Halloween classic of mine! The 2001/2009 DVD contains the very first episode of the House of Mouse series as a bonus program, called ""The Stolen Cartoons"", which also has the one & only instance of 1 Saturday Morning/1 Too characters being in this show, via Pepper Ann Pearson & her mom Lydia near the end of said episode. I'd rather stick with my homemade DVD, since the original AND 2009 reissue are hard to come by AND buy. Happy 15th anniversary to Mickey's Magical Christmas, and merry Christmas, everybody!",1478217600,,1811,4.734177215189874

""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" (1952) - good
""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" (1983) - great,
linked together by some low-quality filler, which does no good to the overall presentation. Of course, you can get this title, skip forward the annoying bits and enjoy the classic cartoons included, but you would be much better buying ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" instead.

When the 3.5 and 5.5 year olds comment that ""I thought this was a new one, PopPop"" it is apparent that it was not a good purchase.

If you've never seen the House of Mouse TV show you are likely to feel cheated. Several of the complaints here are that this is just a compilation of old cartoons and some new ones loosely tied together by a weak plot... That's exactly what the House of Mouse show is! So anyone who has seen the show is not going to be disappointed. Second, this isn't Once Upon a Christmas repackaged. None of the three stories from OUaC are even on this program. Last, several people conistantly have issues with Disney previews. True, the previews start but then you can either push main menu or chapter skip, either one of these will get you to the main menu really fast. Sometimes one or the other doesn't work but I've yet to come across a Disney DVD I couldn't skip the previews on. The catch of course being you do have to watch the Disney logo but the previews are so easily skipped I become frustrated with the complaint.",1257638400,,1068,4.426395939086294
1617422,4,B00005K9OE,"When Disney brought Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and essentially the entire casts of animated features to Saturday morning and other daytime TV in 2001, it was done in grand style with an effort to create something that would please fans and young viewers, being hip as well as classic.

It's a testimony to those involved with House of Mouse that such an impossibly tall order was carried off so much of the time. Sure, the new animation is markedly different from vintage stuff, but even the Wonderful World of Disney combined the flowing, straight line animation with the ""scritchy"" xerox look of the early '60s. The main issue is, does the final product entertain?

My son sure loved it, and he's seen very little of House of Mouse because it's not on TV much and there are precious few DVDs. I found myself laughing out loud at the rapid fire gags and ""inside"" jokes on Disney characters. Most of all, for me it was fun to spot characters like the Gingerbread Man from Cookie Carnival and Elliot from Pete's Dragon.

That's not to say that House of Mouse is uneven -- the Brian Setzer theme and overall rock/swing music is a great way to keep it fresh yet classic. The references to Backstreet Boys and the like are no different than big band crooner nods in '40s cartoons.

Unlike much animation for television, House of Mouse contains lots of purely visual sequences, short as they are, and short cartoons, which are also shorter than the theatrical type. These cartoons abound with gags -- clearly a lot of work went into them by people who, by and large, generally cared about the early work and actually liked it. I can forgive occasional lapses in graphic quality because of the sheer beauty of the comical poses, especially for Donald. Clearly these poses are the foundation of animation that by necessity is produced in and out of the country. It's inspired by the work of the Disney masters, and probably was researched by the series staff.

Mickey's Magical Christmas is a special House of Mouse that extends to feature length, containing new cartoons as well as Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol. As a bonus, the premiere episode of House of Mouse in included -- a very funny story in which Donald takes over the 'toon club.

This DVD is also a bit of a tribute to the late Wayne Allwine, who voiced Mickey since Christmas Carol and is heard throughout. Surely it was unintentional, since this is a DVD reissue, but Wayne also appears on camera, guiding guests through the Disney sound effects department, where he worked with Jimmy Macdonald and from whom he took on the mantle of Mickey's voice.  This DVD is worth having just for his short bonus feature, ""The Sounds of Christmas.""

I sure would like to see more House of Mouse on DVD and so would my kids...",1257292800,2,2792,4.6605691056910565
1617423,4,B00005K9OE,"In 2001, Disney released ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"", a Christmas special from the House of Mouse TV Show.  And like most Disney releases, once it's released, don't expect to see another release again for years.  And in this case, 8 years later (2009) and right in time for the holidays, ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"" is back.

This Christmas episode is about how all the Disney characters (characters from nearly every Disney animated film) are stranded at the House of Mouse (a night club) due to a snow storm.  So, Mickey being the gracious host that he is, is trying to bring home that Christmas spirit and entertain his guest.  The problem is that Donald Duck is not having a great time is like the scrooge at the Christmas party.  So, Mickey tries to make Donald happy and entertain his guest by showing classic Disney animated shorts which include:

  * Donald On Ice (1999) - Donald tries to learn to skate, while Huey, Dewey and Louie try to build a snowman.  But unfortunately, Donald's inability to skate tends to ruin the triplets chance at building their snowman.
  * Pluto's Christmas Tree (1952) -Mickey cuts down a Christmas Tree and doesn't know that the Chipmunks: Chip & Dale are living in the tree.  Unfortunately, Chip & Dale tend to drive Pluto nuts and thus Pluto does what he can to get the Chipmunks.
  * The Nutcracker (1999) - A young girl (played by Minnie Mouse) receives a present (which is a wooden mouse) and dreams for it to become real, so she can dance with him.
  * Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983) - The popular Disney Christmas animated short features the story of Scrooge McDuck and how he's mean to everyone for Christmas until he learns a lesson from the Spirit of Christmas past.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In a the House of Mouse"" is an animated full-length feature that features nice, vibrant animation during the more modern ""House of Mouse"" television show.  But each time the feature switches to the animated shorts, you get mixed results in terms of picture quality due to some of these animated shorts being over 30/50-years old.  But overall, the classics due show a difference in animation quality but for those who enjoyed animation like ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" or even the older classic animated short ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"", although not digitally remastered, these classics due hold up well on DVD decades later.

As for audio, ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In a the House of Mouse"" is featured in DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.  The series is primarily front and center channel driven and personally, I didn't notice any surround or LFE usage but dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"" comes with the following special features:

  * Premiere Episode of House of Mouse - (23:07) An episode of ""House of Mouse"" featuring various Disney characters from popular animated films visiting the House of Mouse nightclub.  Meanwhile, Pete buys the building of where the House of Mouse is located and wants to shut down the cartoon club.
  * The Sounds of Christmas - (2:33) A Disney sound engineer teaches children how to make sounds using objects and how they were utilized in certain animation.
  * SingAlong ""Deck the Halls"" - (1:50) Karaoke SingAlong to ""Deck the Halls"" with animation from ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"".
  * SingAlong Song ""Sleigh Ride"" - (1:57) Karaoke SingAlong to ""Sleigh Ride"" with animation from ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I watched ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"" with my toddler and he absolutely loved it and wanted to watch it again.  And as a holiday family feature, it is an entertaining release that will be fun, due to the number of Disney characters seen throughout the feature.

With that being said, for those who own the recent release of Walt Disney Animated Shorts Collection or other Disney releases probably have the animated shorts on previously released DVD's.  Those who own the original release from 2001, there is really is nothing new on this DVD with the exception of the new trailers.  In fact, if you are a fan who mainly wants this release for its holiday-related animated shorts, then you may want to check out the just released ""Disney Animation Collection 7: Mickey's Christmas Carol"" which comes with ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"", ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" and two other Disney classics.

But with this release of ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"", if you are a ""House of Mouse"" fan, you do get the premiere episode of ""House of Mouse"" and other short entertaining holiday special features.  I do admit that I wished that the DVD release had more interactivity like other Disney releases with games or something extra.

Overall, ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed In at the House of Mouse"" is entertaining for young and old as it does feature newer and older animation and if you don't own these animated shorts on another previously released Disney collection, it's worth checking out.  But if you do have these shorts already, it's kind of hard to recommend it as the majority of the content in this feature are those classic shorts.

So, for parents who are looking for a Disney holiday release, as mentioned earlier, my son loved it and wanted to watch it again.  So, yes it is an entertaining and fun Disney holiday release.  I recommend Disney fans looking for a an animated holiday release to also purchase a copy of ""Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"" (2004), if you don't own it already.",1257292800,46,5691,4.890396659707725

Mickey's Magical Christmas is a re-release of the 2001 DVD feature. If you didn't have a chance to pick up a copy then, you can lay your gloves on this DVD treat that will become a family tradition for many years to come. I received my review copy and we waited until after Halloween to watch this one. It was a great way to start off our Christmas Holiday season!

The DVD is 65 minutes long and is filled with treasures that will delight everyone in your family.
In this full-length adventure, a huge snowstorm leaves Mickey, Minnie and many other friends stranded leading Mickey and his guests at the House of Mouse to whip up an impromptu party that includes instilling a ""Humbug""-quacking Donald Duck with the holiday spirit. Everyone shares their home movies and even grumpy Donald starts to smile when they realize the ""Best Christmas of All"" is the one you share with friends and family.
Throughout the episode, Mickey and the gang do their best to spread holiday cheer. Lucky for us, there are some classic holiday shorts mixed in with the newer House of Mouse shorts. The highlights are the 1952 Pluto's Christmas Tree and the 24-minute 1983 version of Mickey's Christmas Carol.

The first bonus feature of the disc is the premiere episode of The House of Mouse. This is a charming look at the beginning of the series and you get a sense of the creativity and talent of this short-lived series. The second bonus is The Sounds of Christmas-a Disney Sound Effects Featurette featuring the late Wayne Allwine, voice of Mickey Mouse for over 30 years. In the featurette, Wayne retells Twas the Night Before Christmas with the help of a few children providing sound effects.

Taken purely as a DVD aimed at fans of the holiday season, you can't go wrong with this title. The animation (except for Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol) is decidedly ""made for television"" and seems quite jarring, choppy and immature next to the classic animated segments. I am glad that I was able to add it to my collection, though, and I look forward to sharing it with my kids over the next few years.",1257033600,,2276,5.029177718832892

1617441,3,B00005K9OE,"Okay so basically it's like this...the entire Disney cast of characters is, as the title says, snowed in at the House of Mouse.  The characters then decide to break out some hot cocoa and cookies and sit back and enjoy old movies which turn out to be some of the old Disney holiday classics such as ""Mickey's Christmas Carol""  and ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" where Mickey chops down a Christmas tree not knowing it's home to Chip & Dale.

After the tree has been trimmed, the chipmunks delightfully explore their newly decorated surroundings, much to the chagrin of Pluto, the only one who knows that the tree contains the pair. Chip 'n' Dale soon drive Pluto crazy as they explore their new Christmassy surroundings. When Mickey finds out, he chuckles naively and thinks that they're cute.

Toss in a new rendition of ""The Nutcracker"" and a newer Donald short called ""Donald On Ice"".  The featurettes are all pretty good but the bits in between are a bit forced and really not very funny.

Also at a running time of just over 60 minutes it's not the greatest value either.  Still, if you don't have Mickey's christmas CArol, you can get it here along with the other shorts so it's not too bad.",1099958400,7,1191,4.61611374407583

If you know a House of Mouse fan, this may be a good movie for them. But still I have seen some reviewers give this below 3 stars. I just think they have wasted thier time watching this movie. The movie starts with Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) finshing a House of Mouse show on Christmas Eve. But the guests and Mickey's House of Mouse staff can't go home because they are snowed in at the House of Mouse. So Mickey decides to have a party (and going on with the show at the House of Mouse). But then Mickey has another problem Donald Duck (Tony Anselmo) can't get into the Chistmas spirit and keeps saying ""Christmas bah, humbug"". So Mickey starts showing short cartoons.

1617444,4,B00005K9OE,"There have been dozens of film adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" -- including particularly good ones starring George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart. ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is one of my favorites. The Disney characters take the roles in Charles Dickens's classic story of greed, ghosts and redemption. This also has the significance of being the first cartoon to feature the Scrooge McDuck character, who was created and popularized by Carl Barks in the Disney comic books. He is voiced here, and in most later appearances, by Alan Young (alias Wilbur from ""Mr. Ed"".)
You can't find it alone on video or DVD, but last year it was released in part of an anthology movie, ""Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse."" This movie is worth it for the Christmas Carol adaptation alone, but also has several new shorts and the 1952 classic ""Pluto's Christmas Tree,"" that makes it worth picking up. The framing sequence is so-so -- a take on the ""House of Mouse"" cartoon show, but it's got nice bits and the Disney fans out there will appreciate it.",1037750400,30,1061,4.80327868852459

This DVD contains the usual collection of old shorts tied together by mediocre (at best) clips of every Disney character ever!  This was mostly predictable if you have any experience with prior Disney compilations.
The real problem with this video is the LONG and MANDATORY preview section.  On a tape you can fast forward through the commercials but Disney has chosen to embed them in the protected area of the disc that forces the viewer to see them all at 1X speed EVERY TIME you want to watch the video.  Disney charges full price for this disc, around [amt], so this intrusion is unacceptable.
I wanted to spend some time with my young daughter watching a cartoon video but by the time the feature started we were both in a sour mood.

1617477,3,B00005K9OE,"If you're checking this DVD out in the first place, chances are you're either a parent with young kids or a big Disney fan.  If the former is the case, the DVD could be hit or miss depending on what your kids want.  If they really enjoy the format of ""House of Mouse"" - brief glimpses of most of the Disney entourage framing various cartoons - then go for it.  But if your little one has a favorite character and the main draw of this flick is to see that character, you may be better off going with the movie.  A lot of lines and shots are tossed to Belle, Beast, and the seven dwarves, probably to cross-promote the upcoming IMAX and current DVD/video releases of the two films respectively.  But a lot of other characters only show up in brief overhead pans which might leave your kids unsatisfied.  Other than that, the cartoons are fairly entertaining (though really young kids might be upset by parts of Mickey's Christmas Carol) and the two included sing along songs ought to keep 'em busy long enough for you to wrap a present or two.
  As for the Disney fans, again it's a bit of a hit or miss proposition.  You may appreciate having a nice DVD copy of both ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" and ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"", the animation of which puts ""House of Mouse"" to shame.  And you may get a kick out of seeing the majority of the Disney crew togather and subject to the usual in-jokes (though if you happen to love a character from Roger Rabbit or one of the Disney TV shows, you're out of luck).  Plotwise, however, the frame story falls pretty flat.  The major problem is that we never know exactly WHY Donald doesn't have ""The Christmas Spirit"".  Maybe he really wanted to go home.  Maybe he never gets what he wants for Christmas.  Maybe Mickey et. al. make him play the Mouse King in the Nutcracker every single year and it drives him nuts.  If there was some reason for Don's grumpiness, the story might have had some direction.  Instead, we watch as the gang tries various methods to cheer up Don, most of which involve showing cartoons, until one which doesn't seem any better than the others eventually works.  So basicly it depends on how much the short cartoons are worth to you.  Because the House of Mouse story does not carry this DVD.",1008288000,3,2256,4.458536585365854

1617480,3,B00005K9OE,"If you have children under 10 who have enjoyed several Disney films, the DVD might make a good Holiday addition to keep the little tykes busy for an hour.
This DVD is a  home video/dvd release extended  special episode of the Disney channel's House of Mouse show.  The House of Mouse show combines new footage with old cartoon clips.
On the DVD box it says:  Full Length Holiday Movie.  Look closely at the back of the box and you'll see it says it's approximately 65 minutes long.  It was never released to the movie theaters. Many will think it must be a new movie.. even a new direct to video movie because it says so on the box.  If you don't get cable t.v. or the Disney Channel/ Toon Disney you won't know what House of Mouse is.
About 25 minutes of this DVD is the Mickey's Christmas Carol  short, shown without credits and tied into the new shenanigans at 'the House of Mouse"".  The older Pluto and Chip N Dale cartoon : Pluto's Christmas Tree  and brief snippet of another Mickey Mouse cartoon take up another ten minutes of  time.  There appears to be a brand new cartoon with Donald Duck on the DVD, and a cartoon I've not seen before that you might call Disney's Nutcracker, which is narrated by John  Cleese.  Those take up close to 15 minutes on the disc.
That leaves under 15 minutes for new footage and credits.  Mickey and his friends have just finished a concert show at the House of Mouse.  They get snowed in and decide to celebrate Christmas anyway.  Donald Duck doesn't feel the spirit of Christmas so Mickey and his friends- consisting of nearly every single featured Disney character try to cheer the Scrooge like Duck up.  They decorate, and then they begin to tell him stories which allow for the showing of new and old cartoon clips and eventually Mickey's Christmas Carol which features  Scrooge McDuck and Mickey as Bob Cratchet in an entertaining re-telling of Dickens' Christmas Carol  most of us have seen (which isn't better than versions featuring:  Mr. Magoo,  Alistair Sim  or George C. Scott ).
Do you think Donald finds the spirit of Christmas and joins the Disney gang for a brand new
""Best Christmas of All"" song?  Hey I'm not going to spoil it for you.
The new animation is of course not done as well as it would have been for a major Disney feature, but children will have a good time trying to spot the characters and villains from the Disney movies they probably know very well.  Some of the characters do little bits of business.
dvd stuff:
Mickey's Magical Christmas is presented in full frame 1:33:1.  The colors are bright and crisp.  The older cartoon clips are free from any defects, grain, or telltale print damage.  The new material is not as well animated as the older material, but they blend fairly well together.
Audio is presented in 5.1. Dolby and the full spectrum of your  home theatre speaker set up are utilized.  Even some of the older cartoon clips move some of the sound effects around the room.  It's pretty impressive actually.
DVD EXTRAS:
Three Bonus features are included on the DVD and adults will fine the extras easier to watch with their kids then the main attraction.
The Premiere episode of the Disney Cable t.v. channel program :  House of Mouse  is included.  The House of  Mouse combines old and newly created segments to showcase vintage cartoons from Disney's Vault.  The new material involves many many characters from Disney features that gather at the House of Mouse nightclub to watch M.C. Mickey and gang put on a show.  It's a lot like The Muppet Show in many ways.  The jokes are funnier and pacing is better on the
Premiere episode than in the main attraction.
SingAlong Songs includes two follow the bouncing ball shorts.  The songs are Deck the Halls and Sleigh Ride.
The Sounds of Christmas is a very short under 4 minute feature in which a group of children learn that a variety of objects create the sound effects that are used in Disney cartoons.  Hey kids did you know tied up bamboo sticks made the sound of the forest fire in the movie Bambi?
There's also a long preview of the all new Peter Pan movie that's supposed to be out in theaters in February.
FINAL WORD:
If you have little ones in your house-hold who love all things Disney and you want to own a pristine copy of Mickey's Christmas Carol, than this DVD will make an inoffensive program to pass the time for the children.  There's too much saccharine for adults to enjoy it very much I'm afraid, but Adults might enjoy the extra material on the disc more than the main attraction and almost enjoy watching it with the kids.

1617481,3,B00005K9OE,"Some people have hated this DVD, most actually, and a handful have been able to see the good points in this obviously flawed feature. No doubt, there was some false advertising involved, but it's really only the point that it has been referred to as an ALL NEW FEATURE. I've tried to write this review so many times, but it's always too long to be posted, so I'm going to cut to the chase with this attempt, so here goes. First, you HAVE to see the House of Mouse TV show before watching this Christmas special in order to appreciate it. If you had ever seen it you would have known exactly what to expect. Disney even provides us with the premiere episode as an extra on this DVD, of course that still means you have to buy it first. But I do suggest you watch that premiere episode before the feature anyway. In fact, it's actually better than the feature, not counting the wonderful Mickey's Christmas Carol segment. There are 3 other extras on this DVD by the way, two sing a longs, and a really unnecessary and short look into cartoon sound effects. As for the feature, the other reviewers aren't giving you the entire details when they say there is hardly any new footage. The new footage is probably equal to the old, or almost anyway. There are two ""new"" cartoons, along with the new wraparound footage, which is where you get to see all the Disney characters hanging out and sometimes performing, in Mickey's nightclub. They are never in the main cartoons, but they usually, especially in the regular episodes of the show, do get a good amount of screen time. It's just that they want to show you so many characters that few of them really get that much to do. The joy is seeing all of them together, period. For some Disney fans that alone is a wonderful treat. The two new cartoons are a new Donald Duck short involving some snowplay, that may seem like an old cartoon since we have often seen Donald and the boys in the snow in the past, and a really great Disney version of the Nutcracker with Narrator John Cleese. The two old cartoons are the classic Pluto's Christmas Tree, and the classic Mickey's Christmas Carol. Personally, even though I have them both on previous videos, it's great to get them on DVD in my opinion, and any true Disney fan should agree with me! True, I'd like to see Mickey's Christmas Carol get it's own DVD release though, so I can get the wonderful credits too. Overall, this DVD is really not that bad. It's flaws are the fact that not enough people are familiar with the House of Mouse series to know just who stars in the toons and who is just window dressing, and that the wraparound plot about getting snowed in and Donald being a Humbug are forced at you within the first minute of the show, which sets you off on a bad pace because it's so badly done. Oh, and that little matter of advertising as being ""ALL NEW."" I, for one, expected this DVD to be great because I admit, I ALSO thought it would be all new, not to mention Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas, which came out on DVD two years ago, WAS all new and was great. Also, I had seen House of Mouse. After finally buying it though, I WAS disappointed in the quality of the opening, and that there was less new footage than expected, but I still am glad I bought it. It's well worth it for the old Classics AND the two new cartoons, including the bonus House of Mouse premiere. But for what it turned out to be, it IS overpriced. It should be more in the range of 14.99, while I couldn't find it cheaper than 19.99. Well, if you still think you want to get it, I DO recommend it. If you are unsure, stick with the fairly recent Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas. It's ALL NEW and it's very good. But this is still straight to video folks, please stop being upset that you're not getting BIG SCREEN animation quality! I mean, grow up, that's not going to happen!

The scene where Scrooge sees his own grave, falls in and frantically tries to climb out but cannot, and then falls screaming down into the burning fire down below... I wish that scene had been shortened or edited out because it really ruined the whimsical & fun mood of the whole movie, and left my 3 year old scared and confused.",1512086400,2,538,4.489795918367347

I thoroughly read the product information and the reviews and did not see anything saying this DVD would not be compatible with USA DVD players, so I ordered it. The movie arrived today, our kids were so excited, we tried to play it on our bluray player, but it couldn't detect the DVD. So we took it upstairs to the regular DVD player and the message stated ""Wrong Region!"" I'd like to add that even the DVD case clearly shows Universal!

IF THE DVD CANNOT BE PLAYED IN THE USA OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY.... PLEASE STATE IT CLEARLY FOR ALL TO SEE, PREFERABLY BEFORE ONE PURCHASES IT!!!!!!!!",1510012800,3,689,4.556451612903226
