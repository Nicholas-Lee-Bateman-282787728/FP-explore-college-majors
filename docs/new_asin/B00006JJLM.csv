7970344,5,B00006JJLM,"Breathing is important and this dvd goes through step by step with visualizations to help properly breathe.  I had the vcr version (which came with a book to reference to) which was very helpful.  My vcr hit the dust so upgraded to dvd version, which does not have the book. Luckily I have the one from the vcr version.",1359504000,,319,4.389830508474576
7970345,1,B00006JJLM,"I am totally disappointed with this book and DVD.  It is not what I expected especially based on the amount I paid for both.  The Author does not give me anything that I could use for my breathing concerns, and the DVD is not well done.",1350432000,,236,4.108695652173913
7970346,5,B00006JJLM,"A great way to exercise and learn how to breath properly. A gentle ,easy to follow program ,thats quick to do,takes no equipment and benefits from the first.",1307145600,,157,4.642857142857143
7970347,3,B00006JJLM,It is an okay exercise DVD though it didn't work for me. Not all DVDs work for everyone.,1257033600,,88,3.9444444444444446
7970348,5,B00006JJLM,"I first got the book, and decided after the first lesson, that i would like to have the guidance of dvd, and am glad I have both of them. highly recommend that you get both the book and dvd, if you are not professional singer.  Nancy gives more information about the exercises in the book, also shares more imaginary drills which I find quite helpful.  The dvd is great addition to the book as Nancy guides us through the exercises, and helped me better understand how to do them.  Her method is helping me change life long patterns of restrictive breathing, profoundly changing my life on all levels.  I would not have understood how this works if I had not read the book.  So do yourself a favor and get both,  I have strong metaphysical background, have studied breathwork quite deeply,  and thought I knew a lot , but this fills in the missing pieces, is helping my change my breathing, use more of my lung capacity and also channel the increased energy in life affirming ways.  This is not a quick fix, changing breath patterns takes effort, but Nancy makes it as simple and as much fun as possible.  The dvd is visual showing the exercises that are explained in depth in the book.  Highly recommend both!",1225238400,7,1210,4.509174311926605
7970349,3,B00006JJLM,"This is a 90 min slow-paced video based on her book of the same name. You can find the book on google books in it's entirety.
I did the first 30 min which is about 2-C out of 5-B?, half listening because of the slow pace, but it did help me breathe more deeply even that little amount. The pace is a killer snooze though. The other two names, Greg & the girls' are just the models in their spandex outfits. The outfits & makeup look late 80s/early 90s.
The video uses old style computer graphics to help you use analogies like accordion, a baster, and to show you where to place your tongue in or out of the mouth.
Nancy has a slow, calming..... voice & narrates the video. Reading on other reviews, I see people liked it, but either the exercises or the video itself is too boring to keep up.
So far I've done only normal deep abdominal breathing, I've given up on doing the rest, I just can't force myself. But that's my personal opinion, I admit I have low attention span, especially when the person's  personality is repressed to appear ""professional/cool""",1182729600,6,1060,4.408163265306122
7970350,5,B00006JJLM,"This DVD is exceptionally well organized and direct. Nancy Zi is a charismatic teacher. The production, including new-age type instrumental music, is excellent. It's a pleasure to put on this DVD and be guided through tension-reducing/ energy-creating exercises - especially at the end of the work day. I get recharged and can restart my day, so to speak. Some of the exercises are very active. The exercises can be modified to suit one's present ability.

The DVD exercise segments alternate between the use of a male and a female model for demonstrating the exercises. (Each complete exercise segment shows only one or the other - a male or a female.) The many short, but never intrusive, segments between the exercises feature superb full color animation and scenes showing Nancy Zi in restful surroundings with trees and a light breeze evident from time to time. The transitions between segments show blue sky with moving clouds.

BOTTOM LINE: The Art of Breathing DVD is an example of impeccable production and content. The exercises are deceptively simple yet powerful. I experienced the following benefits: (1) A refreshing sense of calm and energy and (2) A noticeably better sounding speaking and singing voice. Very much worth the small investment of time required.",1094601600,16,1275,5.125
