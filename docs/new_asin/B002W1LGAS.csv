8382717,5,B002W1LGAS,"Disney did a huge favor for all ""Zorro"" fans by making their 1957-60 TV ""Zorro"" a Disney Treasure. I found the quality excellent, and love the previews added for each next episode. These episodes are timeless and Guy Williams' performance is timeless as the perfect Zorro. I think Disney did a wonderful and commendable job.
Whether you have ever watched ""Zorro"" or not, these polished and enhanced copies of the original episodes in beautiful black and white will be a delightful treat!",1301443200,4,487,4.951219512195122
