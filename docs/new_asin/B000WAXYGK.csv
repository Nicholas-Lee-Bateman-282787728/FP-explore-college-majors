The only way to get this was to either have been a teacher who ordered it for class or a library. What the person who has been selling this on DVD has done is taken VHS copies obtained from library book sales when they have blown out their vhs sections or rented them, and then dubbed them onto DVDs and sold them... Unless of course they recorded their masters off of PBS back in the day.. Regardless, this is without question the greatest doc ever produced about rock & roll, so if you don't have the patience to scour around library book sales or E-bay and Amazon for the occasional lone VHS tape and eventually compile the full set, a dubbed DVD copy is as good as it gets.. By the way, ""Do you love beer?"" Even if you don't, the sponsor tags in the copies of the set will make you wonder...

Never fear.. If you are not that hung up on quality, ALL episodes are now on Youtube!!!

The series contained so many musical clips that the producers apparently didn't want to spend what it would take to extend their broadcast rights. For years, as a result, the series has not been available for broadcast or for purchase on DVD or videocassette.

As a result, PBS's online store began selling videos of Time-Warner's rock history series not originally made for public TV, The History of Rock 'N Roll. New York Times critic John O'Connor preferred the BBC/WGBH series.

The Time Life series of similar name (The History of Rock and Roll) has a good opening segment, but then drops swiftly into a meandering, lightweight and very unsatisfying, poorly edited mashup that's not worth the time to watch.

The one seller listed on Amazon as having the real thing said that I was buying it on VHS tapes. I went ahead and bought them, planning to convert them to DVDs. But when the shipment arrived, there were five DVDs inside.

My question is how did this vendor obtain the series on DVD when it's never been officially issued on DVD? I haven't watched them yet, so I can't comment on the technical quality. If it's good, being sent the DVDs isn't a problem for me.

Any way, shape or form you can obtain this series, just do it.

9/20/2011 Update: Seller sent me an email correctly saying that the listing states VHS tapes were out of stock and only DVDs are available. I was wrong when I checked off that the item was different than what was described.

The extraordinary, insightful moments are too numerous to even begin to catalog, but highlights that come immediately to mind--even now, years after seeing this for the last time--include: Iggy Pop describing how he realized that the sounds of pistons in the machine shop he worked in were so simple that even his band could imitate them; Rufus Thomas pointing out how WDIA led to white teenagers buying Rhythm & Blues records in the late 40s and 50s in increasing numbers due simply to its extraordinary geographical reach resulting from its uncommonly high wattage--i.e. the demographic changes wrought by technology; the thoroughly brilliant ""Shakespeares in the Alley"" episode, which weaves together Dylan, the Beatles, the Byrds and others into one folk-rock tapestry that illuminates the complex cross-influencing of this era (particularly notable is the restoration of skiffle to its rightful place as the spark plug for British rock and David Crosby's subsequent comment that he heard folk changes being used in ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and other Beatles tunes and that this simply had not existed before--new musics resulting, he says, in his inimitable way, from previously unrelated forms being ""smooshed together"").

8221974,5,B000WAXYGK,"I cannot recommend this set highly enough.  First off, the content itself is by far the best documentary on rock ever done.  I imagine that it will never be surpassed.  As most people who have searched in vain for this set know, it is virtually impossible to find.  The DVD version, which this is, is now only available from this seller to the best of my knowledge.  Second, the DVDs themselves are extremely well done.  The transfers are most likely from a pre-digital source, albeit an extremely clear source, and are as good as they could possibly be, given the age and the source.  In other words, if you are looking for this set on DVD, this is by far the best that you will probably ever find, given that it is unlikely to ever be re-released by PBS, probably due to the costs of licensing the music and performances.  This set, and the care in which it is packaged and presented, receive my highest recommendation.",1468540800,2,921,4.506024096385542

8221976,5,B000WAXYGK,This documentary [rockumentary] should be a part of everyone's media library who grew up with rock & roll.  It's fascinating to see rock & roll traced back to it's roots and how it evolved over the years.  This version goes into much more detail than it's counterpart The History of Rock n Roll.

8221977,5,B000WAXYGK,"I wish I had found this ""used"" (it seemed very new) on DVD from these sellers before I bought it from the only other source I could find it.  The DVD's from the other sellers were garbage: terrible ""pixilated"" quality worse than the worst beat up VHS you ever returned to Blockbuster for a refund, w/ no packaging.  Here though, very solid picture and sound quality, and likewise the packaging.  For a VERY rare set only seen or distributed (and maybe even produced) in standard def. 4 x 3 ratio, this is a godsend if you want it.

The program btw is first rate, and as others have stated, not to be confused with the inferior Time/Life set with same title and number of volumes but completely different content.  BTW if you are interested in an even fuller package, there is a separately available companion hardbound book by rock critic Robert Palmer (not the Addicted to Love guy) from a related perspective, making for the best overall package of Rock 'n' Roll 101 basics PLUS unique insights for the advanced, all created with a unique and original vision, I have ever seen.  The book was a mainstream release so copies of that should be easy to find including cheap used copies in good condition.

8221978,5,B000WAXYGK,"Obviously, no documentary on a vast topic like rock 'n' roll will completely satisfy everyone, but this comes about as close as possible. There are a few omissions, but that may be due to the fact that this series is more concerned with innovators than stars. That works in its favor because without having to spend the program time on things most people know (do you really need to know much more about the Beatles, Elvis, Stones that hasn't been covered in docs devoted specifically to those artists) you get to go both wider and deeper on what made it seem so magical. Instead of a bunch of talking heads, rock critics, professors and such talking about the music, here you get the real deal. Sam Phillips, Leiber & Stoller, Leonard Chess, Barry Gordy, Jerry Lee, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Iggy, Robert Plant...you get the picture. You get a true feeling for how and why things progressed and the interconnectedness of it all. This doc is superior in just about every way to the easily obtainable Time/Life series. It was never commercially available, but it can be had on DVD, even though it's listed as VHS. It is a very well done transfer and it is reasonably priced. If you have never seen it, you're in for a rare treat, and if you did see and remember it, you know what I mean. Get it while you can.",1423008000,,1323,4.516666666666667

You hear the stories from the musicians, producers and label owner's mouths, including Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Robert Plant, Keith Richards, Sun Records founder etc.

You start from Delta blues and end at Punk & Hip-Hop. I only wish they could do a 2010s version of this.
