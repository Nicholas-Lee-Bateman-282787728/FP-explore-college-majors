8721804,1,B010CG2EXM,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It is only 1 workout, and it is way too hard for the average person. The instructor is very into pushups and variations of that.  If you are already very physically fit then maybe you could handle this.  Otherwise there are no levels shown or easier options if it is too hard for you.  You are better off buying Weight Watchers 15-minute Boot Camp.  It has beginner, intermediate and advanced option.  It also includes 4 different workouts - unlike this DVD.",1453852800,,496,4.579545454545454
