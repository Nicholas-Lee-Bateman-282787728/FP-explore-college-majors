and well let me tell u ....it was awsome totally worth the money...some things u won't expect to happen, happens.
the only downfall i would say is that there is way WAY too much blood.
it was like every episode...BLOOD!!!
oh well...it was an awsome story none the less....romance...action.....and mysterious plots.
very VERY interesting.",1068940800,11,484,5.139240506329114

7998223,5,B0000C52EQ,"I had only read the books that this show is based on, and I was worried that like with most things they would cut things out for the tv series. However, they did not! The show followed the books almost spot on. The quality was great and if you love the books you will love the show. The only bad thing was being sad that it ended!",1286150400,,330,3.9402985074626864

7998226,5,B0000C52EQ,"OMG. i saw this and it totally blew me away. first off, nearly everybody dies!! When chidori died, i cried so much!! its just...the way she died was so sad. she dies right there in Yuhi's arms..*sniff* this second half of the series was way darker than the first. well, the whole series is pretty dark anyways. i was also kinda sad that shuro only had a short apperiance. the manga had shuro as a way more improtant character. they killed off her character too. it was also sad that well.... i wouldnt want to give away the ending, but ill just tell you that there is lots of blood!! to much killing on the second disk in this package. but its still really good, so go get it and see what i mean!!",1098057600,3,697,4.208955223880597
7998227,5,B0000C52EQ,IF you are a fan of Yu Watase...then you will love Ceres Celestial Legend!!  The ending is not what you would expect.  Ceres is still looking for her Mana so she can return to heaven...and the other charaters just grow on you. Yuhi still loves Aya and Aya still loves Toya and he finally finds out his past!! If you bought the collector's edition volume 1...then don't wait to buy the 2nd edition!!!  You will definately Cry!!,1073865600,8,426,4.5064935064935066
