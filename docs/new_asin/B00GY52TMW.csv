8628656,4,B00GY52TMW,"'Swedish Nympho Slaves' is another of Jess Franco's trademark sexploitation efforts prominantly featuring his main squeeze Lina Romay. The cover art on the DVD case is a little deceptive as it depicts Ms Romay behind bars in a classic WIP pose when, in fact, she never is in prison in this flik.  Rather, she plays the domineering owner of a sexy club on some un-named exotic island, that features a lot of strippers and prostitutes. The 'plot' revolves around a kidnap/ransom scenario involving the daughter of a fat millionaire who is trying to get his offspring back & he has found out that she was seen in Lina's establishment.  The movie unfolds initally as a series of flashbacks that tell the back-story of how Romay's character met the millionaire's daughter, lured her into a lesbian relationship, then ultimately turned her into a 'sex slave' prostitute at her establishment.  I think this may be where the 'Swedish Nympho' element comes into the title - the young girl 'looks' sorta Swedish (she's blonde!) altho there is never really any other reference to her nationality - in fact the actual translation of the film's Euro-title is simply ""The Slave"".  When people realize that the young girl is 'valuable' she becomes a bit of a  pawn in a struggle between a couple of rival crime syndicates to barter her off to her father, who is also using his 'resources' to track her down.  While this all sounds pretty complex, Franco doesn't let the plot get in the way of providing as many sex scenes as he can squeeze in and there are numerous varied sexual scenarios presented featuring women of many different colors and sexual preferences.  Per usual, Franco manages to throw in a little S&M via some 'interrogation' scenes and there's plenty of full female nudity & simulated love making along the path to the drama's 'poignant' conclusion.  The (widescreen) film transer is super clean & sharp (something I've noticed in many German DVD pressings).  This may not be one of Franco's most notable efforts, but it is a solid representation of his milieu.

In addition to the 'featured' Franco film, this box also includes a second DVD entitled ""Amorous Sisters"" - which is a full length Swiss(?) sexploitation effort.  It focuses on a class of young girls at a finishing school somewhere in the Alpine countryside who are having 'biology' lessons in 'sexual reproduction' from their attractive female teacher. As each aspect of the human sexual apparatus is discussed it leads to a vignette of wholesome sexual frolics with the girls of the class.  Pretty light-weight fare but lotsa nudity and cute girls make it an easy watch - somewhat similar to the 'Schoolgirl Report' series.  Both films are in foreign lanuage w/ English subs.  No 'extras' on either disk other than some 'trailers'.",1310947200,11,2798,4.90042372881356
