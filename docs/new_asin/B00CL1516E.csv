5725441,5,B00CL1516E,"FROM 1-STAR TO 5-STARS - UPDATED REVIEW

NOTE: In this review I use UPPERCASE for heading titles or for emphasis - please do not think I am including uppercase for the purpose of ""shouting"" as the use of uppercase within emails or web pages is usually interpreted as being rude or offensive. That is not my intent.

Why the change from a 1-star review to a 5-star review? A number of things...

1) On ""Cyber Monday"" the price for the ""Complete Season Bundle"" dropped from $398.93 down to $203.99. This is the lowest price I have seen, although in a comment on my first review, Kermsroomy said that on November 7th, 2013 ""It was $198.49 on a six hour lightning deal earlier today.""

2) D. Moore, in another comment on my first review was helpful. He indicated that although the entire bundle is shrink-wrapped the individuals season are still sealed in individually shrink-wrapped DVD cases. If you read my original review below, you will see (as I required subtitles for my 82-year old Dad) the way the whole bundle was shrink-wrapped one could not read that product details on the back of the ANY of the individual seasons. I was afraid if I broke the shrink-wrap enclosing the whole bundle Amazon might not accept the item if returned due to a lack of subtitles.

3) A good number of comments on my review variously said that the entire run of the series had subtitles. Either [CC] (Closed Captioning) or [SDH] (an initialism for ""[S]ubtitles for the [D]eaf or [H]ard-of-hearing"".) Some comments claimed the entire series had BOTH [CC] AND [SDH] -- that is not true, at least according to what I learned below.

So, based on these three things, I took a gamble and ordered the bundle a second time.

HERE IS THE SCOOP ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS SET HAS CLOSED CAPTIONING, SDH, OR SUBTITLES.

Having removed the shrink-wrap that sealed the entire bundle I was able to carefully examine the DVD features and here is what I found:

1) From Season One, Volume One, through Season Five, Volume One the individual DVD boxes are indeed labeled with the letters [CC] -- meaning the DVDs up to Season 5, Vol. 1 have ""closed captioning."" However, if you look at the BACK of the DVD cases for Seasons One Vol. 1 & 2 and Season 2, Vol. 1 & 2 you WILL NOT see any indication that the first two season have [CC]. BUT, if you carefully examine the microscopic print at the very bottom of the SPINE of the DVD cases from the first two seasons, you WILL see the DVDs are indeed labeled with the [CC] logo. I would never have dreamed of looking there! Especially as, unless you have great eyesight, you may need your reading glasses or a magnifying glass to see the tiny [CC] text. Why they did not put the [CC] information on the back of the DVD cases for seasons one and two is beyond me. (All the rest of the DVD technical details are there on the back -- as is usually found on the back of ALL DVD cases.)

2) From Season Five, Volume Two, right through to very end of the series with Season Nine, Volume Two, the individual DVD boxes are very clearly labeled on the back of the DVD case as having [SDH] subtitles.

SUMMARY

It appears then, if you have hesitated to buy this set because you have to have subtitles --  [CC] or [SDH] -- YOU SHOULD BE SAFE IN ORDERING THIS BUNDLE. I say ""you should be safe"" because, as I am in the middle of moving to a new home, I cannot play any of these DVDs as of yet. (My DVD player and my TV are boxed up for the move.)

It is still true, technically speaking, this item is not a ""boxed set"" and, indeed, there are no bonus features but one - Season Nine, Volume 2 does have one episode with commentary by Barbara Hale (Della Street) Amusingly, there is even a disclaimer that subtitles -- [CC] or [SDH] -- ""might not be available on any extra content"" on this DVD - presumably in reference to the episode with the Barbara Hale commentary.

Based on the very significant price drop and the inclusion of subtitles throughout the series -- as either [CC] or [SDH] format - I have changed my 1-star review to a 5-star review. In all honesty, I would prefer to give this item a ""4.5"" as it might be better packaged as a boxed set with at least some bonus material.

NOTE to Amazon: I do wish that Amazon would update the PRODUCT DETAILS section that identifies this item as a ""boxed set"" -- it really is not. And, it would have saved a lot of frustration -- and perhaps missed opportunities to sell this item -- if Amazon stated somewhere in the PRODUCT DETAILS section that this ""Complete Series Pack"" DOES INDEED include subtitles either in [CC] format or [SDH] format.

CLEARING UP THE ISSUE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN [CC] AND [SDH] SUBTITLES

There IS a difference between closed-captioning [CC] -- on the DVDs up through Season 5, Vol. 1 -- and [SDH] -- which is found on the remaining DVDs Season 5, Vol. 2 through to final Season 9, Vol. 2. The information below, courtesy of Wikipedia clarifies the difference between the two:

""[SDH] is an American term the DVD industry introduced. It is an initialism for ""[S]ubtitles for the [D]eaf or [H]ard-of-hearing"", and refers to regular subtitles in the original language where important non-dialog information has been added, as well as speaker identification, useful when the viewer cannot otherwise visually tell who is saying what.

The only significant difference for the user between ""SDH"" subtitles and ""closed captions"" is their appearance: SDH subtitles usually are displayed with the same proportional font used for the translation subtitles on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks a large portion of the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH subtitles, which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD subtitles can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display subtitles on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most subtitles use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD subtitles, since many SDH subtitles present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is very helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH subtitles (such as the subtitles of newer Universal Studios DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.""

Original Review of August 15, 2013
-------------------------------------------
For shame CBS/Paramount - and Amazon. This is NOT a ""boxed set""  - as it is clearly labeled in the PRODUCT DETAILS, FORMAT SECTION.  And I will be returning this item unopened for a full refund.

This item is simply a shrink-wrapped collection of all the individual previous season releases. The first two seasons (4 volumes) are even boxed differently (exactly as they were originally released) and differ from the remaining seasons 3 - 9 which are packaged in narrower DVD boxes.

Worse, they have shrink-wrapped these DVDs in such a way you can't even read the details of even a single season to answer common questions such as format, language, running-time, or whether or not there is closed-captioning/subtitles.

According to the ""official"" [...] site, closed captioning or subtitles - they use both terms at the site - do not appear as a feature until Season 5, Volume 2.

I was hoping this ""boxed set"" would have finally rectified that problem and that Seasons 1 through Season 5, Volume 1 would finally have closed-captioning/subtitles.

Why is this important? Because I had hoped to watch these programs with my Dad, who is 82 and hard of hearing. One would think CBS/Paramount might realize a very large portion of the sales of these DVDs would be targeted to older viewers who remember having watched the show when it originally aired. And that their hearing might not be so good as it once was.

I had high hopes for this boxed set - primarily that each and every season would now finally have closed-captioning/subtitles. Or that they might have even added DVD ""extra bonus"" materials to the set. It certainly appears not to be the case, [sorry for the pun] if all they did was to gather together parts 1 and 2 of each season only to shrink-wrap them together.

My first advice would be to avoid this ""bundle"" - it is not a boxed set, or an updated release, and offers no benefit at all to the consumer.  As of August 15, 2013 Amazon's price for this collection is $311.25. You might even find buying all the individual DVD releases cheaper than buying this collection.

Second, if closed-captioning/subtitles are important to you as they are to me, you might want to suggest this feature be included in a future ""true"" boxed-set at the official CBS/Paramount website at [...] I'm no spring chicken either - so down the road closed-captioning/subtitles might be useful to me, let alone my 82-year old Dad.

A very disappointed customer. And my first ever 1-star Amazon review.",1376524800,186,9172,4.741206030150754
5725442,5,B00CL1516E,"Perry Mason Complete Series Pack

The Perry Mason TV show lasted nine seasons, a record then. Few TV series lasted longer. Erle Stanley Gardner was the Worlds Greatest Author in his time, his books outsold the combined totals of his competitors. His stories were as stylized as baseball games. Season 1 used 36 of his novels for its 39 episodes, Season 2 used 15 of his novels for the 30 episodes. That was over half of his Perry Mason novels. The original novels are better. The films were the simplified and condensed versions of the novels, or new material. The later episodes became a formula where someone would confess in court at the end of the story. No story ever dealt with a false confession as in the 1947 movie Boomerang. In its day Perry Mason was criticized for never losing a case. What is the record for most police TV shows? There is a Perry Mason Television Book on this series, you can find it on the Internet.

Gardners novels educated the readers by using examples from law and science or new technology. He dedicated novels to an important person in medicine or law. Gardner founded The Court of Last Resort to exonerate the convicted innocent. Gardners stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some of this stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). Perry Mason advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. [There is a famous crime with these elements. You can read about Sacco & Vanzetti who were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis. Many believed they were innocent and were convicted as part of the repression of the 1920s. There was no physical evidence to link them to the crime.]

Erle Stanley Gardner generally avoided politics in this Perry Mason novels. Some of the A.A. Fair novels used political corruption in their stories. The 1967 novel The Case of the Queenly Contestant was publicized for the remark that a bullet found on a stretcher was not proof of anything but being planted. Dr. Milton Halpern was blacklisted by the government for criticizing the autopsy of JFK for its lack of an experienced medical examiner. A book written about the TV show said William Talman was not the first choice for DA Hamilton Burger. Raymond Burr played a DA in A Place in the Sun and a villain in earlier films like Borderline. There were other legal dramas (The Practice) but never lasted nine seasons. See the individual reviews for each volume for more details.",1372636800,21,2768,4.7625

5725446,2,B00CL1516E,"Concerning the actual DVDs, they are good stories, with good acting. I do not like how they use the same lieutenant in every story. That's highly unlikely to happen, in reality. Most Counties have many lieutenant's. Ours has over 20. My second complaint is how Mason's secretary follows him around on all the cases, like she's a detective. She should stay in her office and act like a normal secretary. She's miscast in this series anyway. They need a younger woman. She keeps sticking her nose in everything...giving her opinions. And her clothes are horrible...looks like she's wearing cotton housedresses...to her job  as secretary to a top notch lawyer. And lastly, I did receive all the correct discs, though I had to arrange in correct order. But the cases were badly broken and the outer case was torn badly. I tried to tape back the best I could. They need to give higher quality cases to hold this set. Otherwise they are good shows and come in clearly and sound is ok on most of them, some are way to quiet and I must turn up to 100 volume.

5725451,5,B00CL1516E,"I loved the quality of the DVDs because they were clear and not ""fuzzy"" like many copies of old programs.
I have seen Perry Mason many times with several different actors and I believe that Raymond Burr was not only the best Perry ever, but I think he did the part so well that he set a standard of excellence that is incomparable.  The same may be said of William Hopper, Barbara Hale and Ray Collins as they played their respective roles as Paul, Della and Lt. Tragg.  Hopper was the flashy and very handsome detective who was hired by Perry to ferret out information on all the nefarious characters who were involved in each case and ultimately to help lead Perry to a definitive conclusion as to guilt or innocence of the involved parties.  Della, of course was the beautiful and very competent legal secretary who kept the office maintained while also attending court with her boss.  Lt. Tragg had a very dry sense of humor and always let Perry know that the law must be followed so that the outcome of the case would be fair and equitable.  The shows are still interesting after six decades and this says alot about the choice of actors and the abilities of the directors.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes a murder mystery and the courtroom drama that follows to a logical conclusion.  Go and buy it!

5725460,5,B00CL1516E,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched form 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder. Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky privat investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1523404800,,1818,4.87987012987013

5725516,5,B00CL1516E,"Perry Mason is addictive. My husband and I watch a disk almost each night. Growing up watching Perry Mason was a weekly ritual in both of our homes. Over the last 25 years my husband and I would record any episodes but would be disappointed we could not see more Perry Mason. When we saw this set, we debated then seeing the ""trash"" being offered on tv we decided to make the jump and purchase the set. We are so happy we did. Guess we can NOT be labeled critics but we love the first four seasons so much more than the later seasons - more energy. The earlier seasons had more action and less dialogue. Now it has become a game to identify the character actors who appear repeatedly in the following seasons - and to pick out the guilty party. Some actors seem to be fated to always play the villain. The quality of the recordings are as good or better than the old black and white tv's I had in my house growing up. Every night we watch a disk either my husband or I shake our heads before voicing the comment - ""Does Della have any life of her own?"" We also like identifying and checking up on he internet on actors and actresses we grew up watching. If you like Perry Mason and solving mysteries, this is the gift for you. Guess we will start over again when we finish with with last season. This set is a keeper - so be ready to be entertained.",1509321600,8,1349,4.172413793103448

5725518,5,B00CL1516E,"I'd probably give this 4.5 stars if I could -- the content is great (of course) and a fine entertainment bargain at around 100 dollars for the full series -- but there are some quality issues from disk set to disk set that reflect widely varying quality control at CBS's DVD division over the years. The early seasons have somewhat washed out graphics that can be fixed somewhat with contrast/brightness adjustment. Later episodes seem to have greater native contrast depth. Even within the 3 volumes the set is divided into, there are significant presentation format differences from disk to disk. [At least their DVD division seems to have been more on their game than their online presence at CBS.com, where commercials could be as much as 4 times louder (18 dB!) than the program content.]

Warning: Though it's not possible to check your entire set quickly (270 52 minutes episodes!), I did find ONE (1) episode with a  2 minute glitch that stopped playback every time at the same place. After some experimentation, I found that if I manually sent the DVD player to anything greater than aprx 2 minutes, the rest of the program would play without error. One such problem was not a big deal to me, given the givens, but it would be a real bummer to have more!",1509235200,3,1263,4.684684684684685

Have to revise my review.  Apparently the the other seasons - 4 - 9 were received, but were taken by another member of the household without my knowledge.

I saw some reviews said what they received was a mess so I wanted to make special mention of this.

This is a great show representative of quality TV writing and drama.  Storylines are creative with plenty of unexpected events and the acting is good.  Love to watch the facial expressions when Perry's turning the tables of those on the witness stand.

The 72 discs are divided among 3 plastic cases, all contained in the pictured cardboard slipcase. The entire package is only 6 inches wide so this is a very compact set, and in my view a real bargain at the current (5/10/2017) price of $88. For 271 episodes, that comes to about 33 cents per episode.  Both video and audio are very good quality. My only complaint is that Amazon's write-up says the episodes include subtitles but in reality only about half of the set is subtitled. Season 1 thru the first half of Season 5 are not subtitled while the second half of Season 5 thru Season 9 are.

So far, there haven't been any extras on the DVDs, but there wasn't any on the half-season sets either, and I suspect that these disks are just a repackaging of the half-season sets. But that said, the Perry Mason TV show was so good, it really doesn't need any ""extras"" to make it worth owning. Like most older TV shows, even if you've watched it recently in syndication or on cable, you haven't really seen it, since modern broadcaster often cut as much as ten minutes out of older programs like this in order to cram in more commercials, so watching it on DVD is the only way to go. I've been watching Perry Mason since the late 1950s and the program holds up wonderfully. It is amazing to see how much people used to smoke on TV shows! While you watch this program, note all the famous and not-yet-famous actors who appear in various episodes, including a very young Robert Redford!

It's a window into the 50's culture, attire, idioms, references, and society. Women's wardrobe is a hoot! Quality is outstanding with picture very clear and detailed. One caveat, and hopefully someone can clue me in, subtitles don't work when playing on my DVD player (Sony) though they can be enabled when playing on a PC. I can't find the setup menu to turn them on. We enjoyed the censored subtitles when watching on Xfinity as they would substitute X's for objectionable references like SUXXXXIOUS for SUSPICIOUS, PEAXXXX for PEACOCK, and TURXXX for TURNIP.

5725606,5,B00CL1516E,"I want to urge all buyers to go through the disks and make sure they are all there.  You can use the liner notes as a guide.  We discovered that two disks from Season Nine were missing, including the one with the last episode where Erle Stanley Gardner plays the judge.  In their place were duplicates from Season Eight.  Amazon made it right by sending us another set.  Before returning the original order, we sat down and went through each Season to be sure there were no more missing disks.

Despite this glitch, it was great seeing Perry, Della, and Paul again.  The huge cars from that era, the awful hairstyles women wore, a time when the legal age was 21 and not 18, is pure nostaglia.  We've been watching one or two episodes daily and still are not halfway through the series.  Many stars had guest roles when they were young ""unknowns"" -- we recognized Barbara Eden, Leonard Nimoy, and Burt Reynolds to name a few.  Perry always got his man (or woman).",1489536000,13,962,4.477011494252873

So many look like they were made from the 16mm rerun film rather than the high quality original 35. I hope this holds up throughout the series. And by the way, Perry Mason was a terrific show, and still is.  Look at how long they kept their cast together, for example. Even though we always knew. Client was innocent, he managed to build up the excitement & interest to a fever pitch.  we watched it as a family when I was a kid. I enjoy it even more now, better understanding the adult  situations.  And imagine this, with no sex, in the current sense!

The very best thing for me is no longer sitting through all of the commercials trying to watch Perry and Della and Paul and Hamilton on ME-TV here in Phoenix Arizona. I waited a long time for this show to be placed in one boxed set and it was well worth it.  Great writing, great acting, great guest stars and 9 years of great television.  Raymond Burr is one of my favorite character actors and he is the glue that holds this show together, watch him in Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' and with Robert Mitchum in 'His Kind if Woman' and then as Perry Mason to measure the depth of his talents.

Packaging, Excellent, All videos has a separate plastic tray and each disc had 3 or 4 episodes.
Videos Outstanding, All were clear and smooth.
Sound Outstanding. Every episode the sound was perfect
Content:. Were again top notch, I can't remember any series that had so many great episodes. The stories were believable and interesting with many leading recognizable stars in supporting roles.
Raymond Burr was cast in a lot of ""B"" rated movies before this series aired.  After this he took off he worked hard and became a major success.

Remember kids, to a company that has grown too big to fail, you are meaningless, and most especially if you're disabled. A-z is not interested in you if you don't do it strictly their way.

Per an Az Chat Agent, I'll try asking my question here since the Product Question section is missing from this product page (odd): Has any Verified Purchaser played this specific set of DVDs on continuous/loop/repeat yet? I'm an insomniac so this feature matters and sadly, no, not all DVDs will obey the DVD player command. Usually ""Repeat Title"" does the trick but a few only obey ""Repeat Disc"" and some won't repeat at all. I know that at least the first 4 Seasons of Mission: Impossible, a CBS DVD product, will repeat, non-stop, if that helps to know.

5725673,5,B00CL1516E,"I never watched the classic TV series PERRY MASON when it first aired. Thats because I was born the same year that the series based on the books by Erle Stanley Gardner about a tireless lawyer in search of justice for his clients began. PERRY MASON went on to run for nine seasons, ending in 1966. Even then I wasn't watching it. No, I discovered PERRY MASON the same way most of us did, in reruns and syndication. I came on board late in the game and found the series to be one of the most entertaining Id come across. And now its all been collected in one great package.

The series told the story of Mason (Raymond Burr), a lawyer who knew all the tricks of the trade. Each week Mason, aided by his secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale) and private detective Paul Drake (William Hopper) took on a new client and helped them from small crimes to murder. His main nemesis in the series was District Attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman), a man he respected and was friends with outside of the court room.

The best thing about the series was that each week a different story, a different defendant, made for compelling mysteries that had you guessing till the end. That was the fun of the series, trying to figure it out before the end of the show. Those endings have been satirized for years since with the famous court room admissions from the witness chair that Mason always seemed able to pull out of the most confident witness.

Is there a favorite episode? I don't think you can lay claim to any one particular show. Not when you have 271 episodes to choose from. To be honest Ive only begun to watch this collection. When you consider there are 72 discs involved to hold that many episodes the odds are it will take a while before finishing. But it won't take that long to enjoy the series for what it was, a groundbreaking series that held the attention of fans for years. It was so popular that a TV movie called PERRY MASON RETURNS brought the remaining cast members back together in 1985 and was so popular that it led to a series of made for TV movies that came out and continued through 1993!

The series has been available for some time on DVD and broken down by year or split in two for each year. Selling for anywhere from $10-15 dollars per seasonal part that broke down to anywhere from $180-250 dollars for the whole series. Now you can buy the entire series in this single boxed set for $180 retail or $150 at amazon. The set is nicely put together in three cases that hold the discs well and keep everything together in much less space than the previous individual seasons held.

For fans this is the perfect way to have the collection on hand. It will offer hours of entertainment and puzzle solving for the arm chair detective. It is family friendly rather than the current spate of law shows that seem intent on delving into the worst cases of sexual deviant or scenes of blood drenched corpses. Mind you Im not slamming those shows but if you enjoy series like this and have kids the odds aren't great that youll be able to watch these shows while the kids are awake. The same isn't true for this series which all ages can watch. The clothes might seem funny to the kids but the stories are still captivating.

This is a set that the collector will want to have on hand. I got rid of my split seasons with this one here to add to my shelf. My guess is that Perry Mason fans will want to do the same. While the price may seem high it is actually quite a bargain. Even more so when you consider the entertainment value as well. This one is worth owning.",1477008000,3,3581,4.36936936936937
5725674,5,B00CL1516E,"I like the good clean entertainment.  I also like the old radios and telephones (What I grew up with).  The 50's cars are a sight for sore eyes.  NO cell phones, NO pagers, No GPS, NO Televisions in the early episodes.",1476921600,3,218,4.2682926829268295
5725675,5,B00CL1516E,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about this set.  There was an older set which are reflected in ALL reviews prior to October 4, 2016 when the NEW boxed set came out.  This review is for the NEW set.  It's nicely packaged with 3 folios, each thick folio has 3 seasons worth of Perry Mason episodes.  They are secured in plastic holders like many DVD's, 2 discs per 'page' which can be flipped like a book to find the right disc, each disc  contains 3 or 4 episodes.  I find the numbering system to be confusing, a season is divided into 2 volumes, each volume contains 4 or 5 discs.  So you have Season 1, Vol 1, Disc 1 through 5, and then Season 1, Vol 2, Disc 1 through 5, etc.  It makes it hard to find exactly what you want.  It would have cleaner to have Season 1, Disc 1 through 10 instead.  And the color of the discs are grey with shiny silver lettering and there is little contrast between the disc and the lettering making identifying any one disc that much more difficult.  It looks flashy but it would have been far more practical to use BLACK lettering for easier reading.  Technically the episodes are cleanly reproduced with good video and audio, no issues whatsoever.  There appears to be no 'extras' or other background information, just the episodes as they were broadcast, each episode about 52-53 minutes.  I give it 5 stars but due to the packaging I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could have.  But I recommend this set if you like Perry Mason, each episode costs less than 50 cents, and you can't buy much entertainment these days for 50 cents an hour.",1476748800,14,1583,4.31864406779661

It doesn't really matter if I do or not, I am looking forward to seeing every one of them! They just don't make them like that anymore. And any time I can watch TV with no commercials, I am in heaven!

Unfortunately, we have been moving and have not had a chance to contact the seller about the problem previously and no longer have that option. Guess we will be buying that again. Also, in order to keep it together as a set you have to put it in a box or something so it's not very easy to grab and go. Quality seems good and the price was great compared to the actual box set, but hate that there is no way to even send a message to the seller because it's been too long or whatever the problem is. My advice is, check carefully when it arrives to be sure you have all of the right sets.

It kind of reminds me of a small playhouse where you see the same company actors playing different roles in each play. We get a kick out of all the improbabilities in the stories, even made up a game of who can spot items on a list first during an episode- things like ""door open, dead body inside"" ""blackmail"" ""avoiding a scandal"" ""proxy battle"" etc. It's like a bingo game. It is so amusing how so many of the episodes have the same basic elements but in a way that's what makes it so comfortable and entertaining to watch, you know the truth will win out in the end, the murderer will come clean, and all will be well in the little world of Perry, Della and Paul.",1444867200,2,1024,4.283505154639175

This set has every episode of the this long running show with the trio of problem solving personalities, Perry, Della Street and Paul Drake. While over the run of the series there is a formula that is rarely deviated from, the first half of the episode is the set up or the crime, and the second half of the episode is the trial or some sort of courtroom drama.  Even with this formula you are left guessing till the last minute as to who did the deed.  The quality of each of these episodes is top notch, sharp and clean, and most importantly are not edited.  What I really enjoyed in these un-cut shows are the little bits with Perry, Della and Paul interacting that are largely cut out of the syndicated episodes.  I find they add a lot of the personality that is missing from the repeats on cable.

5725765,5,B00CL1516E,"Perry Mason aired for 9 seasons starting in 1957, which was a long run for a TV series during those days.  Remember that there were only three major networks during that period.  It was more difficult for a show to remain on the air for a long period of time, unlike today, where there are many channels that need to have many programs to fill their schedules.  So, a TV show had to have characteristics that would keep viewers interested in order to survive more than a few seasons. What enabled this show to be so successful is that each episode was a ""Who done it?"" in which the viewer could rarely accurately identify  the actual perpetrator of the crime. All of the shows were titled ""The Case of (fill in the blank).""  Because of the way in which each episode was structured, my title for each show was ""The case of the confused viewer""

The episodes were often difficult for viewers to follow, especially for someone like me who was a youngster during much of the show's duration.  But, the shows were engrossing and the acting was first rate.  There were many lesser-known TV character actors who appeared on Perry Mason over the years and it's a pleasure to see them again.  Actors such as Cecil Kellaway, George Macready, Joe DeSantis, Paula Raymond and Jacqueline Scott are but a few examples of the many guest stars that appeared over the years.  There were a number of different actors who played the judges in the cases.  They were all believable in their demeanors and in their delivery when ruling on points of law.  The directors were meticulous in filming most of the episodes.  If you look at the extras playing the courtroom spectators observing the trials in each of the episodes, they all appear to be paying close attention to the proceedings.  It all appears very realistic.

Most of the seasons were filmed in black and white and the photography is fine.

For anyone who grew up during those years, it's fun to again see the automobiles, hair styles and clothing of the era. Promoting smoking was not viewed negatively during those TV years.  So, new viewers might be surprised to see so many cigarettes being smoked, even in the office environment.

Raymond Burr was very believable as Perry Mason.  Mr. Burr had to learn many lines for each show and he was challenged as an actor.  It was a grueling schedule.  Of course, the Perry Mason character has no connection to reality.  He always won his case.  One wonders how the D.A. kept his job.  But, viewers didn't care because the show was really about identifying the real murderer in each episode and enjoying the fine acting of the guest stars.  Both this show and Law & Order also overlook the fact that criminal cases do not go to trial almost immediately after the commission of a crime.  It takes many months to get to trial. It also takes time just to get to a preliminary pre-trial hearing.  But, it would be difficult to present these shows in a real time context.

As an aside, I never cared much for the modern off-beige or pale tiger-wood type paneling in Mason's office.  I'd prefer something more like what would be seen in an old Edward Arnold movie.  But, the show was supposed to be set in modern L.A.  The office dcor suffered for it.

Finally, the show featured a very moving and moody musical theme.  There's an excellent recording of the theme by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  It's on youtube. but the same recording of it can be found on a CD titled ""Cult Files"" in much cleaner sound.

This was a very entertaining show.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas.",1433203200,6,3581,4.593059936908517

I had been watching a few episodes on digital TV and it wasn't nearly as nice as the DVDs.  Most importantly, this series is awesome!!!  I can't tell you how much I am enjoying the series.  What a treasure for me.  I was too young to watch the original series but saw some in syndication when I was young, the 1970s, and enjoyed them.  I love watching the old cars, and scenes from L.A.  The storylines hold their age really well.  Of course, technology and the like have changed, but Perry Mason is still a brilliant lawyer.

Here is something about CC and SDH:
(My TV: Toshiba 32 inch; DVD player: SONY , not blueray, output: AV & HDMI)
1) S1-S5.1 : CC( closed caption)
Works only for AV cables(Red, yellow, white); there is no setting from DVD player, the subtitle can be displayed by TV setting( from TV remoter CC button, select CC1); if using HDMI there is no CC signal.

2) S5.1~s9 SDH([S]ubtitles for the [D]eaf or [H]ard-of-hearing)

We love trying to name the various character actors/actresses of the Golden Age of movies and radio.  And the cars are so wonderful; they were actually made of steel and built to last in America!.  These programs take us back to the late Fifties, when we were teenagers in high school.  Television programs then had plots and dialogue: people actually had meaninguful words to say to each other.  There was no reliance on blowing up sets and killing large numbers of extras--unlike today's idea of programming.  And Perry and his crew dressed beautifully!  These programs, enjoyable as they are, remind me how much we've lost in American culture and manufacturing during the last half-century.",1430092800,3,798,5.131782945736434

The first PERRY MASON T.V. case premiered in the year 1957 and the final case was May 22, 1966 that's a span of nine years, the interesting thing about this series is how the cast remained intact over the years nobody jumped ship so to speak, I'm not the only PERRY MASON fan I once read where SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR mentioned that she was a fan of PERRY MASON so I'm in good company. It's fun to see how the type of cars and fashion changes from the 50s to the 60s as the wheel of justice turns, I'm willing to bet that a lot of people were inspired to study law after watching PERRY MASON do his thing, you will not be found guilty if you buy and watch the PERRY MASON show on DVD.

5725818,5,B00CL1516E,"I first saw Perry Mason in 1957 at my grandparents home. If I remember correctly, Perry Mason came on after The Lawrence Welk Show. I thought, and still do, that he was the greatest Lawyer on television. I can only imagine how many careers that Raymond Burr
influenced. He was a real trial lawyer, even if most all of his cases were won during the Preliminary Hearing. Like others, I wish this series was offered as a boxed set; not the series in a box. I love the fact that the series was left in Black & White. If it were colorized a lot would be lost. The format has been digitalized and the sound is top quality. A steal at this price.",1399334400,2,639,4.203252032520325
5725819,5,B00CL1516E,"Perry Mason was the very definitionof what it meant to be a great lawyer.  There are few alive who haven't heard of Perry Mason.  Perry Mason is part of the cultural lexicon. If a lawyer does a really good job its considered a compliment to be called a real life, ""Perry Mason!""  Perry Mason struck a chord in America, he was a real hard nosed lawyer who was not afraid to sweat the details.  Perry Mason knew his stuff in the courtroom, the boardroom and on the streets.

Helped by his able bodied executive assistant Della Street Perry Mason was always one step ahead of the criminals and prosecutor Burger.  The characters in Perry Mason were stock type characters.  Lt Tragg was the perfect hard bitten police detective, mistrustful, sly and cunning.  Always Tragg a sharp witty thing at the ready in hopes of catching Perry Mason off guard. The people who could afford to engage Perry Mason were generally from the upper classes behaving badly. It must be noted that one episode featured Perry Mason taking the case of a very poor lady who could never afford Perry Masons real life fees yet she engaged him. Perry Mason was the ladies advocate fighting for her cause with typical Perry Mason zeal.  He spared no expense investigating her case via Mr Drake Mason's favorite private detective.

In the end the ladies cause was vindicated she won her case. Still oblivious to the true cost of the legal procedings she gave Perry Mason a few dollars down payment on her legal bill.  The kindly lady promised to make good on her entire bill having no idea of the real cost. Perry graciously took the small amount of money. Della processed it at which time we saw the real breakdown of the expenses associated with her case.  It was in the thousands. Perry told the sweet lady her tiny sum covered the entire expense of her case her bill was satisfied.  That showed me Perry Mason had a heart, that was the best episode in the series for me and it won Perry Mason my undying respect.

Perry Mason while not strictly a Film Noir vehicle is still chock full of awesome film noir qualities.  The black and white media gives the world of Perry Mason a film noir quality as light and shadow are often used effectively to create mood and convey clandestine activities. Mr. Drake was a playboy and a good private investigator of a quality firm.  Drake was dapper and self assured if just a bit stiff.  I had a few of the Perry Mason episodes but I enjoy Perry Mason so much when the complete series pack was released I had to have it.  many people today hate anything in black and white. What most people don't realize that telling a story in black & white is a much richer experience because; it must draw you in, Good black and white story telling invites the viewer to fill in the voids with their own color.  Black and white stories challenge the viewer to participate in the narrative by supplying their own color via imagination.

Color TV and todays show everything culture including every gruesome or sexual detail leaves nothing to the imagination. Black & White story telling does not encourage you to use your imagination it demands that you contribute to the viewing experience as you infuse the story with your own color. Perry Mason shows our adversarial legal system functioning at its best.  I'm too young to remember Perry Mason when it played prime time. I do remember Perry Mason was the last show to air Friday nights when I was young and TV went off the air at 12 midnight not to return till 6 AM the next morning.  I remember that on Fridays I was allowed to stay up and watch Perry Mason, then I had to go to sleep.  Awaken your best Perry Mason memories or check Perry Mason out for the first time.  See Perry Mason and experience our legal system the way it was meant to be.",1397779200,15,3791,4.500729927007299
5725820,4,B00CL1516E,"i'm taking a star off this review because of the way the dvds are packaged.  they are in nice dvd cases and the episodes are of good quality (the ones I've seen).  however, they are bundled in one long package (about 11.5"") with a single strip of 1-7/8""  plastic.  a box would have been nice, now i'll have to find or make one of the exact dimensions.

now to get something off my chest:  how many people need captioning in order to be able to get the most out of these shows?  there are actors talking with their backs to the camera or out of view entirely, accents, unseen telephone conversations, tv street noise, noisy air conditioners drowning out the tv sound, etc, etc.  there are many of us who need to not only see the action, but read what is said.  we see that these dvds are captioned, and say ""all right, I don't have to watch this on un-captioned metv, or wait until there's a short marathon on hallmark, or put up with commercials.  it's worth it to buy these to watch at my convenience!""

my old Samsung dvd player died, so I bought a sony Blu-ray player to watch my new perry mason dvds.  the captioning didn't work, so after a lot of research I found a comment about needing to turn off your progressive scan.  ok, I can do that.  however, there is absolutely no mention of progressive scan in the dvd player user manual.  more research was required to uncover the fact that on my player, I had to push the stop button on the remote for 5 seconds.  nope, that didn't work either.  ""what is this carp?""  finally I found an answer on the web - hdmi cables (and component video) will not carry the captioning signals!  you need av cables with the red, yellow, and white rca jacks.  of course, my new Blu-ray player only has hdmi outputs.  i'm waiting on a new Samsung dvd-e360 from amazon prime - I made sure it has av jacks, and the online manual says the progressive scan is controlled by a menu.

my beef:  so much is made about ""let's make this world better for hearing-impaired people, by passing a law that says all tv shows have to be captioned!""  that's great, but lawmakers ignore the fact that while equipment manufactures and dvd producers get away with claiming ""hdmi!"", ""progressive scan!"", and ""captioned!"" - nobody mentions that the captioning won't work with the other two.  is this supposed to be common knowledge?  if so, I sure didn't know, and i'm not exactly a hermit.

my point (and thanks for listening):  hopefully somebody who can make a difference will see this review.  maybe there are other people who did not know this stuff and have written one-star reviews for ""captions don't work"".  the guy's 83-year-old father will not have to be disappointed.  just because hi-tech can be great, there can be unknown drawbacks that they don't let you know easily.  after my new dvd player arrives, and if the captions still don't work, i'm sure there will be more research required.  as if I have all the time in the world.  I might update this later.",1396569600,12,2985,4.476808905380334

Here in Utah our local PBS station has been playing a few episodes from here and there, very spotty and I can't tell if they're doing it sequence..so out of boredom I looked up the perry mason tv episodes on Wikipedia...

Holy cow there's 270 of them!!  Turns out a bunch of these episodes have never been released for syndication either so they only showed the episode during their original tv airing...also there's apparently an episode where Perry technically loses a case...

Anyway I knew i had to buy all of them.. I figure at my rate it's going to take me a good year to watch them all (or more..).  Some are quirky...some are very dated...(50's...times were...really different back then haha..and what about women's bras back there holy cow talk about pointed..) but for cold winter nights or not much going on and I feel like watching Perry Mason?  I got it covered...

Anyway, I'm happy with the purchase.  All 9 seasons are here.  I wish they had these for blue ray (not for quality because the quality is good enough but...just to put more episodes on less disc's..) but I'm enjoying it and if you're a Perry Mason fan I think this is a good buy....some of these videos were like $20~$40 per season...and that was too much for 9 seasons...also the order of the episodes are in order of them being aired originally so you might get confused why some are out of sequence...so far I haven't seen any issues with the DVD's or quality...course then I'm only on Season 3...

Raymond Burr was a great actor and without using foul language keep people engaged and coming back for more....",1380412800,36,324,4.4
5725852,4,B00CL1516E,"Wonderful to see these old shows again.

To set some expectations...

Not a boxed set. The individually shrink-wrapped season packs are banded into one giant bundle and shrink-wrapped overall. (A lot of work to get it all unwrapped.)

Doesn't appear to include the bonus material that is part of the 4-disc ""50th Anniversary Edition"" sampler package. (The Anniversary Edition is inexpensive - and well worth buying for the test scenes alone. The contrast between William Hopper and Raymond Burr, each testing as Perry Mason is very interesting. Burr had already completely worked out the subtle character of Perry Mason. Burr as Hamilton Burger just didn't have the edge. No tests of Barbara Hale or William Talman.)

The order of the episodes on the discs is apparently the order in which the episodes were filmed, which does not always match the order of first broadcast given in the IMDB and in the Wikipedia episode list. This explains why sometimes the same cast members appear a couple of episodes apart on the discs, and why Wesley Lau is an ordinary suspect in one episode - and a detective lieutenant a couple of episodes later.

Some glitches in producing the sets. For example, the cast list for ""The Case of the Sad Sicilian"" on disc 8/2/2 is also given as the cast list for ""The Case of the Nebulous Nephew"" on disc 7/1/1. (Very obvious given the Italian names of the characters and actors.)

There are editing anomalies in some episodes. Sometimes a character pops up without any transition. Or there are odd transitions. For example, in ""The Case of the Hateful Hero"" (6/1/1) at 11:53 there is an odd truncated snippet of music - and it cuts to a closeup of a nameplate on a desk - ""Fleta York"" - as though picking up on a name mentioned earlier in the episode. She has two lines in that scene and never appears again - but the actress is listed on the first page of the credits ahead of actors who had bigger roles.

These may be last-minute edits done when the original shows were made, or short chunks of damaged film that they couldn't restore, or lost for some other reason. Another commenter suggests that there may have been music rights issues.

I checked a few episode lengths. The episode lengths are consistent within 15 seconds between the episodes in each season -  varying from 50 minutes to more than 52 minutes as network advertising space requirements changed over time.

Perry Mason was not Great Cinema Art - and that's part of the fun. Making enough episodes of a one-hour show to fill a season is not precise or easy. There are different directors and styles. The guests sometimes chew the scenery (for example Jeanette Nolan in the ""Hateful Hero"") but Burr manages to work with them all. The plots often have major holes, especially when an entire Gardner book is condensed into a TV episode. Sometimes the story feels a bit ""off"" because it was not originally written for Perry Mason and has been adapted. The camera dolly wobbles. Someone drops something on the set. Sometimes an actor fluffs a line and it is fixed by re-recording the audio.

The beautiful black-and-white photography is well-preserved and the sound is excellent. (When changing over from watching a color movie to watch a black-and-white Perry Mason episode, take a moment to adjust the contrast. It works best on my set to also turn the color level to zero.)

The subtle portrayal by Raymond Burr; the fun he has in scenes with Ray Collins; the way Burr never steals scenes from other actors. The interplay between the ongoing characters. The teamwork and subtle humor. The way Mason, Drake, Burger, and Tragg often work together to nail the real murderer. (I never really realized how good William Talman was in that role until I saw the Raymond Burr test for the Hamilton Burger role from the ""Anniversary"" set.)

The series is also an insight into how things have changed over the decades: phone booths; the loving shots of the huge cars lent by Ford; people smoking all the time and offering each other cigarettes; racial and ethnic typecasting; men and women sometimes wearing hats; women wearing gloves; getting from place to place in LA in 15 minutes or to a beach house in 30 minutes...

8582937,4,B00CL1516E,"Let me state first that I love this show. I am not dissuaded from watching it by the elements of my own critique, but be aware:
1.  The show is very formulaic; i.e., the plot's setup and conclusion are always the same.
2.  The crime the defendant is tried for is always murder.
3.  The detestable character is always the murder victim.
4.  The defendant is never guilty.
5.  The truly guilty party is always in the courtroom, and (almost) always confesses.
6.  Mason never loses, and Burger (or his stand-in) never wins.
7.  The show will make you question how anyone from the 50s or 60s escaped getting lung cancer (everyone in this show smoked except Della, but if you research Barbara Hale, you learn she was practically a chain-smoker in real life, as if her voice alone isn't a dead giveaway). Bill Talman and Ray Collins both died long ago from smoking-related maladies.

If you are among those who believe intelligent dialogue in a show is important, and that you can never have too much of a good thing, this show is for you.",1531353600,,1033,4.516129032258065

8582941,5,B00CL1516E,"One of my favorite things I've ever bought on Video. I'm still watching it now (about half way though the 9 seasons). I can't seem to want to do anything but watch this. And I'm not a TV watcher. I love this older, simpler mysteries. I've always loved watching this show on TV ever since I was a little boy (and I'm old now).It's big and has lots of disc. Very nice picture and sound, but all B&W (except for that one episode). / I wish I could buy more things in life that I enjoy like I have this so far.",1530316800,,506,3.9705882352941178

8582944,1,B00CL1516E,"A very silly show with some good production values. How silly?

1. A regular attorney finds himself involved with a murder in every case.

2. The district attorney of Los Angeles County personally tries every case and loses. How did he get reelected? No other lawyers in his vast office?

3. Every murder has the same police sergeant on the scene. ""Hello Lt. Tragg."" Did the LAPD only have one officer?

4. Paul Drake has the ability to uncover any bit of information in a matter of minutes. Did he also walk on water and heal the afflicted?

5. Contrived ""twisted"" plots out of left field that even Raymond Burr admitted were confusing.

6. Perry Mason puts his life on the line for clients who couldn't pay his retainer for a cup of coffee.

7. The ""wrap-up"" were everyone's jolly after all the murder and carnage. ""How about that filet mignon now, Perry."" Music up.",1529971200,,868,4.561290322580645
8582945,5,B00CL1516E,We loved this series back when it first aired on TV.  It was a blast getting to watch it all over again.  It's just as good now as it was back then.  We definitely recommend this series.,1529798400,,186,3.972972972972973
