116024,3,0790741431,"William Wellman's long unavailable Track of the Cat finally makes it to DVD in a good but not exceptional widescreen transfer. Sadly, it proves to be one of those films better remembered than seen, failing to live up to fond memory and revealing itself to be an ambitious but largely unsuccessful experiment. William Clothier's Scope ""black and white"" color cinematography is largely successful, especially in the surprisingly few location scenes, but the art direction on the all-too obviously artificial studio sets makes it feel like two distinctly different movies: a stagebound pseudo Eugene O'Neill drama about a house of secrets torn apart by a long day's journey into light and an assembly of second-unit footage of Robert Mitchum adrift in a snowy landscape as his bravado and ego break down in the face of an unseen enemy (in this case a deadly ""painter"") and hostile elements. Unfortunately we get far more of the homestead theatrics than the tracking, and there's none of the menace and dripping dread so prevalent in the novel.

It's not exactly a bad film, and once you get past the wildly overlong and stagey opening 22 minutes it picks up steam, but it's hard to shake the feeling of a missed opportunity here. Mitchum, Tab Hunter and Teresa Wright all offer good performances, but Val Lewton or Charles Laughton could have made so much more of it.

The extras package is good, although there's surprisingly little about the actual making of the film aside from the excellent audio commentary and the theatrical trailer advertised on the sleeve is nowhere to be found on the disc itself.",1152144000,,1603,4.933333333333334
116025,4,0790741431,"Robert Mitchum helped to introduce the psychological western in the landmark film Pursued. In Track of the Cat, he continued to chart new territory for what was already a well-worn genre in 1954.

Track of The Cat, set on Mount Ranier, features Mitchum as the forceful head of a very disfunctional family in the waning days of the 1800's. Mitchum is the middle child, but runs roughshod over his gentle older brother, played by William Hopper (Paul Drake of TV's Perry Mason), and his younger, unconfidant brother, played by 50's heartthrob Tab Hunter. The rest of the family is a spinsterish sister, played by Teresa Wright, (who was in Pursued with Mitchum), and overbearing mother and alcoholic father, played by Beulah Bondi and Philip Tonge.
When a mountain lion begins to attach their cattle, Mitchum and Hooper start out on a lion hunt. Back home, Hunter is trying to navigate an uneasy visit by his girfriend, who is welcomed by half the family and disliked by the other half. Much drama and tragedy ensues.

The predominant use of black and white by director William Wellman is very effective, but it would have been wasted without such a great cast. Everyone is excellent, particularly Mitchum, Bondi, and Tonge, who played comic relief with great effect.

This is a great film long overdue on DVD.",1131926400,25,1308,4.856502242152466

Quick review (no spoilers)..Three brothers live together. A big cat has been attacking their cattle. While this is going on the family dynamic is a mess with a lot of tension in the house. Robert Mitchum, Teresa Wright and YES Tab Hunter all do a good job.

How true might such be to real life? One wonders and I suppose in getting us to ponder life the director has achieved his aim.
Was the movie entertaining, not altogether yet Tab Hunter was perfectly adequate in his role and revealed a physique both athletic and easy on the eye.

The screenplay seems to look more like a Eugene O'NEIL drama like ""Desire Under the elms"", with mixed characters, leaded by a rather dominating mother, and a weak father mostly interested in the bottle ! It's most unusual to watch a film in Warnercolor...in black and white, but William WELLMAN did it, and it still works, with some beautiful scenes, like the burrying of the son.",1400457600,,663,4.773913043478261

On his first two days warming by the fire he watched it 3X in a row!

116140,4,0790741431,"This is a (northerly Western) Guilty Pleasure to be sure, but there you have it. Wellman's long career invites comparison with those of two of his cohorts, the slightly senior Allan Dwan and the slightly junior Delmer Daves. All three excelled in a bewildering variety of genres, enjoyed lengthy careers and without apology bestowed upon us many Guilty Pleasures. These directors are celebrated today--Wellman particularly--for all the wrong reasons, and all the wrong films.

Wild Bill delivered solid Warners gangster pictures, breezy aviation epics that have worn rather better than those of Hawks, and offbeat Westerns that were surprisingly progressive for their era. Too there's his Stanwyck trilogy of NIGHT NURSE, an ecdysiast film and the sadly neglected and underrated THE GREAT MAN'S LADY, one of the choicest Stanwyck-McCrea pairings and a Guilty Pleasure, no less than WESTWARD THE WOMEN which is--you guessed it--a protofeminist Western. (And Wellman completists will be stunned by Ruth Chatterton in 1932's gutsy melodrama FRISCO JENNY, the director's personal career favorite.)

Nearing retirement, Wellman had a busy year in 1954, and his energy entering into his seventh decade is prodigal with THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY and ISLAND IN THE SKY, both John Wayne aviation suspensers; while this TRACK OF THE CAT is Wellman's second (and more pictorially filmic) adaptation from Walter Van Tilburg Clark. DP William Clothier's second unit was dispatched to Mt. Rainier to shoot muted-color snowscapes (the Sierra Nevada were not foreboding enough) and back in Burbank Wellman assembled a splendid ensemble cast: Mitchum, resplendent in chaps and scarlet mackinaw, is teamed again with the great Teresa Wright, Beulah Bondi reliably does her cranky matriarch thing yet again, William Hopper girds his loins for Nick Ray and REBEL, and even Diana Lynn and Tab Hunter register in fairly thankless roles.

The film comes at the end of a long and intriguing cycle of psychological (or psychotic) Westerns: PURSUED (Mitchum-Wright); BLOOD ON THE MOON (Mitchum); THE FURIES; and the culminating, loopy RANCHO NOTORIOUS and JOHNNY GUITAR. TRACK OF THE CAT exerts its own peculiarly strange fascination: it is hypnotic (like MOONRISE or PETER IBBETSON) yet also entertaining for its Warnercolor snowscapes, the varied cast and Wellman's assured control of the proceedings, a vanity film considerably more personal than any of his other Westerns. It is also a key Mitchum film, coming at a time (just preceding NIGHT OF THE HUNTER) when that man's illustrious career was beginning to sag. As a Wellman/Mitchum ""art film"" TRACK OF THE CAT will get under your skin, especially if you read Van Tilburg Clark's excellent source novel as its necessary companion piece.",1389484800,,2765,5.3517241379310345

116181,1,0790741431,"This picture isn't 'minimalist', it's empty.

Yup -- he dies because he failed to secure those peanut-butter sandwiches. And yes, Tab Hunter's hero is such a pliable mama's boy, it's inconceivable that any girl, much less Diana Lynn, could find him attractive. Don't let this 'Cat' litter your living room.",1198713600,5,569,4.533980582524272
116182,3,0790741431,"A disturbingly dysfunctional family is at the heart of TRACK OF THE CAT, which tries to impose symbolic significance on the threat of the creature that is being stalked by the two oldest brothers. But the tale, filmed in muted color with Mitchum's red jacket dominating the screen, tends to be a somber and talky character-driven tale exploring deeper meanings but never quite connecting with them.

The performances are standard except for Mitchum who does a believable job as the loutish oldest brother in an underwritten role. TERESA WRIGHT, DIANA LYNN and TAB HUNTER do fairly standard work, under William A. Wellman's slow-paced direction.

It's a stark and brooding story of an isolated farm family living in a remote area and haunted by the symbolic ""cat"" of the title. Photographed in muted WarnerColor with effective background music by Roy Webb, its somber wintry atmosphere is well captured in the opening scene but becomes tedious before the story reaches a midway point because a real connection with the troubled characters is never really made.

All the cast members have done better work elsewhere. It's hard to believe how matronly and severe TERESA WRIGHT became for this role. She's almost unrecognizable as the spinsterish sister, only a few years beyond her delicate work as a leading lady in many films of the '40s. WILLIAM HOPPER is effective as Mitchum's outspoken brother.

All the interiors are filmed in a style that seems more like a filmed play than a film. BEULAH BONDI as the embittered mother manages to give some gravitas to the story. ROBERT MITCHUM gives his usual sturdy and colorful performance as the oldest son hellbent on tracking a killer cat. TAB HUNTER as the weakest younger brother has less to work with and plays the majority of his scenes with nothing more than a solemn gaze.

A fairly interesting, harsh, character-driven tale that should have been much more effective with better dialog and family dynamics.",1189900800,4,1957,5.009230769230769
116183,5,0790741431,"Absolutely everyone in this movie was sensational.  Everyone! Even the scary ""so called"" Indian Joe Sam.  But Tab Hunter really held  his own against the more seasoned and less handsome star - Robert Mitchum.  I have watched this movie over and over for years, but when I saw it on DVD - on AMAZON, it was well worth buying this copy.  The commentary is excellent and Tab so funny and charming disucssing his feelings about the director and his costars.  I really enjoyed the lady who discussed how training the horse who played ""Kentuck"" as well as other horses trained in Hollywood.  She was really good too.  I keep hearing people say - ""But we didn't get to see the cat!"" And hearing Mr. Wellman's son say his dad sort of regretted not showing us the ""black panther"" was a mistake, I have to disagree.  When the cat kills ""Arthur"" in the movie - having his reaction to knowing he was about to die and seeing the fear in his eyes and not seeing the cat was perfect!  I like not seeing the cat, it makes me wonder really how big was this cat really.  I like the old saying - less is more - it really gives us an impression the way the old films did.  They gave us more imagination.  This is lost in today's movie making.  I sure would suggest you buy this movie, it's well worth it and Tab Hunter is great in everything he does.",1177804800,19,1330,4.268
116184,2,0790741431,"After watching the fabulous bonus features on this DVD (a biography of William 'Wild Bill' Wellman with observations by Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter, another bio of ""Track"" author Walter Van Tilburg Clark, a look at actual mountain lions and their habitat, and more), I realized I held a 'minority opinion' of the film, itself, compared to many of the reviewers you'll read, here; I think it is stagy, lacks the sense of dread and palpable suspense of the novel, and doesn't 'hold up' as well as most of the director's work.

A tale of a dysfunctional family at it's boiling point, and the impact a nearly primordial panther has, in changing their lives, the characters, with the exception of always watchable Robert Mitchum, as the domineering middle son, are all either boring, frustratingly indecisive, or downright unlikable. Oldest son William Hopper, best-known as 'Paul Drake' in television's ""Perry Mason"", is the dreamer, who 'bonds' with the environment, but lacks the instinctive power to defeat the cat, and never comes across as more than wishy-washy; bitter spinster sister Teresa Wright offers a one-note portrayal that soon becomes grating; youngest son Tab Hunter is so wimpy that you quickly lose interest in him; Philip Tonge, the loquacious alcoholic father, whose drinking problem, in the novel, is tragic, here becomes a stereotyped comic drunk, with hidden bottles of liquor providing 'comic relief'; Diana Lynn, as Hunter's girl, tries hard, but never seems more than a minor character in the proceedings; even legendary Beulah Bondi, as the greedy, Bible-spouting, mean-spirited mother, seems to simply channel her 'bad mom' portrayal from the ""What if?"" sequence of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Worst of all, ex-Little Rascal Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer, encased in phony-looking 'old age' make-up to 'pass' as a 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man, looks neither believable, or comfortable in the role.

With a farm set that looks patently artificial (and obviously on a sound stage), the outdoor scenes, shot at Mount Rainier, must take up the slack; sadly, despite the creativity in using high contrasts to make the colors achieve a 'black and white' look, the book's greatest asset, the constant, frightening 'unseen' presence of the malevolent cat was, to me, never achieved, despite a Mitchum monologue as he gradually succumbs to helpless fear; in fact, Hunter's final confrontation with the cat is handled so 'routinely' that you can't understand what all the fuss was about!
