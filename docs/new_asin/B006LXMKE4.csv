8500533,4,B006LXMKE4,"This movie was really unexpected.  I thought the storyline was interesting, but what I saw was really hilarious.  I recommend this to anyone looking for something unusual. Roy Dupuis and Celine Bonnier was terrific.  And the rest of the cast was perfect for this film; and the fact it had English subtitles helped too.",1383177600,,318,4.851851851851852
8500534,5,B006LXMKE4,"An ex-boxer missing a bicep, his cancer striken wife, and his optimistic son who starts a business of lawn mowing and drying the laundry of rich people in poorer neighborhoods to give the laundry ""country aromas.""

A grandfather retires from his specialty of ""corpse disposal"" - literally feeding the fishes- and his son's wife is the surrogate mother for her daughter, the trophy wife of a local developer.

Believe it or not, it all works in this story about life, death, family, and love.  Although some characters have some flaws, they are all nice people... You won't hate any of the major characters, although you wish some would make different decisions.  This a very pleasant film to watch... really a sneaker.

One for the movie club.  In French with English subtitles.",1364256000,,778,4.900763358778626
8500535,4,B006LXMKE4,"Quebec submitted this goofy little black comedy for the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival (English captions), and we were diverted from the very beginning, as we watched a father and son dump a corpse into a river for disposal, then eat lunch as they sit and chat in the boat. Evidently there is a huge sturgeon that lives in the river and it never leaves a trace.

""Coteau Rouge"" (""Red Slope"") is the name of a marginal community targeted for an upgrade by a shady real estate developer who is pressuring the residents into selling their old family homes so he can gentrify the neighborhood. But these folks don't take pressure without exploding!

Because we jump back and forth in time, it got a little confusing, but I think some of the characters are:
  * Paolo Nol (""Sticky Fingers"") is the grandfather who used to make his living disposing of bodies for the Mob. Now he picks up rubber bands because they are bad if they get into the drains and are consumed by the sturgeon that still lives in the river.
  * Gaston Lepage (""Frisson des collines"") is his son, who struggles along running a gas station and garage.
  * Louise Lapar (""Frisson des collines"") as his wife, right now she is serving as surrogate mother for their spoiled daughter so she won't have stretch marks!
  * Cline Bonnier (""French Kiss"") is that daughter. She pretends to have morning sickness and wears a prosthesis baby bump, but her husband is a wealthy developer and she's a trophy wife.
  * Roy Dupuis (""Cyanure"") is that developer. He's cunning and successful, but...
  * Mario Saint-Armand (in his first film) is a grandson launching eco-friendly services in a nearby upscale community. He mows lawns with push mowers and dries sheets for pay on the family clothes lines so they smell good!

The men play ptanque, which is like the Italian bocce, while they discuss changes in the neighborhood and what they are going to do about them.

This is unpredictable, funny and highly entertaining...but tres French. I was glad to see it's available at Amazon.",1343779200,3,2042,4.742209631728045
