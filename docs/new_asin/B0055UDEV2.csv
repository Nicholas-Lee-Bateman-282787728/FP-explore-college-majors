I learned the first exercise on this DVD set and after two weeks of doing it for a few minutes a day, I was much more balanced in my boxing -- I could hit with power at times I would not normally have been able to do so before practicing this exercise.  As anyone who has boxed knows, you cannot hit hard unless you have your feet under you, which is another way of saying that you are balanced.  My Tai Chi teacher also commented that my form had developed grace and power.  This exercise is so simple and basic, that it is still a regular exercise for me.  The improvement I achieved from this one exercise alone was worth the investment in this DVD set.

This experience was enough to convince me to try other exercises, and my training partners and I have had similarly good results as we integrate the exercises into our practice.

This DVD set is filled with exercises that are easy to learn (although some take a lot of work to get good at).  The DVD also has a number of helpful and interesting demonstrations of practical applications of various methods to self-defense.  I am still learning from this set a year later.

The exercises are focused on developing basic attributes that any martial artist can use to get better at their art.  The exercises are in categories by the attributes they develop: balance, body unity, looseness ( flexibility), sensitivity and freedom of action.

Balance and the benefit of it to a martial artist is probably obvious from what I said above.

Body unity means getting your body to move as a unit.  One benefit of body unity is that you can get all of your weight behind your strike, so you hit really hard.

Looseness allows you to ""not be there"" when your opponent strikes.  It can be a lot like a boxer slipping a punch or rolling with a punch.  It also helps you be where you can hit unexpectedly.

Sensitivity is a combination of internal awareness of your own body and ability to sense what your opponent is doing and respond to it effectively.

Freedom of action is harder to define.  I see it as the other four attributes combined in a way that lets you do things which are effective.  You get to a place where your body has natural, intuitive responses to your opponent's actions which protect you while attacking him before you (or he) realize what you have done.

I train with a group of people and we try to do at least one of these exercises (or one of the other ones from the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Proof-2nd-Edition/dp/0736078762/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Proof - 2nd Edition</a>) and we typically find that we are able to perform better as a result.

The exercises on this DVD can be found in the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Proof-2nd-Edition/dp/0736078762/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Proof - 2nd Edition</a>.  The descriptions in the book are thorough (and I find them very helpful for refining details), but the DVD was a much easier way to learn them correctly.  The book is more comprehensive and covers material not on the DVD set, but to learn the exercises, this DVD set is best.

I suppose I should tell you a bit about my background so you can understand where I am coming from as a martial artist.  My first experience with martial arts was when my parents enrolled me in a traditional Jiu Jitsu class as a child.  As a teenager, I studied Kenpo Karate, followed by Wing Chun.  After college, I took up Aikido.  At the police academy, I learned the Koga method.  I have studied Tai Chi and practiced push-hands.  I studied MMA, kickboxing and BJJ and taught defensive tactics for police officers.

The technical quality of martial arts DVDs varies a lot, so you may want to know about that.  The sound is clear throughout and you don't see a microphone.  The lighting is good and the action is always easy to see.  The camera person clearly understood where to point the camera and where to zoom in.  This is broadcast quality video work.

The editing is what really sets this production apart.  There is zero fluff in this DVD set; it is pure content.  The menus are easy to use and you can easily get just the section you want.
