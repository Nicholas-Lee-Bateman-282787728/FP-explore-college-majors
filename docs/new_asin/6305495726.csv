Besides the other reviews, I should say  that the body chemistry depicted in this gay film is not that unusual nor surprising for the gay audience  but maybe offended to non-gay viewers.  But it is good film for the right  audience.  Subtitles are not featured in this DVD;  they would be helpful  to break away from the British accent.

1036830,4,6305495726,"I thought this was a charming film, in an odd sort of way.  Here in the States we get so few British films, especially where they are living and talking and working in their own environment.  For me, a lot of the British films that are released over here, are hard to understand.  A lot of them speak in soft, understated tones, and it's hard to pick up on what they are saying.  So for me, that was the challenge with this film.  I'm not complaining mind you.  I actually enjoyed listening to them talk, listening to their slang, and comparing it to our own American slang and speech.  It actually made me want to go back over to the U.K. for another vacation.",1434240000,,661,4.282258064516129

1036896,4,6305495726,"I really like this movie because of the uncertainty and desires of the main character. He wants to be connected, to be loved, to be important to someone. He falls in with the wrong crowd and gets back into bare-knuckle boxing, which his brother tries to prevent. He's gay but conflicted, and presents a very convincing portrait of what that's like. The actor who plays his on-again-off-again friend/lover has his own problems and the two hit the right notes of conflict and jealousy without being campy or phony. Roger Daltrey of The Who plays a grabby music producer who manipulates young men to do his bidding. He's over the top but a hoot to watch. I had to watch this movie several times before I could get through the heavy Northern (?), working class English accents, but that wasn't a problem. There's just something touching about it that I don't see in many gay-themed films.",1424044800,,884,4.709677419354839

1036898,4,6305495726,"Good acting by Steve Bell and Roger Daltry in this New Labour-era period piece. Script could be far better--a lot of swearing as the working-class ""characters"" struggle to articulate anything beyond the desire for drugs and booze, and that gets boring really fast, but nonetheless it has its moments and isn't ultimately as depressing as the social ghastliness it depicts. It's optimistic and shows a carefree and upbeat London of the 1990's. Bell does a great job here in an understated way, showing real skill, not only in the boxing ring.",1421539200,,541,4.956043956043956

1037028,5,6305495726,"This being a gay film for a gay audience it does help to find the actors attractive and Steve Bell meets this criteria as a tall, good looking athletic northern lad (with accent to match - I love the way he says `Tony' (Tone aye) when speaking with `he's family' affection of his brother (despite having many arguments with him about his fighting which Tony does not approve of)). Although a film made on a tight budget that almost wasn't made due to financing problems the fight scenes are quite realistic - you can actually see whats going on unlike the current trend as in the Bourne films for example where the camera is so close to the action that the fight cannot really be seen. To aid the clarity of the fights some parts were filmed with the actors fighting in slow motion and then this was speeded up for the film.
The film is based on the experience of the Director and is admittedly something of a fairy tale but has many appealing features if one doesn't just watch it to criticise.
Bell, Rose, Behr & Daltrey all do a good job.
The ending is also something of a fairy tale perhaps but I'm not complaining - with Matt refusing to be bought by Kelvin (Daltrey)and leaving his job to find Craig back in Blackpool (after falling out with him) and to ask whether they can give the relationship another chance. Craig's response is touching but not repeatable here!
As noticed by one of the first reviewers - what is touching (indeed tear jerking for me) is the compassion shown towards Craig by his older brother & Matt.
My only complaint is that the film could have been more sexy - I found Quadrophenia a more sexy film (the bath scenes & the passionate kissing scenes in the back streets) and this film isn't really about sexuality.",1381708800,,1743,4.467084639498433

The opening club scene with Dani Behr, is a hit.  Love that dance tune by the group ""Gift."" I have the full version of the song sent to me courtesy of another web fan who liked it also. I saw this film at least a decade ago, but it is still one of my goto films for depth and interest. It is painful to watch at times and the brother of Bell's character is also interesting both for his compassion and his ""concern."" If you liked the film ""Strapped,"" you will like this film also. Both films blurr the lines between what many perceive to be gay and straight, and further exemplifies the truth that sexuality is not static, but rather a continuum of discovery, if we're open to it.",1372550400,,815,4.191082802547771
1037101,4,6305495726,"To be gay and fall in love is not easy, for the rookie just as much as for the veteran.

The veteran is in the music business where to be gay is as banal as having no hair on your face. It meets a younger one who is not sure what he is. The veteran falls for the novelty of someone who is doing it for love and comfort and not for his glands.

The rookie is trying to prove himself by fighting the old way, the way they used to do in the Far West, though we are in Blackpool. No gloves. Feet permitted as much as fists and all other ways to hit and hurt. The audience is there to enjoy the blood and the suffering and the loser going out on a stretcher if possible.

But the rookie is initiated to something he wants but he fears and he discovers he likes it, and he likes the man who is giving him that feeling of being loved, of being needed, of being wanted and expected, and he gives back the same. And the absence of the temporary distance of the other is harder than thirst and hunger. The pain of the desire when the object and the soul of that desire is not here is often maddening.

But around the veteran, who is in his twenties only, there are other girls who depend on his guidance in their singing, other boys who depend on his enterprise and even shiny PR to become what they maybe are not, even if maybe they are what their boss wants them to become. And temptation is too hard, too burning hot and sooner or later the veteran will fall and the rookie will be trapped with a hangover that will come from an excess of alcohol and unwanted but un-resisted submissive abandon.

But jealousy and rivalry brings a break up and the story is then how the two estranged lovers will find a crossroads where their roads can meet. More than touching. Encouraging about the real maturation of men in this world. And it takes courage to just face what you are and believe that most people around you, if they love you a little bit, will accept you the way you are.

A film many should see to enjoy that maturation, or to discover what love can be between two men. Burning dedication and freezing need.

I was vastly disappointed in everyone and everything else.  Except for the ""bare knuckle fighting,"" the story has been made and remade over and over and over.  All of the Actors (except Mr. Bell) gave all they had to give to a story and script that was commonplace and overworked.  The dialog was ""expected"" and there was little happening that inspired any continued interest for watching.

If you haven't guessed by now, I think the time spent watching this film could have been better used, except for finding a new Actor who came across as ""real"" and comfortable in his role.

In my humble opinion, Mr. Bell was the only reason to finish watching this flick till the end.  I'll look forward to seeing him again in other productions that might showcase his natural style and talents.

Steve Bell was a featherweight amateur boxing champion when he was cast in this part and does a great job bashing in the competition's faces for the camera.  As Craig, he plays a guy whose parents have died and is trying to find his way in the world.  He hangs outside of clubs and looks at the men going in and out, unable to muster up the nerve to enter.  He runs into Matt, a music promoter, played by Ian Rose.  Rose appeared in the 2006 film ""Flyboys"" & does a fairly good job here as the sympathetic friend who helps Craig become comfortable with himself.  What most appealed to me about the film is the tolerance of it.  Christopher Hargreaves plays Craig's older brother Tony who observes his risky boxing bouts and tries to understand him, despite repeatedly berating him.  After we go through the on & off romance between Craig & Matt, Christopher unexpectedly shows his younger brother great kindness and acceptance.  The film ends on an upbeat note with Matt choosing love over business and Craig offering forgiveness.  Enjoy!",1178755200,3,1095,4.746031746031746
1037106,4,6305495726,"For years there were practically no movies with decent gay characters-- at least in these United States. Now we can hardly keep up with them, thanks to the advent of DVD's. ""Like It Is"" is one such film, not so much about coming out as coming to terms with your sexuality. Craig (Steve Bell) is a young man from Blackpool who has a rough and tumble time getting his life together. He falls for Matt (Ian Rose) who works for Kelvin (Roger Daltrey), an older, worldly conniving character who gets in the way of these two men and their relationship. Of course there is the obligatory girl friend type, in this case, Matt's roomie Paula.

This film, like many of this genre, has a low budget feel about it although a decent movie-- as this one demonstrates-- can be made without a lot of cash and fanfare. The actors, including Mr. Daltrey, give decent peformances. Craig-- a sometime bare-fisted boxer-- suffers a rather bloody boxing defeat but ultimately makes some progress in getting his act together, a step in the right direction.",1165190400,4,1033,4.675824175824176

Several years later it was on TV one night and I watched it again....and I realised how atrocious it was. A year or so later I wtached it again and this time another reaction to the film developed within me.....it was actually - if unintentionally - funny. We have the seasoned Matt demonstrating what can only be described as the most laughably innacurate London accent since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Then we have Craig....a supposedly bare knuckle boxer who doesn't look as if he could knock his way out of a soggy brown paper bag. Enter Roger Daltrey....anyone remember 'Buddy's Song with Chesney Hawkes? Roger please keep to music; and I can only assume the Dani Behr character was created by the vilest imaginable mysoginist. If you don't set out to take the film seriously you can really enjoy it. Horrendous dialogue and acting that would make an infant school Nativity Play look like a RADA production. If any of them had been alive Sid James, Hattie Jacques and the rest of the 'Carry On' crew would have made the film truly complete. Marvellous!",1134777600,5,1230,4.6728110599078345
1037108,4,6305495726,"A gritty little film about a bare-knuckles fighting champion coming to terms with his sexuality.  This little indie feels and becomes, something far more than a routine gay love story with big, impressive performances from everyone involved.

Roger Daltry is creepy and a delicious hoot as a gay, aging, vain, bitter, music producer trying to retain the illusion of youth and beauty.  It may be his best acting performance yet.

As streetfighter, Craig, Steve Bell is simply terrific, believably combining into a cohesive entity numerous seemingly disparate qualities:  a tough street urchin exterior, a desire for a better life, a realist of his capabilities, charmingly nave, and more than a bit prone towards hotheaded violence.  In his small town of Blackpool, he meets and falls for music producer Matt (Ian Rose) and before long finds himself moving in with Matt and his roommate, the disturbing, ultra co-dependent, Paula, who takes an instant dislike to Craig.

What could meander into either soft-core porn or worse, stagnation of soap opera, is deftly avoided by director Oremland, who believes in these characters and is blessed by having a cast that does the same.

A small-town (Blackpool) fist boxer Craig (Steve Ball) travels to London to pursue his fantasies of the gay life.  He hangs around a gay bar until he meets a handsome young man Matt (Ian Rose) who is very much in the 'in crowd', being a popular record producer.  The two have a pint and end up in an unsuccessful sexual liaison: Craig clearly doesn't understand the ramifications of his desires.

Matt rooms with Paula (Dani Behr) whose career he is promoting.  He is also involved professionally with his boss Kelvin (Roger Daltrey).  Despite the unsuccessful 'first round' with Matt, Craig pursues him and soon they are in a viable relationship.  Craig is in need of a job and Matt manages to convince Kelvin to hire him...on the proviso that Matt commit his attention to a young group of punkers to achieve a successful album at the expense of forgoing Matt's attention to Paula's career.

Things happen and Craig finds himself on the couch one morning with one of the punker stars, discovered by Matt, and the two split.  Craig returns to Blackpool to the only life he understands - that of fist boxing - and the inevitable reunion with Matt is the basis for the rest of the story.

The actors are all fine.  The movie moves along with a nice clip and we are introduced to the seamy side of London's underbelly and the provincialism of Blackpool.  The only real problem is that much of the dialogue is swallowed by the multitudinous variations on English accents.  Subtitles, not supplied, would greatly enhance the flow of the spoken word!  In all, a good film in this genre.  Grady Harp, March 05",1111622400,5,1752,4.606451612903226
1037190,2,6305495726,"The movie Like It Is, directed by Paul Oremland, has to deal with a boxer/fighter Craig (Steve Bell) as a guy who is trying to crawl out from the fighting life he is in. Craig meets Matt (Ian Rose) who is a band manager/record producer who takes a romantic interest in Craig and the two head off to London. It is in London that trouble begins to unravel the relationshi as Matt's boss tries to split the two up. The movie wraps up with Matt trying to get Craig back before their relationship is doomed.

Both Steve Bell and Ian Rose do a decent job of acting in spite of the terrible script that is so disjointed by terrible editting and poor scene transition. There really is nothing new in this film: drugs run rampart, pretty boys litter the set, and sleazy gritty characters are plentiful. In addition, the fight scenes make you wince with how fake it come across. The lack of character development doesn't fully connect the viewer and the drama happening to the characters in the story, thus by the time half the movie is done you really don't care if Craig and Matt get together or not. The only glimmer of promise in this movie was the techno soundtrack which was fairly funky and enjoyable. Finally, when the movie comes to an abrupt end, Like It Is seems more like a recipe on what a movie shouldn't be.",1111190400,3,1312,4.421487603305785

Although one cannot ignore how physically beautiful he is, his acting is what matters here. Playing a blackpool fighter(Steve boxed in real life), he carries his role with a masculine swagger, while also displaying a tenderness so rarely captured on film. Struggling with his own sexuality, gay audiences will embrace this performance and straight audiences will find this film proves it appeals to mainstream viewers as well. Soon, gay themed films will not be seperated from ""straight"" themed films, as love is universal. And this film is ground-breaking as it never depends on stereotype. Roger Daltrey, lead singer of the legendary rock band, THE WHO, shows he has great acting chops, as does Ian Rose. Brilliantly directed by, Paul Orewland, this film is my favorite gay themed film, along with the American film, ""Edge of seventeen.""I will cherish this film over and over.

1037195,5,6305495726,"""Like It Is,"" directed by Paul Oremland, is a love story that takes the viewer into England's gay scene.  The story concerns Craig (Steve Bell), a tough young man from Blackpool who earns a bloody (literally) living in the sleazy world of bare-knuckle fighting.  He becomes involved with the slick, ambitious Matt (Ian Rose), who works in London's music and nightclub industries.  Thus the stage is set not just for a love story, but also for a potent culture clash.
I really enjoyed this film.  Director Oremland is unflinching in his portrayal of the violence, drug use, and sexuality of his characters' lives, but the film also is very sensitive in its exploration of their emotional worlds.  There is an amusing vein of satire running throughout in the film's handling of a ""boy band"" subplot.
Roger Daltrey turns in a great supporting performance as Matt's boss, an older gay man with a leering, mischievous charm.  But the film really is carried by the two leads.  Bell and Rose have a palpable onscreen chemistry and really bring life to these conflicted characters.  In a way, ""Like It Is"" is a very old-fashioned love story that asks basic, universal questions about relationships and the possibility of true love.",1052352000,11,1223,4.902912621359223

1037238,4,6305495726,"A film depicting a gay love story between a bareknuckled fighter and a coke sniffing record producer?  Who would have ever thought it would work?  But it does, thanks in large part to Steve Bell, a natural in front of the camera, who steals the show as Craig Collins, a shy, working class, bare-knuckled fighter from Blackpool who chooses to reveal his, uh, less macho side to Matt, played by Ian Rose, an ambitious record and club executive, who's smitten mightily.  Christopher Hargreaves, who is reminiscent of Bob Hoskins, plays Tony, Craig's older brother, and also gives a good performance.
By turns romantic, very sexy, humorous and painful, Like It Is is a much better take on the theme of a gay athelete coming out than the smaltzy, better known but much overrated Get Real, and is to be appreciated for showing the diversity of gay relationships.  The unlikely ending to this unlikely love story will make you glad.  Plus, it's not about high school kids, for once.
As good as it is in the good parts, I can't call this a great gay film, however, because of the inclusion of The Big Name Star, Roger Daltrey of the Who, included, I suppose, in the hopes his name on the marquee would draw crowds, but who only mugs his way through the most unlikeable role in the film, distracting attention from the real stars and the real story.
Still, I highly recommend Like It Is.",1010620800,14,1378,4.608163265306122
1037239,4,6305495726,"""Like It Is"" is an entertaining movie.  While it is yet another coming out story, the performances and characters help make it more interesting than the average coming out story.
The story starts in Blackpool, England, moves to London, and returns to Blackpool for a dramatic and fulfilling finale.  The main character is Craig (very appealingly played by newcomer Steve Bell), a bare knuckle fighter in Blackpool who takes on whatever jobs he can to make a living.  He is gay, but isn't ready to do anything about it until he meets record company promoter Matt (Ian Rose) outside a gay bar in Blackpool where Londoner Matt was supporting one of the artists label, Paula (Dani Behr), who is also his best friend and roommate.  Craig invites Matt back to his house and asks Matt to *ahem* him.  However, a virgin, Craig freaks out at the pain and throws Matt out.  Matt tries to offer comfort, but Craig isn't ready to accept it.  Matt leaves, leaving behind his card.
Neither of the men can forget the other, and Craig finally decides he has to deal with himself and his sexuality, so he follows Matt to London.  Matt takes Craig in and they begin a relationship.  Craig has trouble fitting into the gay world and Paula feels jealousy towards Craig for taking her best friend's attention away from her.  Added to the mix is Matt's boss Kelvin (the immensely entertaining Roger Daltry) who is very much attracted to rough trade like Craig.
This is a very appealing film with interesting characters and strong performances all around.  It does fall into the general category of the ""coming out"" story, but the settings and the characterization keep it fresh and interesting.  The script by Robert Gray and the direction by Paul Oremland are sharp.  I do wish that the DVD had a director's/writer's commentary track because I would like to know more about the choices they made and why they made them.
All in all, I would recommend this film to people who enjoy ""Get Real"", ""My Beautiful Laundrette"", ""Maurice"", ""Boyfriends"", and the British ""Queer as Folk (series one)"".

Matt is from London and he works in the music industry-he visits Blackpool one night and meets Craig when he-(Craig)-is standing outside by what looks like a gay club.  Craig is not at all comfortable with his sexuality, but he invites Matt to his house for a one-night stand, which is disastrous.  Craig's life in Blackpool is not very good; the only way he makes money is through his fighting, which his brother Tony does not like at all. (Craig also refuses to tell his brother that he is gay, which is really frustrating for Tony because he wants to help his brother but has no idea what is making him so unhappy.)  For reasons that are not quite clear, Craig goes to London to pursue a relationship with Matt.  Matt has this flatmate, Paula, who is a singer. Matt was responsible for getting her album put together and on the market.  To say the least, Paula is not happy when Matt lets Craig move in with them the day he shows up on their doorstep.
Craig has a very hard time fitting in while he is in London.  Matt's friends, flatmate, and boss-Kelvin, are not happy about Craig being in his life.  Craig's biggest problem is that he really does not have any direction in his life.  He has problems getting and keeping jobs-he gets hired at a gay bar and then loses his temper and gets into a fight when someone calls him queer (he is obviously still not comfortable with his sexuality).  Matt's boss, Kelvin, and his flatmate Paula, basically do everything they can to try to destroy the relationship between Matt and Craig.  This is because Kelvin sees Craig as a liability to Matt-since Craig is having so many problems fitting in and finding himself, and Paula is jealous of the time that Matt spends with Craig-she wants Matt to help her get her next album out and keep her career going on the right track.  I won't say how the movie ends, but both characters have to make decisions about themselves and what is important to them, and this makes the movie end in a satisfying way.",989193600,11,2039,4.495934959349594

Will Craig find happiness  in Britain's gay Mecca or be forced back to his sordid former world?

Steve Bell turned in a terrific performance as the bare-knuckle street fighter who tries to turn is life around for the better once he meets an openly gay music producer (handsome  Ian Rose).  It amazes me when straight actors give such top-notch  performances as gay characters (Get Real, Beautiful Thing, ect) and Bell's  performance is right up there.  I was expecting a two-second cameo by Roger  Daltrey, however, he plays a strong role in the film as the aging, rich  bitchy queen of yore - he was excellent and had few zingers in his scenes.  Theme wise, this film is optimistic and engaging.  There's a subplot  involving the creation of a '90's boy band that is just too precious - they  can't dance, who knows if they can really sing and their music is very  Euro-disco and teeny-bopper oriented.  The lead singer of this group comes  between Bell and Rose at one point in the story - could you imagine the  British tabloid press getting a hold of that factoid? Director Paul  Oremland gives us a film as earnest and romantic as he intends to give (the  character of fighter Bell was inspired by his own experience as he explains  in the DVD's featurette) and I look forward to his next projects. As for  the DVD:  the picture is letterboxed to 1.66:1.  The video is much crisper  and clearer than I was expecting - it looks very good.  The sound is clean  and audible.  Music sequences give quite a punch and there is no background  hiss to be heard.  Colors are stable and natural, but I really liked the  scenes in the nightclubs which were fairly vibrant without  ""bleeding"" or ""smearing"".  There is also an original  trailer that is incorporated into the informative featurette.
