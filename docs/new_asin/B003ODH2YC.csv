8528584,1,B003ODH2YC,"This is absolutely the worst art instruction video I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad art instruction videos. The ""artist"" responsible for this makes wire ""sculptures"" that  a first-grader would be embarrassed to bring home. Dreadful. Sloppy. Insulting. Less than amateurish.

She makes ""sculptures"" that she calls ""animals"" or ""creatures"" because she obviously can't bend  wire into a recognizable dog, horse, cat or dragon. And the ""heart"" mobile? So horrible it's hysterical.

I alternated between laughing so hard that I almost fell off the sofa and being so angry that I was throwing my shoes at the TV.

It would all be a bad joke if I hadn't paid $30 for it.",1284336000,2,673,4.817391304347826
