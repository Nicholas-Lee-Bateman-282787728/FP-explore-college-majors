I will return the product and request that an appropriately formatted disk be sent to replace it.  I will carefully read descriptions of media before ordering in future",1381017600,,282,4.529411764705882
8237766,5,B0010EI5CU,"If you are an agliophile and like detective dramas this is for you.  Throw in humor and iteresting social situations and you have good viewing.

I started watching ""New Tricks"" on my local PBS Staion.  I never wanted to wait for the next episode (not to mention no shows on weeks with ""Beg-a-Thons.""

I did purchase this in the PAL format because I have a DVD player that handles world-wide standards.  If you live outside the North America most players are multi-standard, in North America there are only a few that are.",1268265600,4,521,4.619565217391305
8237767,5,B0010EI5CU,"MY Family just loves this series. I think I will die if they don't allow us to see the sixth season.. Why is it if you can't see it on tv you also cannot buy it??? Grow up people and allow us to see good stuff.
This is an intelligent, humorous show written for grown ups who like  good mystery, with good chemistry between the characters and lots of humor.  The characters are not the usual formulaic stuff that you get on american tv. And darn little violence and you can actually hear the dialog. That doesn't mean it is all simple and cutesy. Watch and enjoy.",1252540800,2,562,4.242990654205608
8237768,5,B0010EI5CU,"This is such an great program --- cleverly written and very human.
I do hope we can look forward to BBC providing us with the Region 1 DVD's we need to enjoy the rest of the shows available in Europe, but not here.",1251936000,,214,4.0
8237769,5,B0010EI5CU,"I was pleased when PBS started airing this british detective series.  Retired police detectives are hired by the police department to solve COLD CASES.

But the real fun is in watching this motley crew work. Like Columbo, they are real geniuses full of quirks, old & seasoned but with more energy than most half their age.

If you like quirky detective drama with a few laughs thrown in, then htis is the series for you.  The only problem is, this PAL region 2 DVD will not play on your standard U.S. DVD player!

BBC AMERICA HOME VIDEO: PLEASE RELEASE A U.S. NTSC REGION 1 DVD for the rest of us to enjoy!",1200960000,21,606,4.375
