37043,5,0781740681,"One day I will bake cookies and send them to Dr Acland for making such an incredible, useful series of DVDs. I dedicate my success in medical school gross anatomy to his DVDs.

The dissections are of the highest quality, and the fresh tissue dissection allows for incredibly realistic texture, appearance and movement. The format is incredibly clear and the ""table of contents"" navigation makes finding exactly what I want to see a cinch. Dr Acland's presentation of the material is incredibly precise and clear, and shows the structures in a 3D manner absent in even the best books.

I watch these as a supplement for class material and as a dissection review both before and after dissection labs. My grade has significantly improved as a result of regularly watching these DVDs.

I bought the DVD set instead of the web subscription because I want to be able to watch them in year 2 and beyond, because clinical work always has to keep the pertinent anatomy in mind.",1320364800,7,969,4.755952380952381
37044,4,0781740681,"The videos were well explained and the picture was good.  The sound could be a little low at times, but otherwise these are a great set of DVDs to study Anatomy.  I am very happy with my purchase.",1313107200,2,196,4.131578947368421
37045,5,0781740681,"All the other reviews are obviously from people who need to know this for medical school or other reasons. I thought I would contribute a review for those looking for practical information.

I teach voice and piano, and I have many students who have injured themselves because of incorrect playing or singing. I was looking for a resource to help them understand the mechanics of playing and singing, and a friend lent me these DVDs for a few days, and I just had to buy the entire set right away. These DVDs are a wonderful resource not just for studying the human body, but also for understanding how the body functions. If you use your body in any way, understanding the most efficient and least-damaging way to use it is essential to avoid repetitive stress injury and other injuries.

The videos are beautiful quality, and everything is clearly explained, including the attachment and insertions, and the function of the muscles and how they work together to perform various actions. This is like nothing else out there. My students who have seen the DVDs are astounded by how much progress they make since they understand how to use their hands or throat muscles, and how much less pain they have. If you are an athlete, musician, or anyone who uses their body to earn a living, you must get this to understand how your body works, so you can keep your body in peak condition.

In short, buy it now.",1292889600,6,1405,4.634538152610442
37046,5,0781740681,"How frustrating is it to go to the anatomy lab and given a sheet of paper to show you what you are supposed to find?  That is all a thing of the past because you can use these AWESOME Acland DVDs to direct you and show you the way to get a jump start on figuring out what is important and what is not.  The way medical schools do it used to drive me crazy because they let you go on a wild goose chase but the answer to this are these Acland DVDs, not only do thy show you the anatomy, piece by piece, they show you the anatomy on sections that you will not-they are sections from fresh cadavers for the very purpose of identifying the anatomical parts and find them in your anatomy lab.  I mean these dissected sections are perfect and they are fresh so when he moves a muscle to show you how they function you can see in real-time how they work.  He points out the insertions points and shows you the nerves that innervate the muscle to give you a functional feel of how everything works.  So the way I would use these DVDs is to watch the DVDs on these perfect sections with explanations given by Dr Acland, then go to your lab to identify it on your cadavers since that is what you'll most likely be tested on.  I'd identify them on Netters and Rohens just to solidify your knowledge base.  This is the way I did it and it totally worked for me.  You've got to have someone, in this case DR. Acland, point out the structures and then practice pointing out landmarks  so you can find it on any cadaver.  Half the time you spend hundreds of dollars on books for school and after the fact you realize you never opened the book and it was a complete waste of money, well this is something that is worth its weight in gold because if you use it, let's say where ever you are or while you are studying and use it to teach you what to look for and learn what it does, this product is absolutely one of the best if not the best money you will spend in your 2 years of didactic course studies. The best $160 plus you will spend for anatomy.  I found these DVDs from a friend who spend 2 years as an anatomy teachers assistant and he did not lead me wrong.  I went out and bought these things right away and have never looked back since.

In my case, these Acland DVDs saved me from spending long hours in the lab looking around aimlessly and inefficiently for structures but these DVDs pointed out what I should be looking for. All in all these, these DVDs helped me to learn anatomy efficiently without wasting precious lab time, especially when there are a limited number of cadavers and an overabundance of students fighting for cadavers.  The sections that you see can't be replicated in the lab and the way they are presented are uniform and make sense to all the anatomy that is taught.  The sections are beautiful in how they are presented and how the DVDs help the viewer to make sense of the anatomy and how it corresponds to its functionality; these DVDs are second to none.  The sections that they present are nothing like anything you've ever seen and the way they show how the bones, the muscle, and nerves work together in unison to make the anatomy come to life is simply amazing.  You could spend hours in the lab and try to dissect your own cadaver (albeit probably make a ton of mistakes dissecting the wrong parts and cutting away important parts) to show the parts of the anatomy or you could just watch these DVDs which do it all for you.  The sections shown are in real-time and the way Dr. Acland explains the anatomy makes sense.  Following these DVDs with Netter's and Rohen is how I aced my anatomy class and I don't think I could have done it without these resources.  Certainly, you have to read your course book and read what they deem important to do well on the exam, but in terms of identifying the anatomy is where these DVDs really save you a bunch of time.
It is difficult to explain in words-you've just got to see the DVDs and see for yourself.  Sure if you want to be a surgeon and try to cut away the skin, fat and fascia to see the way it should be done to learn, that's one thing but these DVDs show you the main parts of the anatomy that you would probably miss because teasing away the outer layers is much more difficult than one would think.  It is really easy to make an incorrect slice and cut out the stuff you should have learned from dissecting your own cadaver.  I for one am not interested in being a surgeon and trying to tease away the fatty layers to get to the anatomical parts that are so important for my education.  From experience, I found you spend so much time in trying to dissect the anatomy that often times you miss the anatomical parts that you are trying to find and that is where these DVDs come into play-they show you what you are supposed to have dissected and what you were supposed to have seen.  I've never seen sections this well prepared and to see an expert working under perfect conditions is what this DVD tries to accomplishes and they do an incredible job at accomplishing that.  Sure it misses some of the little stuff you're supposed to learn during your dissection but referring to Netter's and Rohen will give you all of the information you'll need to learn the anatomy for medical school.

After my first few anatomical systems, I found these DVDs and began using just these DVDs, Netter's and Rohen to pick out the anatomy I was supposed to find out on my own for each system and that is when I began to really learn more efficiently and began to ace my anatomy class.  That is after all the purpose of medical school to teach you to learn efficiently, weed out the important stuff from the unimportant stuff.  These DVDs show you the important stuff and emphasize what you should be concentrating on.  Memorize the list of anatomical parts and learn the function of how the anatomy achieves the function and you'll be at the top of your class without a doubt!!!  Time is of the essence and these DVDs are great for the beginning anatomy student and they are also great for those who want to a quick review for the boards or for an refresher anatomy class.  I couldn't give higher marks for these DVDs and if I could I would 10 stars!!!  There's nothing else like them and they are beautifully done for each system.",1282348800,22,6298,4.31918505942275
37047,5,0781740681,"I am using this series to prepare in advance for gross anatomy.  It is wonderful!  From Dr. Acland's soothing voice to the beautiful dissections, I can't recommend this DVD series highly enough.  You'll learn without even knowing you're doing so.",1281484800,4,246,5.1
37048,5,0781740681,I have taken many anatomy courses and Acland's anatomy is a great review for me.  I would have found this very helpful during my study of anatomy in school also.  The only thing is when I received my shipment one of the dvd cases was damaged but the dvd was not scratched.,1269388800,2,272,4.211538461538462
37049,5,0781740681,"I have been very weak in anatomy and I had to pass board exams, I tried atlases, etc, but nothing really is interesting than listening and watching the human anatomy lectures by dr. acland. He did superb job on the anatomy....
Well done!!!",1264118400,16,239,4.5813953488372094
37050,5,0781740681,"This set of DVDs is transformed from Acland's preeminent Video Atlas of Anatomy series. It is an extremely navigable learning tool with even higher quality audio and visual resolution. The DVDs are based on true dissected specimens. They are particularly useful for those who need to learn anatomy but have few or no chance to do dissection. I also know some people who want to learn anatomy but they refuse to dissect bodies. For these people, Acland'd DVDs are ideal tools. [...]

I contacted Dr. Acland via his website, and suggested him to make a script of the DVDs. He is very kind and quickly prepare a sample for me. I find that the script can help me not only with understanding his explanation in the DVDs, but also with remembering the details. I even printed his script and took them with me in the subway. I read it, and at the same time try to recall the images in the DVDs. I find it is a very good way to remember so many anatomical terms and structures.",1172793600,49,969,4.443820224719101
37051,5,0781740681,"This is the best human anatomy source I have seen.

37056,5,0781740681,"These anatomy videos reduce my time in the lab considerably.  I am less confused and need less time with a paper atlas when I go into lab to study. I HIGHLY recommend this video series--the ability to speed up to ""med student mode"" (1.5x + speeds) makes it a valuable study tool.  Queue up a video and watch it like you'd watch a show, pausing to take notes on occasion.  It's a lot less smelly than anatomy lab!",1383696000,,412,4.256410256410256

37064,5,0781740681,"This six set dvd gives a very detailed explanation of all medical anatomy terms.  The views of the human body are interesting and I found that it was alot to learn.  I do not think one could expect to watch each only once and gain maximum knowledge.  To became familiar with all parts of anatomy will require many hours watching and familiarizing yourself with the terms.

Don't waste your time on any other resource. Watch these videos and you will love anatomy once again if you are a graduate doc like me !! Just unbelievably superb in all aspects. There is nothing like these videos out there, I bet !!!

7789883,5,0781740681,"I was a single Mom with two kids when I was in medical school, working an additional 20hrs per week to pay for kids before & after school care, so not much time.  After watching each video only 3 times (appropriate for the organ system we were studying), I was the first student in over 20 years to get a 100% on the first anatomy exam on upper and lower extremities.  I held ""video nights"" in my apartment complex after that hoping that other students could benefit--and they really did!

What's great, is these are ""live"" dissections--so no preserved with formaldehyde--everything is so beautiful and fresh.  They edited things backwards, so everything starts from bone and its anatomy, then the muscles are layered on etc inside to outside.  He has a wonderful British accent too which somehow made things he said easier to remember.

I am sad that these videos/DVD's are no longer available for purchase.  That is probably okay for most people as they can still ""rent"" the information online so it's still all ACCESSIBLE for certain periods of time; however, I always like to keep my favorite things--but at least still VERY useful for medical school, dental school, nursing, chiropractic, etc....
