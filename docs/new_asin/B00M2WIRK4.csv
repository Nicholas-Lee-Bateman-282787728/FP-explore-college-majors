I then cannot even eject the disk because when I try to recover it, the DVD disappears from my desktop; so, I must shut down my computer and boot it back up!!  This takes 5 minutes and by that time, I have lost the momentum! I am not happy.  Do not buy!!",1408838400,2,429,3.953488372093023
8669916,1,B00M2WIRK4,"I am very disappointed with this DVD.  While it arrived promptly, it is a waste of my money.  I got through the warmup, squats and then the DVD began skipping for the entire rest of the workout.  Actually, I didn't even get half way through it.  The DVD stopped cooperating completely.  My DVD player is fine.  It's the ""home workout"" that didn't work out at all!  I want my money back!",1408579200,,386,4.352112676056338
