639489,1,6303416403,"TMNT was very good, TMNT II was very funny, they both had excellent costumes and both the younger and older TMNT fans could enjoy them. But THIS, what is THIS?!? The costumes look like something you'd buy in a  halloween store (esp. Splinter). And SPlinter's new voice, ridiculous. But  even worse there is NO PLOT!!! Thats right none at all. The Turtles go back  in time to bring April back to the present when she accidently send herself  back via some old flea market egg-timer.
Even Ninja Turtles: Next  Mutation is better!
Watch TMNT I or even II, but stay away from  this!
Now if youll excuse me i have to go read my Eastman & Laird  Mirage TMNT books before its too late!!!",938736000,,680,4.435483870967742

639841,3,6303416403,"The subtitle, ""Turtles In Time"" is incorrect.  ""Turtles in Time"" was the name of the 2nd Arcade game (which became the 4th console game), COMPLETELY SEPARATE from this film, which has nothing to do with it.  When TMNT III came out there was no subtitle.  Someone clearly got really confused and messed up here.

BTW, the movie is just okay.  Definitely the worst of the three, but still entertaining enough.",1455926400,,407,4.757142857142857

639890,4,6303416403,I watched this at the movies when it first came out. I was crazy about Teenage Mutant ninja Turtles. But other than that it was more of the same. I liked it better than the new movie but that was just my opinion.,1439078400,,212,3.953488372093023
639891,5,6303416403,Your favorite turtles are at it again but this time they are going back in time to ancient Japan. With an action packed plot and amazing effects this movie will definitely hold your attention(and your little ones attention too!) There are lots of laughs along the way and even some moments that really get your brain kicked into gear. Watching the turtles experience another world and four ancient Japanese warriors experience New York City is simply fantastic. This is a great movie and perfect for the whole family to watch.,1438819200,,526,4.855555555555555
639892,4,6303416403,"Here's the think about ""Turtles 3""...it's a good film but it's not as good as the two before it. Some of the jokes don't stand the test of time like the other films' dialog but all in all you need to see this one if you've seen the others. It has it's good parts but again it's not as good as the other two films so don't expect it to be. The puppets/robots used in this film aren't as smooth as the ones previously used. Not sure if they used the same studio or animatronics people but the turtles and Splinter seem to ""bounce"" their heads as they talk or they just don't seem natural.",1438128000,,586,4.104347826086957

639980,1,6303416403,"Boy, if the Secret of The Ooze was a disappointment, then this thing is a crime against humanity. This movie makes the second movie look like the first movie. If Secret of the Ooze was a pile, then this is a steaming pile. There are just so many things wrong with this film it is astounding. And I am not just saying that now looking back. I distinctly remember watching this when I was a kid and hating the movie. Even as a kid I could tell it was awful.

The first thing that you can tell is wrong with the movie are the body suits. They look cheap and poorly made. The colors are disgusting and the mouth movements are so limited that they look like Chuck E. Cheese robots flapping open and shut. Jim Henson's creature shop did not work on this movie and the low production shows.

Secondly, the plot of the movie is ridiculous. April finds an old Japanese scepter and they are magically whisked away to feudal Japan. What? Why does that happen? Who made the scepter? What was it's purpose. Before the movie even gets going you are left wondering why these things are happening. So the turtles are now in ancient Japan, doing everything wrong that you can do in a time travel movie. They talk to the locals, get involved in fights, and actually kill an English merchant stationed in Japan. It is a total surprised that when they come back everyone isn't a monkey or something. Time travel movies are hard enough to get right, but this just doesn't even try.

The jokes are absolutely low brow and juvenile. If you thought the second movie had some groan worthy dialog, then this movie will give you a brain hemorrhage. There are hardly any worth while fights and I think the turtles use their weapons even less in this film, if that was even possible.

The only two redeeming things about this movie are that they brought back Kacey Jones (awesome!) and they brought back Corey Feldman to do Donatello's voice again. These two bits almost make the movie enjoyable, but then you just get hit with another stupid joke by Michaelangelo and you get put into a coma again.

Seriously, do no watch this movie. Maybe on an ironic, bad movie night it would work, or if you could turn it into a drinking game. Pass on this tragedy of a movie.",1429660800,7,2236,4.430656934306569

640456,1,6303416403,"This is seriously the ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"" of the TMNT franchise.

I recently got a bit...well, I'll just say too curious and started watching on YouTube. I knew this was bad already because I watched a trailer for it once and noticed the costumes weren't made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop for this one. The animatronics in the original costumes were way better and allowed for a far better range of facial expressions, but in this one I don't know what the heck they did.

Either they sped up the film to make the voice-overs match the mouths, or the mouths were just flapping back and forth erratically (usually not matching the words. They were more careful about that in the first 2 movies). In some scenes, it's really hard to tell, though neither would surprise me because this movie is that bad.

Whoever did the puppetry for Splinter was terrible. The first time he opens his mouth, the delay between the voice and movements is painfully obvious. Also, the voice was not the original man who played him.

Lastly of course is the script. There are no real villains that present a challenge, no Shredder of course but come on, there were so many other awesome villains from the comics and cartoons they could have used. April just so happened to pick up an old Japanese scepter at a flea market and the turtles are sent back in time to feudal Japan, exchanging places with four guys whom Splinter and Casey Jones are left to babysit for the duration of the entire film.

The characterization was so completely off that it made me want to cry. Raphael isn't angry or upset as usual, Splinter isn't as mellow or sagely, Casey Jones doesn't even do anything...

It's just such a departure from what TMNT originally was. The first film was spot-on PERFECT. It had all the darkness of the comics, a few funny moments, serious moments, and it knew exactly when each needed to be expressed. The music was great as well, and the camraderie and life lessons were all there. The second wasn't as good, but was still tolerable and fun.

Do yourself a favor and don't touch this one. I regret spending even 2 seconds on it.",1327017600,7,2124,4.559055118110236
640457,4,6303416403,"When their reporter friend April O'Neill (Paige Turco) is whisked off to parts unknown by a peculiar Japanese artifact she found at a flea market--and a 17th-Century Japanese warrior, Kenshin (Henry Hayashi), appears in her place--Michealangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Rafael naturally gear up to find her and get her back.  The artifact turns out to be a magic scepter which replaces people from the past with others of equivalent mass (hence Kenshin's advent) and carries the Turtles back to Japan in the year 1603, where they discover that an ambitious daimyo, Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono), who happens to be Kenshin's father, is attempting to crush a rebellion led by Mitsu (Vivian Wu), who happens to be Kenshin's beloved.  A British gunrunner (Stuart Wilson) eager to sell Norinaga his cargo of rifles and cannon makes things more complicated, since of course it's to his interest to make sure the war isn't settled.  And the Turtles have only 60 hours to accomplish their mission and return to their own time or they'll be ""toast.""  It's fun to see the quartet in action in the land that invented their discipline, trying to adjust to a time long before their own (two of them even entertain thoughts of staying), and as always the quips fly thick and fast and the combat scenes are a fast-paced delight.  Elias Koteas returns as Casey Jones, though no explanation is offered for his absence in the last movie, and there's more than a hint that the Turtles will have a second adventure in the past too.",1308009600,2,1510,4.837209302325581
640458,4,6303416403,"First, don't be mislead by all the bad mouthing.  This is not the worst movie of all time.  I thought this was a solid Ninja Turtle movie; I loved it when I was younger and still today I find it entertaining.  Like it or not, this is the way the great live action trilogy came to an end.  After this we had to wait years for TMNT, and that wait was not worth it.  I don't know why it is so hard for some to appreciate this movie (I am still appauled by the amount of people who disliked Secret of the Ooze!!!)

Is the writing weaker than the previous movies?  Yes.  Is this a strong finish for the trilogy?  No.  However, I think all of the Turtle quality is there.  One complaint I see is that the Turtle's mouths don't line up with the words well.  In my opinion, no more so than in Turtles 1 and 2.  I never even noticed the slip ups until they were pointed out and I started looking for them.

Someone said the story was far-fetched; the idea of time travel was too sci fi.  REALLY?! A series based around 4 turtles mutated into humanoid form living in a sewer eating pizza, trained as ninjas by a mutated rat that come out and fight crime at night whose main enemy is a ninja who calls himself Shredder?!  Yeah thats A LOT more realistic than time travel.  The main antagonist was killed of in the last movie, I give them credit for thinking up this plot.  Turtles 3 had a good storyline although not executed to its full potential.

Main characters such as Splinter and Casey did not have much face time.  I would have loved to see Casey accompany the turtles, but he did not.  This is cleary a weak point in the movie, but nothing I couldn't live with.  As I said before, Shredder is dead and I like this (in a way as he was one of my favorite characters), it opens chances for the Turtles to fight new evils, not just the same old fight Shredder/beat him/he returns thing. Maybe an emergence of Crange could have been in order?  Some people say ""Shredder couldn't be in 3! He died!"", maybe Crange could have used some Deminsion X technology to revive him?  Hmmm, might be a nice idea for the rumored new live action Turtles if they intend to continue the series rather than reboot it.

As for being goofy, yes it was.  Secret of the Ooze was too.  And this is why I think so:  Us, the old school comic fans, got Turtles 1.  Then, they saw the influence it had on the younger crowd.  It was a potential marketing giant, therefore the next 2 films were aimed more at this age group.  Think of the possibilities! Toys, cartoons, costumes, clothes, video games....So I understand why 2 and 3 were a little immature.

But when it all comes down to it, its still the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!  Its done in their fashion.  The idea of the Turtles using a magic septor to travel back in time, save April and defeat an evil warlord was out of left field, but it worked.  You get a change in scenery, not the same old grungy city.  There are some good fight scenes, you get to see the Turtles working on their inner selves to become better warriors.  The costumes are the same quality as the previous movies.  I really don't see a reason to absolutely hate this movie.  It is the weakest of the lot but look what it had to compete against! 1 and 2?  Out-doing those would be no small feat.  Come on, TMNT was pretty well received and it was more out there than this movie.  And most importantly, this was the last live action Turtles (I don't think it will be for long though :) so appreciate.",1298937600,4,3495,4.241274658573596

This time the turtles end up going back to 15th Century Feudal Japan and many wonder if this is actually a nice way to take the turtles.  Although I have to say that I'm a little iffy on that idea, while one way it's good to see that they take the turtles in a different direction but at the same time I wonder as to why they would do like time travel for a turtles movie.  While I can say that the costumes for the turtles were good for the first two movies though in this one they don't seem to be that good but yet it's better than I expected for this movie.  While we go into the movie we see a side of Raph that most never though we'd see, as he befriends a young boy named Yoshi while the turtles are in a time of war in Japan.

640460,2,6303416403,"This is actually the very first time I've seen ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III"", which is amazing since I was a Ninja Turtles nut as a kid. I simply never had the opportunity to see it...and thank goodness I never did until now. It's incredibly underwhelming and overbearingly silly. What's obvious to most people who saw the film, the time travel premise doesn't seem very suited for a Ninja Turtles movie. The fans watch it for the turtles, the foot soldiers, villains like Shredder, and horrible puns. All this movie had are the horrible puns, and this movie has more one-liners than it does fights.

No one wanted to see the turtles go back to the Edo period and fight forgettable daimyos and pirates, but that's what this plot is. The turtles just happened to mess around when April arrived and just happened to acquire a plot device that just happened to magically switch their places with the historic figures from 400 years ago. April just happened to find Casey's ancestor, the Turtles just happened to get involved with the rebel faction, and the bad guy just happened to be in the middle of a deal to trade guns for gold for the evil king. The forces of nature sure works in convenient ways.  Here's a question: how come their clothes are switched when time traveling but objects like the Walkman stay with them?  Is that just so the samurai can see the Walkman and smash it into pieces ina so-called humorous gag?

The few fights it had, they were pretty unexciting, and too much time is spend on the cast causing a ruckus, not worrying about the consequences of time-traveling. Casey and Splinter are there for, well, being there, and the Japanese soldiers being sent to the present don't take much advantage of their surroundings (except for hockey). The more I watched it, the more I felt detached with what's going on.  Although this movie wasn't good, I can't say the rest of the theatrical TMNT movies were stellar.

I will give the filmmakers props for trying something diffrent with the characters, that is why I enjoyed this installment mainly for this reason  , besides seeing the turtles in full samurai gear is kinda strange and funny, the pace in this film is good, the action is fun as always and the comedy is ok also,  so the story may lack the edge the first 2 had and the acting may seem wooden at times but it don't matter!

640584,5,6303416403,"I am 23 years old and have been a fan of the Ninja Turtles since I watched the first episode on Saturday mornings when I was 8 or so. I recently purchased the first two movies because I knew I loved them, but for the life of me I could not remember much about the third one. I rented it today because I had read all of these reviews saying that the third movie was terrible and I did not wish to buy it if I was going to hate it.

My first impression as the movie began was that whoever designed the faces for the turtles, as well as splinter's puppet needed some help. As mentioned several times on this site, the costumes could have used quite a bit of work. It looked a little too Jim Henson (though I love the man).

However, after only a few moments I realized that I was laughing and enjoying myself just like I did when I was a kid watching the old show. Within the first 30 minutes I realized that I liked this movie almost more than the first one. Not only did this movie have cool visuals and great japanese costumes, but this one actually had a well developed plot. I liked the new villian and thought the actor who played him did a rather good job. His personality was different from Shredder's and gave something new to the Turtle trilogy. He was even funny at times. This movie expaneded on the turtle's personalities and allowed you to get to know them better. I don't know why people complained about the characters not acting like themselves because they acted like they should as far as I am concerned.

Concerning the plot involving time travel; I enjoyed it. Its fantasy after all. The turtles are mutants, and in the first movie the turtles make some sort of phsychic connection with Splinter. The cartoon itself was filled with Sci-Fi elements if anyone cares to look. I don't think that time travel was too far fetched by any means. It also presents something new and exciting for the Turtles. This film expaned the world of the turtles beyond the sewers and New York city.

I think that one should take this movie for what it is and not concern yourself with what it is not. If you want dark and gritty, then watch Batman or the X-Men. You cannot take yourself too seriously when you are watching a movie about walking, talking, fighting mutant turtles. I loved the Turtles because not only were they heroes, but they were funny. To me, this movie had that sense of joy that the old cartoons had, and I believe this movie was well written and well done, despite the obvious flaws in the puppets and the ending being a little weak.",1148342400,3,2554,4.359243697478991
640585,4,6303416403,"I was only 8 years old when this movie came out. I'm twenty years old now and I still remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle craze. It was a PART of me growing up. Remember the craze? You should! There will never be another craze like it! No, not even Pokemon compared to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. All of us kids came together back then. If you didn't have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles backpack or lunchbox you just weren't in. Sorry, pal. I'm telling you right now, I was the coolest kid in school! I had all the action figures (even the vehicles!), the lunchbox, the backpack, the shoes, the pajamas, the games, the movies, boardgames, sunglasses, halloween costumes, etc. Oh, I could go on forever. I had it all. I knew every turtles biography by heart! Hell, I knew every CHARACTER by heart. And my favorite comedian? Michael-frikkin-angelo!

So, when the 3rd movie came out, make no doubt about it! I was the first in line to see the movie! I remember, I was NOT disappointed. I LOVED the idea of them going back in time. But I was only a kid. I'm an adult now and it's STILL my favorite movie of the 3. Why? Because it IS a serious plot! It was like todays Spiderman, Hulk, Punisher, Batman, Resident Evil. It allowed you connect with the Turtles on a more EMOTIONAL level. Come on. Who DIDN'T cry during the Raphael scene when he's alone in the bathroom staring at the wall? I felt for him, man.

Okay, okay, okay. So, it wasn't up to par with the movie standards of 1993. But they did give it a hell of a run. Actually training the turtles REAL martial arts made the action a little more realistic. A nice change-over if you ask me. You also have to remember that all 3 movies were INDEPENDANT FILMS! Less money to work with.

I didn't give it 5 stars for one reason... It just seems unfair to Vanilla Ice, man.",1125705600,2,1831,4.363636363636363

The movies story could have been worse, i mean for a live-action movie based on fantasy mixed with reality, it works well. 1993 i don't think was the year of these types of movies, even though this movie is way more enjoyable the The Power Rangers Series which debuted the same year. The action scenes do lose some flare, mainly due to the fact that a lot of it is real, i was amazed by the first 2 because it's so much harder to make fake punches look real, but this one had real martial arts trainers, because a lot of the guards that you see in this movie are trained professionals, and can take hits. I think that may have been a problem for fake characters and a PG rated movie. I did like a lot of the camera shots, like Raphael throwing his Sih at the arrow and breaking it in half. If you pop that into slow motion, you can see them switch shots at the last minute, great editing there. Comedy isn't fresh but it works, the wet willy was funny. Overall, a good, clean show of movie making fun, in this fair box-office movie. 42 million dollars, which i believe was the #1 movie of its genre that year, which is good in a few ways.",1110153600,,1301,4.187250996015936
640587,2,6303416403,"This is a bad movie not only because it doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content.  It's like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101.  Each turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their weaknesses.  Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children, and I believe that Donny falls in love.  It's been awhile since I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with it are enormous.  First, the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product.  In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments. They just feel heavy handed.  That's not to say Mikey's plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all.

Secondly, the action is just not there as it was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it's previous effects of catharsis.  It felt like I was watching the History Channel special about the history of the Turtles war in Japan and they lost.  Also, the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms of death.

Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, ""This is good for my calfs,"" I was thinking, ""What, is my mom supposed to laugh at that?""  As for the Japanese men who take to American living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk, painfully unfunny and pointless.

Equally as pointless was the use of Casey Jones.  His character in the first movie almost steals the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majority of the film.  In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless.  So he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series.  I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed.  The meaning is always better in small doses.

FINALLY, the song used in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny, action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least found out the name of that song.",1108166400,6,4917,4.460423634336678
640655,1,6303416403,"If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and are not a young child, you will despise this movie. I remember renting this movie when it came out and disliking it quite a bit, but I could never remember why. My brother and I were watching the first movie in the trilogy, and he asked how much TMNT 3 would cost. It was only a couple bucks, so I figured what the heck and got it. As soon as I put it in, I remembered why I hated it, all those years ago. This move had a lot to live up to, as the first two TMNT movies are some of the best films ever. Unfortunately it fails in everyway possible.

The biggest problem with this movie is the characters. Nearly all of them act much differently then they should. This is especially noticeable in Raphael and Donatello. Raphael acts, for lack of a better term, ""goody-goody"" in this movie, and he befriends a young boy, Yoshi. It's not to say that that is inherently a bad thing, but it's not at all how he normally acts, and the scenes with Yoshi feel completely unnatural. It's like they were just added to teach any kids watching a lesson. He also throws his sais at enemies, and in the other films he was very protective of them. Very inconsistent. Donatello is considerably dumbed down for most of the movie and becomes smart only at oppourtune moments. April is much more ditzy than she has been in the other films. Casey is only concerned with fighting and not with the motives behind the fight. He's supposed to be a vigilante, fighting for justice. Splinter is way more strict than he has been and generally less solemn than expected. The European and Japanese characters feel very awkward as well. The only characters that are well done are Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and the traitor to the Europeans. On a side note, the Turtles and Splinter look much less realistic than they did in the first two movies, and it makes you wonder why they changed the look at all.

The plot is also fairly unbelievable. April comes to the Turtles' lair with an artifact from 17th Century Japan, which she acquired from a flea market. The item sends her to Japan and a Japanese warrior returns. April gets captured and the Turtles decide to rescue her. When they make the trip to Japan, 4 more Japanese warriors take their place. Casey has to babysit the Japanese men, and the turtles have to find a way to return to the present. They also have to deal with some Europeans who are hurting the Japanese people. That's really all there is to the movie, and it's completely predictable. The only twists are when one of the Europeans(played by the same actor as Casey) helps the turtles and then betrays them, but you could even see that coming.

The dialogue is ridiculously bad and often very childish. Practically everything said is unbelievable and only included to get a laugh from the kids, which is part of why the characters act so different from how they normally do. Sure, the turtle's made jokes in the first two films, but those jokes were actually fairly intelligent, and served as relief. Here the action relieves the jokes.

I also find it annoying that the Japanese people speak in perfect English. This takes place in the 17th century. Everyday Japanese people aren't going to know English. Very few speak it well even in modern times. I have nothing against them, but it seems ridiculous that their English wasn't at least a little broken. Even the little boy, Yoshi, spoke English perfectly. On the other hand, the Japanese warriors with Casey didn't seem to have a good grasp on English at all. It's another huge inconsistency.

The Casey segments are painful. The warriors that were sent to the present act like kids, and Casey tries to teach them about modern culture, particularly hockey. I guess this was supposed to be funny, but I can't see anyone over the age of 10 enjoying this section.

A final pet peeve is that the cast is almost entirely different from the first two. Apirl is different again, and the turtles and Splinter sound much different than they did in the first two. Casey is the only returning actor. This wouldn't be a big deal, but the change is for the worse. I guess the original actors saw that this wasn't going to be good, and didn't want to get involved.

To the movie's credit, the scenery in the movie looks great. I doubt it was filmed in Japan, but it looks close enough. The soundtrack and fighting are also fairly decent. None of these things can rescue the movie, though.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 10. The entire point of this movie was to make a family oriented movie with lots of jokes for kids and that's not what TMNT's about, and the makers obviously could have cared less about pleasing older fans of the series. It really feels like they were just in it for a quick buck. It's a shame, because if they had just put more work into the story and gotten better talents, this could have been a decent movie. I'd only recommend this to people with small children.",1096502400,6,4986,4.519955654101995
640656,4,6303416403,"The first Turtles movie was great in the fact that it took on the tone of the comics rather than the TV show (more grim, more adult). The second, after much backlash from parents, went in the total opposite direction and turned it into camp. This installment is a nice ballance of the two.
Granted, the costumes are not up to par with the first two, and the plot is not the most original (nor feasible), but they take a back seat to the jokes. The first two TMNT movies focused more on plot and action with an occassional joke to keep things light. Writer/director Stuart Gillard's time travel story, while not the strongest, opens the door to many jokes and gags, which is what makes this movie stand out among the others. It's a nice change of pace, in my opinion.
Kudos to Elias Koteas in this film (he deserves to be the first in the credits). His 15th century counterpart isn't the best, but he makes up for it when Casey Jones is forced to ""babysit"" four ancient Japanese warriors in modern-day New York (favorite bit is still the hockey scene).
For those who were more interested in plot, this is not the best place to start in the series, but if you enjoy a good line of jokes and gags, I'd definitely recommend this one!",1086566400,7,1229,4.394736842105263

He moves his hands with the window to slide it down, but they don't actually *touch* the window. Since -when- did he learn telekinetesis? O_o Anyhoo. The script totally reeks. Come on, time travel? That's a bit farfetched, even by a standard TMNT comic plot, and something was just a bit offsetting about seeing Raphael flying kites and cooling his temper down like that. The only reason I gave this two stars was: THEY BROUGHT CASEY JONES BACK! He was one of the best characters, and even though he isn't in it much (bah, forget that character that's supposed to somehow *coincidentally* look like Casey in the movie.), Elias Koteas does a great job.

Released in 1993, the plot centers around April and an ancient scepter which she discovered at an antique store. Unbeknowest to her it(scepter) has power to transport her back to 14th century Japan. April brings the antique to the turtles underground layer. Suddenly it begins to glow and with many special effects she is transported to Japan...1300's!! The Turtles go back as well to 14th century Japan to save their closest human companion. Along the way the Turtles befriend a little boy and have fun with the locals. There is even a person who looks just like Casey Jones ancient relative.
  Although Many a critics and would be critics deadpanned this movie as being lame and tame, this it is not!! There is action galore and many special effects along with a charming and family friendly plot! However, it never ventures to anything that would bore an adult or child, it is very entertaining!
  When this movie came out the popularity of the turtles was not what it once was but their icon did not and still hasn't died!

It just goes to show you that no one, the power rangers included, have never come close to the popularity and brightness of th Ninja Turtles! There never has been and never will be any cartoon, comic or movies based on a kid's show franchise than the four loveable turtles. So, if you're a true fan ,you always appreciate everything the thing or person you follow  and look over any differences that maybe visible from begining to end of their reign as the most popular super heroes of the late 80's and eraly 90's!  I recommend this movie as well as the other two that came before it.",1077408000,,1819,4.633540372670807
640660,2,6303416403,God shoot those poor things!!! The director absolutely SCREWED THE TURTLES UP!!! They look so much like frogs!!!!!! The animatronics make me cry!!!! The voices kill me literally!!!! Splinter I want to SHOOT because he's so horrible in this movie! The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star is because of Yoshi (he's so adorable!) and Casey Jones and the four Japanese dudes. April was somebody I wanted to just slaughter with a mace. Has anyone noticed that she changes personality in all three?? Nope. Don't like NT 3. But the ninja/karate moves are pretty cool. Either than that....put this thing out of its misory.,1076716800,4,618,4.785046728971962
640661,4,6303416403,I had to laugh at the string of reviews for the vhs version of TMNJ III--clearly some adolescents out there are in a little over their heads when it comes to appreciating the splendid depiction of feudal japan and Elizabethan England that the producers wove into this story.  If I had a bright 10-year old at home who was into martial arts I would want them to see this and hope it might ease them into a mature appreciation of the culture that gave birth to their sport.  This last episode is good clean fare for family viewing and will even teach the young dudes some history--cowabunga!,1065484800,4,589,4.4953271028037385

So the turtles have to go and get her and return within'a 48 hour period. Not all that interesting,event tamer than part 2. The best thing about this is Casey Jones,and the 4 Japanese guys, who switch places with the turtles,watching hockey and playing video games at the bar.",1051056000,3,415,4.621621621621622
640772,2,6303416403,"The turtles are at it again for the third time, but this movie isn't nearly as good as the first two, one of the reasons why is that Splinter's voice was awful, it seems to be that he was shaking and his voice was a little upbeat, also there are no foot soldiers or the Shredder, just a bunch of Japanese villians, and the idea of going back in time wasn't that great either, fortunatly we do get to see Casey Jones back even though he had only a minor role and Corey Feldman returns as the voice of Donatello (he didn't do the second one due to rehab for heroin addiction).
Paige Turco returns as April O' Neal.
The only reason why I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 cause it has Casey Jones in it but other than that, it's just not a great movie, only recommended for only the diehard turtle fans.",1046736000,4,803,4.1210191082802545
640773,2,6303416403,"Oh dear, if you're diabetic then I would seriously advise against watching this film. It' so sugary it'll rot the brain right out of your head.
Why on earth Eastman and Laird allowed this to be made is beyond me. It's soooooooo far removed from their black and white comic book. Okay, I know the cartoon series was too but the first movie did have a hard edge to it. I mean, take a look at the cover-the Turtles are smiling and happy. Then look a cover of one of the original comic books. They're almost always gritting their teeth and frowning. THAT'S how it should be. Not like this.
Even the animatronics look fake. The first 2 had a rather believeable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera. His voice is also totally different and he seems a touch more upbeat and lively. HARDLY the way Splinter is supposed to be.
The plot itself defies logic and there are massive holes all over the place. With such a dramatic change in locale from New York to Fuedal Japan you'd think the movie would take advantage of that and go nuts with imagination.
But sadly not. It just...goes nowhere. I mean, what is the deal with the character of Whit. Why does he look like the great, great, great grandfather of Casey Jones.
In fact, the return of Casey is the only reason I am not giving this a 1-star rating. It's a pretty wretched movie but Elias Koteas can make it a tiny bit less unbearable.
Hopefully the new cartoon show and the possibilty of another (harder) movie will cancel this one out. It's nothing but dated, mindless fodder for under-fives. At the risk of repeating myself; this is NOT how the Turtles shoud be.
Extras are almost non-existant but the animated menus are cool. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is in pretty good shape but the Dolby 5.1 track isn't up to much I'm afraid. The film was orginally recorded in Dolby SR so this is obviously a remastering job. It's just adequate is all I'm saying.",1036195200,7,1991,4.502762430939226
640774,5,6303416403,"Some seem to not like Ninja Turtles III for some odd reason, but its great and not so typical such as having Shredder in it (as always), travelling in Time, cool setting, intresting storyline with different twists, part 1 is my favorite, then 3 then 2
Ninja Turtles are back in action!",1032825600,5,285,4.5
640775,4,6303416403,"OK, so this movie doesn't feature uber-villain Shredder, but this is one great entry into the TMNT series.  Though not as good as TMNT: The Movie it is ten times better than TMNT II.  The story starts with the Turtles down in their new subway lair (discovered in II) just hanging out now that Shredder is dead and buried.  April stops by with an ancient Japanese device she picked up for Splinter at a garage sale.  The device turns ""on"" and transports April to feudal Japan, a young Japanese prince taking her place.  The Turtles spring into action and travel back in time to save their friend.  Of course complications ensue and the Turtles find themselves in the middle of a revolution of sorts between the prince's father and the prince's rebel girlfriend.  The great part of the film is that the Turtles must decide if they want to stay in the past, where they are accepted and revered, or return to the present and remain outcasts.
And perhaps the best part of the film: No Vanilla Ice!!!",1031616000,3,994,4.550561797752809

640777,1,6303416403,"Well...I was always a fan of TMNT growing up.  So of course I had to see all 3 movies.  While myself and some of my friends argue whether this one(#3) or #2 is the 2nd best TMNT film made, its still in my opinion the worst of the 3.  By far in my opinion #1 is definatly the best.  No question asked.  This deviated from the whole storyline and really had no place.  I saw this as more of a kids movie than anything else...whereas I could get into the first two more.  I'm rating this pretty low as I think they could have done something a lot better with the third film.",1030924800,4,571,4.0

640779,4,6303416403,"Arguably not the best of the series, TMNT III does have its charms.  Even though it did not contain my favorite turtle villian, the Shredder, it still was an entertaining plot that offered the same things as the first two films.  A welcome feature of this film is the reprisal of Elias Koteas' role of Casey Jones, who, despite his job of basically baby-sitting Splinter, still has his trademark attitude.",1030060800,2,405,4.771428571428571
640780,4,6303416403,"Personally I myself am a film buff, and this movie cinimatically has its faults, but at its heart it goes back to the roots of the TV show which i watched as a child, The first 2 movies were  dark, They had better writing and puppetry but were so grim. this disconnected it from the younger generation of turtle lovers.
it is not the best in the series but it is my favorite, it has more fantasy and charm than the first 2",1028160000,4,422,4.0843373493975905
640910,3,6303416403,"This movie might not have added up to TMNT 1&2, but it is good in it's own way. True, Casey Jones had a very minor role, it didn't take place in New York, the idea of going back in time seemed a bit weird, Kevin Clash did not return to do Splinter, the acting seemed a bit childish at times, and it was not as dark as the first two movies. However, being a long time fan of Ninja Turtles, I can somewhat overlook those flaws. The humor was a little cheezy but in a funny sort of way. One definate plus to TMNT 3 is that the turtles used their weapons more than they did in the TMNT 2. Also, ""Turtles in Time"" takes a break from the original plot and makes for a new adventure. A year ago, my review of this movie was somewhat negative due to being 5 years since I watched it last. Seven people gave feedback toward my previous review and found it helpful. I appreciate those feedbacks but I recently watched TMNT 3 again and have come to like the movie for what it is. Though ""Turtles in Time"" should not have been an end to the series, the movie is still entertaining to watch in my opinion. As for the DVD version, the features aren't very impressive. If you still own the VHS version, don't bother replacing it with the DVD unless your VHS copy has worn out over the years. Apparently a 4th TMNT movie is coming out in early 2004. I don't know whether it will be animated or live action but that should give Ninja Turtle fans something to look foward to next year. Hopefully, the 4th movie will be geared more towards teens as well as adults unlike the previous sequels which were mainly for die-hard Ninja Turtle fans only.",1024272000,,1627,4.217948717948718

The voice of Spliter should have been the same voice from the 1st and 2nd movie.  The Turtle's costumes should have been the same as the 2nd movie.  The enemies were too unbelievable.  And the ending of the movie was just a little too weak for me.  It's a good movie for a fan, but I only suggest buying it if you are a diehard Ninja Turtles fan.",986083200,10,456,4.067415730337078

The second one was a little less darker  and made the Turtles less scary (probabley because compared to Tokka,  Rozarr, and Super Shredder, they looked like teddy bears).  This one gives  us the friendly turtles we fell in love with in the cartoon show.
