8258044,5,B0015D20CM,"In THE INTIMATE, director Kim Tae-Eun poses a number of themes that most lovers prefer to avoid unless forced by wayward circumstance to consider. The title suggests the first one. Is the intimate the one who is already in an intimate relation (as engaged) but clearly lacks an emotional resonance with the other? Or is the intimate the one who has no connection but desperately seeks it when the clock is winding down on the ability to do so? In the first case the intimate is a woman named anonymously ""Girl"" (Seong Hyeon-Ah) who has been in a seven year relation with a man with whom she lacks all resonance. In the brief time we see him he comes off as a crass outsider who has no idea what makes Girl click. He has long pressured her to commit to marriage and she gives in, perhaps out of exhaustion from saying no. His inner sterility stands in marked contrast to her powerful sexuality. She is a walking orgasm. At the start of the film, Girl meets a handsome virile stranger in an elevator and sparks fly. Within a very few scenes, they become physically intimate. It is at this point that the director's foray into the ambiguity of the title manifests itself.

The stranger calls himself Boy, thus intensifying the sub-theme that there is a self-imposed wall of non-intimacy that Girl constructs but Boy is unable to ascend. They do more than have sex, of course. Boy tells Girl that their relation must run its course in a single day of 24 hours. They intuit that they must fill those hours with the full range of human emotions that must ordinarily be spread out over years. They fight, they insult, they eat, they grope each other's body with the same ardor that they grope their psyches. The difference in the groping is that in his case, Boy needs to experience a lifetime of feeling before his self-imposed clock expires. In her case, Girl wants no more than to fill in the blank slate of her empty soul with emotion to carry her through the day until her marriage. Boy seeks love, so as not to lose it. Girl seeks it only as the ultimate act of selfishness. Girl's fianc meets Boy and is surprisingly accepting of him. In fact, the fianc accurately has sized up the limitations of Girl by telling Boy that the only reason that she wants him is that Boy functions as a disposable dildo.

There is no single grand climax to the movie yet there are various mini climaxes, one of which occurs midway when Girl soliloquizes to Boy: ""How would you react on your wedding day if then you were to meet your chosen destiny?"" The answer is an ironic foreshadowing of the film's closing scene when this happens. A second mini-climax occurs toward the end when director Kim Tae-Eun pays homage to the Clint Eastwood Meryl Streep film of a similar tangled love triangle, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. In this latter film, Streep attempts to leave a vehicle to join her lover Eastwood before her husband-driver whisks her away. Streep gets her arm tangled in the vehicle door just long enough for her to lose her chance. Here, Girl tries similarly to exit, but in her case it is not her entangled arm that is the barrier but her conflicted mind that allows her to torment herself with the tantalizing notion that she could leave one life for another had she the iron will to do so. At the end of THE INTIMATE. nothing of external consequence has occurred. Boy still keeps his destiny with the clock and Girl keeps hers with a mindless devotion to maintain a stasis of sterility. But a great deal has happened if not to Girl and Boy but to the viewers who have seen with blinding insight that the destiny that we keep for ourselves is never externally constructed. Few films suggest this as visually as THE INTIMATE.",1406851200,,3717,4.538002980625931

This premise has been ""warped"" to South Korea, albeit ""The Bridges of Madison County"" with a powerful and stronger gimmick. ""The Intimate"" (aka. ""The Lover) is a sexually charged drama with sexier, younger performers and a modern touch. Director Kim Tae-Eun's erotically charged romantic melodrama explores that song's question. This film is a typical love story that explores the complications of a boy who meets a girl who already has a fianc&eacute; and the platitudes of love's true meaning. (after all the horror and thematic dark films I've seen lately, I have to do one review for a friend)

Seong Hyeon-ah (Time) plays an unnamed woman who has never taken a risk in her life. She has been dating the same man for 7 years and is planning to get married the next month. One day, she meets a handsome stranger (Cho Dong Hyuk), who persuades her to spend the day with him. Over the next 24 hours, she will experience a new level of excitement and intimacy, as well as confusion that she has never experienced before....

Lust at first sight or love at first sight? The film's premise explores thematic set-ups such as; ""passion and logic"", ""love and financial stability"" or ""unbridled romance vs. duty"". I'm very surprised that my female friends didn't take to this erotic/romantic drama and my male friends are the ones who really dug it. (maybe its because of the beautifully-shot sexual scenes) I believe that the reason may be because the film is compelling even with its not so original premise. The film really makes the audience curious, I know I was wondering what would happen next. The two leads remain unnamed, they are referred to as ""Mr. Boy"" and ""Ms. Girl"". It was quite interesting that the film seems to portray that true, unbridled love occurs in the first few days or months or years in a relationship, that love may become tainted through the years. Getting to know your partners annoying habits, bad attitude, what he does for a living and so forth makes love conditional. For Ms. Girl, true love is the man's first image, untainted love should be pure and that feelings may wane after hardships, annoyances, parental pressures.

I think the reason why I did enjoy ""The Intimate"" is because of its structure. Sure, the sex scenes are quite numerous and beautifully shot, Seong Hyeon-Ah is seen in her birthday suit quite often. The sex scenes may even rival those seen in other Korean erotica such as ""Green Chair"" and ""Summertime"" for raw explicitness. There is (in uncut version)a scene that features a ""money shot"" that will make viewers ask: ""Did they or didn't they?"". Erotic sequences aside, ""The Intimate"" has more going for it than sleazy sex. The film maintains an air of mystery on our two leads and while this may be its strongest strength, some viewers may start to form a certain alienation in the 2nd half. While ""Mr. Boy's"" motives are crystal clear from the first meeting, he is shown romantically unattached with a business engagement overseas, ""Ms. Girl"" seems to be a blank slate, her character background seems a bit clouded. I guess the character ""blankness"" is meant for audiences to project themselves in that situation, or in her character. I don't want to spoil the details but some folks may wonder why the film ended the way it did. The film does somewhat lack in the stereotypical complications as to why she did what she did. I see this as a positive thing.

Seong Hyeon-Ah is awesome in her role as the unnamed woman. I loved her performance in ""Time"" and she doesn't disappoint in this film. She turns in a performance that seems sedate, almost distracted and distant even when she is making love. I supposed this is meant to convey her confused state, that her character is plain on ""riding the currents of life"" and most of the time has most of the stuff she's done has been planned out from early adulthood, by her or someone else. Whereas, Cho-Dong-Hyuk's character is full of charisma that every woman will want to call him their own. The fianc&eacute; is considerably less attractive but a rich jerk whose idea of marriage is to fulfill a void missing in one's life. I guess this was a less than a stellar move from the film-makers, since if he was a likeable character then the complications would be more tragic and may need further development.

""The Intimate"" is not a bad film per se, it is actually a good one. The director knew what he wanted to do and never backed down from its execution. The film wanted to explore one person's definition of love and her disappointments, and on this it does succeed. Somewhat bleak in its message which is why it probably turned off my female friends. Regardless, ""The Intimate"" is engaging cinema. If you look beyond all the nudity and VIGOROUS sex and try to read between the lines, you will find a film very worthy of your time.

South Korea definitely knows how to do melodrama...

Recommended. [3  stars]",1250812800,62,5008,4.715428571428571

The dialog and plot are simple, but there are provocative scenes the story is sweet and there are a few funny parts. I enjoyed this movie... similar to a Korean ""Lie with Me"" with a little less depth/moodiness and a twist with a love triangle.",1212710400,21,305,4.368421052631579
