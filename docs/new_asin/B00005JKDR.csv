1435974,4,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is a great movie, and it seems Pixar can do no wrong. They continue their dominance of making good movies and high grossing movies. Unlike their parent company Disney who has faltered lately.
Monsters is a great story and concept. Monsters who live in another world that have to scare children to power their city. What a great concept. Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) is the top scarer and the guy who never ceases to train. Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) who is assistant and can't seem to keep up with the office work, but has a great knack for making jokes and training Sulley. Sulley though creates a problem as he sneaks into a door one day, and accidentally brings a child out. That child name is Boo. And Boo is the heartstring to this movie. She is scared of Randall who has an evil plot to get screams out of Boo. Sulley discovers that plot and reveals it. Monsters is a great movie that explores great themes as well: friendship, laughter, and fear is easy to overcome. The animation is grand scale, and the laughs are always there. The emotional aspect is a great turn for Pixar and shows that these guys have heart as well as the old funny bone. Get this when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.",1016668800,6,1228,4.4622222222222225

BUT I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.  I HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS, JUST FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SULLEY ALONE, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MIKE AND RANDALL.I'M SURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A ROZ IN EVERY BOY AND GIRL'S EARLY LIFE AT SCHOOL, THERE CERTAINLY WAS WHEN I WAS A KID AND I STILL LOVE HER TO BITS FOR BEING THE MOST CANTANCEROUS, STUBBORN AND SMASHING TEACHER IN THE UNIVERSE.I SUPPOSE I'M A PETER PAN AT HEART AND FORTHIS REASON ALONE - THIS MOVIE OF ""WE SCARE BECAUSE WE CARE"" IS GOINGTO BE A MONSTER HIT.......PARDON THE PUN!!1111",1016582400,2,791,4.455172413793103
1435976,5,B00005JKDR,"Yes, the special effects are great.  Pixar takes basically the same technology as ""Toy Story II"", probably added some improvements, and brings us another visual delight.  This one should be a big success on video, as kids are going to love it in their libraries.
But of course, it wouldn't mean beans if there were not a good story.  This one creates a brand new world for us.  I wasn't aware of this but it seems that the monsters that hide in our closets have a back exit that leads into their own world.  In this world, scaring kids is just another day at work, and they punch a clock in the same manner that we do.  They are not bad monsters for scaring us, it's just what they do.
So everything is going fine until an actual kid get's into the monsters' world and gums everything up.  Turns out the monsters, at least our leading monsters, are really good guys who just scare kids as a job.  When they encounter the child, who THEIR world considers the monsters, a lot of prejudice has to be overcome.  But once they accept they child, protective instincts take over, and they try to put everything back in it's place.  This, of course, entails all kinds of difficulties, which entertain us enough to make this one a keeper.",1016582400,4,1229,4.4222222222222225
1435977,4,B00005JKDR,"Two fabulous CG films were released in the year 2001. The first is the hugely popular (and brilliant) 'Shrek' which took the world by storm. The other was 'Monster's Inc. which many judged the film by its ad and immediately thought it would be another sappy Disney flick... how wrong they were!
It can be seen that the Disney evolution of creating more 'Adult based' cartoon's started with 'The Emperor's new groove' in 2000, and is continued with 'Monster's Inc.' which has the ability to entertain the masses. Children love it for the colorful character's whilst a sophisticated adult viewer can also enjoy he film on another level.
The film follows the misadventures of Sulley and Mike, two best of friends who work for the Monstropolis energy concern; namely Monster's Inc. The company gets the city's energy from the screams of young children. But when a young child (Boo) stumbles into the monster's world, chaos ensues as Mike and Sulley find it their job to save Boo from the evil Randall as well as point out that children aren't in fact deadly to monsters.
The strict use of a linear narrative makes the film a tad predictable in parts... but who cares? It is essentially a children's film but as mentioned above it is also appropriate for an adult audience... why? Because of the brilliance in casting. Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sulley and Steve Bushemi as Randall, each bring something special to the film. Crystal and Goodman give off the perfect 'buddy film' milieu. It is very amusing to look at the film as an adventure of Goodman and Crystal rather than two characters that sound like them.
Disney has gained a reputation for slinging out some amazing DVD's that are so packed with features it's almost like having three discs worth of stuff. This in course refers to 'The Emperor's new groove', the two disc 'Snow white and the seven dwarfs' and the recent 'Atlantis'. One thing can be sure... that the 'Monster Inc.' will be jammed pack, and I can't wait for it.
Pixar has again created a brilliant children's film that has a sort of edge that the others perhaps lacked. The moments in 'Shrek' that may be seen as 'Not suitable for children' (no matter how hilarious they are) aren't in 'Monster's Inc.' but a film is created that is utterly entertaining.
So what is better 'Shrek' or 'Monster's Inc.' it cannot be determined. They are by no means the same film, while 'Shrek' subverts the linear fairy tale style, 'Monster's Inc.' makes a fabulous film through alluding to the genre. So in summation both films are fabulous... and each well worth seeing.",1016323200,,2587,4.751111111111111
1435978,5,B00005JKDR,"Like their previous release, this is a good moive for all ages. There is so much improvement over the computer animation. The facial expression and all the tiny little fur on Scully can be see so clearly. They just flow with the air so naturally. The color is so rich. It is very pleasant to the eye. And of course... the lovely and adorable 'Boo'. At the age of 40, I never knew dat I will like any other doll until 'Boo' came along. What a laugh! Can't wait to get the Dvd of this wonderful moivie. Looking forward to all Pixar animated moives. No doubt about...",1016150400,,564,4.280373831775701
1435979,4,B00005JKDR,"Mike and Sulley are a team of scarers who work for Monster,Incorperated,an agency that powers all of the land the live in with the srceams harvested by the monsters. It goes like this:a machine drops a door inthe proper place with a srceam meter attatched,Monster walks through closet door,makes chlid scream,walks out,and the srceam is used to power the city of Monsteropolis...But what happens when a CHILD gets through the door?Sheer panic thats what! You see,Monsters think human chlidren are toxic,You touch one and You die...Well when the little girl-named Boo-Follows Sulley everywhere both are,well,upset! They decide to try and take Boo home,but is it possable??????????????????????
I thought this was a wonderfull movie,another Disney Classic...i reccomend this movie to anyone,its not just a kids movie!",1016150400,,814,5.52
1435980,4,B00005JKDR,"Leave it to animation studio Pixar to tackle a project like ""Monsters, Inc."" Pixar has always taken us to places we've never been but have always suspected existed. In ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"", they showed us the secret world of toys that kids have always believed in. In ""A Bug's Life"", they showed us... the life of a bug. And now, with ""Monsters, Inc."", they show us the world of the monsters we always thought were hiding in our closets to scare us.
John Goodman is James P. Sullivan (""Sully"", as his friends call him), the top scarer at Monsters, Inc. His best friend is Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal. Their job at Monsters, Inc. is to scare the living daylights out of children. Oh, you didn't know? Scream energy is what powers Monstropolis, the city they live in. At the time the film takes place, Monstropolis is having a power shortage. ""Rolling Blackouts"" are to be expected. So of course, the faithful monsters at Monsters, Inc. must scare as much children as possible. But wait... in this film, the monsters are scared of us, too. Whoda thunkit? So if a child just happened to get through the closet doors that separate the monster and human worlds, just how do you think those poor little monsters would be able to handle that?
There's more to the plot, but I won't take up any more of your time with silly plot details. I had a blast at ""Monsters, Inc."" for a good deal of time, and even though it has it's lulls, it certainly is a solid piece of work. This is going to draw a lot of comparison to DreamWork's previous ""Shrek"", so let's get that out of the way here. First off, the animation. While they're both computer animated, the animation in ""Monsters"" differs from that in ""Shrek"" in a few ways. The animation from Pixar is well-rounded, and uses a lot of cooler colors and more colorful tones. Even though ""Shrek"" was DreamWork's first completely computerized animated feature, it's been apparent in all of their animated flicks that they've gone for the more hardened, realistic look with a more yellowish palette (take a look at ""The Prince of Egypt""). Me, I like the Pixar way myself. Take your pick.
But in other ways, ""Monsters"" fails to live up to ""Shrek"" or its Disney predecessors. Mainly because unlike ""Shrek"" or the ""Toy Story"" movies, this won't appeal to all ages. This is one of the few animated movies I can point to that would play better to the adults in the audience than the children. If the kid who was crying in my row is any indication, there's a lot of stuff in ""Monsters"" that could really scare the little ones, especially when things start happening to Boo (the little girl who found her way into the monster world).
But let's not talk about the bad stuff. ""Monsters, Inc."", with all of its flaws, is a fantastic film. It starts off in an incredibly fresh way (the opening credits reminded me of an old Disney short, ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"".) The whole beginning segment pulsates with energy and originality. With Pixar films it always seems the filmmakers had a great time making them, and it shows here. Yes, it does slow down in the middle as the focus becomes more story related, but there were a few jokes that I think went over most people's heads (including one sly pun involving lemon flavor snow cones-- if I were with Mike and Sully, I'd give them a helpful piece of advice- don't eat yellow snow!)
However slow the middle may be (and trust me, it's not that slow), the movie picks up with an exhilarating climax involving millions of closet doors. Without a doubt this sequence was put together with the thought of a Disney World ride in mind. This scene is a testament to the abilities of computer animation. It's quite a sight to behold, and it never becomes stale or uninteresting.
""Monsters, Inc."" is a tremendous accomplishment from Pixar. It's got plenty for most of the family (although the really young ones might want to skip it). Newcomer writer/director Peter Docter can't quite top ""Shrek"" as computer animated flick of the year (and ""Shrek"" can't beat ""Waking Life"" as best overall animated film of 2001). Hopefully though, if we're lucky, he's just getting warmed up.",1015459200,4,4163,4.619433198380567
1435981,5,B00005JKDR,"What a terrific, unexpected, imaginative story!! Did not expect the fun ride I had watching this film. My seven year old loved it as much as my husband and I did. Monsters scare children to capture their screams to use as electricity to run their city?!  OK?  But then one child, Boo, gets let loose in the monster world and it's a catastrophe that monsters Mike and Sully have to fix, but how?  This movie will truly tugs at your heart strings and hit a cord with everyone. And I believe Boo is the true spirit of the film, she portrays the kid in all of us.  The DVD is loaded.....the 2nd DVD has more than three hours of extras on it that are well worth it.  The extra ""Mike's New Car"" will have you laughing and laughing and watching it again and again.  And if you saw this in the theaters the short ""For the Birds"" is included to laugh at all over again.  This is a keeper all the way!!  Every generation can watch this imaginative film and enjoy it.....get your popcorn and your kids or your grandparents or your pets, and get ready to laugh and cry and enjoy the ride!",1015459200,,1076,4.240196078431373

1436252,4,B00005JKDR,"Its good to watch a funny movie in these days. A film called MONSTERS, INC.  is a Disney, Pixar movie. After Lovable was  done with his work and go home, he saw a door that hadnt sent back to the childrens world. When he opened the door, he found out that it was a little girl, so he named her Boo. Mike is Lovable friend, and they both are trying to get Boo back to her home. MONSTERS, INC. is a funny movie because Boo is the one that make funny parts to appear.  Many laughs will come at this part and Boo isn't afraid of monsters, so I thought she is brave.

  Even though MONSTERS, INC. is  comedy, I also think that it is scary at some point.  This movie really teaches us to overcome with our fears of scary things. In fact, this is part of our everyday life. Without overcoming our fears, we won't have a happy life.",1519948800,,824,4.074534161490683

The problem, however, was in the shipping. My order arrived on time, but came only in one of those slightly padded envelopes. I opened it up only to see that my item arrived damaged! Luckily it was only the plastic packaging and not the disk itself, but still not cool of the seller.

1436760,5,B00005JKDR,"Tables turn as a charming young girl bursts through her own closet door and sends shivers through the monsters on the other side. Everything about this is wonderful, from the essentially Pixar concept to the warm, sentimental relationships at its core. Even the animation has held up quite well, which isn't always the case with these early CG efforts: humans still look a bit wonky, but most of the cast seems drawn straight from the pages of a Caldecott winner and that kind of bright, absurd character works beautifully. John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two. One of my favorites of the entire Pixar catalog, it swings hard and connects on every level. Sweet, sad, silly and stupendous, a timeless classic that I was glad to share with my kids.",1489449600,,1157,4.938461538461539

1437932,5,B00005JKDR,"This is a super cute movie  I think most people with kids have seen monsters Inc. I think that this movie actually came out when I was in grammar school I downloaded it on a 2011 kindle fire The movie does take up quite a bit of data but even my older Kendall has had no issues opening and playing the video. When you open it up on a Kindle it does go to a screen asking if you want to replay The movie from the start, or start the movie from the beginning. It also has a bunch of information about the movie and the actors who played the voices if you scroll down. My son is two years old and is upset asked with the movie monsters University I personally think that the original monsters Inc. is much scarier then the second monsters University movie. So if this is a New movie that you're introducing to a smaller child that you may want to try out monsters University first and if they can make it through that without being scared then move to the original monsters Inc.",1472342400,2,975,4.158730158730159

1437994,5,B00005JKDR,This movie is amazing. It came out when I was in college and LOVED IT! My 3 year old loves this movie and keeps asking to see it. John Goodman and Billy Crystal have great chemistry and portray Sully and Mike perfectly.  It's great for adults as well and towards the end of the movie you will see reference of Jessie (from Toy Story 2 and 3) and Nemo doll in Boo's room. I would recommend this movie it's a great Disney movie one of our favorites.,1470787200,,447,4.137931034482759

1438384,1,B00005JKDR,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,2,1188,4.8088235294117645

1438437,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. brings back fond memories of watching the movie in Business Technology Concepts because of the technological aspects involved. On top of that, its a really cute story about a Monster with a heart who grows to question his role as a scary monster when Boo sneaks onto the scare floor. In its own way, it teaches a very useful message about daring to confront the things that scare us or we don't understand. Further, there are elements of the seedy nature of the corporate America and what one might do to stay on top of the heap. Thats where these movies excel, in that they entertain the kids, but give the adults in the audience something to think about.",1465689600,3,670,4.545454545454546

1439085,5,B00005JKDR,"Who doesn't love a good Monster Story? If you have children, you can seriously relate to ""Monsters in the Closet"". Both my children had that fear, and My niece (who is two (2) years old) has started in on her fear of it. I actually bought this movie so I could show Lexi (my niece) that there is NOTHING to be afraid of. Sounds silly right??? Well it worked! Lexi had a bad fear of Monsters, even the mention of one would throw her off. After a few times of watching this movie, we have since learned there are NO Monsters at Aunt Francine's house. There are NO Monsters hiding in the closets or under the bed. Like on the movie, we've explained that these awesome fury little things want to make us laugh, and have a good time. Because ""Our"" laughs are what keeps their city going. I know y'all probably think I've lost my mind by now, however I am telling you the truth. I had a plan when I purchased this movie and it worked. I would recommend this movie for children of all ages. It's not scary, seriously a very good wholesome family movie.",1460246400,3,1045,4.282828282828283

1439344,3,B00005JKDR,"Cute, fairly tame Pixar flick about monsters scaring children to harness the energy from their fear or something ridiculous like that. Don't read into it too much and just enjoy the animation and silly characters and it's not bad. Mike looks like a cyclops granny smith apply and Sulley looks like a steroids-amped Cookie Monster. The plot involves a misplaced kid who enters the monster world and that, apparently, the parent's have no concern for her disappearance. There was a plot, and I'm not sure what it was, but the kids enjoyed it. The animation is sharp for the monsters but the human character looks creepy and uncanny-valley unconvincing. The Randy Newman music at the end sounded basically like the same old 'Toy Story' music - in fact, I found myself singing ""You've got a friend in me"" along to the end credits music. I guess he just takes the same musical idea and reworks it for all his films.",1453161600,,910,4.69375

1439359,5,B00005JKDR,"Just a little more than two months ago I sat down at my keyboard and wrote
a review on Disney's Blu-ray release of Finding Nemo.  I was filled with excitement,
as I raved about the remarkable job the animation team did with the film's 3D
translation. When all was said and done, I placed Finding Nemo at the top of the
list as the best animated upconversion that I had seen to date.

Now, I sit here again, filled with the same exhilaration, having just watched
the newly released 3D Blu-ray of Monsters, Inc. which I can completely assure
you benefits greatly by its new dimensionality added in post production.

The success of Pixar's 2001 release rests mostly on the charm of its voice
talents.  The pairing of Billy Crystal (Wazowski) and John Goodman (Sulley)
provide some of the best comedic performances found in any Pixar film to
date.  For those of you who still may not be familiar with the story, it concerns a
pair of specially-trained monsters WHO work 9 to 5 at the largest scream-processing
factory in Monstropolis.  As they sneak into bedrooms, the screams of frightened
children are collected and used to power the Metropolis.  Believed by Monsters
to be toxic, children are strictly forbidden from entering their world.  As you would
expect, that is exactly what happens as a little girl named Boo (Mary Gibbs)
enters the factory, creating complete chaos. As Sulley and Wazowski try to
return Boo, they uncover a dangerous plot about to be set off by a multi-legged
chameleon-like lizard named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), that could be
deadly to them all.

Monsters Inc. translates flawlessly to 3D Blu-ray, which amazes me because
often you'll hear skeptics talk about how wearing format eyewear diminishes
overall picture quality.  Through my active shutter glasses, I was astonished
to find no such degradation. In fact, what I saw before me was strikingly perfect
imagery with its palette of rich colors and vast amount of textures that are really
pleasing to the eyes.  There's just a wonderful array of vivid, neon-rainbow colors
to behold here.  Black levels are fantastic.  Even more astonishing is the level
of detail that only Blu-ray could provide.  You can see every strand of fur
across Sully's Monstrous body, and with the added depth that 3D provides, it
appears to be more realistically soft and natural.  This is another one of those
transfers that turns your display into a picture window where everything seems
so perfect inside that you could almost reach in and touch it.  In a word, it's
breathtaking.

The 3D itself is quite excellent, opening this film up to an entirely new viewing
experience thanks to a noticeable amount of depth that makes each scene
look limitless in size.  While there are no blatant gimmicks it's very cool to see
just how many body...err...monster parts protrude outwards.  Take notice how
Randall Bogg's slinky lizard head pokes itself outside the boundaries of the display.
Check out the snakes in Celia's hairdo as they move in and out of the space
between film and viewer.  I even enjoyed the opening title sequence with its many doors
that jettison outward when opened.  And speaking of which....the most thrilling 3D
effects can be seen during the door vault sequence.  If you have a subwoofer and
turn the sound up loud, you almost feel as if you are on a roller coaster ride as doors
race down a conveyor belt.  The pure depth that is portrayed as you look to the bottom
of the vault is immensely impressive. I also loved the overhead shots of the CDA
swat team and all its helicopters converging on the city. This is the kind of perspective
you just cannot replicate in 2D.

And up to this point you haven't heard me complain about crosstalk.  Well, that's because
there is absolutely no ghosting to be found here.  That's a real thumbs up for this transfer.

While the 3D is impressive enough, nothing can prepare you for the explosive Dolby
TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack (downconverted to 5.1 on my system).  I don't think I could write
anything about the acoustic experience and do it justice.  Let me just say that I have
rarely been so sonically immersed in a film as I was here.  There is such an unbelievable
level of effect placement and panning that are perfectly executed as if without any effort
attached.  At any moment, you could expect sounds to emanate from different corners
of the room.  At times, I heard helicopters encircling my head.  Other times it was the
screams of frightened children.  Every stomp, thump, drop, crash and pounce in this
film is heavily accented by powerful LFE that can be felt as well as heard. I talked
about how great the door vault sequence looks in 3D.  Just wait until you crank your
system high and find yourself in the middle of the action as you feel the floor vibrate
beneath your seat cushion.  Make no mistake about it -- this is reference quality audio
that will be the subject of conversation with your friends long after the credits roll.

...and when you are done assaulting your senses with Monsters, Inc., don't forget
to take a look at the included short, Partysaurus Rex.  It stars the lovable Rex
dinosaur of Toy Story fame as he throws a party for discarded bathtub toys. I
found it a highly entertaining short, mostly thanks to its effective use of 3D, brilliant
neon colors and pumping techno track.  Very worthwhile addition to this package.

The Ultimate Collector's Edition of Monsters, Inc. arrives as a 5-disc set.  There
are single 2D and 3D feature film discs, a bonus Blu-ray disc with a wealth of extra
features, and separate DVD and Digital Copy Feature discs. The Blu-ray case is
sleeved with clever lenticular packaging that gives the effect of Wazowski and Sully
opening a bedroom closet door.

I continue to praise Disney for their efforts in bringing new life to their existing library
with 3D upconversions that are extremely well done.  Monsters, Inc. looks more expansive
and feels more impactful and emotional than ever before thanks to the amount of depth
and realism this format is able to provide.  If one could afford it, I would recommend
enthusiasts purchase every single 3D animated feature Disney has released to date.
However, if you could only afford to buy two, I would place Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.
at the top of the list (in that order).",1453075200,,6315,4.775322283609577

1439801,5,B00005JKDR,"My kids love Monsters and can't get enough of them. The beautiful thing about this movie is that in the hundreds of times that my kids have watched this movie, I can't say that I have ever been disappointed when they want to watch this over any other film.

Most of the time, I can only watch a movie one time before I start to get tired of it. With Monsters, you are instantly hooked from the first scene to the last. In Blu-Ray, this film is absolutely stunning.

The one reservation that I have is that the size of the box is the size of a DVD box, not a Blu-Ray box. I understand that it says that it comes in DVD packaging, and I really didn't think that the size would bother me that much. For $8 more, you can get the Ultimate Collector's Edition which includes a digital copy as well. Unfortunately, this does not include a digital copy, which I think is a great value and worth the extra money.

If you're looking at which version to buy, I would pass on this one and grab one of the upgraded copies with a digital copy so that you can watch it anywhere you have access to a mobile device!",1440633600,,1098,4.145539906103286

This was an excellent quality Mandarin Chinese dub with great voice acting, some of the voices I felt fit the characters even better than the original English ones.

1440485,4,B00005JKDR,"This movie is very cute, however, its been giving my kids nightmares. I guess I thought that they would think the monsters were funny. All of the other kids their age like this movie.
If you think that you kids that might be sensitive to being scared - forgo this one",1425427200,,267,4.254901960784314

1440487,4,B00005JKDR,"I'm going to comment only on the 3D version of this movie.

I have to say, I was profoundly disappointed by the 3D version.  The other 3D animated movies I've seen are Finding Nemo, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, all of which looked pretty fantastic (especially Nemo -- like a big window directly into the ocean in my living room).

The problem is confined to the brightly lit scenes, which unfortunately are almost everything in the scream factory.  The bright light makes the characters look like glaringly obvious CGI figures superimposed on a computer storyboard.  No amount of tweaking my TV settings to make it darker seemed to help.  The darker scenes looked better.

That being said, overall I don't feel 3D added anything to this movie at all.  There are no ""jump out"" moments, so the 3D is really only for ""depth of field,"" which is only good if you can distract yourself from the really terrible way it makes the characters stand out too much like a CGI artist's work station.

On a positive note, the extra on the Blu-ray ""Partysaurus"" from the Toy Story franchise looks much, much better.",1425340800,,1145,4.656716417910448

I wish Amazon would make it clear when instant downloads do or do not come with the bonus features -- or better yet, just include them, since they were in the original VHS editions and I shouldn't be forced to pay for Blu-Ray to get them again.

1441226,5,B00005JKDR,"We really love the Monsters movies.  We ended up finally picking this up in order to get the sequel, and so we'd have both.  The concept of the series is so creative and fun.  It asks the question ""What if monsters hiding in your closet and under your bed were real, but what if they weren't really that bad?  What if they were just like us, and scaring us simply because it's their job?""  There's a lot of great humor in these movies, and some pretty interesting looking monsters.
This movie looks great in blu-ray, and I really like that we were able to get the combo pack in order to take the DVD on road trips, or the digital version to watch on our tablet.
This is one of those cool movies you can find for your kids that's not too bad for mom and/or dad to watch with them.  It's a good pick for sure!",1406505600,,807,4.10828025477707

I guess I would say it was sometimes funny tasteful, smart, and really innovative. I think children would find it hilarious but as an adult maybe it was just too silly for me.  I will add I love, love, love cartoons, Disney and all of that stuff. This just didn't give me the laughs I like to get. It was interesting, but it was missing the ""IT"" factor for me. didn't finish it.
  All I can say is you really should watch it with your family, sometimes kids cracking up can help a ""blah"" movie become awesome.  I don't think it would make anyone angry at its quality or anything but maybe just not ""MY"" favorite Disney movie but again It think it's a great family movie possibly where the adults may end up walking away to finish up chores is all,, :) Hope this um helped?",1403827200,,893,4.279761904761905

The attention to detail is amazing...having Boo draw a picture of her monster, closeups of textures in the couch and her monster costume. The movie shows how learning about one another eliminates fear and invites cooperation. There are many doses of humor - slapstick, low brow and high brow, in order to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. I still love this movie after repeated viewings, and having it right on the computer is great for travel. Thanks for putting it on amazon prime!",1400025600,3,653,4.891891891891892

1441425,2,B00005JKDR,"There is no way I would recommend that you plop your 3 year old in front of this movie and make dinner.  You really need to be around to comfort her on the scary parts, because they are truly terrifying at moments.  I know that we adults can get chuckles at the sarcasm and/or the spoofs, but my daughter was crying out with horror at some of these scenes.
I'm not too worried about it though, and overall the movie is ok, but I swear that I've seen some way more mellow movies that were labeled PG.  One of the reasons I decided to take the chance to watch a movie called ""Monsters...""  is because it said it was ""G"" rated.  When I think of ""G"" rated I expect something that has good messages, and generally peaceful.  This movie has characters hitting each other with baseball bats, sucking their faces with menacing vacuums, ganging up on one another to inflict suffering, and these are just a few things I can think of after watching one time.  Whoever was in charge of rating this movie should be fired!!!",1399161600,5,1010,4.3689839572192515

1441443,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is one of my favorite Disney movies - it is a wildly imaginative take on a classic childhood fear and I love the idea that laughter is more powerful than fear. The animation is beautiful, particularly on bluray, and the voice cast is perfect. There is a surprising amount of emotional depth, character development, and humor to the film that I don't think was present in many of the early Disney films.

In terms of the release, I'm glad Disney is now offering the combo packs, often at a comparable price to purchasing just the DVD or just the Bluray. It provides more options for people who may not have a Bluray player in every room with a TV, or when you bring the movie to someone's house not knowing what format they can support.",1398384000,2,750,4.474452554744525

1441490,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. (Pete Docter, 2001)
[originally posted 14Nov2001]

Docter gets his feature-length directorial debut after working behind the scenes on Pixar's Toy Story films. They took a chance having someone other than John Lasseter helm this oneand it paid off big time.

In case you've been living under a rock for the past six months, a quick plot summary: friends and roommates James P. Sullivan (John Goodmanthe big blue hairy guy) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystalthe eye) work at Monsters, Inc., the company that provides the monsters that inhabit the closets of human children. They do this because the sonic vibrations of childrens' screams are the source of their world's power. Nifty, huh? They've also been brought up to believe that being touched by a human is instant death. Through various machinations, a human child ends up coming through a closet door and landing in Monstropolis, the town where the monsters live, and the news of this has roughly the same effect as a nuclear bomb threat in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Guess who gets stuck with the kid and has to find a way to get her back to the human world?

Pixar have always been good at balancing the edge between kid-friendly and adult-oriented, and never more so than in this movie. There's enough physical comedy to keep the kiddies happy, while the movie's main plot and emotional subtexts go way over their heads and keep the adults interested. Top-notch casting (James Coburn, Steve Buscemi, and a host of other top-of-the-B-listers join Crystal and Goodman), Pixar's trademark cutting-edge animation, and one of the best scripts in years make this not only another bullet in Pixar's belt, but the best one yet. **** ",1396569600,,1711,4.951219512195122

1441503,5,B00005JKDR,"I found this film very delightful and was quite funny in places. Adults who take their kids to see it might be surprised to find themselves having a pretty good time, as I did when my niece and went to see at the BFI (British film institute) hasn't been a film in years, previous to this release, to use such creative energy. My niece and I loved the way they did Sulley's fur.",1396483200,,377,4.178082191780822
1441504,5,B00005JKDR,"Pixar's forth film is one of their best and the 3 disc (actually 4 if you count the digital copy) Blu Ray is nothing short of spectacular. The film looks and sounds great with only the slightest of imperfections at brief times. The film shows Pixar's growth and each film looks more polished that the one before it. Monster's Inc. may scare very young children though, so you may want to screen this before letting your little ones see it.

The Blu Ray has a ton of bonus material and all have been carried over from the previous DVD release, so this is a no brainer for those who want to own or upgrade this film.",1396137600,,614,4.293103448275862

1441592,5,B00005JKDR,"I had never seen this...after all, I scare easily, and could a monster movie really be cute, I wondered? But this movie is so, so touching and heartwarming - you will weep happy tears at the end. The relationship between Sulley (""Kitty"") and Boo is so charming, caring, and sweet. Additionally, the film is riddled with all of Pixar's trademark (clean) humor and wit. The monsters are very cartoon and mostly funny, but a few of them might take a few minutes of getting used to for the youngest or most sensitive/visual children. I guarantee you, however, nothing about this story is creepy, and by the end of it, you'll have totally forgotten they are technically monsters. In fact, by the end of it, they're converted to...well, I'll let you find out. A beautiful movie about love, friendship, care, and loyalty. Everyone should see this. It's a gem.",1393632000,,852,4.763513513513513

1441598,4,B00005JKDR,Monsters Inc. is much better than Monsters university. It is funny and appeals to adults and young viewers alike. The child girl in this movie reminds me a lot of Agnus in Despicable me.,1393372800,,186,4.5

1441641,5,B00005JKDR,"It was great.  I was skeptical a good sequel could follow Monsters Inc but this works great. New characters,...uh,...creatures mixed with the fan favorites; an abundance of cuteness, fun, action, and moral-of-the-story.

1441659,5,B00005JKDR,"The story line is brilliant. The characters are funny, flawed and relatable. The voice of Boo just melts my heart. The ending makes me cry like a baby every time. I have seen it at least 15 times.

I also think, although I am not a psychologist, that I think this may help a toddler win over her fears of monsters lurking in the dark. as we were watching this movie, I made sure to point out to her that the monsters were good and funny and that she did not need to be be afraid of monsters, or that like Boo, she could confront the bad monsters and win!",1392336000,,460,3.8526315789473684

It's fast-paced to be sure, but somehow it never holds my attention.  The movie kind of loses me starting with Mike & Sully's banishment, all the way through the end of this scene.  That said, it's still very funny and occasionally touching, especially when Sully and Boo say goodbye.  Highly recommend.",1390867200,,532,4.627659574468085

There's evil afoot in the factory of Monsters Inc, panic in the form of a small child, and a dastardly plot our unsuspecting heroes accidently stumble across and solve.  The voice work, by the likes of James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose III and Steve Buscemi as the evil Randall Boggs is exceptional.  The story is well thought out; the pace is quick.  The fact that you can care for such odd looking creatures is amazing.  This should have won the Oscar for best animated feature film but it didn't, losing to Shrek.

1441990,5,B00005JKDR,"Boo! Get it? The character in the movie, Monsters Inc., or the exclamation used to scare someone? In Monsters Inc., both uses of the word, Boo, added up to the highest grossing animated movie as of its release date (October 28, 2001). This wonderfully crafted Disney Pixar film has universal appeal; all age groups, young and old, are captivated and transfixed as the characters struggle to return a lost child to her home. Amusingly, there is a unique role reversal; not between the scary monsters and two-year-old Boo, but between two monsters and the scary two-year old. The monsters believe that Boo has a toxic touch  that she could kill even the largest monster with just one finger! The audience remains alert and on the edge of their seats as the anticipation and suspense of this hilarious film builds. In fact, my first experience in the theaters as a four and a half year old was this very movie. I was fascinated with the silly looking monsters and the now renowned, Mike Wazowski, the green eyeball with arms and legs, and Sulley, the colorful and fluffy supersized teddy bear, whose distinctiveness will forever make me smile. I strongly recommend this movie!",1387324800,,1173,4.835820895522388

1442134,5,B00005JKDR,"After ""Toy Story,"" this movie is my favorite of Pixar's work.  The animation is absolutely wonderful, especially so when you watch it on Blu-Ray.  This is a movie that is good for kids and adults alike, though some little kids might be a bit spooked in places.

This is the story of Mike and Sulley, good friends who live in Monsteropolis, a place somewhere adjacent to our own reality where everyone is a ""monster"" and they power their world via obtaining children's screams.  Hence, Sulley is a master scarer and Mike is his handler for the city's power company.  Sulley steps through doors into various children's bedrooms, scares them, and the power of their fear provides energy that they can use.

The problem all starts when a little girl happens to tag along and follow Sulley back home...and, horror of horrors, everyone there believes that children are toxic to monsters.  There is also a secret plot going on at the power company involving finding another more powerful way of getting energy from the kids.  Sulley and Mike soon discover that not only aren't kids dangerous, but Sulley ends up attached with the one he ends up protecting.

Wonderful movie.  The animation of Sulley's fur and the little girl's face is fabulous, as is one of the scenes where they jump through the interdimensional doors all over the world.  Very touching and very funny at times.  I've watched them movie half a dozen times and I still love it.",1384819200,,1438,4.754032258064516

I was a little worried he'd be scared of monsters in his closet... but we're good it seems! We watched it twice this weekend and he's already asked again.,1384300800,,251,4.142857142857143
1442155,5,B00005JKDR,"The genre of animation has grown quite a bit in the last couple of decades. When movies like Finding Nemo came out years ago we got to experience how much could be done with this genre. As more and more films came out the law of averages prevailed, some were good, some were pretty bad, and only a few were truly great. That is why I stopped watching everything that came out in this category and tried to concentrate on those I thought were gems. I am not sure why I never got around to watching this movie, but now I realize that I was missing out all these years.

Let's start with the biggest plus I found. The story is absolutely enthralling, with a plot the overflows with imagination and provides the audience with a nice combination of laughter and tender moments. There may be a few scary moments for little kids, but these are truly few and far in between, and as soon as they figure out that the monsters are actually more afraid of the kids than the kids are of the monsters, it goes away.

The voice acting is what actually takes this film to the next level. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver with their voices better performances than many actors can deliver when acting themselves in films. The inflection in their voices, cadence and emotion provide the story with an added layer of awesomeness. Finally, the animation and graphics are really stunning, with smooth action, spectacular level of detail and vivid colors.

I regret having waited this long to watch this one, if you are in the same boat I was, stop dilly-dallying and watch it now. You'll be glad you did.",1384300800,,1589,4.510416666666667

1442232,4,B00005JKDR,"Monsters University is a look at the relationship between Mike and Sulley during their days at Monsters University -- when they weren't necessarily the best of friends in this sort of prequel to Monsters INC.

I thought the original Monsters INC movie was one of the better animations movies going, with a good funny story that made me as an adult laugh.  So I looked forward to seeing the sequel (ahem) prequel I mean.  And although it may not be overall as strong as the original, maybe treading into territory we have seen before, Monsters University does a good job at bringing some laughs and a decent story with a good message for the kids.

 There are some great lines and shameless but expertly timed sight gags.  The movie does a great job at telling what it truly means to be honest, honorable, loyal and fair.

Although it has a predictable tale, it is a good movie to watch with your kids that has a good message on top of it.",1383091200,,938,4.450292397660819

I watched this twice, having not seen it when it was first released. although my children are now grown I think the movie includes helpful themes of good versus evil, diversity and tolerance, heroes and villians and effectively dispels the fears of ""monsters under the bed "" that many children harbor at a young age. this performance is an absolute joy to experience.",1379030400,,479,4.714285714285714

1442576,5,B00005JKDR,This is a very kid and pre-teen friendly movie.  It is difficult to find a movie that a 5 year old boy and a 11 year old girl will watch together.  This movie was well received by both parties and their parents.,1377561600,,211,4.0

It's missing the outtakes, which have some of my favorite scenes in them.  I wouldn't have minded not having them, IF I hadn't paid so much for it!  Why can't they be included in the downloaded version?  I'm REALLY disappointed.  $19.99 is a lot to pay for a movie and not get everything that's part of the movie.  If I had known this, I would have just bought the DVD instead.",1376956800,,523,4.26530612244898

1442634,3,B00005JKDR,Can't understand why writers have one character call another 'stupid' without any regard how those indirectly offer sanction to young kids to do the same thing.

1442687,4,B00005JKDR,"You would think with John Goodman and Billy Crystal at the comedy helm, this movie would have delivered much more fun and craziness and also be much more 'colored' in it's humor. Yeah, it's alright for a G, but I think it would have worked better if it was more adult-oriented with a minimum of PG-13 rated stuff coming from the lips of two of the best improv-style comedians that we know. This leads me to believe that ""Monsters University"" can't possibly be that reflective of college pranks and life and will be a bigger let-down than ""Monsters, Inc."" was.",1375833600,,559,4.6

1442748,5,B00005JKDR,"From Pixar, the Makers of Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Wall-ee, This is a tale with an unusual take on children and monsters in the closet. John Goodman is an incredible actor, and here he shines as James P. Sullivan, a monster who works in a factory that produces energy by collecting the screams of children. He and his best buddy, Billy Crystal as Mike wazowski are in contention with another monster, Randall who is seeking to top the scare record any way he can. However, Randall has some dark plans of his own to revolutionize the industry and that includes kidnapping children. His plans are interrupted when Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world resulting in a city wide panic because the monsters have always believed human children were toxic. While he and Mike are with the child though, things begin to change as Sulley grows attached to the little girl named Boo, and they discover that she is not at all dangerous, but Randall is and that his accomplice in the kidnapping caper is none other than their own boss Waternoose. How this is resolved is in the film, a wonderful romp that does have a point for it. It makes the dark and the shadows a bit less scary to think that monsters come out to make one laugh instead to frighten.",1374883200,,1267,4.56140350877193

1442752,5,B00005JKDR,"Enjoyed watching this movie again, this time with my 3 year old. She really liked it. I was nervous about whether the monsters would scare her, but this issue is handled very tactfully, and in my opinion, there are only 2 times when monsters do something scary (roar), and it is either immediately followed by something silly that makes the monster look ridiculous or contrition on the part of the monster.",1374710400,,406,4.732394366197183

1442933,3,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. is a great family film and a fun time at the movies.  However, it could have been much better in my opinion.  On its own it is a good film to take your children to, but by Pixar standards I find the film to very average.  I have seen Pixar at their best with the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, and the Toy Story trilogy.  Compared to those films, in my humble opinion, this film does not measure up.

The thing that I liked the best about this film is the concept.  The concept is that the monster world is powered by scream energy.  Monsters use manufactured doors as windows to the human world and scare children which give the monsters their energy.  I find that a great concept.  I also like that scaring is more of a business and it has this corporate aspect.  The concept itself is not new, but this film does give its own spin on it.  There is a lot that they could do with such a good set-up.

However, what they ultimately do with it is underwhelming.  One of the big issues I have with this film is the story.  The story is very clich and not very interesting.  The story is that a little human girl comes into the monster world and our heroes Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) have to protect her from the villains and get her back to the human world.  Along the way the girl and our heroes (particularly Sullivan) form a bond and realize that humans are not so evil.  I have seen this story before, and I knew what was going to happen ultimately.

The villains were not that interesting either.  The villain Randall (Steve Buscemi) I found to be more annoying than threatening.  He is just a one-dimensional bad guy.  I did not feel much tension or urgency regarding their ultimate goal.  The final showdown at the end was, to be honest, kind of boring.  It was not that exciting to me and I felt no tension.  The last act of Monsters University I thought was done much better.  In fact I thought Monsters University as a whole was better than this film despite that film being quite clich as well.  I just found it more enjoyable.

There are many good things about the film.  I did like Mike and Sullivan.  I found that they did have chemistry together and they can be quite funny, especially Mike.  The humor is fine, but not Pixar's best.  I found that the funniest parts were during the third act.  The kids should be very entertained.  The animation is great and it still holds up today.  I did not see it in 3D when it came out last year so I cannot comment on that.  As I mentioned earlier I do really like the concept.

Overall, most people will really enjoy this movie.  The reason why I am being hard on it is because I thought it was average by Pixar standards.  I have seen Pixar at its greatest and this was not their greatest.  However, you should still enjoy yourself.  The children should love it.",1372809600,2,2858,4.328922495274102

Not only is it fun for both adults and children (my parents were laughing the whole time), it's a great movie to help little ones with the normal bed time fears of monsters in the dark. I wish I'd had this movie when I was little! When buying this movie, remember that there are different regions for DVD players. Make sure you buy the right region. Almost all the 1 star ratings are due to people not bothering to make sure they bought the right region and then complaining about their ""defective product.""",1372723200,,537,4.489795918367347

1443080,1,B00005JKDR,"There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.

If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?

I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.

So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?

Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.",1370822400,,1208,4.355555555555555

The monster characters are sooo human, I couldn't stop laughing at certain points because they reminded me of people in my life.  It has a good storyline and teaches a good lesson about friendship and love, and how greed can make people do bad things.

Let me tell you that I was very impressed with Pixar's UP and Finding Nemo in 3D, but they do not hold a candle to this movie in terms of 3D depth and quality. My favorite part was the blizzard. The amount of depth seen was ridiculous, from the copious snow blasting down in the foreground, the characters in the middle of field, all the way to inanimate objects in the background.

My bottom line: If you like Monsters, Inc. and are looking to dive into the 3D version, I would give it my highest recommendation.",1361232000,6,720,4.255474452554744

In 3-D it's no less affecting, and is the first 3-D movie I've seen this year that actually looks and feels like it belongs in 3-D.  I find this ironic, as many movies that were filmed specifically for 3-D look flat in comparison to the converted ""Monsters, Inc.""

Sully (John Goodman) is a traditional scarer, getting energy for the city of Monstropolis by scaring children.  The ethics of how this works never occurs to Sully (or anyone, really), as human children are considered terrifying, diseased beasts.  This of course makes it easier for the ""monsters"" to do their jobs.

But in reality Boo is an inquisitive little girl who loves her ""kitty"" (that'd be Sully).  She is fearless of the various monsters, except for Randal (Steve Buscemi), a chameleon-like monster who has other plans for extracting screams from kids that's even less ethical than simply scaring them.

Stumbling into this is Abbot-like sidekick Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed butterball who is in love with his ""shmoopsey"" Celia (Jennifer Tilly).  Unlike Sully, he's moving on to a relationship -- with the possibility of raising a family -- and he balances the circumstances of their contact with the world of children against his future with his girlfriend.  This is heavy stuff for a show supposedly for kids.

But that's the point.  ""Monsters, Inc."" is a show for the man-child in all of us, who secretly suspects he'd like to be a parent but isn't sure if he's up for it.  When faced with the possibility of Boo coming to harm, Sully tells Mike ""none of that matters now.""

It's hard to understand unless you're a parent.  But it's true.  Once you connect with a child, nothing else matters.  ""Monsters, Inc."" isn't content to just entertain children, or stop at a happy ending.  It has a higher goal in mind, taking on the question of a civilized society and the ethical sacrifices it must make to be productive.  Sully eventually finds a way, but in doing so sacrifices the one thing he loves most.

The last scene, with a monster coming out of the closet not to scare a child but to greet her, is one of the sweetest moments in CGI history.",1356566400,,2342,4.705159705159705

I purchased this set for $54.99 as my daughter loves it, after my purchase I saw that it is now 49.99, you can imagine my irritation, even just at a $5 difference. Also, I made a hurried purchase as they said there was only one left in stock, since this DVD is in the Disney vault right now, I had no way of purchasing another new copy from anyone else, and even though this was twice what I paid for my original copy, I bought it since it was the ""last copy"", and was excited to have found one last new copy! Now it says there are 3 more copies.  Seems suspicious to me.  If this is a duplication, Amazon should be aware, as this is illegal.  I will be returning this and asking for a refund.

1444403,4,B00005JKDR,"***This review may contain spoilers***

When ""Monsters, Inc.""first came out, some perceived a rivalry with ""Shrek"".  I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily and own both DVDS, and that both are highly accomplished animated features. On the old ""Ebert and Roeper"" TV show, I remember that critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes. I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film; the poor fellow must have been jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.

I will not rehash the plot. I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive. Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. (""Sully"") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world. While the ""Odd Couple"" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie. Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time. Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the presence department.

Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of ""King Kong), ""Monsters, Inc."" stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work. It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie. Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the ""Scream Suction"" device by the unctuously reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy). Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears. The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.

In short, ""Monster, Inc.""'s plan came wonderfully together. Despite some commentators' views, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again. Keep doing it...please!

ONE QUIBBLE: Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension. I wonder what her parents were thinking when she went missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).",1324425600,3,3097,5.362139917695473

1444408,5,B00005JKDR,"My three children love this movie, especially my three yo. son. Watching this on Bluray is fascinating.  Pixar really did a super job with the textures. For us adults, hearing the well known voices of John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Billy Crystal make it all the more fun.",1322352000,,272,4.666666666666667
1444409,5,B00005JKDR,"Good classic children's movie. There are a couple of scenes where young children might be a little scared especially right near the start where there is the ""room simulator"" and also back in the simulator when Sully gives a scare demo. My son who is a year and a half really enjoys it, but was a little scared during the scenes I mentioned and seems to dislike Randall instinctively.",1321920000,,383,4.565217391304348
1444410,5,B00005JKDR,"I love Pixar movies, but originally wasn't too impressed with this offering. Having a baby changed all of that, however.

Once we stumbled across some 'Monster's Inc.' while my then-two-year-old son was in the room. He was instantly transfixed, something about the shape of the characters and the world enraptured him. After his first exposure, we got incessant demands to see this: ""Watch Monster Mike! Watch Monster Mike!""

I would have figured some of the subject matter (using children's screams as energy, the villian, etc.) would be a little dark for a two year old, but he absolutely loves it!  My son (and therefore, I) saw this movie at least 20 times, often split across multiple days. Even though it's been almost a year since we first started watching, he still loves it.

Pro:
- nice animation, cute characters
- great voice acting from Goodman, Crystal, Buscemi, and more! See if you can recognize Waternoose's voice
- interesting story and plotline
- lots of details. My son absolutely, positively loves the idea of the doors.
- DVD has worked reliably and has good video encoding quality. No complaints!

Con:
- none. It's a sweet movie that gets a little better each time you watch it.",1321488000,,1202,4.84390243902439
1444411,5,B00005JKDR,I really enjoyed watching this movie on Blu-ray. The picture quality was amazing. It has been a while since I saw this movie and watching this movie on Blu-ray felt like I was watching it for the first time. I felt like a kid again glued to this movie from start to finish. My kids enjoyed the movie on Blu-ray as well. I love that the picture fills up the whole screen on my widescreen tv. No more black bars on the top and bottom of the picture. I give this movie 2 thumbs up. You should buy it. It is worth the purchase.,1320537600,,523,4.038461538461538

1444434,5,B00005JKDR,"Great movie for two year old and up.  My only issues are several times when one character hits or slaps another.  Also several times one character will say ""Shut up"" to another.  These are things that we never ever do in front of our children.  Otherwise, it's a great movie.",1315872000,,275,4.44
1444435,5,B00005JKDR,"As far as Pixar is concerned, they are sort of modern day geniuses.  I mean, outside of the horrendous `Cars' (I refuse to see `Cars 2'), they have had one homerun after another.  `Monsters Inc.' was one of the first Pixar films to really grab my interest as an adult.  Considering that `Toy Story' was released when I was ten, it was an instant hit with me at the time.  `Monsters Inc.' on the other hand was released when I was sixteen.  It's a lot harder to convince a teenager that an animated film is worthy of their time since to a teenager the word `cartoon' can mean one thing; `it's for children'.

I was not a child anymore.

That said, it was a film that some of my `female' friends wanted to see and so we all went together.  We loved it.  But honestly, what isn't to love?

`Monsters Inc.' is yet another imaginative offering from Pixar, the studio that continues to reinvent animation by giving us vivacious stories of superheroes, flying houses and rats that can cook.  Here we have the story of a monster community that scares children to keep their city running.  Scares capture energy that is used like electricity.  The film focuses on two particular monsters, Sully and Mike.  When they inadvertently bring a young girl (who they affectionately refer to as Boo) back to their world, everything gets tossed upside down.  In the process we get a special and tender glimpse at the world of monsters and we see them come to a more docile understanding of their own existence.

By the end of the film you'll just want to squeeze Sully so tight!

The voice work is remarkable (but what else would you expect from a company that immortalized Ellen DeGeneres as a fish).  John Goodman is perfectly cast as the warm and lovable Sully (that voice is so serene and calming) and Billy Crystal IS Mike Wazowski!  The animation is crisp and endearing, with bright colors and remarkably real landscapes.  It's a stunning addition to the Pixar filmography, and one that everyone would be proud to own.

I guess cartoons aren't just for kids anymore!",1315872000,,2053,4.6005509641873275

1444480,4,B00005JKDR,"When you watch this movie, you'll laugh...and be drawn in by the wonderful animation. Colorful, wonderfully dimensional, and crisp animations will, for the durance of this movie, trick you into believing--or wanting to believe--it's all real. And the story itself is just plain funny without being corny. The characters are original and charming; the plot is creative (a monster factory collects kids' screams, which are turned into energy. One day, a human girl accidentally gets into the monster world due to the villain's carelessness, and a hard worker and his assistant must get her back to the human world). Splendid. The movie does tend to wander until the conclusion, and sometimes the movie is a little too sentimental, but it does not affect this brilliant film very much, if at all.",1313280000,,793,5.061068702290076

1444486,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is Pixar's most funny film. The humor in this film is so clever, so refined that is one of the best comedies ever. The humor is not juvenile or full of pop culture references, is a broad humor that will appeal to children and adults alike. But, this movie is not only a comedy. Being a Pixar film, expect excellence in every area of the production. The story is awesome, the characters are endearing, the animation superb and the action sequences jaw-dropping. Is amazing how this was only Pixar's fourth film and they already were showing how good they are. Monsters. Inc. is an instant classic that will entertain you, move you and make you have a wonderful time.

Picture & Audio
Like with every Pixar film on BD, it's not surprinsing that Monsters, Inc. debuts on HD with a completely mesmerizing transfer. You will see every detail in crisp clarity and awe at the level of animation that this movie has. Some aliasing appears in Sulley's fur but I think is inherent to the source and shouldn't bother you. An amazing transfer through and through.

Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is demo quality. it will envelop you with Randy Newman's amazing score and you will be literally transported to Monstropolis. An audio presentation that can't ger any better.

Bonus Features:

This is a 2-disc BD set that its full of chocked full goodies. You have everything from the 2-Disc CE DVD that includes hours upon hours of making of featurettes, trailers, two shorts, an audiocommentary, publicity and much much more. New to this BD is an excellent piece called ""Filmmakers Round Table"" where Peter Docter and crew sit down and reminiscence about the making of the film. Also you have a view of the new ride of MI in Tokyo and an interactive game.

A DVD copy is also offered.

Closing Thoughts:

Monsters, Inc. is another Pixar film that everyone should own. With impeccably comedic timing, superb animation and an excellent story, this is another proud addition to the Pixar catalogue and should be a proud addition to your library. This BD offers unmatched picture and sound and many hours of bonus material. Hurry and just buy it!!!",1307404800,5,2142,4.757412398921833

1444529,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. is widely recognized as one of the greatest Pixar films ever made, and it's there are several reasons why. First, the premise of everyday monsters actually trying their best to scare human kids in order to raise their economy is something that is quite amusing. Kids and adults alike love the plot because it's very inventive. Also, the characters (especially Sully, Mike, and little Boo) are really likable, while the animation is spectacular and extraordinarily detailed. The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.

I may not be one of the biggest Pixar fans in the world, but I know a good movie when I see one. And Monsters Inc. is a GREAT movie. I fully recommend it to kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, even pets.

1444598,4,B00005JKDR,"If, like me, you find yourself wondering what makes the big guys in the entertainment industry so big, you've come to the right review.  We all know Pixar has established itself as the premiere computer generated feature film studio, but as if gems like the Toy Stories aren't proof enough of their supremacy, enter Monsters Inc.  Nine years old already, this one manages to push all of the right buttons of what a CG feature film could and should be while managing to appeal to viewers of all ages.

Reaching the top of a given industry can be serendipitous, sure but this one here represents proof of the gradual climbing process that separates this studio from the others.

Monsters Inc., for the two or three human beings on earth who have yet to see it, follows James P ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman), a big blue furry monster and his friend and coworker Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a smaller green Cyclops, who happen to work at the power company within the city of Monstropolis: Monsters Inc.

Subscribers to the theory that monsters work at the utility companies in our own world will be glad to know that in Monstropolis, energy is derived not from the burning of coal or turning of turbines but by refining human screams, which are collected in steel canisters.

The monsters travel through doors linked to those in children's' bedrooms in our world and do their best to scare said kids into a nice shriek of terror. Sulley just so happens to be the number one scream-generator at Monsters, Inc. despite intense rivalry from the #2 guy, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). Meanwhile poor Mike, a member of the preparation team, handles Sulley's paperwork, arranges doors and changes his collecting cylinders.  It turns out only the biggest, scariest and most elite employees have what it takes to become scarers.

Sulley and Mike's careers at Monsters, Inc. and the very welfare of Monstropolis are in jeopardy once Sulley accidentally lets a human child into the monster.  It turns out that while humans are conditioned to fear monsters, so too are monsters trained to be terrified of human children.

What we have here basically is a layered parody of blue-collar life as the catalyst to deliver an inversed look at the myths all kids can relate with.  The plot structure is impeccably tight with enough levels of amusement to appeal (classily) to just about anyone who encounters it.

I'm personally partial to all of the instances where an oblivious Mike Wazowski, a role seemingly custom made for Billy Crystal, narrowly avoids fame but is no less enthusiastic about it.

Taking in this film, even a decade after its initial release, it becomes apparent that Pixar's charm is actually derived from some of the simplest ideas imaginable.  In fact most other animated films suddenly look way overcomplicated by comparison.  The visuals have since been outdone in terns of complexity, color, and texturing yet few releases since can claim having delivered such a well-rounded package.

Additionally a lively Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX mix done up by a team at Skywalker Sound. It's as active, and vibrant as the visuals! As a bonus Randy Newman's charming score comes through with spectacular clarity.

In all, it had been nearly a decade since my last visit to Monsters Inc. and as a result of a recent mission to visit/ review as many computer generated features as possible, purchased the 2-disc DVD set being reviewed here. Conclusion: Pixar's path to supremacy is lined with some of the finer examples of the genre.",1287619200,,3535,4.894472361809045

1444655,5,B00005JKDR,"Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.

And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), ""Monsters Inc"" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best. It has brilliant animation, delightful characters (""Mike Wazowski!""), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.

The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.

The top Scarer is James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.

Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named ""Boo"") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.

Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.

The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue (""What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?"" ""I get a time out?"" ""Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?"" ""... painted?""). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).

However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story -- Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it (""I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!"").

John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo (""One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!""). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.

It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual ""working joe"" environment -- ""Monsters Inc"" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.",1280793600,,3353,4.941385435168739
1444656,5,B00005JKDR,"Lets all remember back to our early childhoods...

It's bedtime in our cozy little rooms, our parents are tucking us into bed, saying goodnight and that they'll see us in the morning. They turn the lights out, close the door behind them, our eyes drifting shut, thinking of the happy thoughts from the day...That's when you hear a creak in your room. Your eyes dart from side to side, wondering what that noise was that stirred the silence. All of a sudden a dark silhouette starts staring at you from across your room, leaning towards you in your bed. You watch in terror as it seems to dance back and forth as it comes closer towards you. As it's about to pounce, you freeze and can do nothing but scream bloody murder in hopes that your parents save you from this evil monster who's somehow gotten into your room. All of a sudden, the lights come on, mom or dad rush in and ask what's wrong. You tell them about the monster that almost ate you from across the room, and they point out that it must just be your imagination, and you only saw the shadow of your lamp. They once again say goodnight, thinking that you're just a silly kid, but you know better, you know you saw something coming from your closet.

Monsters Inc is a hilarious and adorable take on the monsters that lived in your closet when you were a kid. The story revolves around Mike Wazowski, a little green one-eyed monster with a sharp wit, James ""Sulley"" Sullivan, a lovable large blue and purple striped fuzzball of a monster, and Monsters Inc, their place of work. Monsters Inc is the leading power supplier for Monstropolis, and we come to find out that the monsters who terrified us as children were only trying to collect our screams of terror to power their homes, offices, and local drinking establishments. Sulley is the leading scarer at work, and is almost about to break the scare-record, but Randall, a chameleon/snake hybrid, is hot on his trail in being the best scarer. Everything is going great for Mike and Sulley, until one day a small child nicknamed Boo, sneaks back into the monster's world through her closet door, and everyone's lives change. Children are believed to be ""dangerous"" to the monsters, and anyone who comes in contact with even a piece of their clothing is instantly decontaminated (Code 2319 - learn it, you'll hear it a lot).

This child invasion can't come at a worse time, as Monsters Inc is in trouble, since kids aren't as easily scared as they used to be. The story deals with Mike/Sulley's friendship, the competition between Sulley and Randall for leading scarer, and everyone's interactions with Boo. While all of this seems silly and simple, there's a lot of depth with all of the characters involved, and even Monstropolis has it's own charms.

Pixar (who was still a newer company at this point) once again did a fantastic job with the vibrant colors and attention to detail throughout their world. All of the monsters look extremely ""realistic"" and lifelke, and with the popularity of HD movies now you can actually see the stray strands of fur on the fuzzy monsters. There are a lot of different characters in the film, and every one looks very individualistic, adding for a lot of diversity, as well as showing the creativity of the writers/animators at Pixar.

The world itself looks like something straight out of any normal suburban city, with trees lining the sidewalks, normal everyday businesses lining the streets, and cars puttering down the roads. Small attention to details are abound in Pixar films, and after watching this film again recently, I noticed more of the smaller things, like the sale signs in the grocery store selling blood oranges, and other ""scarily"" named items.

One of my favorite parts of Pixar films (as well as Dreamworks, and pretty much anything animated), is the amount of creativity the creators can give themselves with the worlds they create. When dealing with a world of monsters who terrorize children from out of their closets, Pixar can think of the creepiest terrors that a kid would imagine, and make a living breathing version of it. This ability to be able to showcase creativity, and Pixar's creative talents, make for AMAZING films every time one is released.

Overall, this is probably one of Pixar's best films. The amount of time and creativity put into this world of lovable monsters shows throughout the film, hitting on all aspects of a great movie. The story is great, the characters are lovable (even the monsters who are jerks are still enjoyable), and the father/daughter dynamic between a giant blue fuzzy monster and a little tiny toddler girl are heart-warming, and even at some points tear-jerking.",1279670400,,4687,4.764778325123153

Even though this film came out before animated films were being made in High Definition Cameras; the transfer to Blu-Ray format is flawless compared with other transfers from regular DVD's to Blu-Ray films that i have seen from the same time this movie came out. Video is pure 1080P, literally lights up your entire screen with vivid brilliant colors and Sound is fabulous. You actually get to see many details from the characters you didn't even know were there from watching the original film.

1444692,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released in theaters on November 2, 2001. The movie focuses around two main characters: James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski. Sulley and Mike are best friends who live together and work at the Monsters, Inc; a scare plant. Sulley is the top Scarer at the plant and Mike is his assistant scarer. At the end of a shift one day Mike forgot to file his paperwork because his mind is on Celia Mae, his girlfriend, who he is taken her to Harryhausen for her birthday. Sulley steps in for Mike and does his paperwork for him. Sulley is picking up the paperwork and notices that one of the doors has not been put away. He peeks in the room to see if there are any monsters in it and finds out there is none. When he is back on the Scare Floor he sees a little two year old girl playing with his tail and all fun breaks loose. The rest of the story is about Sulley and Mike trying to get Boo (the name giving to the three year old girl by Sulley) back to her world. Along the way the two find out the Randall is kidnapping children for his scare machine and the one who is to blame for the door being found by Sulley. Mike and Sulley are at one point banished to the Himalayas where they meet the Abominable Snowman who was also banished there for reasons unknown. Back at Monsters, Inc. the two send Randall through one of the doors and destroy the door so he cannot return, get Mr. Waternoose to reveal the plans of the scare machine to the Child Detection Agency, and finally send Boo home. The computer animation of Monsters, Inc. is great, the story does not drag, and it keeps everybody laughing. The only thing I really hate is the two disc set. In my opinion everything could have gone on one disc and much of what is on Disc 2 could have been left off. Monsters, Inc. gets an AAAA++++.

One evening there was nothing else to watch so I picked this for background noise. After a few minutes I found myself watching the movie and laughing. This has to be one of the best animated features out there. Monsters, Inc. boasts a stellar cast:  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn! Imagine that kind of talent creating the  monsters' personalities, woven together by an extremely clever story line, brought to life by award winning animation and you get a film that you can watch again and again.

1444728,4,B00005JKDR,"Recently I bought a Blu-ray, against my own thinking because I had to get a player so might as well join the hype. Needed a Blu-ray disc to see if it was worth it so i bought a few discs including this one BECAUSE it was rated as 1 of the top 50 movies to own on Blu-ray by a number of reviewers and I saw this this movie and enjoyed it a long time ago on DVD.

It was worth it ... the detail is excellent ... and I'm no expert but I am meticulous to quality. I do not believe Blu-ray makes a big difference because the quality is in your HD tv ... I have original dvds that look just as good on a Blu-ray playing on the same tv. Don't be fooled, Blu-ray isn't automatically better. Your tv makes a difference.

Having the digital copy and DVD included make this a great set ( I ended up selling off my previous DVD).  If you don't already own this on DVD this is a great way to get all three mediums at one time so that you can take it on trips with a portable DVD player, iPhone (or even an iPad), or enjoy it at home on Blu-ray with a fabulous picture and excellent sound quality.

1444734,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. is a delightfully funny film by Pixar and Disney.  Released in 2001, Monsters, Inc. reflects the modern human world in many ways, with production quotas, rolling blackouts, and families and children in bustling Monsteropolis.

Almost an Abbott and Costello film, Sully & his assistant and best friend, Mike Wazowski.  Randall is Sully's greatest competitor, a scaly, evil chameleon with greed at his heart.

Sully does the scaring of children through doors that when connected to children's bedroom closets become a doorway into the human dimension.  Energy is collected from the screams and powers the Monsteropolis.

But kids are not getting as scared as they used to.  To increase the quota, there is corruption and intrigue afoot, which is realistic for an animated film.

The adult gags and references, such as Harryhausen's Restaurant, are fun to see.  Also, with children being seen as a threat to Monster-dom, there are great penalties for even the slightest contamination from the child's world.  A sock on one unlucky monster's back is enough for panic by the yellow squad of the CDA: Child Detection Agency.

The animators and writers made Randall the complete opposite of Sully.  Where Sully is kind, intelligent and gentle, Randall is sly, secretive and evil.  Randall will stop at nothing to get his own ends.

The one-eyed Mike is fun to watch and see how the animators give a one-eyed guy such emotion.  He's pretty silly too where he just doesn't get what people are trying to say to him.

Crime does not pay and making lemonade out of lemons are good lessons for kids.

The ""blooper"" reel at the end is great, and the jazz music is well done.

Great entertainment from Disney.

1444794,4,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters, Inc."":  4-Disc Edition (BluRay/DVD combo)
(Pixar)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Great movie, one of the best. I first saw it in the theater when it came out, in Emeryville, CA, near the Pixar studios and they had a ginormous, life-sized Sully in the lobby.. With real fur!  So cool... but the movie was even better.

I am knocking a point off this particular edition, however, because it's not quite the bargain I thought it would be.  When I wanted to purchase ""Monsters, Inc."" for my kid, and saw that they had an affordable combo pack that had both DVD and Blu-Ray versions, I thought, well, I might get a Blu-Ray someday, so that could come in handy. Yeah, I'll get it!  Unfortunately, the DVD disc does not also include the same material as the Blu-Ray, so a bunch of games and bonus features are not included, which really bummed my daughter out.  These features were already embedded in the old DVD edition: Disney has purposely *removed* them in order to steer customers towards the new format. As a consumer, I resent this enormously, and I think other potential buyers might want to know that the DVD version has been downgraded and will not be as much fun for your kid as you might hope.  Disney is being needlessly manipulative with its product: why not just give us a package that really is in *both* formats?

It's still a great movie, though!!  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)

1444825,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is a Pixar masterpiece; the animation astounds me and the plot is very engaging--you won't get bored! There's action, adventure, scenes that evoke genuine emotion and lots of good one-liners and even a few ""sight gags,"" too. The actors doing the voiceovers were chosen with care and the flow of the movie is very good--the plot unfolds smoothly without becoming too fast or too slow. The script was well written, too. The film even explores the themes of friendship and the universal struggle between good and evil; that's very impressive.

When the action starts, we quickly meet two employees of Monsters, Inc., a power plant in the city of Monstropolis which, by the way, is populated only by monsters who scare children. There's James Sullivan aka ""Sully"" (voiced by John Goodman) and his buddy Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sullivan is number one at scaring children; but his not-so-friendly coworker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi) is a competitor for the number one slot. Other monsters working at Monsters, Inc. include the boss of it all, Henry Waternoose (voiced by James Coburn); Celia the receptionist (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) and Roz (voiced by Bob Peterson), a cranky older monster who's a stickler for paperwork! Roz is not too happy with Mike because he never seems to file his paperwork correctly--or even on time!

At Monsters, Inc., monsters generate power similar to electricity by entering children's bedrooms in the human world at night through closet doors to make the kids scream in horror! Unfortunately, however, Monstropolis has a problem; the monsters are just not producing enough power from the children's screams. Another interesting thing is that the kids don't know that the monsters are actually quite afraid--of them! The monsters believe that human children are extremely frightening--and the kids could easily be toxic, too!

A big problem eventually arises when James accidentally lets a two year old child into the world of Monstropolis. The state police-like Child Detection Agents need to capture the child and send it back to its home before the child might infect, harm or even kill a monster! James and Mike go through many trials and tribulations just to keep track of the playful and often hard to catch child; and we get quite a few unexpected plot twists and turns before the movie ends!

The two DVD version of this film offers us a plethora of extra features which are truly wonderful. On the first disc, there is the choice between viewing the film in widescreen or fullscreen, although you can only get the audio commentary and the 5.1 surround sound effects mix when you watch this in widescreen format. On the second disc, most of the extras are divided into one of two categories: ""Humans Only"" and ""Monsters Only."" With ""Humans Only"" you get a tour of Pixar Studios (at least as it was when this was first released); deleted scenes; a ""Monstropolis Art Gallery;"" another featurette entitled ""Animation Gags and Guide To `In' Jokes""--and more! With ""Monsters Only"" you get a training video for your first day at Monsters, Inc.; ""See The Monsters, Inc. Employee Handbook;"" ""Learn The History of The Monster World""--and still more! In a general category you also get ""Mike's New Car,"" ""Outtakes"" and ""For the Birds.""

Monsters, Inc. is a wonderfully animated family film that is sure to remain a favorite for many years to come. Although there are a few potentially scary scenes near the end of the film, I still highly recommend this film for family entertainment; use your judgment when thinking of showing this to very young children.",1262304000,,3626,4.996688741721854

1444841,5,B00005JKDR,"Another Pixar gem!  The movie is smart and easy to watch for both kids and adults.  The monsters are perfectly animated with each hair flowing seamlessly on the blue monster ""Sulley"" (John Goodman). Sulley is a whimsical work of art to watch.  He has a buddy and job partner, ""Mike"" (Billy Crystal) who is a round green guy, with one eye and much smaller than Sully.  He talks all the time, but means well.  They both work for Monsters, Inc., a large company that specializes in children's screams they capture in a bottle.  This is bottled energy that monster land needs to keep lights on and refrigerators running.

Monster's Inc. has an assembly line of doors from all over the world.  Once set up in a large room all the monsters enter and they emerge from a child's closet.  A frightening scream from the child is extracted and then the monsters go back through the door and another one is set up.  Kids begin to get used to the monsters and are not scaring as easily.  There is a energy shortage in Monster Land.

Then one day, a little girl, Boo (Mary Gibbs) grabs Sully who she thinks is a big ""Kitty"".  He brings her into the factory by mistake.  Wow - the monsters are scared stiff of children and an exciting adventure ensues.  One discovery is that children's laughter gives more energy than their screams.

We have to have a bad guy so Monster's Inc. plot includes a villain that looks like a purple lizard.  He can disappear and reappear and he has a evil plan for extracting screams.

The ending is happy and you are glad you watched such an endearing tale.",1261958400,,1572,4.475352112676056

1444846,5,B00005JKDR,"Most movies may leave you wondering if it was worth the money to upgrade your setup to Bluray, but Pixar movies will prove just how much of a difference there is.  This movie is beautifully rendered with crisp details (so many features of the monsters' skins and furs that I had never noticed before), and the sound may not be mixed 7-channel but it is encoded in DTS Master which provides phenomenal clarity and fidelity (fitting for a movie that won several awards for sound and music).  In my wife's words, ""It's better than when we saw it at the movies.""  Similar to ""Up,"" this title comes in Disney's new Blu++ format where you get the Blu-ray movie and special features, a DVD copy of the movie and a digital file copy for use with your PC/Mac or favorite portable media player.  It's my opinion that this is the smartest thing Disney has ever done.  Having the DVD copy gives parents and children an option when traveling (plenty of vehicles with DVD players in them) or spending time at a different location where a Blu-ray player is not available (we have grandparents living on a farm in the middle of nowhere and friends who haven't upgraded yet).  The digital file is great as well.  Right now I use this to turn my iPhone into my own personal in flight entertainment system, but in the not too distant future I can see providing my daughter with an iPod of her very own.  Disney says all their movies will be like this going forward, and I wish they would go ahead and re-release all the existing Pixar Blu-ray catalog in the new format.

1444907,5,B00005JKDR,"IMHO the two best Disney pictures of the past decade plus are Monsters Inc. and The Incredibles.  (ok, Toy Story may come close, but it's primarily a boy's movie)

Monsters Inc. is VERY appropriate for boys or girls; and family viewing.  I guarantee that both young and old will enjoy the story - and young children will not be frightened by these monsters.  The heart of the movie is the relationship that develops between Sully (big blue fur ball) and Boo - the child that manages to enter the monster world.  Children enjoy the fact that mosters are as afraid of children as human children often are of monsters.  It's a real ground leveler.  Though there are 'good' and 'bad' monsters in the show, good triumphs and it leaves everyone feeling happy in the end.

Disney sells a wonderful 26"" stuffed Sully for about $30.  If you want to make those little eyes light up this Christmas, consider a present including both the movie and the stuffed animal.  It's guaranteed to make the most timid child unafraid of bedtime.",1257206400,,1022,4.659217877094972

1444939,5,B00005JKDR,"First, let me just say that it is a very, very good and funny movie, but I will come back to its many good points. I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl `Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did a very good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.",1254182400,2,2722,4.349705304518664
1444940,5,B00005JKDR,"Before anyone starts saying this has not been released yet and  there cannot be a review of the Bluray edition let me tell you this, this movie has been available in Japan and Mexico for quite some time now, and I was able to get a copy of the Mexican edition, which was at one time, identical to the one to be released in the US. It is a 3 disc edition (2 BD plus DVD copy of the movie), this has now been changed to a 4 disc set in the US to include the additional digital copy.

Disc one starts with an intro by director Pete Docter, in which he pretty much explains all the contents in this 'glorious' high definition version of the movie.  A mini documentary on the 'Monsters, Inc: Ride & Go Seek ' ride in Disney Japan is also included. The highlight to me was the creators 'Round table' in which they talk about the process of creating the movie, some deleted scenes not included in prior DVD versions are shown here and they finally explained to me why is it so difficult to get a reservation at 'Harryhausen's' if all the staff from the scare floor seems to hang around there!

The Pixar shorts 'For the birds' and 'Mike's new car' (originally made on 4:3 format) are also included in HD format (as previously released in 'Pixar shorts)

The movie is presented in 1:85:1 aspect ratio. The word that comes to mind to describe how this looks is simply 'Beautiful', the colors, the textures, Sullivan's fur, the character's skin textures, Roz' sweater. Details pop up, colors are bright and clear. I had never noted that the real name of 'Boo' is actually in the movie until I saw it on Bluray!

The audio is another improvement of this BD edition. Presented in an uncompressed 5.1 track, the music by Randy Newman and the sound effects (check the audio in the door chamber sequence or every time 'Boo' laughs/cries and there is a power variation) sound just great. Spanish and French Dolby Digital tracks are also included. An audio commentary with the creators provides a lot of details of the movie, since I have watched this over and over with my 2 year old kid I have been able to play the commentary a couple times so he watches the movie and I learn about how it was made.

One thing I noted though, the end credits in the Bluray are not the same as in the DVD. The DVD will have the bloopers play while the credits roll, while the Bluray does not. Those 'Bloopers' though are included in disc 2 as additional features.

Disc 2 includes a feature called the 'Employee's manual' Additional spots created to promote the film are included too. Storyboards and drawings from the artists in HD as well as the '100 doors challenge', which is like a trivia game in which based on your responses you will be offered a position in Monsters Inc. Disc 3 as mentioned earlier, is a DVD copy of the movie (in the Mexican edition the 4:3 presentation is included, NOT widescreen) which is great as my kid can have that to watch it as many times as he desires.

Fans of the movie or any Pixar movie should not miss this!",1252540800,63,3018,4.384615384615385

[...]

""Monsters, Inc. saved my life.""

So began a recent meeting of Teletubbies Survivors.

The dad continued quietly, glancing down at his hands as he spoke.  ""Someone gave it to us, used, might even have been on VHS.  I was losing hope, didn't think I'd ever watch anything funny or clever again.  I mean, have you ever seen Barney's Adventure Bus on widescreen HD?  I love you, you love me... I don't think so.""

""But there was Arthur,"" a mom spoke up. ""That show's well written... and funny.  And Sesame Street has its moments.""

""Monsters, Inc. was different,"" the dad said.  ""The characters were likable and interesting.  The humor worked--that opening scene is ingenious--and the plot had real tension.  I didn't know computer animation had progressed that far.""

""What about the ending?"" an older mom volunteered.  ""Talk about emotionally satisfying.  Monsters, Inc. has got to be my favorite movie with either John Goodman or Billy Crystal, and that's saying a lot.""

""Has anyone been to the interactive theater in Disney World?"" another Survivor asked, showing genuine excitement in her voice.  ""It's one of the few things they've added in the past ten years.  Very well done.  Highly recommended.""

""I had a question about something else,"" a dad new to the group spoke up.  ""What was the significance of that vacuum cleaner pet or robot or whatever it was on Teletubbies?""

""Please,"" said the first dad, surprising the others with his volume.  ""Not tonight.  I'm just not up for it.""

""Noo-noo,"" a woman murmured near the back of the room.  ""Noo-noo.""

""Now see what you've done!"" snapped the mom in the seat to her left.  ""Jen's crying.""

""No one wants to think about that part of our lives right now,"" the first dad said.  ""Let's share memories of Monsters, Inc.""

1444942,5,B00005JKDR,"I think that the whole delay is because they're including something else. Previously the info about the package said it was gonna be a 3-Discs edition and now it says it will be 4 discs.

Here at Costa Rica, you can get the 3 Discs Bluray version, with English, French and Spanish audio which includes 2 blurays (one of the movie, and one with extras) and disc 3 is the movie on DVD.

I really don't see the point about including a DVD with the movie if you're getting the same movie on bluray, but I guess is just another way to charge more. I guess 4 disc on the version at amazon will feature a digital copy of  the movie.

I hope is something else than a digital copy disc, because having all you people waiting months and months just for that, I think is not quite fair; specially since the bluray is already available. Also Latin America blurays are zone A just like  USA and Canada, therefore I don't see the point for such delay on Amazon or North America.

Maybe Disney is trying to make more money out of you for the holidays, so think about that!",1251676800,,1057,4.26

1444958,5,B00005JKDR,"I recently re-watched this film (the last time having been when it was int he theaters), and found it just as entertaining to both myself and my child movie-watching companion.

THEN: I went to the theater with two young (6 and 3) boys, who were enthralled throughout.  The younger boy demanded a Boo doll for Hanukkah.

NOW: Watched it at home with my 3 year-old niece whose attention did not waver (and that's a trick) throughout the whole movie.  She was completely committed to finding out what happened to that little girl.

Half the fun of this movie is watching a child watching it, really.

The voices of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, et al. simply enhance the immensely enjoyable and creative storyline.  Comic timing amongst animated actors hardly gets better than this.",1248307200,2,779,4.856060606060606
1444959,5,B00005JKDR,Monsters Inc. is one of my favorite Pixar Disney movies. Sully is a fun lovable monster voiced by John Goodman. Mike is a goofy worrisome monster voiced by Billy Crystal together they make this great movie/team that has you laughing and wanting to have a friend that is with you in everything you do. I love Boo the little girl she is so adorable she loves both of her new friends. This is a movie you can definitely watch as a family or just watch yourself you'll find yourself wanting to watch this movie again and again.,1247529600,,523,4.402061855670103

1444965,5,B00005JKDR,"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too.

Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.

There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too, and I'm anxious to check it out when it comes out on Blu-Ray in several months.",1237680000,,800,4.326666666666667

This movie is very easy to follow for young kids, and has just enough higher brow humor to entertain adults.
It is also a movie with a lot of love (even to different species who in the past were natural ""enemies""), and a good lesson in tolerance for ALL our differences.

1445028,5,B00005JKDR,"I love animated films and Monster Inc. is no exception. It's got great animation, characters and a well thought out story, but it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. Classic monster buffs will catch lots of winks and nods to the days of yesteryear in this irresistible and funny film. It might do your young children good to see this with an adult to help them get over 'the monsters in the closet' syndrome most kids have at a young age.

1445032,5,B00005JKDR,"Ahhhhh, what a wonderful film. Once again, Pixar and Disney have made a true family film well worth watching, with funny (and smart) dialogue, lovable characters and well-casted voice talent, not to mention very original ideas for the plot and a good villain (I don't mean that the villain is a good guy, I mean that the villain's villainy makes him a good villain in a villainous way.)

1445034,5,B00005JKDR,I know the graphics aren't state of art anymore. But the story and the characters make this a great movie for kids & adults. We wore out our first copy and just bought another. Timeless.,1206144000,,186,4.3428571428571425
1445035,5,B00005JKDR,"Excellent Video.  Highly recommend this show for any families with kids.

Even as an adult this show had me laughing and wanting to see more.

The voices of the characters are fantastic.",1204761600,,186,4.75
1445036,5,B00005JKDR,"Like the other Pixar offerings, everything about this film is beautifully constructed, including the characters, the voices, the backgrounds, the music (which won Randy Newman his first Oscar), and not least of all the story.  Pixar spends a lot of time and energy developing deep, textured stories that work on many levels.  Look just beneath the surface, and there might be a message lurking:

Although they're a weird looking bunch, the monsters all have oddly ordinary names, like Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan (""Sully""). They live in houses, go to work each day, and worry about romantic relationships and energy shortages.  Except for outward appearances, they're a lot like us.

To deal with the energy problem, they invade the private territory of small, dark-haired people who don't speak the language (human children), popping out of their closets, intimidating and scaring the ""energy"" out of them in the form of screams.  The monsters are taught that children are toxic, and any contact must be avoided at all costs.  Even a child's sock brought back into the Monster world is enough to trigger a full-scale governmental SWAT team decontamination.

Impatient with the low efficiency of the scare technology, Sully's evil arch-rival, Randall, builds a machine to forcibly suck the scream-energy right from the unwilling mouths of the children. In searching for test subjects, he inadvertently lets the human child, Boo, into the Monster world.

Sully's gradual change of heart towards Boo forms the emotional hook of the story, underscored by Randy Newman's remarkable music.  Sully pays a high price for learning to care about Boo.  His friendship with Mike is tested.  He is banished from his own land.

It doesn't take an advanced degree in geo-politics to draw some obvious inferences about what's going on here, but politics never gets in the way of the story.  The chemistry between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) is a big part of the success of the movie, but the imaginative design and spectacular animation doesn't hurt, either.  The final action sequence is amazing.

The DVDs are full of amusing and informative behind-the-scenes footage.  Both wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film are included in the package.

All of Pixar's films are top-notch, but I think this one is at the top of the heap, bringing together a terrific story, great characters, and spectacular animation.  Five stars doesn't do it justice.",1203552000,,2466,5.150753768844221
1445037,5,B00005JKDR,"The movie is terrific just by itself, but the extras really make it worth picking up. The ""outtakes"" and ""Mike's New Car"" are fun, even if they are short.

The film itself has great visuals and style. One of my favorite Pixars.",1201824000,,227,4.404761904761905
1445058,5,B00005JKDR,"This is such a cute movie. It is well worth owning on Disk. It is not scary. I found it to keep the attention of my 10 year old daughter as well as my 2 year old nephew. This is a direction most fantasy movies have not taken before. I am glad that Disney did this piece.

The graphics are so real you feel like you can actually pet Sully's back. When it was made it was ahead of its time in quality of graphics. I think it continues to be one of the most realistic cartoons to date.",1200096000,,482,3.8686868686868685
1445059,5,B00005JKDR,"This is one of my favorite movies ever because I still laugh at the jokes and it's still entertaining.  It is not childish whatsoever, even though every one will love it!

1445060,5,B00005JKDR,"This is an awesome movie. My son wanted to watch it every night for a solid month, and I didn't mind because it was funny. And not just the silly child humor, but Billy Crystal funny (he played Mike or googly bear).

There are just a few scary scenes for the little ones, that I jump through. But other than that, it is such a pleasure to have a movie the children like that I enjoy too. Especially after you've seen it 100 times!",1194566400,,430,4.119047619047619
1445061,3,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. had much potential and could have been better in the hands of someone like Tim Burton, or even someone imitating his style. As it was this movie was merely ""all right"" and isn't one that will endear itself to too many people. Who knew, though, that all those closet monsters and below-bed beings worked for a good cause? And who says the movies have nothing to teach us?",1194307200,,384,4.5
1445062,2,B00005JKDR,"For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI-type ""classics"" like Toy Story I, Bugs Life, etc).  Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent aggression, and usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these ""modern kids classics.""---comments and demands like ""WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!"" (courtesy of ""Bugs Life""); ""YOU'RE STUPID!""; ""YOU IDIOT"" (Toy Story); ""YOU STINK""....and the like.  Even the brilliant (for adults, that is) Monsters, Inc. has the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing each other (especially by the villain Randall, who viciously threatens and tries to Kill the protagonist at the end, snarling ""STUPID"" at him, etc).  Maybe ""Finding Nemo"" is the least objectionable of the bunch.  In retrospect, all the Disney movies in our collection are safe, tame, and benign by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc).  I wish we'd stuck to safer products for toddlers, like the afore-mentioned Disney titles, or The Wiggles, Baby Einstein, Bob the Builder, etc.  I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting-edge, any day!  Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later from others? No one wants their kid to be the FIRST SOURCE of the poor habits and language being adopted by the other kids in the neighborhood and amongst the extended family.
The golden rule now in our house: If the adults enjoy it, and it's not tedious and boring, it's probably inappropriate for kids!",1193270400,22,1701,5.250922509225092
1445063,5,B00005JKDR,I took a chance with this one as I hadn't previously seen it when I ordered it. It has quickly become my 2 year olds 2nd favorite movie to watch (2nd to Finding Nemo). This is one that I also enjoy watching with her and we watch it over and over. I love that it shows monsters in the closet as being friendly monsters with fears of their own. My daughter will sit and watch this movie in length and actually pay attention. Great addition to her movie library.,1192579200,2,459,4.168539325842697
1445064,4,B00005JKDR,"This is, what, six years old? Still, for those of us who are kids at heart (and who grew up with monsters under the bed and in the closet), this is a very good rememberance of childhood, and a good tale for the kids of today that the ""bump in the night"" probably is a dream. I recommend it.",1190073600,,290,3.9322033898305087
1445065,5,B00005JKDR,"It was that good!  Unfortunately they didn't leave a door open for a sequel.  Great story about the Monsters all little kids fear in their bed at night, and their interaction with those kids.  It gives you the persepective from the other side of your closet door where the Monsters live.  The characters are very lovable.  Great, great comedy sequences, you will be laughing out loud!  Unique story line. ""Loving"" out-come.  Enjoy!",1182988800,,431,4.902777777777778
1445066,5,B00005JKDR,"This movie was great and it was really enjoyable and funny. I have had this movie since it came out as I went to see it in the movie theater.  This would be my favorite movie of all time. Sulley(James P. Sullivan) and Mike Wazowski (the main characters of this movie) are my favorite characters in this movie and are my two favorite characters in any movie. Randall Boggs would be my third favorite character in the movie because he makes me LAUGH!! But he gets destroyed into a trailor during my favorite part of the movie which is when Mike and Sulley are hanging or flying on doors to try to get Boo home. Boo is my least favorite character in this movie because she CRIES a lot during the movie and just not my favorite. Celia, who Mike is in love with isn't all that great too. But I think Roz is great. She makes me laugh when she tells Mike that he didn't turn in his paperwork. and Mr. Waternoose would be my 5th and last most favorite character in this movie till he gets arrested by the CDA. Also, the part where Mike and Sulley go to Himalayas is great because they're in a BLIZZARD!! The worst part of the movie is when Sulley and Mike take Boo home that's when I feel to cry. But overall, this is a really great movie which I wish I could give this 10 stars. Please get this movie but Shrek s$cked!!!
Best film of the year.",1182384000,,1336,4.178294573643411
1445067,5,B00005JKDR,"Some of the best stories for children have presented their worst fears only to have the menace brought down to size.  ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" works that way perfectly.  'Monsters, Inc.' helps to tuck the kiddies in and give them the giggles, too.  Taking near day-glow colors, the Monsters in this fluid Pixar picture are hideously cute.  They live in a ""green"" world where the renewable resource of children's fright powers the Monster community.  Looking like the sorts in (Lucas Films, Ltd. is credited here) a 'Star Wars' bar scene, the film's focus is on the power company where the employees go through magic doors, their portals to children's bedrooms where the fright factor generates their power plant.

Heading the troops is big blue ""Sully"" (John Goodman) a good natured monster, proud of his ability to be the equivalent of ""Employee of the Month"".  Keeping track of his generating power, he is out to set a plant record.  His green, one-eyed sidekick, Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) has a Martian appearance, but his voice couldn't scare a mouse.  He is smitten by one-eyed purple princess, Shroopsy with hydra hair (snake braids).  They all face their competition with rascally Randall, (perfectly villainous, Steve Buscemi) the salamander-like monster with invisible capabilities.  Pivotal to the plot is Mr. Waternoose, (James Coburn) a tycoon who resembles a tarantula in a three-piece suit.  In the causality is 'Silkwood'-like contamination if any child or remnant remains in the Monster world.  (In other words:  Just like parents often say about insects or some animals:  ""They're more afraid of [children], than [they] are of them."")  Sully and James come across ""Boo"" whom they find in their best interests to return to the dark realm of her own bedroom.

Formidable to the fore, 'Monsters,..."" takes a premise that could have been a dumb non-starter, and provides supporting plot structures with enough heft to turn the adventure on.  With Pixar animation, the movement is flowing enough to take the technological edge off the look, and Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson's screenplay keep the dialogue fresh and funny.  Director Pete Docter gives the movie proper assembly.  'Monsters, Inc.' is therapeutically good for children's dreamscapes as well as their funny bones.

Wow!! What a great movie this is. This is by far my favorite movie due to the presence of Mike and Sulley. There is not a lot of great movies out there, but this one is one of the very best!!

It's sometimes easy to forget John Lassiter's outfit were the architects of the current CGI driven animation we take for granted today in features such as Happy Feet. For me Monsters Inc. is benchmark for the company since the script equally matches the ground breaking animation (Sully's fur, for example).

The rapport between Billy Crystal and John Goodman bursts out of their respective Mike and Sully characters.

This classic tale takes the monster in the closet premise and turns it into a face paced, quick-firing one liner fest with a deep sense of emotion.

1445168,5,B00005JKDR,"What if there actually were monsters in the closet, but their goal was to capture your screams to power their world?  While the plot sounds silly, the execution is hilarious.

James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan, voiced by John Goodman, and Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal, are the leaders in obtaining the highest quantities of screams at the factory.  Life seems to be going well for the buddies.  Mike is in love with Celia, voiced by the sultry Jennifer Tilly.  Sulley is the favorite of boss Henry J. Waternoose III, voiced by classy veteran actor James Coburn in one of his last roles.  Life could hardly be better until co-worker Randall Boggs, voiced by Steve Buscemi, leaves a door in the factory and Sulley steps through it to find Boo, as he names the ultimately charming little girl that follows him through the door.

What follows is one of the funniest movies of 2001, animated or otherwise.  Pixar Animation did an outstanding job of animated the monsters throughout this film, and the chase scene through the door factory has to be seen to be believed.

Winner of 11 major awards, including an Oscar, and nominated for 29 other awards, this movie has a visual power that will captivate young and old audiences alike.  The two-disc collector's edition includes hours and hours of extras.  As with most two-disc editions, some of the extras were great, some were good, and many I skipped through because I was uninterested.

""Monsters, Inc."" is a rare family film that is suitable for all but the youngest members of the family.  The animation is superb, the acting is great, and the storyline is creative.

Whoever thought this whole thing up should have gotten a very large raise. The story arcs nicely, with the viewer getting attached to Boo, the little human girl, as Sulley does.

1445170,4,B00005JKDR,"The writer's of this story had to be on some serious ""mind-blowing"" drugs.

The concept here is so original.  No other movie, ever, has invented a story of incredible uniqueness, such as this.

Imagine, a power plant.  And how it runs is by monster's going through doors, to go into children's room's and scaring them in their sleep.  The screams of the children fill cylinders that are attached to the door's outside.  The louder the scream, the more power has been collected.  Monster's compete with each other to become ""scarer of the month"".  And the power plant employees (the monsters) all have to avoid contamination. Which, in this case, is having the children they scare or any of the children's belongings (socks, toys, etc.) touch them.

I believe that this film was made for an adult audience.  Not that it's vulgar or suggestive, but only because of it's about a power plant (something that children wouldn't care about).  And all the basic routines of working at a power plant that may obviously be far beyond a typical child's comprehension.

This film is so ""out there!""  I absolutely love it.  And it looks so good on a high-definition TV and my high definition digital-to-digital HDMI DVD player.  It's a great demonstration DVD for my awesome new TV.",1143331200,2,1269,4.810185185185185

1445191,5,B00005JKDR,"As a child, who is not fearful of a big, scary monster opening your closet door and eating you alive?  Ironically, these intimidating monsters are more afraid of the children they are scaring than the children are of them.

 Pixar's Monsters, Inc., directed by Peter Docter, David Silverman, and Lee Unkrich, puts a spin on the original idea of monsters inside your closet.  I greatly enjoy this comedic movie full of laughs and tears especially because of the characters' qualities and creativity.

 In this movie, James P. Sullivan, played by John Goodman, and his sidekick Mike Wazowski, played by Billy Crystal, work at a factory called Monsters Inc. that turns screams into energy.  Everyday life depends on children's hairs standing up in the town of Monstropolis.  One day, James P. Sullivan, the best scarer at this factory, accidentally lets in a little girl that he later name Boo.  Although children are supposed to be toxic and dangerous to monsters, both Mike and James P. Sullivan, nicknamed Sulley, find that no harm comes from these little people.  Boo, played by Mary Gibbs, has now entered a world unfamiliar to her where she poses a great threat.  With her two monster friends, Boo is ready for any problems she might face.

 Because of characters like Boo, Sulley, and Mike, Monsters, Inc. keeps me captivated and emotional.  Anyone can relate Mike's comedic flair, Boo's vivaciousness, or Sulley's friendliness.  Even from the beginning of the movie, Mike wakes up Sulley by saying, ""Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m. in the big monster city. Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles, and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in, or simply... work out that flab that's hanging over the bed!""

 In addition, I love the originality that this movie possesses.  I have to give acknowledgment to the writers of this film.  They did a wonderful job of being imaginative, and coming up with such a complex world full of monsters.  I especially like the scene when both Sulley and Mike are in the locker room and Mike asks for ""odorant.""  With his choices of smell being smelly garbage, old dumpster, or wet dog, Mike chooses wet dog, and Sulley responds by saying, ""stink it up.""

 Overall, I absolutely love this movie and never get sick of watching it.  I especially like the fact that this movie is fit for the whole family to watch together.

 Who knew that to the creatures inside our closets think of us as the monsters that could hurt them with just a single touch?",1133481600,3,2599,4.758389261744966
1445192,3,B00005JKDR,"I'm not sure what it is specifically about me anymore, but animated films just don't have any magic. When you were young, you used to believe anything & everything you saw on screen. But now, not so much. Is it just me? I chose this film simply because I couldn't get past a guy at the time, and I spotted this. My dad loves these kinda films.

The cast has a whole host of famous voices, which you'll have to watch the credits to work out who they are, and then kick yourself, cos you knew who they were all along. They include: Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and Bonnie Hunt, amongst many more.

I didn't like the characters much in this movie, although the little girl, Boo, reminded me so much of Christina Ricci (say it right!) in Mermaids. I have no idea why.

The end credits are quite funny, with the list of babies born during the production, no monsters were harmed in the making of this motion picture, and outtakes as well.

But the best thing about this DVD? The hilarious short film, From The Birds. I CRIED during this, it was so funny - it got an Oscar as well. I've already watched this short film three times, it's the best thing about this entire DVD. I'd definitely buy this DVD (but probably for my Dad's DVD collection) so I can keep watching this hilarious short. I actually had to pause it during, just so I could calm myself down & stop watching it. I even bought a little mobile phone charm, as it reminds me of the birds in the film.

Overall, there is a few funny moments during the film, but otherwise, it was alright. Not really my kinda film, but obviously something was telling me to borrow it, so I can see the brilliance that is From The Birds.",1131753600,,1718,4.339563862928349
1445263,5,B00005JKDR,"The folks at Pixar can do no wrong with Monsters, Inc., the studio's fourth feature film, which stretches the computer animation format in terms of both technical complexity and emotional impact. The giant, blue-furred James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (wonderfully voiced by John Goodman) is a scare-monster extraordinaire in the hidden world of Monstropolis, where the scaring of kids is an imperative in order to keep the entire city running. Beyond the competition to be the best at the business, Sullivan and his assistant, the one-eyed Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), discover what happens when the real world interacts with theirs in the form of a 2-year-old baby girl dubbed ""Boo,"" who accidentally sneaks into the monster world with Sulley one night. Director Pete Doctor and co-directors David Silverman and Lee Unkrich follow the Pixar (Toy Story) blueprint with an imaginative scenario, fun characters, and ace comic timing. By the last heart-tugging shot, kids may never look at monsters the same, nor artists at what computer animation can do in the hands of magicians.",1129680000,,1075,5.255813953488372
1445264,5,B00005JKDR,"If Cars is good, which I hope it is cause trailers don't make it look good, then Monsters Inc is probably my least favorite Pixar film. But of course like the saying goes, it's not my favorite but it's still good. It just doesn't have the hilarity of Toy Story 2, the amazing technical ability of Finding Nemo or the energy of the Incredibles. In the end, Monsters Inc is like films such as Bambi or Dumbo, they're not funny but they still entertain us regardless.

In the world of Monstropolis, their power comes not from traditional electricity but from childrens' screams turned into energy. So we have ""scarers"", monsters who use a vast supply of doors that lead into a child's bedroom and literally scare the kids to get the screams. Only problem is kids are getting really hard to scare. Top scarer Sulley working late one night finds a door left behind, and a kid. And monsters have been conditioned to believe kids are dangerous so he tries avoiding her only she's really attached to him.

Only he can't really bring her back because Sulley's rival Randall is after her. Helping out Sulley is Mike, his assistant, and figuring out how to bring ""Boo"" back to her own room without being detected. This leads to an impressive animation sequence where they see just where all the doors are.

The film may not be as funny as previous entries(or for that matter, the next 2) but it's certainly got a warmth and heart to it, something definately lacking in today's animation films. Pretty much bringing all the charm almost single-handedly is ""Boo"", the girl who ends up in Monster world. Speaking in baby talk and a word now and then, she's certainly the kind of child you'd want to have. Billy Crystal plays Mike and he's got that manic voice going on that Robin Williams did in Aladdin(and again in Robots).

One thing that is a sight to watch is the technical aspect of the animation. One scene early on when Mike and Sulley walk to work certainly looks vibrant and colorful and Sulley's hair looks great plus the aforementioned ""door room"". The humans are certainly looking better too, the Toy Story humans definately looked odd but they've gotten better, with their best probably being their last film, the Incredibles.

The only one I'm missing for Pixar films on DVD is Toy Story 2 and of course that comes out boxing day(and obviously Cars but that's not even in theatres out, here's hoping it's good) but this film certainly is good, even if you have a child(ren) or not.",1129420800,,2482,4.631818181818182

I recommend this film to anyone with kids, and even those of us that are just young at heart! Pixar did an excellent job on this one,... but don't they always?!",1122768000,,408,4.049382716049383
1445329,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters, Inc.""? You want me to talk about ""Monsters, Inc.""? All right, we will. ""Monsters, Inc."", Pixar's fantastic and wacky comedy (its fourth movie), is one of the funniest movies ever made, animated or live-action. It's got elements of the Marx Bros., Mel Brooks, Chaplin and Looney Tunes. It has some of the goofiest-looking characters ever- no two monsters are alike. It has some of the best voice work ever, from big names like John Goodman and Billy Crystal to tiny, 3-year-old (at the time) Mary Gibbs. It has a most original story line, some snazzy designs, a warm kid-friendly message that's refreshing rather than gooey, and guaranteed laugh-out-loud gags that even leave this sober-sided writer rolling on the floor.

  The ""Monsters, Inc."" story is well-known, but on the off-chance you've never seen it (for shame!), here it is: Welcome to Monstropolis, the only city in the world where humans are poisonous. Most of its inhabitants work at Monsters, Inc., the giant corporation that produces the city's energy by means of clean ""scream power"": the reaction by frightened kids hidden behind electronic doors! A team of ""scarers"", assisted by their door operators, create the screams, and if you have so much as a baby bootie on your body, it's time for the CDA (Child Detection Agency) to roar into the plant with a full shutdown by its headless yellow robots. James P. (Sulley) Sullivan, a huge blue furry creature, is the star of the scare floor, with help from his motormouthed green eyeball partner, Mike Wazowski. These are the characters voiced by Goodman and Crystal, respectively, and two of the greatest animated characters ever created.

  All you-know-what breaks loose after a stray after-hours door is opened and a very cute little girl, who has maybe a five-word vocabulary, sneaks into the MI plant. The sequence where Sulley barges into a sushi bar (run by octopi) and the kid pops out of a bag is one of the funniest things you'll ever see- it's a ""Kid-Tastrophe"", as a hysterical Muppet-ish TV announcer says.

Soon, Sulley and Mike discover that ""Boo"", as they nickname the girl, is really a friend, and that people are not poisonous. For the rest, you'll have to watch it, and I'm one who could watch this every night.

  If you own just one Pixar DVD, ""Monsters, Inc."" is the one to get, not just because the movie itself is fantastic, but so is the bonus disc. Team Pixar has a great time showing off all their computer, animation and voice tricks with everything from storyboards to early sketches (Sulley was originally dubbed

""James P. Johnson"" and was orange). There are foreign-language clips (watch one five-minute sequence dubbed into everything from Polish to Portuguese- Lisboan and Brazilian), musical portions (Randy Newman's playful Dixieland-ish score and his theme song, sung in character by Crystal and Goodman, won him a long-awaited Oscar), even guest appearances by Sulley and Mike on everything from the ABC Monday Night Football opening to something called ""Ponkickies"" (an animated Japanese kiddie breakfast TV show). More than any other Pixar DVD package, the extras are a great show in themselves, satisfying everyone from the tiny tots to the grown-up animation geeks. For that matter, so does the movie.

  I don't know anyone who doesn't love ""Monsters, Inc."", and when you're done with it, you, too, will want your very own one-eyed green Mike to hang out with and do your errands. You'll also have a carload of catchwords (""Put-That-Thing-Right-Back-Where-It-Came-From-Or-So-Help-Me!...The Musical!"") in your head and a great understanding of how, and why, Pixar truly brought animation into the new millennium. Best of all, this movie really is fun for all from three to 93. ""Monsters, Inc."": it's a scream!",1122163200,,3776,5.04983922829582

1445332,5,B00005JKDR,"It's nighttime. Your mom gives you a good night kiss and closes the door. Quietly you try to sleep when suddenly you feel a creak in the door. The closet opens and a monster comes out to steal you a scream

.

For you it's a nightmare. To the monster it's a way to produce some energy. And that's the premise of Monsters Inc.

The Monster City is located at the other side of the closet. Diverse and weird creatures wander on the streets in their daily routines, most of them without interacting with the humans. A particular company, Monsters Inc., transforms children's nighttime screams in energetic resources to keep the city working properly.

Monsters Inc staff is trained to scare, and no one is better than James Sullivan ""Sully"" (John Goodman), who alongside Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal, a riot) is the best team of energy collectors in the company

Monsters must avoid contact with the children, because they think children are contagious (genius premise); neither can allow them to go to the monster world, since they can't predict what horrible consequences would follow.

And exactly that's what happens. A little girl goes through the door and sends Mike and Sully in an unprecedented adventure.

Filled with honest laughs, warm and funny, Monsters is a charming movie with a story as original as their predecessor, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.

In this adventure, Pixar once again pushes the excellence level in animated movies, using 2.5 million render marks, compared with the 1.1 used in Toy Story. Such accomplishments are obvious and admirable, especially in sequences where you can see clearly the blue skin of Sully in movement with the air, Boo's hair or the wonderful facial expressions of Mike.

This is a happy movie, full of joy and a good lesson. Fear creates power, but a negative one, which inhibits people (and monsters). But, as our character discovers, there are other kinds of power, much stronger, like a good laugh, to deal with our ""inner demons"" and come out winners in life.

Now about the DVD, I have to say that comes with great extras and bonus.",1118793600,,2087,4.804469273743017
1445333,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters Inc"" is an incredibly refreshing and halarious animated film which blends original plotlines, beautiful colours, a haralious screenplay and important messages together. Personally, ""Monsters Inc"" is my favourite Pixar movie yet, simply because of its wittyness and ability to engrip the audience into the world behind the bedroom closet.

Monstropolis is the city of Monsters, concealed from the human world by the cupboards of children's bedrooms. Their way of life is dependant on the use of children's screams, to which provides electricity and power. The corperation, Monsters Incorperated is responsible for gathering these screams from these ""highly toxic"" children - ""a single touch from a human child could kill you!"" - by scaring them wittless. It is here where we meet Sully (voice of John Goodman), a teddy-bear like monster who is the most successful ""scarer"" in the company. Ironically, when a human girl crawls into his world, he develops an attatchment to her. Sully, along with his halarious one-eyed pal Mike (voice of Billy Crystal), embark on a race against time to return ""Boo"" (as she is nicknamed) back to her rightful human world before the evil monsters get her instead.

It is a truly delightful film. Here, Pixar has moulded their Monsters of all different shapes, colours, skin types, and sizes to have human-like qualities; imagine the human world and its ways of working, except the humans are played by monsters! It is this irony that gives ""Monsters Inc"" its originality.

The famous 3D animation of Pixar is always absolutely brilliant. Each monster is unique, and the settings are simply devine. A particular mind-boggling scene is when the main characters Sully, Mike and Boo are on a roller-coaster like journey in the place where all the children's doors of the world are stored. It is an absolutely riveting scene! How the animators managed it is beyond me! The animation of Boo is also delightful, in that she is represented to convey the utmost innoncence and cuteness of a 2-year-old toddler.

The screenplay, in typical Pixar fashion is halarious and enjoyable, offering puns for both its childhood and adult demographs. Almost every scene has a joke and adds extra strength to the overall film. Billy Crystal's character Mike is a wonderful, funny character, who lights up every scene. A film that can appeal equally to all ages is an excellent one, and ""Monsters Inc"" certainly successes here.

And finally, as well as being undeniably funny, it also has, as all children's films should, powerful messages which are portrayed subtly in the film. The film teaches us to look beyond appearances and see the inner beauty of something. You shouldn't follow what other people say, because more than likely it's not true. And finally, and more importantly, it teaches us not to bully people, because it's going to come back to haunt you. Live life positively, seeing the quality in the poeple around you, and yourself.

So in conclusion, ""Monsters Inc"" is my favourite Pixar animation because it is such a wonderful breath of fresh air. By mixing exquisite animation, appealing comedy for all ages and possessing important messages, this is a simply stunning film. It opens to the door to a new centurt of animation.",1117756800,3,3263,5.067039106145251
1445334,4,B00005JKDR,"Monstropolis is experiencing a power shortage. They use the screams of human children to power their city. But the numbers are off and Monsters, Inc. is really pushing the people who work on the scare floor to create more energy. James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) is the current leader. A large, fuzzy bear-type creature with horns, Sulley works with Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a round green guy with one eye. As a team, they are the current leaders. Randall (Stave Buscemi) is consumed with jealous rage and wants to be the top earner. Everyone in Monstropolis has been taught that the human children they scare are also toxic to the monsters. This leads more than a few monsters to become afraid of them and quickly call of the visit. One night, after everyone has gone home, Sulley revisits the scare floor and finds that a door to a child's room has been left behind. He pokes his head in and sees nothing. When he returns to the scare floor, he finds that the little girl who lives in the room has grabbed onto his fur. He nicknames her Boo and has to figure out a way to get her back home without causing the city to becomes panicked.

""Monsters, Inc."", the newest film from Pixar, is a brilliant addition to their library. Directed by newcomer, Peter Docter, a John Lassiter protg, the film starts with a brilliant concept, adds a delightful screenplay and tops it off with some of the best computer animation yet.

Much like the previous Pixar films, the attention to detail in ""Monsters, Inc."" is simply staggering. Monstropolis is basically any large American city, down to the power crisis and potential rolling blackouts. The only difference is that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes. The buildings are given brick detail, the cars are given grills, the interior of Monsters, Inc. has a large lobby. It makes it seem very real. The attention given to the characters is actually even more impressive. Sulley's fur coat seems to be very real and life-like. Every strand of fur seems to move individually. In a couple of scenes, his coat is buffeted by wind and seems to ripple like waves. His facial expressions are also very good and exhibit a whole range of emotions. Mike, the little round assistant, is given more of a goofball comic look, fitting the voice that Billy Crystal uses. His eye and mouth movements are very expressive and help to create an impressive character. Every monster has a different look; Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the girl Mike has a crush on, looks like a sort of Medusa slug, Mr. Waternoose (James Coburn), the head of Monsters, Inc. looks like a crab. This level of inventiveness never fails to amaze the viewer.

The story is very involving, providing amusement for the adults while the kiddies are amused by the animation. The story opens with a little boy going to bed, as his parents close the bedroom door. Immediately, his eyes widen as he imagines the closet door open a crack and a shadow flowing from it. It turns out to be pajama sleepers, hanging on the inside. Then, a monster appears, ready to frighten the child, only to get frightened by the child instead. But all of this is actually happening in a simulator in Monsters, Inc., to train the monsters about frightening the children. The method used for getting into the children's bedrooms is very inventive. The story involving Boo, the human child is also very amusing. A chase through various children's doors is also an amusing highlight. Just these few elements represent more thought and inventiveness than that which is invested in most other Hollywood films.

There are also a lot of jokes aimed at keeping adults occupied. First of all, the entire film is basically a tribute to baby boomers. Everything in Monstropolis is growing old and weathered. It is the children of today, harder to scare because they are desensitized, that are the problem. The children of the baby boomers are the problem, inferring that the baby boomer period was just fine for Monstropolis.

Ultimately, ""Monsters, Inc."" has a message or moral and it is presented in such a way that all viewers can get the message and retain it. The message isn't rammed down our throats and forced upon us.

""Monsters, Inc."" is an enjoyable film for everyone in the family. The characters, animation and story will surely win over everyone who watches it. 4  stars.",1113264000,,4369,4.755936675461742

Monsters Inc. represents Pixar's most original story so far, and what we are treated with is a hilarious look at what it's like on the other side of the closet. Monstropolis is on the other side, where the two main characters Sully and Mike live. They work for Monsters Inc., where the scariest monsters are matched to their ideal kids and they scare them. This provides the energy for all of Monstropolis. Sully(voiced by John Goodman) is the top scarer at the company and Mike is his assistant. Randall, another monster, is Sully's biggest competition and will do anything to beat Sully. So one day when Randall tries to cheat his way to the top, something goes wrong--a child gets through the door into Monstropolis! Humans must never touch Monsters because they are thought to carry germs (23-19, 23-19!). Sully and Mike are then plunged into a hilarious and touching adventure.

1445378,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters Inc"" gives one explanation.  You see, in a city called Monstropolous, their electrical power is generated by kid's screams. The monsters are actually more afraid of the children than the children are of the monsters.

And that, folks, is the problem.

As kids get more and more sophisticated, it's harder to scare them.  Monsters are working hard to make sure they have the power to keep their city running.  Sully (John Goodman) and his buddy Mike (Billy Crystal) are top-runners for the Scare Record, but they have stiff competition.

Then, somehow, a kid gets loose in Monstropolous.  Sully and Mike take charge of her, but can they get her back to her home without being found out---or having her harmed?

1445382,5,B00005JKDR,"Ok, I am watching Monsters Inc. on ABC right now on ""over the air"" digital television (DTV).  I guess it is the world broadcast premier and presented by The Wonderful World of Disney.

The animation is psychadelic-like, almost like bright colorful liquid.  In terms of a movie that older people can identify with, this is better than Finding Nemo, also a great movie.

  Wow.  I'll probably buy the DVD.

ABC and The Wonderful World of Disney have done an amazing job with this transfer into high definition (who knows the original movie might have been created in HDTV to begin with).

On the delightful side, it is one good story, it dazzlingly  us with amazing animation and a level of character development seldom seen in real movies.  On the insightful side, it deals with the terror that all of us face, the terror of the unknown.

It would be a serious mistake to call this a childrens movie.  Although my grandchildren have probably watched it a dozen times, it is a movie that us adults will truly enjoy.  Monsters Inc.  address adult issues, namely, our fear of the unknown.  The monsters are just as fearful of the children as the children are of them. It is only through fear and intimidation of the children can the monsters do their job  . .  .supply scream-power for the power plants that supply energy to their monster world.

Although each world lives in fear of the other, they have more in common that the differences that seem so readily apparent.  Each world desires to live in peace, each world wants love and acceptance, but it is only through the use of terror can the monster world survive, or so they think.

This is a movie about overcoming the prejudices that keep us apart as human beings.  But thankfully, it did not degenerate to a kum-by-ya feel good movie with simplistic politically correct answers for what ails the human race; rather, it shows us that acceptance of our differences takes work and that no matter how good our intentions and motives are, there will always be some who succumb to hatred and prejudice.

1445428,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monster's, Inc."" combines a fantastic cast, cutting edge imagination, and a tender storyline into a wonderful, delightful family film . . . it may even cure the nighttime frights of your wee ones!
Most of us were scared stiff at some point in our childhood by the spooky, imaginary ""monsters in the closet,"" usually after we've read ""Where the Wild Things Are"" for the first time.  ""Monsters, Inc."" plays on that near-universal fear by creating a rational explanation -- monsters live in a parallel universe, connected to ours by closet doors, and they power their land by the energy contained in human screams.  Makes perfect sense!
Sulley (the hilarious John Goodman) is a celebrity in Monstropolis as the leading scare-getter for Monster's, Inc.  Sulley is generally a lovable big blue yeti-bear-creature, but he can be quite terrifying.  Blissfully unaware of the terror he unleashes, he enjoys his job.  Basking in Sulley's reflected glory is his sidekick and assistant, Mike Waznowski (Billy Crystal, perfect as ever).  Mike is a lime-green-yellow glob with one giant eye and an even larger mouth.  He helps Sulley get the screams and stay one step ahead of the competition.
And the competition is fierce.  The dragon-chameleon Boggs (Steve Buscemi, suitably creepy without being too scary for the kids) is right on Sulley's heels to be the scream champion, and he's willing to go to any lengths to beat his nemesis.
All is well in Monstropolis until Boo, a human child, accidentally finds her way through the closet and into Monstropolis.  It seems that as scared as kids are of monsters, the monsters are equally scared of the kids -- their touch (allegedly) brings death and ruin.  (This misunderstanding leads to great comic scenes as X-Files-type HAZMAT crews invade every time there's a kid sighting, usually to the woe of the monster who has seemingly been infected by the kid!)
Like all Pixar films, the glories are in the details.  Check out the gentle satire of Hollywood celebrity culture, of mindless bureaucracy, and the perils of romance in the office.  The animation is also wonderful -- Pixar continues to evolve with every picture.  For example, Sulley's fuzzy hair is fully articulated as he zooms through various escapades.
The story is fast-paced, with enough jokes to keep the adults laughing . . . which is good, 'cause your kids will likely keep throwing this into the DVD player.
Speaking of the DVD -- there are lots of fun extras on this two-disc set.  Personal favorites include the fake ""outtakes,"" similar to those at the end of ""A Bug's Life,"" a short film featuring Mike showing Sulley his new hi-tech car (with hilarious consequences), and an Oscar-winning short film, ""For the Birds,"" which shows how funny animation can be, even in short doses.  There are additional extras that will keep the kiddies occupied for hours.

The scariest part I felt was the part where they were trying to suck the screams out of Boo and the rest.

1445489,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters Inc"" gets my nod as my favorite of the trainload of CGI animated features that Pixar has brought forth during this great time for animated movies versus the awful period for music. ""Toy Story"" paved the way for these movies but I never thought it would happen but ""Monster's Inc"" does the unthinkable, it actually surpasses ""Toy Story"" not only in the excellent animation but also of groundbreaking graphics (Sully's Fur) and of a really, REALLY original story idea. I guess it's safe to say that this movie made me conquer my fear of going into the closets at night and if there are monsters, I'm no longer afraid of them. Just for a little humor. I haven't laughed so hard the way I did with seeing ""Monster's Inc"" and it's hard not to see why. That's why I love Pixar's movies. They aim for all ages from young children to elderly audiences and ""Monsters Inc"" is the best of them all alongside ""Finding Nemo"". The whole story plot idea is unbelievably original and unsurpassed by many movies since this one.
It all begins with a typical night with a monster who aims to scare a sleeping child by creeping out of the closet. The whole thing goes awry and turns out to be a simulation and we discover the reasons why monsters actually come out of closets and scare the children of the human world. The Monsters scare the children because they need to collect the children's screams to a utility power plant where the screams generate electricity for their city of Monstropolis. However the city of Monstropolis is facing a looming power shortage because the children of the human world are becoming harder and harder to scare and thus brownouts are becoming more and more commonplace, threatening the very well being of the monster world. The problems don't stop there. While the top scarer of the monster crew James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) continues his winning streak as the number one scarer, a nemesis co-worker named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is also causing some headaches. The CEO of the company Henry J. Waternoose is also ready to use any means to keep his company from collapsing from the power crisis gripping Monstropolis.
The main storyline though is of a much more chaotic incident. According to Waternoose's warnings, the humans possibly carry germs that may be deadly for monsters to become infected with and the crews take drastic measures to avoid getting touched by the humans that they try to scare. One night, as Sullivan is going to turn in his assistant Mike Wazowski's paperwork and finds a door that is activated. He opens it and unaware of it, a toddler escapes through the door and right into the monster factory. Unable to get her back into her right bedroom, Sullivan attempts to disguise her but fails and as utter pandemonium follows, and vast numbers of C.D.A. (Child Detection Agency) decontamination units scouring the city for the missing child, Sullivan along with his longtime friend Mike Wazowski are on a long quest to get Boo home without being caught by the C.D.A. Sully and Mike however are unaware that they have several enemies that are working within their own ranks which make their mission to return Boo home more complicated and more dangerous.
 The computer generated animation effects are absolutely breathtaking in just aobut every way you look at it. The animation effects of Sullivan's turquoise blue fur is so well done that it looks almost like actual live footage of a costume. Even the movements look incredibly lifelike and the details in the movie are just incredible! This movie is just about perfect in so many ways. If there is any quibble I have aobut this movie, it's that it's only 90 minutes long. Perhaps I'm spoiled at the movie lengths after seeing the Lord of The Rings movies but I think ""Monsters Inc"" should've been at least two hours long for more fun but that's just my opinion.
 The actors selected for the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters they provided the voice work for. The late James Coburn perfectly fitted the elderly role of the longtime elder Henry J. Waternoose, CEO of the Monsters Incorporated Company which his family has owned for three generations and it's really sad that Coburn moved on so soon after such a great movie. My favorite of all is of John Goodman who provides the stadium sized voice of the great James P. Sullivan, the top scarer of the Monsters Inc. workforce. He sounds so incredibly funny when he screams especially during when he discovers Boo has escaped into the factory. Billy Crystal is incredibly awesome playing Sullivan's constantly agitated assistant and lifelong friend Mike Wazowski and his voice is perfectly especially when Wazowski is uptight about things. Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, they're all great.
 While younger viewers will certainly have a great time with the charm factor of this movie, older audiences will likely get a truly good message of about how even fearsome-looking creatures or human beings can in reality turn out being very gentle and caring beings who wouldn't even hurt a fly. And while I don't believe that monsters necessarily exist in most places, this movie also explains the reasons why monsters do this, scaring the daylights out of the sleeping children, they need their screams to power their cities but the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them.
 Enough said, go and buy this DVD as soon as you can. This is one of the greatest animated movies that has ever been made and the crew behind it's conception deserve the utmost praise for it's creation.",1076371200,2,5611,4.81139896373057
1445490,4,B00005JKDR,"Talk about a success story! Ask any normal movie-goer before 1995 who Pixar was, they would have given you a direct blank stare. In fact, unless you were well familiar with animated shorts, you would be hard pressed to find an average Joe who really knew that such an animation facility was in operation. After 1995 and the prodigious success of their first full-length animated venture, Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios grew with tremendous strength partnering with Walt Disney Pictures in distributing their future animated films. That deal is now in serious question on whether it will be renewed or will result in the parting of the two studios. On Disney's side, the executives may be leaning more and more toward giving in to Pixar's demands considering the animation studio's features have brought in a combined $600 million domestically alone and recouping their budgets with each release. This is opposite to several of Disney's animated feature films such as Fantasia 2000, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire that have failed to meet expectations. What happens with the two studios after this may hinder on the success or failure of Monsters Inc.
The story center around the misadventures of two monsters that create havoc in the secret monster city. James P. Sullivan works for Monsters Inc., a company that provides energy for Monstropolis. How do they obtain this energy you ask? By going into the bedrooms of children, scaring the young ones and gathering their screams which power everything from cars to lights. Sulley is the best of the best, thanks in part to his buddy Mike Wazowski who helps him on the scare floor. What's more is that everyone seems to just love the big guy, everyone except Randall Boggs, who continuously attempts to pull ahead of Sulley in the scare numbers only to fail. Everything in Sulley's life seems to be going perfectly, that is until he accidentally lets a small little girl into the monster world. From there, all hell breaks loose. Disney and Pixar once again create a picture perfect story that is filled with humor and heart. If you don't usually cry while watching a movie, you'll be hard pressed to see a dry eye including your own while watching this charming tale.
One of the most engaging aspects of Monsters Inc. has to be the vibrant voices behind the delightful, and at times scary, characters. The teaming of Billy Crystal and John Goodman has to be one of the biggest, if not the best, highlights of the film with each actor playing off each other gracefully and showcasing perfect chemistry together within the course of the feature. Steve Buscemi gives an utterly chilling voice-over performance for the slippery and cunning Randall Boggs. The familiar voice, at least for many adults going to see Monsters, brings about much needed sinister-like quality to outweigh the humor and the heart-tugging emotions that might have over-flooded the feature had the character not been added.
Overall, Monsters Inc. serves as a perfect example of the blending of intensity, humor, and heart so perfectly, it could only have come from the talented artists and writers at Disney and Pixar. They manage once again to out-due their previous successes including the original Toy Story and its sequel in both quality and storytelling unlike most films which, from film to film, tend to take a step backward. As effective as the feature was, there were moments where the filmmakers try too hard pulling off tear-jerker moments and eventually the emotions become a bit much. The ending to the film was a bit of a disappointment especially after it brings the audience to such an emotional peak as the film draws closer to its finale. What makes the ending more disappointing is that it seems to hint at a possible sequel that could never happen under the current Disney and Pixar agreement. But those squabbles are nothing compared to the overall effectively entertaining humor and visuals from one of the best family features in quite awhile.",1076112000,,3998,4.950892857142857

1445492,4,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters, Inc."" is a funny addition to anyone's Pixar library.  It's funnier than ""A Bug's Life"" and has a storyline that holds up better than ""Toy Story.""  Sully and Mike are a great duo in this tale and it's fun to watch them interact with each other and Boo.  The opening sequence in the test ""Scare"" room is funny, and the following sequence at Sully's house is hilarious.  Steve Buscemi is a standout as Randall, the conniving culprit of the movie.  He's devilishly funny and Mr. Waternoose isn't so bad either.
All of the monsters in this movie are designed with brilliancy.  None of them come across as too scary for youngsters to watch.  A cameo appearance by the ""Abominable Snowman"" leads to a funny moment with yellow sno-cones.
My 2 year-old wouldn't stop watching this movie for weeks after we purchased it, and now she's hooked on it again.

This movie is definitely for both children and adults.  I'm FAR from being a prude but it's refreshing to be able to watch a movie without having to worry about every other word being a curse word, some guy's a** filling the screen, or some woman's breasts falling out of her too tight top.  Once in a while, you just want to be able to sit down and enjoy a show without having to explain the sexual overtones.
It takes talent to be able to use your voice in the way that Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and the other actors and actresses in this movie did.  To me, doing voice work takes more out of you than being seen on the screen.
On the DVD version, be sure to check out the short film, ""Mike's New Car.""  Hilarious.
Pixar did a fantastic job with the animation.  I'm sure it took forever to put this movie together and three cheers from someone who is appreciative of their hard work.
I don't understand how anyone can attack this movie, or any kids movie for that matter.  The line about the content not being real enough got tiresome a real long time ago.

1445529,4,B00005JKDR,"While the ""Toy Story"" movies had a fairly simple story, as did ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Monsters, Inc."" marks real progress for Pixar. While one expects greater technical sophistication with each film (and said expectations are always rewarded), this film also marks the first time where shades of gray creep into the story, and new heights in creativity in the setting, characters and storyline are added to the mix.
The three Pixar films prior to this are mostly kids' stuff, with the fun for adults being the gee whiz technical aspects (and seeing long-ago toys come to life), ""Monsters, Inc."" slyly plays with adult conventions, making it a delight for audiences of all ages.
For younger viewers, the film may run a little long, but it's still time well-spent. The added features on the DVD are excellent as well, but are arranged in a more kid-friendly format than adult viewers might prefer, although not to the ridiculous extent present on the first Harry Potter DVD.

But, unexpectecly, sometimes, a few, the film is an extrordinary masterpiece for adults. Children may laugh about 10 or 20 sketches, but if you are an adult you may laugh about 100 or 200 real funny ideas! Recently we found it in ""Shrek"" or in Pixar's Monsters Inc., good for kids... but much better for adults!
Monsters Inc. is fourth full-lenght Pixar's film. After the masterpieces ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Toy Story 2"". All Pixar's films are made completely by computers, but the ideas came from an extraordinary talented human group, headed by John Lasseter.
The main characters are: James P. Sullivan ""Sullie"", a big horned blue monster, the most frightening one but with an extraordinary heart; Mike Wazowsky, a funny one-eyed little green monster, his best friend; an Randall, a black-hearted reptil, a jealous cheater.
Monsters live in their own world, but they need energy that they obtain from children's shouts. Then they need to enter through the ward-robe door to the child's room, scare him and obtain energy.
But monsters think that children are dangerous and infectious, if a child touches you you'll probably die. But Boo, a 2-3 years old girl, gets into the monster's world because she thinks that Sullie is a big nice kitty.

Also effective are James Coburn as the nasty spidereman boss; the inimitable Steve Buscemi was devilishly evil as Randall; I don't know who voiced Roz, but she was great.

Monsters, Inc. has the quality of a kids cartoon that adults dearly need.  It has the limited ""adult"" humor (such as Mike forgetting his anaversary) that makes the adult happy that the movie is not ""Blues Clues"" or Barney.
The computer animation is perfect, especially in an extra on the DVD entitled Mike's New Car.  Additionally, the other extras on the DVD are worth it, including how they made the fur on the monsters look real, to the creation of a monster world.

The premise is simple: Monsters scare children, when the children scream it is bottled as useable energy for monster land. James Sullivan (Goodman) is Monsters Inc's top scarer and his sidekick Mike (Crystal) is his assistant. Sully is about to break the All-Time Scare record when a child enters monster land. The rest is trying to return Boo (the child) back to her door and get her safely home. This movie is flat-out hilarious and not just for kids. Billy Crystal steals the show as Mike and has some great one liners. Goodman is too comfortable playing the lovable oaf Sully. James Cobern and Steve Buscemi round out the cast as Henry Waternoose (CEO of Monsters Inc.) and Randall Boggs (the villain) respectively.

With the exception of Randall, who wants to take the honors away, life is going well.  One night, however, Sulley returns to the scare floor to find one door has been left behind.  Investigating further, he accidentally lets a little girl into their world.  Believing that kids are toxic, Mike and Sulley try to figure out a way to get her back to her room without getting in trouble for letting such a danger into their world.
Pixar has scored again - big time.  They seem to get better with every film released.  Here, they present a heart warming tale with loads of humor that will make the entire family laugh out loud.  The characters, while looking like monsters, do have a certain cuteness about them.  And they have wonderful hearts, making them easy to like and root for.  ""Boo,"" the little girl, really steals the show.  The animators did a wonderful job creating her.  The idea that monsters are actually afraid of kids is inspired, providing some funny moments.  The graphics have come a long way; the effects are wonderful, but they never get in the way of the story, which is tight, entertaining, and lots of fun.  And that climax.  I want to ride on those doors as well!
As always, the folks at Pixar know how to release a DVD.  The movie itself is presented in wide screen and full frame formats, directly from their computer files so you get a wonderful picture and sound.  The audio commentary is informative and eye opening, and the second disc contains over three hours of extras that show all the hard work that went into creating this masterpiece.
While some moments might frighten young children, most will fall in love with the almost cute stars and be so caught up in the fun of the story that they won't notice.  Pixar hit just the right note to appeal to kids and the parents they drag into the theater.

1445768,4,B00005JKDR,"The people at Pixar have a remarkable talent for taking an idea from childhood, turning it into a compelling story, and producing a film that is enjoyable to both children and adults.  Oh, and they tend to look fantastic, too.  In the latest feature-length film from Pixar, we learn that monsters really do live in our closets.  In particular, we get to know Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) as two monsters who work for a scream-collecting factory called Monsters, Inc.
The premise of the film is that the world of the monsters is powered by the screams of children.  So the employees of Monsters, Inc. are responsible for sneaking into the rooms of children while they are sleeping to scare them.  The emanating screams are captured into containers where they are refined into the highest quality screams to power everything from the lights to the cars.  Because their screams are such a powerful substance, children are considered toxic and dangerous.  So trouble ensues when a child follows Sully into the monsters' world.
Although the premise may sound a bit frightening for children, the filmmakers handle the concept well and there are only a few scenes where children may be initially startled.  But the film quickly changes moods during these scenes and children will come out laughing.
The vocal talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal fit their characters well, and the performances of Steve Buscemi (as Randall) and James Coburn (as Henry J. Waternoose III) are also excellent.  As the expanded material on the DVD points out often, the animation is definitely ground-breaking as many of the monsters (especially Sully) are rendered gorgeously with fur that flows and bounces with the movement of the characters.  This is the first Pixar film that was not directed by John Lasseter (responsible for directing the _Toy Story_ films and _A Bug's Life_, and serves as executive producer for _Monsters, Inc._), but Pete Docter does a great job taking the helm of this Oscar-nominated film (that lost to Shrek -- whatever).
The DVD release includes a second disc which includes a great tour of the production process of the film, such as early story treatments and detailed explanations of why modeling fur is so darn hard.  One of the best features of the second disc is the very funny animated short film ""For the Birds"" which won an Oscar for ""Best Animated Short Film,"" as well as the humorous but slightly disappointing ""Mike's New Car.""
Like other Pixar films, the story and characters are entertaining and engaging for young viewers.  But the film includes character complexity and subtle humor that adults will appreciate as well.  While not quite up to the standards of _Toy Story_ or its sequel, _Toy Story 2_, this remains a terrific film.",1049932800,,2792,4.94017094017094

1445815,4,B00005JKDR,"Disney and Pixar have again teamed up to create an outstanding computer-animated film.  I must admit that the trailers and hype had me skeptical, but when I saw the film in theaters, I changed my mind--this is a great film, particularly for kids (though adults can enjoy it, too!)
The premise: the monsters under your bed, in your closet, etc. are REAL, and their world connects to ours through the closet doors.  Those monsters don't really want to eat young, terrified kids; it's just the fear they're after as an eco-friendly power source.
That's where our main charcters come in, as the best scarer, Sulley, and his set-up man, Mike (the two voiced to great effect by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) find one young girl unafraid of the cute and furry Sulley who follows him back to the the monster's land though her closet door.  The neat plot device is that monsters are in fact terrified of kids, believing contact with them deadly.  Thus the first half or so of the film is devoted to Mike and Sulley's antics of trying desperately to hide and return the kid to her home, dressing her up in a monster costume and lugging her all about town as they try to locate the door leading back to her bedroom all the while avoiding the men-in-black-esque ""decontamination"" teams. Adults and children alike will enjoy the their antics and the saccharinely sweet kid's charm.
The second half of the film does flag off a bit from the first as Sulley and Mike discover a nefarious plot to kidnap and harness the fear of children through a mechanical monstrosity reminiscent of the infamous tentacle monsters of anime.  The chase scenes that ensue are at times repetitive and predictable and lack much of the charm of the first half of the movie (though not the slapstick schitck), but not a child will notice as they cheer on Sulley and Mike.
Overall, this is one of the more original and cuter films to come out of Disney in a long time.",1047859200,,1931,4.601744186046512

However, a funny thing happened during my ongoing visual and aural animation: I actually started caring about the story, about the characters created only from photons and actors' voices--as well as from a screenplay that is completely inoffensive to little ears, yet also listenable to bigger ones. And the graphics--wow! At times I found myself forgetting that this wasn't live-action, especially during what I felt was the best scene, one that reminded me of a wicked inverted-rollercoaster ride.
Well, there you have it: a film that everyone from five and up can enjoy, for different aspects of it.  Aside from the wonderful visuals, of course we also get two of the best vocal acting performances in recent memory, from Billy Crystal and John Goodman.

There, you'll find Monstropolis, a place where creatures of all shapes and sizes live everyday normal lives, where all the energy in the city comes from screams, and where human children are considered toxic. The plot is set in motion when a big, blue monster named Sully brings a little girl named Boo into the monster world and turns it upside-down. Like in ""Toy Story"", PIXAR brings a nostalgic twist to the film which makes it not only a ""kiddie movie"", but equally enjoyable to grown-ups who remember when they thought there were monsters in their closet. The DVD also features an assortment of special bonus features, most notably deleted scenes, art galleries, theatrical trailers. and a full version of the original story concept for the film which only somewhat resembles the final product.

1445874,5,B00005JKDR,"My title may sound a tad cliche, but I believe it. The guys at Pixar understand the mind of children - because they still haven't grown up! That's why Monsters, Inc. is the perfect balance of children's entertainment and adult sophistication. I love it when a studio produces movies that kids love, but at the same time are able to add a level of maturity and sophistication that adults appreciate - without sexual innuendo or appealing to the lowest-common denominator. (i.e. several instances in the movie, Shrek)
The animation is simply incredible; the characters are compelling and hilarious; Boo is worth the price of TWO admissions; the plot and backstory are completely ingenious.
Buy this movie. Enjoy it. Enjoy Disc 2.

in the Simpsons. Same goes for some other monster elements and the
breaking-voiced maintenance worker boy character. One big
difference with the Simpsons however is that the Simpsons is funny
and this was pathetically unfunny. From the rip-off starting
premise, the concept then becomes tediously convoluted - in other
words, a 95-minute mess (not that I was able to endure the entire
95 minutes). Once again, Disney tries to appeal to all age groups
but fails to appeal to any age group as a lot of material is too
scarey for small children and too trite for grown-ups. I lasted
for about 20 minutes and then I hit the 2X speed on the DVD and
then 4X speed to spool through about another half hour, and then

1445876,5,B00005JKDR,"If you have small children, movies such as this are worth their weight in gold: the kids love it (our two year old can barely start the day without at least seeing scare trainee Mr. Vile whose friends call him ""Phlegm"" and his ill-fated run through the bedroom simulation), and since the kids love it, you'd better get used to the idea of YOU watching it OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
And here Monsters, Inc. (along with the Toy Story movies and the outstanding Shrek) really shows its mettle: even for my (somewhat addled) parental brain, this film stands up to repeated scrutiny: I think I could probably recite the entire script verbatim and I still get a kick out of it.
Partly it's the characterisation - Goodman and Crystal are as good as you'd expect, but the secondary characters are their equal - the adolescent door shredders and, of course, Mr. Vile are amongst my favourites. Every aspect of the film rates highly: the script pops and fizzes (probably thanks to Crystal's ad-libbing), the computer rendering is brilliant (though I still say Shrek is the undisputed CGI heavyweight championship of the world), and the grand scheme of the film - its look and feel, is just remarkable.
Viewers who complain that the darker aspects of the story weren't adequately explored seem to have missed the fact that, first and foremost, this is a story for very small children. And besides, there's no way I'm marking down a film that guarantees me a half-hour lie-in on a Sunday morning just because it isn't nasty enough.
Two nitpicks (neither of which rob the film of the five stars it deserves): Firstly, the standard version I bought isn't the full widescreen version (this wasn't made clear on the tin, and even if it was, it is a curious and rather cynical decision on Disney's part), and secondly, to get the movie to play you have to scroll through a bunch of other Disney trailers - there seems to be no way to avoid these (other than impatiently cueing through them). This is standard Disney practice - although what they think it will achieve is beyond me, no matter what they do I'M NOT BUYING TARZAN - and it is irritating as hell.

The story of monsters behind our closet doors we all feared as children is outstanding.

However, I didn't find it as funny as many other reviewers. There were some jokes I chuckled at, but nothing I really laughed out loud about. The role of the child in the movie is a bit weak, I would have liked to have seen the animators make her a bit older and funnier. I did find the parallels between the real world and the world of the monsters funny at times.
What I thought was the funniest part of the movie was actually the ""out takes"" at the end of the DVD. Those are the things I really laughed out loud at.",1042848000,,850,4.253086419753086

Mike's New Car is funny (made for the video release, skip the commentary for it, though) and For the Birds is cute!

John Goodman plays John Sullivan, the lovable larger than life blue monster, who leads the pack at scaring kids.  His pal Mike (a cyclops voiced by Billy Crystal) is well-meaning, chatty and hilarious.  Somehow, they wind up with a cute 2-month old human they nickname ""Boo"" (you must understand that humans are considered contaminating, as one monster gets its fur shaved for contact with another human).  Can they return ""Boo"" back to her door?  Will Mike ever get things right with his girlfriend?  And can ""Sully"" still lead the pack even with the snake-like Randall?  The door scene close to the end of the movie is a real highlight!

Kudos to Goodman, Crystal et al for their vocal performances, Randy Newman for his musical score, especially the winsome song ""If I Didn't Have You,"" directors Lee Unkrich, David Silverman and Pete Docter and producers John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Darla K. Anderson!

John Goodman gives voice to the most lovable of all the monsters in Monstropolis.  Sulley is the top scarer at Monster's Inc. but someone else has found a new way to beat that record and pull in ratings topping numbers.  Randall, voiced by Steve Buscemi, is just the type of monster that makes kids afriad to open their closet.  He is a self serving, chamaleon like monster who has come up with a scheme that will take the world of scaring to a whole new level.  Instead of the old system of hiding in the closet and scaring a kid to get a litlte scream, why not just milk it out of them with a machine?  Randall accidentally lets a little girl (Boo) lose in Monstropolis.  Sulley thinks its his fault, so he takes it upon himself to put her back with the help of his pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).

1446005,3,B00005JKDR,".... Because what I saw was a high production film with more plot holes and predictable characterization than I can forgive. The dialogue by the various characters from heroes like Scully to the forgettable revelations that the boss was the bad guy was seen from a mile away. Snappy delivery does not equate to original stories or memorable plot designs. I do not own this DVD but I saw the film in the theater and presented as entertainment twice since then and there was that in flight presentation from Europe too which I studiously viewed it trying to ""get it"". Did I like the characters? No. What was to like. Scully was a lovable lug with a heart, surprise, surprise. The big-eyed Mikey portrayed by Billy Crystal was also a character that's been presented over and over again as the selfish, funny guy who has a change of heart by the end (insert lovable smart-alec meercat from the Lion King, Jason Alexander's gargoyle from The Hunchback, monkey from Alladin, crab Sabastian from The Little Mermaid, petulant animated clock from Beauty And The Beast......), then the big corporate boss was the bad guy?! Noooooo.... really? Couple all that with a cute-as-a-button, prespeaking little girl who coos and ahhs and squeaks and is terrified by all those bad guys, but wants to be snuggled by the big blue Scully and you have a predictable ""hit"". Of course people will love this. They're programmed to love it, and none too subtly either. Is it a bad film? No. It's fine. That's all it really is; fine. However when something gets the rave reviews this film recieved, I expect at least one good gut laugh. I'm not as hard to please as I might sound. This was a disappointment. So was Shrek. Maybe it's the highly rendered, overrated CGI that's the problem. Maybe it changes the way I view these predictable films. It's not dazzling me. By the way, my kids and my wife don't ""get it"" either. We ""got"" The Emperor's New Groove, The Iron Giant, Eldorado, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, as well as the more serious Atlantis from American animated cinema and several good laughs from the recent Ice Age. Compared to those, Monster's Inc is just a lot of the same old thing and not very clever, regardless of the stellar cast and the opinions of reviewers.

The new animated short, ""Mike's New Car,"" is fun to watch, but not nearly as entertaining as the Oscar winning ""For the Birds,"" which was also shown in the theater.
We also loved the outtakes and the tour of Pixar studios which provides background on the people and the ideas behind Monsters, Inc. The only problem is: my son figures he'll be able to get a job someday where he can just goof around, ride scooters and have a pet chimpanzee.

Trouble comes when Goodman happens upon a child who has accidentally escaped through her bedroom door into the monster world, a big problem considering children are considered to be virulent by the bigwig monsters who run the city.

1446074,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. is a superb family film.  Many other reviewers have laid out the film's plot, so I will simply outline the parts that I liked.
John Goodman and Billy Crystal are an awesome comic pairing that will have everyone laughing.  While the movie is funny and has a good guy vs. bad guy plot, there is nothing to worry about your children seeing.  The movie is completely devoid of off-color humor and violence.  Parents who have felt that even children's movies were becoming too sexualized and/or violent, will find a welcome respite.
Monsters Inc. is also a good looking movie.  The animation is excellent, even to the point of really expressing emotions on the characters 'faces'.  I think it is the best animation ever made thus far.

The kids can watch it over and over without wearing it out, and I really enjoyed the bonus features on the second disc. There is so much on there that it takes quite a while to get through it, but definitely worth watching.
For those who are worried about the 'scary' factor: It is not a scary movie at all. My twin 4-year-olds describe the monsters as being 'cute'.  What is funny about the movie is that the monsters are afraid of kids than the kids are of the monsters.

1446109,4,B00005JKDR,"Monsters, Inc. is another triumph of computer animation from the wizards at Pixar.  As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a ""what if?"" scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours?
Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters, Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster, Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.
One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst.  His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.
The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a ""Grossery Store"" and ""odorant"" (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie.

1446111,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc is another great hit from the Disney/Pixar series! Monstaers Inc is about the world of Monsters in our closets and why they come out. In the movie, it's established that a scream will give power and energy, that same power and energy is needed to fuel the city of the Monsters. So like factory clock work, the Monsters go in every morning (night for us humans) and scare people to get that scream.
Sully (John Goodman) is the #1 Scarer and his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is there at his side making sure he catches each scream. Their biggest competition for the #1 slot is Randall (Steve Buscemi). After a night's work, Mike decides to go home and Sully stay behind making sure his paperwork is done and that's when Sully finds Randall cheating and helping his numbers by doing unauthorized scares! Realizing this Sully goes to investigate and finds out that by accident, a little girl has broken into the Monster world! It's up to Sully and Mike to hide her from the authorities and get her home dafely. It's a animaterd comedy adventure that keeps you rolling and brings you to tears.
I have to admit, I'm not much of a Disney fan anymore ever since the power days of Disney in the late 80's with the Little Mermaid to 1994's The Lion King, but NOW with these great computer animated full features, I can safely say that I can't wait for Disney to do more of these because there are enjoyable for all ages.
Plus the bonus DVD has a lot of great extras in it like the short feature ""Mike's New Car"", outtakes and other great features. This is a movie that I'd suggest any family to pop in and have a family movie night.

It's really fun to go through all the doors and learn about the diffferent things. You'll love this DVD, it's great! It's especially great for younger kids, but even older kids and adults can appreciate it too! It's one of the best Disney movies, and the best one this millenium (with flops like ""Treasure Planet"") You won't regret buying this DVD. Enjoy!",1040428800,,1243,4.404347826086957

This movie is one that can be enjoyed by the entire family. No potty humor, no gross-out stuff. Just a good ole' fashioned tale of good vs. evil.
Goodman's character is a lovable slob-of-a-monster who becomes attached to a little girl. Crystal is perfectly cast as the commonsense, ""What-are-you-thinking-about?"" half of the duo. Together they spin a story that is funny and meaningful. One of the few ""kid-flicks"" I did not mind seeing over and over.

1446115,5,B00005JKDR,"I'm a 7th grader, and my class watched this film at school because we had to do a gruelingly hard art project on it...but that's not the point. I agreed with the idea of watching it, basically so we could watch TV instead of studying. I liked Ice Age and Shrek, but this didn't really appeal to me at all. But after watching it, I really liked it. The movie's based towards young kids (obviously), but it would definetly appeal to older kids and even adults.
It's just like a big cartoon; very entertaining, even if you don't crack up laughing. It's about Mike and Sully (why is it always so easy to remember character's names in kid's movies?), two monsters, living in their alternate monster world. What are their jobs? Scaring childen. Every child has their own monster, and the monster's job is to scare them every now and then by coming out their closet and doing what monsters do. Well, what humans don't know is that monsters are just as scared of them as they are of them. Monsters fear humans, believing they're intoxicated, poisoned, etc., so when a human baby slips into the Monsters Inc. factory, Sully and Mike hide it the best they can, but, like all things you try to hide, it slips out, and panic covers Monstropolis. It all turns out to be a fun-filled family comedy/cartoon, that everyone will enjoy. Myself? I enjoyed it more than Shrek.",1040256000,,1356,4.561475409836065

They keep making films that kids love, parent's love, and are only rated G (in other words, they never pull cheap laughs, like Shrek did every once in a while, earning them PG status). Monsters, Inc., is a great movie, very funny and has it's moments of peril, and it's moments of fun. The technology behind this movie is so complex now, that if the world was not 'stylized', they could make you believe it's for real! John Goodman and Billy Crystal do some great comedy together, and the late James Coburn does a fantastic change in the movie. I'll shut up, buy this movie is worth [the price]!

I haven't mentioned the animation because this flick is so enveloping, the detail so precise...it's a reality in which I was happily immersed.
Only after spending time with the innumerable extras did I gasp at the level of complexity I had taken for granted. You will sit eyes agape in amazement, learning about computer animation techniques. I found the whole bit about ""set dressing"" to be ridiculously cool.

1446241,5,B00005JKDR,"Some people think that this movie is childish. I cannot stress how wrong that is! Believe me that this is one of the greatest movies you can watch. The plot is nice and goes like this: The monster world, Monstropolis, needs children's screams for energy.
To get the energy, they need to go through doors and enter through children's closets and scare them, but it is a dangerous job because in Monstropolis, children are supposedly dangerous and toxic. Eventually, the main character, James P. Sullivan, (John Goodman), accidentally lets a tiny little girl named Boo, (Mary Gibbs) in. So eventually, it is up to Sullivan, or Sully as he is usually called, and his pal Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) to return Boo to the human world, but this is a hard job because of an evil chamelion monster known as Randall Boggs, (Steve Buscemi) gets in the way, and is out to capture Mike Wazowski at a certain point. This movie is simply awesome. There are two more things added in this movie. There are two animated short films, known as 'For The Birds' and Mike's New Car.' In 'For The Birds', some birds sit down and chirp at each other and argue, and then a larger bird sits down, and the birds try to kill it, and very nearly kill themselves. In Mike's New Car, Mike Wazowski buys a new car, lets Sully in, and then there are some accidents, and Sully can't figure out what to do. Eventually the car explodes and Mike appears burnt to a crisp. Also there is a sneak-in of the video 'Finding Nemo.' I give this film the highest recommendation I can give a film!",1038873600,,1554,4.51418439716312

1446243,5,B00005JKDR,"I was initially and continue to be amazed by the computer animation in this film. I want to jump up and fly to Pixar studios to see how they do it. Every hair on Sulley' back moves independent of the others - or so it seems. The facial expressions of the characters are wonderful. Realistic emotions are played out on the faces of the monsters and the 2-year old human child ""boo"". The characterization of the 2-year old child is right on target - take it from the mother of a 2-year old. I love it! My son's name is now ""boo"" in the house. Another interesting observation - to me - is that the child looks more animated than the monsters. Boo's characterization is great, but her ""look"" is more animated than the monsters - which doesn't detract from the movie at all. I'm just curious if that was deliberate?

 The story is wonderful too. Even with the brilliant animation, this movie wouldn't be as wonderful as it is without the terrific story line, characters, and voices.

 My favorite scene is when ""Boo"" overcomes her fear of Randall to save Sulley from falling out of a door. You've got to see it. I laugh out loud each and every time.",1038787200,,1144,4.407582938388626
1446244,5,B00005JKDR,"Here is a film for the kid in all of us, adults and children alike.  This movie creates a fantasy world full of childlike wonder and humor - the characters really come to life thanks to brilliant computer animation and some inspired performances by the likes of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and the late James Coburn.
I watched the film without knowing much about the actual plot beforehand (an approach I would recommend to new viewers).  However, I enjoyed it as much the second time around.  Not only is there humor, but there are some sweet and touching moments that are handled perfectly and never stray into the realm of sugary sentimentality.
The attention to visual detail is amazing and will reward repeated viewings.  This is perfect for families to watch together without anyone being bored: a delicate feat that the filmmakers carry off admirably.
In short, this is a movie that makes you feel good.  Simple as that.  What more can you ask for during these trying times?",1038700800,,982,4.781065088757397

It's kind of cartoonish for the little kids (might be just a little scary for some of them), lots of not really violent action, a plot that while silly (monsters scaring kids to capture their screams for use as an energy source) is pretty well done, good characterizations (especially John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike Wasowski)and some really interesting computer animation.

The most interesting part is probably the entire movie making process. From the start of creating the story to the finished product of actually going on the computers and animating the characters. The original story which is done in storyboards and narrated shows that the original story was far from the finished product. They changed many aspects of the plot and characters to make it just right. Pixar put a lot of work into this DVD as with their others.

Although probably not appropriate for the youngest of viewers, those over age 8 or so will get a kick out of Pixar's newest twist: those monsters in your closet are actually scared of kids!! This movie follows two of the monster world's ""Top Scarers"" as they try to find a child who has escaped into their world -- without anyone else finding out about it.
Billy Crystal and John Goodman are both excellent as Mike and Sully, the main characters. Also, the voice actress for Boo, the little girl, is spectacular. This is the first movie that I have ever seen to use ""baby talk"" realistically, and also with humor. This movie will give both adults and children something to laugh about.
As for features, there are some good featurettes included that explore ""The Making Of..."", plus an added scene or two. I wasn't that impressed by the ""extras"" but the movie itself is DEFINITELY worth it!!",1038096000,,931,4.648484848484848

But tonight, we rented the Monsters Inc DVD and I absolutely loved it!  Clever, hilarious, touching, innovative, unique, imaginative - those words don't begin to tell about this movie!  You just have to see it.
It's such a pleasure to see a G-rated movie doing so well, both at the box office and also sales of the products for home viewing.  This movie is totally free of sex, profanity, and substance abuse.  Some of the action could be called violence, but not in the sense we usually define violence in movies!  This movie might scare a 4-year-old, however.  You need to know your own child to know if he's ready for this action-packed, laugh-a-minute masterpiece!
I watched this with my husband and two of our older kids (ages 19 and 21).  We all enjoyed this movie immensely and can't wait to watch the extras on the other DVD.  I can actually see watching this movie again, as the humor flies fast and furious and I know I missed a some good lines!
You will be touched by the relationship between Sully (the big blue monster) and the little girl he affectionately names Boo.  He puts her safety above his job and above the good of the company.  This little girl they created is nothing short of charming and endearing.  You will instantly love her and cheer Sully on as he does everything he can to protect her.
The premise of the movie - that the Monsters collect screams of children which in turn power the city that the Monsters live in, is nothing short of genius.  This DVD would be a great gift for many people on your Christmas List - regardless of their age!",1038009600,24,1815,4.427710843373494
1446303,5,B00005JKDR,"In Toy Story, we had toys coming to life, now we learn that there really are monsters lurking in kids' closets. Every aspect of this production, from the story, the animation, the effects, the voice actors, the music and sound design, is well executed and it all fits together wonderfully. The final breathtaking and hilarious set piece in the door vault must be seen to be believed. My favorite bit of casting is Steve Buscemi as the lizard-like Randall, and using a real child to portray ""Boo"", which lends more credibility to her character.
Disc 2 is a feast for those who love behind the scenes features. Pixar's funky offices, their pet monkey, and the executives riding around the halls on scooters make it look like a fun place to work.  Unlike many DVD extras, you get a genuinely informative crash course in how these films are made, as well as fun frivolity to explore, the most obscure being a playbill for Mike's company play and an orientation to Monsters, Inc for new employees.",1038009600,,992,4.7011494252873565
1446304,5,B00005JKDR,"DISC ONE: For moviegoers during summer of 2001, the marquee was packed with animated options: Shrek, Atlantis, Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc. If you disect the movies, the first two end up being dissapointing when viewed in the small screen and Final Fantasy is just made with a different public in mind. Now, Monsters, Inc. achieves in DVD format the same feel you got when you (hopefully) saw it in theaters: the movie IS a great movie for all ages. No bells and whistles: simply brilliant!
The script is very funny, clever and innovative (it is worth seeing on the DVD how much it evolved from the original treatment it was going to have...), turning around the ageless childhood fear of monsters into a fear of kids BY monsters, who need kids' screams in order to power their society. Top ranking scarer, big, blue and furry Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assitant, Mike Wazowski (brilliantly played by Billy Crystal) see their ""monstrous"" lives turned around when Sulley accidentally brings a little girl (Boo) by accident into their monster world.
Complementing the script and the voices, the animation is incredible. The faces of the characters, the blinking of the eyes (the red in the eyes, when Mike sprays antibacterial stuff on his face, the glassy look in Sulley's eyes toward the end of the movie), the fur of Sulley (every hair moving just as if he were real), the illumination all through the movie. Plus the persecution scene leaves you speechless: there's SO MUCH happening in it, and it's so seamless: one of the great animation accomplishments of the movie without any doubt.
DISC TWO: One element that powerfully called my attention is the very human (is that ironic or what?) touch that the second disc has. For example, the Director, the two Co-Directors and the Producer appear in the very beginning, showing you how to find your way around the DVD. It's not that it's a convoluted DVD or anything of that sort: simply the two discs are packed with all sorts of goodies and they are making an effort to have you find it all.
One of the best things included in disc 2 is the Oscar-winning animated short film ""For The Birds"" which we all enjoyed in theaters so much right before Monsters started. Also included are the complete outtakes (call them ""bloopers"" from the movie, if you may, whose concept alone makes you scratch your head in surprise while you laugh till it hurts). But the fun to disc two doesn't end there: there is a wealth of details for the more technically-inclined or those who simply are curious about the way animation is done, with a whole tour through the process, from story reels, to layout, animation, simulation (a key component in the level of perfection accomplished with Sulley's fur and the way Boo's big shirt works) ahd shading/lighting. Same thing is done with design and music & sound. Wrapping up the goodies is a pretty fun tour of Pixar studios where you can catch a glimpse of why these guys are able to come up with such a funny movie: they're having a blast there! :D
Technical comments
-If you view the DVD on a computer (as I did), the first time you do it, you will go through the installation of the InterActual player software. Hit ""Accept"" at every step of the way: whether you like it or not, you won't be able to take advantage of all the elements in the DVDs unless you view it using this software...
-Another detail for computer users: the ""Peek-A-Boo Door game"" was useless on my computer. It's designed to be played when viewing the DVD on a DVD player. In fact, it almost brings my laptop to its knees. So, my recommendation to you DVD-viewers using a computer to go past the intro page with all the games on it and click on to view the movie.
-Subtitles included are in English only, so that probably will not make Spanish-only or French-only-speaking viewers too happy, n'est-ce pas? Verdad?
In general, though, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.",1038009600,2,4078,4.696927374301676
1446305,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc is by far Disney and Pixar's best movie to date. What an incredible imagination the creators of this movie have, it just took my breath away. The storyline takes place in Monstropolis a city where monsters live beyond the human world, and in that city there lies the company called Monsters Inc where monsters work and their job is to scare children, and then they collect their screams as a source of energy for the city's electricity. The outrageous part is this, the monsters consider children to be dangerous even deadly and that if a child were to touch them they would be contaminated and the company would be in trouble. Mike Wazowski voiced by Billy Crystal and James P Sullivan voiced by John Goodman are a team at Monsters Inc, Mike assists him and Sully does the scaring, they are the perfect team and Sully who is the top scarer at the company is this close to breaking the all time scare record until something happens. One night when everyone has left work Sully enters in door that has been left and when he goes in to look and then comes back out a little girl follows him and Sully tries to put her back but she keeps following him. Soon everyone in Monstropolis is in fear because of the so called child security breach and the future of Monsters Inc is in jeopardy. The ending is pretty much predictable but the great comedic talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman more than make up for that. There are other wonderful voice talents in this movie such as the hilarious Steve Buscemi as Sully and Wazowski's nemesis Randall Boggs, the late and wonderful actor James Coburn as the Ceo of Monsters Inc Mr Henry J Waternoose III, the funny Jennifer Tilly as Wazowski's girlfriend and Monsters Inc receptionist Celia Mae, and the hilarious John Ratzenberger as Yeti the abominable snowman. There are also two great shorts on the vhs edition ""Mike's New Car"" and ""For the Birds"" All in all Monsters Inc is a movie that is pure magic, anyone can enjoy this movie, there is not one thing I don't like about it. I even found myself in tears at some parts of the movie. Just the relationship that Sully develops with the girl who he names Boo is both endearing and sweet, it really was touching. It is a movie that teaches you about true friendship, being there for your friend no matter what. How wonderful and even intriguing it would be if there really was a world where monsters worked, had families, drove cars just like humans. Pixar really outdid themselves with this movie and the end result can be summed up in one word: amazing!",1037923200,2,2563,4.54978354978355

However, children are getting harder to scare due to social influences from media and Monsters, Inc. is struggling to produce power for the city.  One evening when James stays to finish up some paper work he finds out that someone is working at an unauthorized time, and a child is accidentally sneaking into the monster world.  This is extremely dangerous, because the monsters have been socialized to believe that a child's touch is as lethal as the ebola virus.

My 18 month old daughter was maybe a bit nervous with the opening scene, but that soon ended as this movie certainly isn't frightening, but instead is humorous and lots of fun to watch.
The computer has come a long way and the animation in this movie is beyond great, it represents what I think computer generated movies should be.  If movie makers try and take computer generation along the route that Final Fantasy took, then eventually we'll have computer generated movies that look like live action movies, what would be the point?
I think the way these ""monsters"" were made to look like and take on human characterists was fabulous, especially since they didn't look human at all.  The little girl in the film was very well done and her interaction with the monsters was handled expertly.
I didn't bother to rent this one, I bought it right away.  I know we'll enjoy it for a long time.  A strong recommendation.",1037491200,5,1156,4.511961722488039

Billy Crystal has always been one of my favorite comedic actors. The vocal performance he delivers is maybe one of the best jobs of his career. John Goodman as the loveable blue top scarer ""James P. Sullivan"" also delivers a heartwarming performance. And the sweet adorable little Boo will melt anyone's cynical heart.
Visually this movie is remarkable. Pixar has developed a way to display the most subtle of human behaviors and emotions. In the realm of comedy it is not just the delivery of witty and sharp dialogue that brings laughter to its viewing audience but also well placed comical facial expression of its characters. In this aspect Monsters Inc is top notch!

The extras DVD was crammed with behind-the-scenes, outtakes (These were some of the best I've seen!), and 2 animated shorts, ""For the Birds"" and ""Mike's New Car.""  On a bus trip, the whole bus cracked up for ""The Birds"", and this wasn't the easiest bunch to find a movie on a bus trip amusing!  The behind-the-scenes will basically give you every little detail about animation (if you choose to watch all of the numerous clips.)

1446412,5,B00005JKDR,"...Not only was the movie great, but the fact that the DVD came as a set of two was even more facinating.  The first was the movie, lasting 1 hour and 33 minutes and the second was the bonus material, lasting almost 2 and 1/2 hours.  This second disc was full of bloopers, extra scenes that were cut out of the movie, commentaries by the director, and interviews with the voice actors.  There is also a wide range of games, a music video, a short film titled ""Mike's New Car"", which was pretty funny, another short film called ""For The Birds"" and the original story line of what the movie was going to be like.  In this disc they also have a tour of the Pixar Studio, the cast of characters, what it took to make Monstropolis look like a ""monster city"" instead of a ""real city"" and how they managed to put everything together to make this wonderful movie.  These are a wonderful attribute to the movie, because children can sit down a watch all of the work and fun that goes into making a movie that will become one of thier favourites.
I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.  It is great for both kids and adults alike.  It is filled with humor for both and it will be enjoyed by everyone.  I am a university student and I have bought this movie.  A lot of my friends love this movie, and almost everyone that I have talked to also love it.  It is ""a get away from the everyday"" movie that we are normally used to watching.  This may be made for children, but we all still have a bit of a child in us.

This delightful cheerful cartoon is a story about two Monsters ""Sully"" which is voiced by John Goodman and ""Mike"" which is voiced by Billy Chrystal.  These two monsters are with this company called Monster's Inc and they scare children for energy for the plant....it is like a nuclear plant yet not axactly. There is a compitition all the time of who can have the most screams on the scream chart at the end of the work shift and Sully is always in compitition with this wormy guy which I forget the name of.  Anyways as Sully is in compitition with ""the worm""  he finds the worm trying to sneak a few more screams in so that he can be at the top and when Sully tries to get rid of the evidence the evidence becomes friends with him and doesn't want to go back and sully doesn't want to let the little girl who escapes go back.
  This movie is alot more on DVD format with the little outtakes that are really good to the games for the kids.

  That said, however, Monsters Inc never bothers to tell a story.  It's all staging and set up to tell a story.  Essentially, you get an 80 minute view as to what life would be like in a monster world on the periphery of our dimension, and a weak subplot on how monsters get their energy.  The villains are transparently obvious, there's really never any sense of threat or accomplishment, and the resolution, if any, is very tepid -- essentially, life goes on as normal in Monsteropolis.

In case you aren't familiar with Pixar, all their movies are computer animated. In my opinion, they produce the highest quality animated movies out today. I think they've passed up their cousin, the Disney traditionally animated movie. 'Monsters, Inc.' is just as good as all the other Pixar movies: 'Toy Story', 'A Bugs Life', and 'Toy Story 2'. Every member of your family will enjoy 'Monsters, Inc.' - there are jokes and gags in there for everyone.

1446491,4,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters, Inc."" is set in a world looking not unlike our own, only populated by monsters.  Otherwise, and besides the technology that allows its denizens to travel into our world through our closets, ""Monstropolis"" looks pretty much like home.  Its people have the same insecurities - fear of the unknown; also everybody is sensitive about an energy crisis, with the dwindling screams of children providing the sole power source for the city.  To secure as much of the scarce energy for Monstropolis (today's children just don't provide screams as easily as in years gone by), Monsters, Inc sends its workers into the bedrooms of children throughout our world in the night's darkest hours collecting the screams needed to keep the city working.  In an unexpected switch, the monsters prove terrified of children, incorrectly believing them to be the most toxic creatures in the universe.  Among the monsters, Sully (voiced by John Goodman) is the champ.  Backed-up by the otherwise hapless Mike Wyzofski (Billy Crystal), Sully barely manages to hold the lead against a slimy and ambitious chameleon named Randall Boggs and voiced by Steve Buscemi.  Among the denizens of Monstropolis, the brave workers of ""Monsters, Inc."" are heroes, up there with the astronauts (their entrance on the factory floor sends up a similar scene from ""The Right Stuff"" in which the Mercury astronauts appear in their flightsuits for the press for the first time).  Those monsters who can't make the cut are banished to our world, condemned to making brief cameos on episodes of ""Unsolved Mysteries"".  Apparently trying to up his quota, Randall works off-hours.  When one of his victims, an adorable 2 year old girl escapes into the monster world and is discovered by Sully, the company is thrown into a crisis.  Learning that the child (whom they call ""Boo""isn't as dangerous as they'd been led to believe, Sully and Mike protect her from Randall and try to find her door from among the thousands kept in Monsters, inc.'s warehouse, all the time dodging Randall, the insidious stormtroopers of the CDA and a shadowy conspiracy that has plans of its own for Boo.
This was a great film, though the characters are pretty one-note (they're all monsters, but their blue-collar sensitivities are very human; Sully is the hero with Mike as the comic relief;  Billy Crystal doesn't get as much mileage from ""Mike"" as Tom Hanks or Tim Allen got from Woody and Buzz in the Toy Story movies), but the plot is an ingenious re-working of childhood neuroses (with cowardly monsters who live off our screams replacing toys who live for playing.)  Like other Pixar flicks, even the tape comes with extras - two shorts, one of them being based on ""Monsters, Inc."" characters, plus ""outtakes""  and even shots from a musical version of ""Monsters, Inc"" acted and sung by the company's employees.  A lot of fun, without ever being all that scary or sappy.  There's even a high-speed sequence involving Mike, Sully and Boo searching for Boo's door while being chased by Randall, that's bound to show up in Disney as a theme ride.",1035676800,,3088,4.943907156673114

1446497,5,B00005JKDR,"This is a wonderful collection, containing a great transfer of a film that's both funny and sweet, coupled with another disc full of great extras.
First off, disc 1 contains both widescreen and fullscreen presentations of the film. Hats off to the DVD creators for showing examples of the differences between the two, and for making widescreen the default selection. If you haven't been watching your DVDs in widescreen, then you've been missing half the movie. It should be pointed out, however, that in this case as well as with A Bug's Life, Pixar actually reworked the composition of many scenes in order to make the fullscreen version look better. The fullscreen version contains ""bloopers"" during the final credits, while the widescreen version does not, but they can also be found on disc 2. I have to say that I am disappointed with the running commentary. It wasn't as informative or entertaining as the ones I had experienced on the Toy Story films. They basically discuss the technical challenges, all of which are also discussed on disc 2. They also describe some fully-rendered scenes that were later deleted (unusual for an animated film), but not all of them are included in the set. That's a bit of a disappointment.
There is so much information on disc 2, it's hard to describe. You get wonderful character design sketches, early animation tests, tours of the ""sets,"" deleted scenes, games, interviews and much, much more. There's really no possible way to get through it all. If you tried it at one sitting, you'd have information overload. Most of the extras are great, while some of it is not as great and a bit redundant. That's bound to happen when this much information is on display.
It took way too long for this movie to make it to DVD, but it's worth the wait. There have been many unfair comparisons to Shrek, but this movie and DVD collection is much better in many respects. Not only is it more appropriate for kids, but it can withstand way more repeat viewings. The DVD set itself shows what can be done in terms of content. Disney/Pixar continues to set the standard for DVD presentations of animated films.",1035417600,,2140,4.77088948787062
1446525,5,B00005JKDR,"This movie gives me much peace and quiet in our rowdy household!  My two-year old boy and five-year old girl both sit still through this one, in its entirety.  My two-year old was sick for two days, and he watched it six times during those two days.  He sat still, by himself (sister was at school), and watched it, riveted.  I checked on him while I puttered around straightening things, and he never moved, until the ending credits.  Then, he was up like he was shot out of a gun, dancing around, saying ""Monster, monster"".  As is usual with Disney/Pixar, it operates on more than one level.  Observant parents will catch some very funny moments (we can all relate to the work-a-day grind).  The sushi bar is probably my favorite.

1446528,3,B00005JKDR,"With the good word of mouth the movie received, I was disappointed at not being able to see it at a movie theater when it first came out. It seemed as though it would be a movie worth the price of admission, so I gladly forked over the bling bling for the DVD. I should have rented it first!
Though most of Pixar's animation is amazing, the opening sequence seemed as though it belonged to a different movie. There was nothing clever about it. The story, however, has a great premise and many of the ideas mined to support it really hit the mark. Mr. Goodman's Sullivan is played wisely. Boo is a beautiful creation. The complexity of the monster world reflects well the dedication of its creators and the care that they took in making the film.
There are some really bad choices however. Mike Wazowski had a lot of potential if it had not been for the decision to portray him as such a whiney braggart. Mr. Crystal plays Mike way over the top and is at his most annoying. The friendship that Sulley and Mike share seems very one-sided. Nothing would suggest that Mike would act nobly. The twist at the end of the movie was also hardly original and was as unsatisfying as it was in Mission Impossible.
The second DVD is very interesting.  The creative effort that went into the movie is astonishing.  At the risk of being accused of being too picky and without a life, I have the following request of Pixar:  Enough with the ""supposed"" outtakes!  They were funny in Toy Story and A Bug's Life, now they're just boring.",1035158400,4,1518,4.4496402877697845

The effects are also very advanced.  You can see how ""Sully's"" furr moves when he walks, and the expressions on his face.
This is a great movie, and shouldn't be missing in your movie collection.  I highly recommend it.",1035158400,,473,4.292134831460674
1446531,4,B00005JKDR,"2001 was a banner year for Computer Animated film.  ""Final Fantasy"", ""Shrek"", ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Jimmy Nuetron"" made the year a feast for the eyes.  But where ""Final Fantasy"" was all looks and no story, and ""Shrek"" was shallow fluff that will be forgotten in a year, ""Monsters Inc"" Continues Pixars string of success going back to the original ""Toy Story""
The story itself is a great invention.  Monsters are real, and live in their own little world, needing the sceams of young children to power it.  A clever premise that plays off the Monster in the Closet stories from our younger days.  John Goodman voices Sully, the top scarer at Monsters Inc, the company that bridges the gap between the human and monster world and collects the screams that power Monsteropolis.  Billy Crystal, doing his best work in ages, voices the films mail comic relief, Sully's partner and best friend, the one-eyed, self-involved Mike Wazowski.  The plot revolves around how a human child, named ""Boo"" by Sully, gets into the Monster world and turns it upside down, Sully and Mikes attepmts to get her back to Earth, and a smart subplot about an insidous plan to end the ""scream shortage"" in Monsteropolis by kidnapping children and litterally sucking the screams out of them.
The movie is faced-paced and very funny.  It remains original while paying homage, through a series of in-jokes"" to great monster films of the past.  It is also a great story for children, as it teaches important messages about friendship, avoiding sterotypes, and even ethics.  Where ""Shrek"" was a mostly cynical spin on fairy tales that went for cheap laughs and had a mixed message about true beauty, ""Monsters Inc"" is a lovely tale that is funny for both children and adults.  It's another home run from the folks at Pixar.",1035158400,3,1790,4.836065573770492

1446582,5,B00005JKDR,"Pixar's seemingly endless roll continues with this gem of a movie.  And once again I hew not only to the standard that I liked it, but of the audience reaction as well when I saw it in the theaters.  Everyone laughed as one, watched silently in awe as one, you get the picture.  And when Boo / Sulley first said goodbye, there was not a dry eye in the house.
The meat and potatoes is, this movie hits all the right buttons.  It fulfills the promise that both Toy Story movies, good movies though they are, never quite made it to.  They combine the whip-smart humor, heart-string-tugging sequences, and lush landscapes for all this to happen in.  Randall alone (somewhat cliched, yes, but in my book a great classic villain, wonderfully voiced by Steve Buscemi) shows what can be done with a great voice in the hands of animators.  This proves another coup for the filmmakers, in that everyone's voice fits.  Jennifer Tilly is the perfect Celia.  Billy Crystal is just right for Mike, the same as John Goodman is just who I'd picture behind a character like Sulley.  In the same vein, I have a hard time picturing anyone ELSE doing these characters, because they were picked this well.  And while I'm at it, kudos to those who put together the extras.  Just seeing the length of time they spent getting something so seemingly simple as Sulley's fur to work correctly is a treat in itself.  Not only that, but there's a treasure trove of other oddball studio tour treats, etc.. the new short film isn't the best thing they've ever done, but it's good.  And the short ""For The Birds"" is still exquisite in all it's simplicity.
In any event, there is no more to be said.  I could go on about the movie's storyline more, but I don't want to ruin anything.  Suffice it to say the folks at Pixar did a fine job, and this is an excellent movie that works on many levels for both kids and adults, and well worth your picking up.",1034985600,,1919,4.455587392550143

Aside from the jokes and the dizzying chase scene, there are two scenes in the film that are living proof of the power of truly great animation; one, near the end, is absolutely heartbreaking and puts a lump in my throat no matter how many times I see it.  The other is the final image of the film, and it blows my mind to think about how a collection of pixels could carry such emotional resonance.  I say bravo.",1034985600,,577,4.40566037735849

The story line has something for everyone to enjoy, it's great for the kids of corse, but theres no kind of person I can think of anyhow that would not find this film to be enjoyable! It's so convincing as well that it seems hard to believe that the ""Monster World"" isn't real! As far as the comedy goes, no other movie lately has made me laugh quite as much!
John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve some sort of award too for lending their voices to the film. The casting is no less the perfect which makes the characters seem all the more real!

1446587,5,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters Inc"" is the most amazing movies I have ever seen (next to Shrek, GREAT MOVIE!).  It is both suited to the subtle adult humor as well as child oriented slapstick.  The characters are both very identifiable as well as limited by human like conditions.  Thus the audience can feel empathy for the Mike and Sully despite the fact that one is covered in blue hair and the other is a Cyclopes.
  The plot is the movie is well developed for both the ADD attention span of today's youths and adults.  There is plenty of action for the youngsters, while also having more than enough non-clich meat for the adults to chew on.
  ""Monsters Inc"" also both all its viewers to remember what it was like to be a child; to wonder what hiding in the closet and what lurks under the bed.  The writers and Pixar effectively play off this instinct and build it into a fanciful world where the roles are switched and monsters are scared of humans.
  Though the implications of some scene might slightly be pushing the bar on PG, this movie is suitable for every age group: kids, teens, young adults, adults, and older folk.
  I give it an A+, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I think every American home deserves a copy of this fine Hollywood flick.  Get it today!

1446640,5,B00005JKDR,"Pixar has no strikes against them. Bugs Life was a fun film, while the Toy Story films established them as a cut above. While Disney made ""Dinosaur"" and ""Atlantis"", Pixar was where the good films were at. Monster's Inc. raises the bar further, to a height most film makers would have a difficult time accheiving.
Although some say that it should have ended differently, without the reconstruction (I'm having difficulty explaining it without spoiling the magnificent ending), I have two problems with that logic. Firstly, that would end the film on a different note. Secondly, the final ""shot"" of the film was one of the defining shots of the film; at least a quarter of the films final charm would be lost without that ending.
As for the second disk in the DVD, it's worth the price all by itself-I reccomend you buy the set before the retailers realizes that. ""For the Birds"" is anything but: it's hard to pack so much humor, and a moral, in so short a time. ""Mike's New Car"" is also entertaining. And the Company Play will have people rolling in the... um, on the couch, I guess. The expression doesn't hold up here.

I am absolutely awestruck at the abilities of the people who create these new films for families. The art work is incredible, and the storyline is so great, I wish I had thought of it. This story takes Maurice Sendak's books about monsters to the next level. Tully and company are a scream, the voices chosen perfect. I can actually see a little of Billy Crystal in the one-eyed monster...and if that isn't hard to do in acting, I don't know what is. I am hoping that the folks at Pixar can do another movie with these two, and come up with another remarkable and clever plot line along the line of how children actually think.
The thought that the monsters are more scared of the children in reality is a scream, and when they learn that what they've been told is not necessarily true, well...this is a lesson we need to be reminded about. We all label each other, because of our differences...and children and adults alike need to be reminded occasionally that different can be good, and to judge people on the basis of their own individuality.
I was afraid my granddaughter would be scared with this one, like she was with The Grinch. Never happened. This DVD is a definite collectors item, and a wonderful addition to our library.

1446687,5,B00005JKDR,"Disney and Pixar studios have done it again! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a story about the monsters you were always afraid of after the lights went out. In the world of monsters, Monstropolis, James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) is at the top of the scare list at Monsters Incorporated, the business where monsters try to scare children around the world so the world of monsters, can keep their electricity. Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) is Sullivan's wise-cracking, one-eyed partner who dreams of becoming famous and winning over the woman of his dreams. Sullivan's arch rival is the slimy, sneaky Randell, who will do anything to be at the top of the scare list. When Randell tries to beat Sullivan's record, Sullivan finds out and he accidentally lets a little girl out of her room and into the monster world. The monsters think that if they get touched by a human child, then they will die. So after Sullivan breaks the news to Wazowski, it's up to them to try and get the little girl--who Sullivan names Boo--to get back into her room before anybody in the monster world finds out!
The computer animation is absolutely brilliant. The storyline is light and humerous and is not full of ""dirty toilet jokes"" like in the film, ""Shrek"". John Goodman and Billy Crsytal make the perfect animated pair! The DVD includes hours of extras, such as the hilarious animated short film, ""Mike's New Car"", and the Oscar-winning animated short film, ""For The Birds"". There are also hilarious outtakes, filmmaker's audio commentary, never-before-seen deleted scenes, behind the scenes, a tour of Pixar studios, and tons more! A must have to your family DVD library.
I highly recommend ""Monsters, Inc."".

The two work for Monsters, Inc, a company that produces power by scaring children in their rooms and capturing their screams.  However, children are extremely dangerous to the monsters.  One touch from a child can kill a monster.  Boo, a little girl, manages to sneak through her closet door and into Monsters, Inc unnoticed.

During the short feature where they take you inside Pixar, they go into vivid detail on how they did a lot of the elements of the movie.

I must add though, that it is my least favorite of Pixars feature films, but I still give it 5 stars. The reason I like it less is that there was less character development. In Toy Story 1 and 2, and A Bug's Life, I thought the characters were deeper, richer, and I was deeply engaged in caring about how things turned out for them. With Monsters, Inc. I liked the characters, but they had little depth, so I didn't care as much what happened to them. This probably has a bit to do with the fact that the characters were Monsters, and were more 'cartoony' than other characters.
Also, the humor was a bit more sparse. In Pixar's previous efforts, it seemed lit every other line was filled with sharp, witty, humorous lines. In Monsters, it was a bit thinner.

1446786,5,B00005JKDR,"I'll have to give this the nod as Pixar's best movie yet.  Why? Quite simply, the created almost everything from scratch.  Very little human/our world to base these models on.  It's all monsters and their world, so they had to work overtime to create a believable and realistic world all their own. They succeeded!
  The voice work on this film is superb.  Many of the voices you'll get right away, others might not be as noticeable until you see the credits roll and you'll go ""Yeah, it WAS Xxxxx!""  Billy Crystal is Mah-velous once again, injecting humor into nearly every scene he's in.  John Goodman gives a warm performance as well.  You just want to cuddle that monster!  And Boo, quite possibly, the cutest kid I've ever seen in a movie.
  However, Steve Buscemi plays his character to the hilt, and my 2 1/2 year old, much like Boo, didn't like him too much.  He's that good at being creepy!
  The story itself is heartwarming and fun, tinged with just enough sentimentality that most likely you'll love the ending, whether you need the Kleenex with you or not. :)  Me, I needed it.  Shhh...don't tell.  The kids will laugh at Dad!
  The second disc is jammed with extras to keep you entertained for hours.  You even get a couple of mini sequels that are not to be missed.  Now that I've seen both, I can't believe this lost to Shrek for Best Animated Feature.  Shrek, while a fun movie, just doesn't have the heart that Monster's Inc. brings to the table, and for me, that tips the scales in Pixar's favor!
  So, if you've made it this far, and are on the fence about the movie, let's see:
1) If you have kids, they'll want this movie.
2) You'll enjoy watching this movie with your kids.

One can certainly get lost in all the material hidden behind any of the doors.  I wished they had showm more about the actual sound making and speech overlay.  Especially of that of the little girl - Boo.  My favorite character.  So adorable.

1446859,5,B00005JKDR,"The creators of the animated blockbuster ""Toy Story"" open the door to a whole new world of imagination in the very funny animated fantasy ""Monsters, Inc"". In the amazing world of Monstropolis, James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are the top-notch scare duo of Monsters, Inc. When an unsuspected human child crosses over to their world, Sullivan and Mike must keep their new guest a secret and learn that humans aren't that scary. ""Monsters, Inc"" is the fourth animated movie produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The 2001 animated blockbuster is an inventive and delightful family comedy with a superb voice cast and incredible animation. The story is original, funny and appealing for all audiences. The computer animation is simply groundbreaking. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver great comic performances. The voice cast also includes Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly and Academy Award winner James Coburn. ""Monsters' Inc"" won the Academy Award for Best Song.

Disney dishes out one monstrous DVD. The animated blockbuster is presented in both THX-certified 1.85:1 widescreen and standard full screen formats. The DVD contains an exceptionally sharp picture quality with bright colors and a positively excellent Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound. This fully-loaded 2-disc DVD includes audio commentary with directors Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich and executive producers, several deleted scenes, very funny outtakes, multiple behind-the-scenes featurettes in the production of ""Monsters, Inc."", the amusing animated short ""Mike's New Car"" and sneak peeks of upcoming Disney movies. The interactive DVD menus are very appealing. With its impressive viewing quality and enjoyable features, ""Monsters, Inc"" scores a solid ""A"".",1032912000,5,1769,5.650375939849624
1446860,4,B00005JKDR,"At Pixar Animation, the love of detail both seen and unseen is expressed in the company mantra: ""We sand the undersides of the drawers."" The fruits of this obsession are on display in the DVD release of ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the animation blockbuster that examines when bad things happen to things that go bump in the night.
The Buena Vista Home Entertainment release sprawls over two discs, with a clear separation of extras for kids (they enter a door marked Monsters) and adults (Humans). The segregation is helpful, but everyone will want to go everywhere anyway. A new ""Monster's, Inc."" cartoon (""Mike's New Car"") exclusive to the disc should delight everyone, regardless of age. It includes what could be a dubious first: a cartoon character using a cell phone when trouble strikes.
The crush of special features can be a bit much, so the chronically zany folks at Pixar do their best to help along viewers. Clad in Hawaiian shirts and groomed for Disneyland duty, key filmmakers do video intros for many of the extras categories.  Civilians will find the filmmakers' commentary quite a challenge, however. Away from the visual arena, the men of Pixar lose their zip, with the discussion devolving into a survey of the film's problem-solving process. As with many group commentaries, it's hard to tell who is talking -- and when they drift off into a long discussion about the Sock, you probably won't care.
 ""Monsters, Inc."" looks great, of course. Those lucky enough to first see the film in theaters with digital projection will find the look a bit soft, but the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes. The Dolby Digital EX 5.1 mix sounds solid and focused, with the rear channels used effectively for some dialogue. Voice talents Billy Crystal (the motor-mouthed, one-eyed Mike Wazowski), John Goodman (Sulley) and Jennifer Tilly are seen on the job. One extra, a Sulley and Mike game developed for a Japanese TV show, was ""very creepy,"" my kid noted.",1032825600,,1972,4.918918918918919

I managed to stay awake easily throughout the whole thing.  The movie had the best graphics I have seen yet in an animated movie.  Also the cast was second to none.  After the movie started it was easy to find yourself in the monsters world.  The humor and overall storyline was very good.  I will watch this movie many more times in the future.

1446865,4,B00005JKDR,"MONSTERS, INC. is a movie that when I saw it in the theatre didn't really knock my socks off as I thought it would. Juts a few things short of interesting and for me, not as entertaining as Toy Story or A Bug's Life. (Even Toy Story 2 was a little better than this.)
Some standout performances by Billy Crystal (America's Sweethearts, Analyze That) and John Goodman (Emperor's New Groove, What Planet Are You From?)and even Jennifer Tilly (Stuart Little, The Muse) and of course some great gag bits and slapstick humor for a computer generated film. Directed by Peter Doctor (writer of Toy Story 1 & 2) who gives the film a flavor of color and flare.
The story is that of the concept that monsters scare you under your bed in and in your closet as a kid and this is how they do it. Very mechanical and very routine. Their job is to collect the screams of the scars and then turn it into power and energy for Monstropolis. There is one fear; the Monsters are more scared of the kids they scare then the kids themselves. Guess what? One gets in the Monster world. I'll let you imagine what happens next.
Now the DVD extra's are amazing. There is a very funny NEW short called Mike's New Car, which is short but hysterical. There are games, and Monster training videos and manuals and CDRom extras too. Music videos and a ton of production information on how the film was made and produced. The extras on the DVD are worth it alone. You'll enjoy this one. (9-22-02)",1032652800,,1462,4.4185185185185185

***1/2 - FILM
***** - DVD
I just bought the DVD, watched it and can't help but sell-all-out on just how well done the film is and just how special the DVD edition was. I had heard mixed reviews from everybody; People who's taste I trust, people who hate movies like this one, and others who can't decide whether they enjoyed it or not; when the movie first came out in theaters.
My opinion:
I liked everything about both TOY STORY films, didn't care much for A BUG'S LIFE's story/plot though I still enjoyed the genre of completely computer composed cinema, but as for MONSTERS, INC., I am completely sold on Disney's wizards at PIXAR and permanently at that...they are the one's responsible for everyone else's computer/CGI movie-toons $ucce$$.
SHREK & ICE AGE <--- (which I've yet to see) are feeding off PIXAR's unique style & it's popularity due to critics and audience approval at the box office.
All of them are great to watch and especially interesting to see how they are put together. The time consumation involved is more than most mere mortals dare to bare. The perfection of this new art doesn't seem effortless - in the way that anyone with the CA$H could accomplish. The stories, characters, and overall production is always the foundation but, the quality of it's originality, awe-inspiring jaw dropping finesse & flow keeps all who still have ""the child inside"" begging for more. Even if it isn't Disney/PIXAR branded, the similair styled films companies know they have a mint and will continue to keep on trying to one-up the other.
Now, if you are a fan of the STAR WARS - Episode 1 DVD's features and mind boggling behind the scenes info & eye candies, MONSTERS, INC. will fill in that void/absense & fanboy NEED until STAR WARS - Episode 2 & SPIDER-MAN come out in November.
Sit back, watch the flick, set your opinions aside until the final scene is through...you'll realize & see the same thing I did. If you don't, you fall into the category of people who hate movies like this one and will be short-changed in the long run.
Watch and enjoy just how SCARY it is to feel like a kid again, seeing something new and original for the very first time redone, redone, & redone again until this film genre is narrowed down to perfection.",1032652800,3,2365,4.6875

1446889,4,B00005JKDR,"""Monsters Inc"" is first-rate family entertainment. This Pixar Studios production is visually stunning and shows off digital computer technology at its finest. Its monsters wouldn't scare the average four-year old, which is what the moviemakers intended. This is sheer fantasy, and delightful fantasy at that. Adults should know that the movie lacks the sophistication of ""Shrek"", ""Antz"" or other Pixar works like ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"".
In this highly imaginative tale, those monsters who come out of kids' closets at night are actually residents of Monstropolis, where energy is provided by the screams the creatures elicit from unsuspecting children. Times are tough, though, because kids today aren't so easily frightened. The monsters must never actually touch any child because they believe that human beings are deadly poisonous. So, the beasts are actually more frightened of kids than kids are of them. [Who knew?] Much comedy and pandemonium results when a little child called Boo follows one of the monsters, Sully, into Monstropolis.
For kids, this is one of the best animated features ever made. For adults, it is painless to sit through and, for the most part, quite entertaining.",1032652800,7,1200,5.287958115183246
1446890,5,B00005JKDR,"An energy crisis in Monstropolis means that the scarers at Monsters Inc. whose daily job it is to scare children from their closets have to work harder to provide the city with energy. As an ad for Monsters Inc. says, ""We scare because we care.""
The concept is imaginative and brilliant--each assistant works the machinery to put the door in place. The door is aligned with the closet door of a sleeping kid. The monster enters, scares the kid, filling a yellow energy cannister. John ""Sully"" Sullivan, a giant blue and purple furred ursine monster, and his assistant/pal Mike Wazowski, a fast-talking, wisecracking small green ball with a large eye, horns, and toothy smile, are the top scarer team. Right behind him is Randall, a nasty purple lizard with chameleonic talents who hates Sully and wants nothing more than to topple the friendly and loyally dependable giant from the top.
CEO James Watternoose, a gray multiocular creature with crustacean body, is concerned of the crisis and difficulties. Kids are depersonalized with violence and horror, Georgie, a scarer, accidentally has a kid's sock on him and has to be shaved and decontaminated, temporarily putting the Scare Floor out of action, and new scarer recruits aren't cutting it.
Sully goes back to the scare floor to retrieve some paperwork so Mike can go on a date. He sees a door still in place and lo and behold, encounters a little girl. To say he panics is an understatement. Monstropolis soon goes into crisis mode, complete with yellow-suited members of the Child Detection Agency. Seems that the running myth here is that children are toxic. ""A single touch can kill you."" Yet Sully realizes that maybe Boo, (the little girl) might be safe to touch, and he becomes attached to her, to the chagrin of Mike. The simple solution would be to find her door and return her, which it is, but that would end the movie too quickly.
The key thing though is that throughout it all, all the monsters are anthropomorphs--they have basic human characteristics. If I close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue, I'd imagine a slapstick comedy. Even Roz, the raspy-voiced slug-like matron of accounting with pence-nez and a quiff of white hair, who's forever reminding Mike to turn in his paperwork, is human-like.
Mike Wazowski was tailor-made for Billy Crystal what with his fast-talker/charmer personality. Most of the triumphant dialogue is his to chew through. Ditto for Steve Buscemi, whose vocal talents exudes wonders as the slimy Randall. John Goodman's Sully is the most tender-hearted and most human character. The scenes when he faints four times in a row is funny. But other monsters who have a few lines are merely stunning even in their brief appearance. Check out the slug janitor who gives a satisfied nod at cleaning a spot on the floor. He departs leaving a trail of slime behind him.
Influences include the 1970's energy crisis, Mike's accent and schtick, which recalls the 1940's, jazz music from the 1940's, the Abominable Snowman, the Right Stuff style entrance of the scarers, The Invisible Man, the CIA, SWAT Teams, Medusa (Celia's hair), Star Wars (the filtered voice of the CDA members modelled after Imperial stormtroopers), and the opening scene of Star Trek II.
Oh yes. The opening For The Birds short feature involving a bunch of parochial sparrows and a large goony-bird on a telephone wire is just as enjoyable. And the Mike's New Car feature shown right after the credits has Mike having trouble with his six-wheel drive. And the bloopers segment shows that a certain monster does have a sense of humor after all.
Monsters Inc. is not only the most creative animated films I've seen since Twice Upon A Time, but the funniest. It's one movie I actually went to see twice at the theatres, and I don't do that often.

The premise is cute: in the world of Monstropolis, the inhabitants are all monsters whose job everyday is to scare all the world's children to power their city, which is quite charming. We focus in on two particular monsters: Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and his pal Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sully is trying to maintain his status as the #1 scarer of all in Monstropolis. But when a young sweet little girl crawls her way through her door into the world of Monstropolis, it's up to Mikey and Sully to get her back before everyone sees her and causes widespread panic, as humans are thought of as ""toxic"" in the world of Monstropolis.

1446893,5,B00005JKDR,"Even if you aren't able to watch the DVD edition of Monsters, Inc, the VHS version is still laced with a few extras to enjoy at the beginning and the end of the film.
""For The Birds"", the Academy Award Pixar short winner plays first, a wonderfully modest computer animation of little birds getting their just deserts when crossing power with a bigger bird while perched on a telephone wire. It is continuously the most hilarious 5-minute story you'll ever watch. We are also indulged to a small clip of Pixar's new movie ""Finding Nemo"" (coming to theaters in 2003), detailing the life of a young fish stolen from his coral reef home and the search his timid father must undergo to find him.
Next is the movie Monsters, Inc. the magnificent comedy that can be enjoyed by ANY age group. I am endlessly amazed just how clever the people at Pixar are, no detail is overlooked and the film flows with such energy and intellect the story is essentially believable.
While the credits roll, we are treated to the bloopers that were later added to the theatrical release. A few include James stumbling up while entering the scare floor, Roz popping up in random places and your average character accidents like messing up lines. After the outtakes, Pixar ingeniously created the cast to perform, ""Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me!"" the play Mike and Sulley claimed they were rehearsing during the movie to cover up an argument (returning Boo to the human world), which duplicates the entire film's plotline into a musical rendition.
After the film, the animated short ""Mike's New Car"" is included, which has Mike showing Sulley his new 6-wheel drive vehicle that completely explodes with various mechanical problems. Not as funny as the movie itself or ""For the Birds"" in my opinion, yet still a delight.
Overall, everything about the tape is just superb, I highly recommend adding it to your Disney/Pixar collection.",1032566400,8,1928,4.792792792792793

Summary:
Great movie for kids and adults with lovable characters and side splitting laughter. Great Pixar quality animation, great and imaginative script, great acting voices (Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully) that really fit their parts, high quality comedy (some slapstick) great directing, great music.
DVD Features:
The DVD extra material are plentiful and excellent!  Definitely well worth the purchase!
Great Director's Commentary; great tour of Pixar; great presentation of the animation process, etc.
""Mikey's New Car"" is a great little short feature; etc. and the ""Birds"" short feature is cute, too!
Review:

This hilarious movie delivers side-splitting laughter!  Everything fits together and is just great! Should be animated DVD of the year!
This is a great DVD to have at home, even if you saw this in the movie theatre.  My daughter saw it in the theatre, but still laughed uncontrollably watching the DVD movie, as well as Mikey's car!  I mean really laughing until she couldn't breath!
Story:
Monsters work for a Corporation (Monsters, Inc.) That supplies energy for their city, Monsteropolis, by capturing the screams (scream energy) of children and monsters compete for the best screams with blue-furred cuddly Sully (Goodman) leading the competition.  Somehow, a charming infant sneaks into Monsteropolis and hooks onto Sully; and whoever gets caught with her will get ""cleaned"" by the ""authorities"" - not a good thing! This throws Sully and one-eyed Mikey (Crystal) into a panic as they stumble against all odds to send the child back without getting caught.
Scare Factor:

While the Monsters may be afraid of the children, there is no need for your kids to be afraid of them.  The movie seems pretty harmless and young children seem to have no problem with the movie concept and scenes.
And, did I mention it was FUNNY?!",1032480000,,1855,5.1395348837209305
1446895,5,B00005JKDR,"Boo makes the whole movie tick.  The concept is soo cute its crazy.  Its like your parent's always told you when you were afraid of animals when you were little.  ""Don't worry its more afraid of you than you are of it.""  Thats the case in this movie.  The Monsters are TERRIFIED of the children.
The monsters go to work everyday at the scare factory, they call up closet doors by this crazy machine that allows them to use real doors that open from the factory to the child's bedroom.  The monsters go into the kids rooms, and attempt to scare them to collect their screams for energy.
They teach the monstors to always leave the doors closed because nothing is more toxic than a child.  And then the inevitable happens, and that's the set up for the movie.  Once Boo arrives on the scene, the monster's whole world is turned upside down.
Boo is wonderful, adorable and lovable.  She steals every scene and totally makes the movie.  As this is a Disney movie, there's something in it for the whole family, jokes all around.
The voices are great (Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buschemi and Jennifer Tilly).  The animation is fabulous, each individual hair on Sully's body moves as the air around him moves.  The story line is classic and entertaining.  Its a must have for all, buy it today and you won't regret it.
This movie teaches kids that there's nothing scary about monsters, they are just as silly as we are.  The moral of the story...Laughter is more powerful than fear any day!!  Enjoy.",1032480000,,1500,4.5655430711610485

When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't sure what to make of it.  Pixar has a brilliant way of not giving away much in their previews so audiences are drawn with curiosity to find out what the writers could possibly do with monsters.  I'm pleased that they came up with a good idea.
The plot of ""Monster's Inc"" is light enough for kids to enjoy and imaginative enough to keep Disney/Pixar's reputation for great movies solid.  There are plenty of sight gags to keep the movie consistently funny and some touching moments to add a ""human"" element to the monster characters.
Also, some great actors lend their voices to this one, including Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the main characters.  These two have great chemistry (even if it is only vocal) just like the kind Tom Hanks and Tim Allen shared in the Toy Story movies.  And look for other comical stylings from actors like Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and John Ratzenberger.
I don't mean to keep going on about Pixar, but, let's face it, their animation is stunning!  Example: Just look at Sully's fur and notice the VERY fine detailing.  The DVD offers a crisp picture so one can fully appreciate all of the hard work that went into each frame of the movie.

Plus, we watched ""Mike's New Car"" before the movie so I could explain what would be coming up. Besure to also watch ""For The Birds"", it's funny & very cute.
If your child tends to be a little on the scared side, then do not allow him or her to watch this...without you right next to him or her. Also watch in in the day time...before bed.

At the main menu one is given 2 doors from which to choose, either one can take the Human Door to the left or the Monster Door to the right.

  MIKES NEW CAR SHORT:  One of the best extras included on this DVD include the new Mikes New Car animated short.  It is a hilarious short that involves Mike showing off his new ""6 wheel drive"" car to Sully.  It definitely met my high expectations of a Pixar short.
  FOR THE BIRDS SHORT:  This is the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film of 2001 from the creators at Pixar.  The looks the birds give each other in this short are great, and this animation is definitely worthy of the award it has received. I was very pleased to see this included on the DVD.
  GUIDE TO IN-JOKES: This is an example of the greatness of this DVD. Most kids are not going to read through these - but adults were kept in mind in the making of these bonus materials. This guide describes and shows you over 20 in-jokes included in the movie.
  FUN FACTORY TOUR OF PIXAR:  I found the tour through the new studios very worth the time watching it.  This is not the boring tour of a building - it is obvious the people at Pixar have fun at their jobs. Not only do the creators give you the grand tour, but also a chimpanzee comes along for the ride. Check out the paper airplane flipping around when you find it in your exploration of this DVD - it leads to a funny Easter egg.
  SOUND EFFECT OPTIONS:  There were 2 things relating to sound that I think are great additions to this collection. The first involves being able to listen to just the sound effects for the length of the entire movie. A great option for those really into sound. Another cool effect is included - a binaural recording. Plug in some headphones to your TV and listen as Billy Crystal and John Goodman demonstrate a really great sound system.
  MONSTER SECTION FOR KIDS:  I loved the fact that one can pick which direction they want to head on this DVD. Walk through the Monster Door and the kids can find everything they want to know about how to become a monster, and they can play a few games along the way. Even the littlest of kids will enjoy the simple games awaiting them in the Monsters Inc. Headquarters. Oh - and listening to the teen-cracking voice of Needleman reading off stats and ""cards"" of each monster is hilarious.
Other Highlights include : Trailers and TV spots, International language section, a TV clip reel (which Mike and Sully introduce Monday Night Football and some holiday gags), Monster Files, Release Materials, Music Video, and much more! Also included is a Trailer for the upcoming Pixar film Finding Nemo.
  This is a DVD definitely worth the price.",1032307200,5,3294,4.457429048414023
1446934,5,B00005JKDR,"It's hard to seperate truth from hype when there is so much written about Pixar's movies, but the truth is, every single one of them is a classic. And the DVD release of Monsters, Inc. is not only a novel story, but an incredible deal when you add up all the extras you get in this 2 disc set.
For the benefit of the two adults in North America who haven't seen it, Monsters, Inc. tells the story of two friends, Sully and Mike who work at Monsters, Inc. generating Scream to power the city of Monstropolis. Sully (the big blue one) accidentally lets a live, human child back into the factory, endangering all life in Monstropolis. Pandemonium ensues as our two heroes try in vain to get her back to her world, and other forces try to stop them. I don't want to spoil the plot be revealing any more, but you will be just as spellbound as your kids as the plot unwinds. The characters and world they live and work in is so well-constructed, you'll be able to enjoy the story again and again.
The DVD contains not only this excellent story, excellently animated, but so many bonuses that you'll be thinking the price tag is wrong: 3 extra animated shorts, outtakes that are hilarious, backstory and information about Monstropolis that will engross children and adults alike.
Monsters, Inc. is a great movie that everyone will like, and the DVD is well-crafted and full of stuff that makes it a great buy also. Don't hesitate to get this new classic!",1032220800,,1447,4.505703422053232

Mike and Sully ae best friends, Sully is the top monster for monsters Inc(he got the most screams.  When Mike and Sully go into a young lady's house, she follows the monsters to the monster world.

1446997,5,B00005JKDR,"I was sitting there watching ""Monsters, Inc."" on DVD, the first time I had seen the film, and kept thinking it was a very good but not a great animated film.  Then we got to the ending and suddenly I find myself crying.  I get weepy over lots of movies, but rarely animated films (""Bambi"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" begin the exceptions that prove the rule).  I think this especially surprised me because I did not think that ""Monsters, Inc."" was going to be that kind of a film.
The story is about Monsters, Inc., a corporation in the Monster world that sends scarers into the bedroom of human children all around the world to capture their screams, which are used to provide energy.  James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan is the best of the best, and Mike is his assistant.  They are going for the all time record when something really, really bad happens: Sully accidentally brings back a little girl from the human world.  At this point, wackiness ensues.
The promotion for this film really made it seem like it the main character was Mike Wazowski, the frenetic one-eyed green dude voiced by Billy Crystal.  But this film is really about James P. Sullivan, the hairy blue giant with John Goodman's voice.  I was sort of disappointed that Crystal was not really stealing each and every scene, sort of like Eddie Murphy did in ""Shrek.""  But this film is clearly Goodman's show (how did they ever avoid giving this man an Emmy for his flawless work on ""Roseanne""?), and he shows you what he can do with just his voice.
Any doubts I had about the rating to give this DVD were quickly settled by the second disk.  You can read the list above of all the goodies you will find there, but the chief joys are (1) the hilarious ""outtakes"" Pixar always managed to come up with for their films; (2) the Original Treatment, which tells the earliest storyline about Johnson, the monster who dreams of being a star scarer; (3) an all-new animated short film, ""Mike's New Car; (4) ""For the Birds,"" the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film; and (5) a behind the scenes look at Crystal and Goodman recording ""If I Didn't Have You.""  I think you will find that with numbers (1), (3) and (4) you might laugh more than you do while watching the actual movie, especially on (3) and (4).  My stomach hurt I was laughing so hard.
So, that's the ""Monsters, Inc."" DVD in a nutshell.  You cry, you laugh.  What more do you need to know?",1031702400,5,2412,4.4771689497716896
1446998,5,B00005JKDR,"The folks at Pixar have really outdone themselves with this joy-filled DVD package, which I was lucky to receive about a month before the official release.
If you have not yet seen the movie, have no fear, buy the DVD, do not rent. You will not regret it. Wildly imaginative, totally hilarious and yet filled with deeper meanings and fine acting, Monster's Inc. is first-rate family entertainment that rewards multiple viewings.
And like other Pixar pictures, Randy Newman's unique musical talent is a wonderful antidote to the schlock you will find in other companies' animated pictures.
As for the 2-disc DVD set, the bonus disc alone is worth the price of admission. Most DVD ""deluxe"" packages that I have seen to date have a haphazard collection of lame ""making of"" features, a few deleted scenes and previews. Not with Monsters Inc. This well-thought out disc is packed with fun games, entertaining documentaries on the movie and on the crazy people at Pixar, and the bonus ""Mike's New Car"" short among the hours of features on this disc. Instead of 90 minutes of movie, you are really getting four or five hours of real entertainment.
The director's commentary track is also a well-thought out addition to the disc, not just an annoying throwaway that you will find on other discs. My wife and I really enjoyed the story behind the story, and the fun that the Pixar folks had in making this movie is infectious.
I can't recommend this enough.
Enjoy!",1031616000,19,1455,4.824
1446999,5,B00005JKDR,"Pixar and Dreamworks score a perfect Ten!  The advances in animation since ""The Toy Story"" are breathtaking.  The villain, Randall, is so shudderingly slinky, I have to invent a new verb for him:  he just ""slimes"" around!
The Monster World is generated by the power of children's screams when said Monster leaps out of the closet.  However, there are problems: the latest generation of children don't seem to scream as much, and the Monster World is running low on power.  All of this must be done without coming into physical contact with said children because they are toxic to the monsters.
Sully, the #1 power-maker, is just as lovable as only John Goodman can make him.  His voice is so comforting; it should be declared a National Treasure.  Mike, done to perfection by Billy Crystal, is Sully's fast talking, one-eyed sidekick.  Little girl, Boo (voice done by a real little girl, Mary Gibbs) is a pocket-sized sweetheart who will make the toughest go ""Awww--"" My whole family were agonizingly stumped over the voice of the Yeti (Abominable Snowman--""who IS that guy?  I KNOW that voice!"")  For other aurally challenged customers, John Ratzenberger is Cliff the Mailman in ""Cheers.""  He carries off the big, dumb but friendly ""I don't know my own strength"" character with aplomb.
The package:  Loaded with goodies.  You have a choice of Widescreen or Pan and Scan.  Has an original short of ""Mike's New Car"" (fairly funny) and a delightful Oscar Winning Animated Short Film, ""For the Birds.""  There are a couple of very primitive games for the toddler set inexplicably (to me) overdubbed from Japanese.  I loved going through the Monster Door that told you how the animation was done and discarded takes.  My favorite was the ""hard to do"" stuff that explained how Sully's furry coat was made to move and blow and get snowed upon.  No one could ever say they were shorted in the ""extras"" department.

1447192,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. looked like a really good animation movie when the commerical's were playing and when it finally came out in the theatres I had to see it the day it came out. The theatre was packed and I was looking forward to the movie.
When the movie started I was very happy and by the time it was over I was sad. The movie was extremly entertaining and it was funyn and it was touching and it was all perfectly combined to make one hell of a movie. I loved it so much about a month later I saw it for a second time with the ""outtakes"" and ""deleted scene""which was very funny.
The plot was simple like all G rated movies. Mike and Sculley are two monsters living in Monstropolis and work for Monsters Inc. Monsters Inc. is a company filled with the doors to kid's bedrooms where the monsters go when there sleeping,scare them,and then collect there screams so they could get power in the town. Scully is Monsters Inc's top scarer and his rival Randell(voiced by Ghost World's Steve Buscemi)wants to take Scully down and become top scarer. One night Randell decides to do some late night scaring without anybody knowing. Scully stays late to to do some of Mike's paperwork and discovers the door. Scully goes inside the door and the little girl behind the door ends up into Monstropolis by accendent. Since monsters are afriad of children Scully runs in fear and Randell is left wondering where the kid behind the door is. Now Scully and Mike have to keep the little girl(who Scully named Boo)a secret or all of Monstropois will be in a panic.
The movie has humor for children and adults alike and the DVD adds to the fun. The DVD is supposed to have a short created just for the videa called ""Mike's New Car"".So see Monster's Inc if you already have not. It's a great movie.",1031356800,10,1775,4.431192660550459

They way the characters play off each other is funny and brilliant and the movie is just full of hysterical dialog and satire [in typical Pixar comic genius style].
Our young daughter loves this film, but we love it even more.  We saw this a couple of times in the theater and look forward to enjoying our DVD version - which includes MANY extras [a whole disc worth] that are fun.
Monsters, Inc is easily the best animated film released in recent years.  This is one you won't mind the kids watching over and over and over and....",1031184000,,813,4.466216216216216
1447195,5,B00005JKDR,"I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy of this DVD, and I highly recommend it. The extras will take you through a plethora of Monster info, including behind the scenes ""flubs"" and ""outtakes"", an Academy Award winning short by Pixar, and even an extra Monster Inc. short for good measure.
The film itself was one I missed in the theater, and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on DVD. From the opening segment, I was hooked. The title sequence is a wonderful throwback to the 1960's, with colorful collages of doors and monsters playing with the titles. Hollywood was always doing that sort of thing in the past for their musicals or comedies, using models, sculptures, and even cartoons for animated title sequences. There's a quaintness about it that is sorely missing from today's movies.
The animation is flawless, and far better than Pixar's breakthrough feature, ""Toy Story"". The monsters are all quite cleverly designed, and there are a wealth of subtle visual gags and jokes that will keep you in stitches. Best of all, adults will enjoy the feature just as much as kids if not more. The creators leaned away from saccharine syrupy sap and went right for the funny bone.
There are quite a few interesting elements, from the closet door storage system and ""launch"" center, to different facets of daily monster life. The idea of monsters collecting the screams of scared kids as an energy source is pretty clever.
The performances are perfect. John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike play off one another as if they were an old comedy team still bantering after a long and successful career together. Steve Buscemi is suitably slimy as Randall, the evil chameleon, and James Coburn lends his voice as the boss of Monsters, Inc. John Ratzenberger pops up as a strikingly Bumble-esque Yeti, and Frank Oz and Bonnie Hunt round out the team.

1447197,5,B00005JKDR,"Without a doubt, this is one of the cutest movies that I have ever seen.  Disney once again puts out one of the finest DVD's on the market in this soon to be classic.  My children can't stop watching it.
Monsters, Inc. is the factory that runs the ""Monster World"" and it is powered by the screams of children all over the world.  The imaginative factory allows the employed monsters to enter the child's room through an elaborate system of doors.  All is going well until the loveable James P. Sullivan (Sulley), played by John Goodman, inadvertantly allows a small child into the factory.  The place is turned upside down in search of the small girl, as children are believed to be toxic and dangerous, but through the ordeal, Sulley learns a great deal about children, and more importantly himself.
The film is masterfully done with state-of-the-art digital picture and sound, not to mention a wonderfully witty dialogue and whimsical plot.  MONSTERS, INC. has a super cast as John Goodman and Billy Crystal are absolutely fabulous, and their timing together couldn't be better.  Throw in the devilishly evil Steve Buscemi and experience of James Colburn just to mention a few, and you have an amazingly interesting group of characters.
This 2-Disc Collector's edition is loaded with bonus features.  The movie, itself, can be viewed in the full screen version which was specifically reframed for standard televisions, or in the widescreen version which is digitally enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  Another nice feature is the all-new short animated film, MIKE'S NEW CAR, which was created exclusively for the DVD, as well as the extremely funny outtakes and never-before-seen deleted scenes.  There are a few games on the second DVD, including the adorable ""Peek-A-Boo"" Door game that will keep you guessing for hours, as well as ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" with Mike and Sulley.  I think my children have played this a thousand times!  Other bonuses include a look at the ""Monstopolis Art Gallery,"" a behind-the-scene's look at the making of the ""If I Didn't Have You,"" and ""For the Birds,"" the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film.

1447250,5,B00005JKDR,"I really loved the Disney/Pixar animated film ""Monsters, Inc."" when I saw it in its initial theatrical release. The marvelous fantasy/comedy takes place mainly in a sort of alternate world populated by a wide variety of colorful and amusing monsters--most notably, Sulley (voiced by John Goodman), a big, lovable blue cross between Bigfoot and Godzilla, and Mike (Billy Crystal), a round, green, one-eyed bundle of manic energy. Together they have a suspenseful and exciting adventure when a human child accidentally crosses over into the monster world. It's a hilarious and heartwarming film that's filled with laughs, thrills, and some marvelous visual images.
The 2-disc DVD edition of the film is loaded with entertaining extras--the bonus disc alone boasts approximately 207 minutes of added material. The extras are cleverly divided into two main groups: ""Monsters Only"" and ""Humans Only."" The first of these groups allow you to go deeper into the imaginary monster world of the film, whereas the second group lets you peek behind the scenes and see the creators of the film at work.
In an attempt to keep this review down to a manageable length, I won't go into detail about all of these marvelous extras. From the ""Human"" side of house, it's fun to see the film's director and the other behind-the-scenes talents get to speak to the viewer directly. You also get a taste of what it's like to work at Pixar studios. Also fun is a look at the film's friendship song, with commentary by songwriter Randy Newman.
Particularly interesting is the huge gallery of concept art (some still, some animated) that documents how some concepts in the film changed by the time it reached its finished form. You get to see a version of Mike with no arms, versions of Sully with tentacles instead of legs, and more oddities. For technophiles, the extras go into details about the efforts to get the computer animation program to render Sully's fur properly. I also loved the gallery of TV ads and theatrical trailers; they remind you of the superb job that was done marketing the film.
The ""Monster"" extras are fun; you get to pretend you're  a new employee at the Monsters, Inc. factory. The extras are packed with details; there's even an employee handbook that you can read. There's also a new short film, ""Mike's New Car,"" in which Goodman and Crystal reprise their vocal roles. All in all, the 2-disc edition of ""Monsters, Inc."" is a masterful example of what can be accomplished with the DVD format.",1031011200,,2496,4.900709219858156
1447251,5,B00005JKDR,"I wouldn't think it's necessary to say much about the story of this film -- to avoid boring people who have seen it, and to avoid possible spoilers for people who haven't (few as there may be).  Of course it's a five-star film.
And what could i say that hasn't been said already by someone, anyway?  I could say this film is wonderful. That it's genuinely heart-warming, and that it legitimately earns every single tear it jerks... and that the last shot is one of the most wonderful moments i've ever seen in this sort of film.  That the characterisations are spot on -- John Goodman's Sully and Billy Crystal's Mike are absolutely believable as roommate/buddies.  The computer animation is, as usual with Pixar, state-of-the-art (and, by this time, i think we can safely say that the technique is *not* just a passing fad).
The script is excellent, and the basic concept, that little childrens' screams, captured by appropriate machinery, power Monsteropolis, making scream collection of paramount importance (at least, until one big-hearted monster actually comes to *know* a child), is a very nice conceit on which to hang the story.
And that last shot...
But the DVD set -- ah, THERE is something to talk about... and that earns another five star rating.
I have had this set in my hands for a bit over a week, and i still haven't exhausted all of its possibilities. (I have found one easter egg, by the way; i'm sure there are more.)
DISC ONE:
Trailers, of course, for older films coming out on video/DVD, newer direct-to-video releases, and upcoming theatrical releases, at least one of which looks Impressive.
The movie, available in either widescreen or standard TV format.  The nice part here is that, unlike conventional films, shot widescreen, it was not necessary to cut off parts of the screen image to make the film fill the screen.  Instead, it was quite simple to merely have the computer make two versions of each image, the same width but to show *extra* space at the top and bottom of the frame to fill up the full height of the TV screen without having to cut anything from the width of the image.  I'd still watch it in widescreen, since that is the way the shots were actually planned, and the extra at top and bottom might alter the composition.  (I found it a bit annoying tohave to select widescreen or full;screen format every time i played the film.)
Sound is impeccable (there is a THX Optimiser on the disc), and, in addition to the regular track and the commentary track, there is a third track of nothjing but sound effects. (I would have liked another track or two -- say, one with commentary by Goodman and Crystal and other voice actors, and another with nothing but the music cues, maybe, but what there is is excellent.)
The commentary, by director Pete Docter, co-director Lee Unkrich and executive producers John Lassiter and Andrew Stanton covers a lot of odds and ends, including explaining places in the film where they had originally planned to something differently and why they changed it, explaining some of the tricky bits of the animation and some of the problems they encountered and had to solve during production -- standard enough stuff for such a commentary, but interesting.
DISC TWO:
Here's the good stuff.
More than i can describe, actually, though certainly i have to mention the two short films -- ""Mike's New Car"", created especially for this release, and ""For the Birds"", an absolutely hilarious short wich won the ""Animated Short Film"" Oscar for 2001, and richly deserved it.  One has the impression that its makers had carefully watched and absorbed every single Roadrunner cartoon.
There are ""Outtakes"", which are hilarious, even funnier than the outtakes at the end of a Jackie Chan film, which lead into the Monsters Inc employee play.
The main part of the disc is divided between ""Humans Only"" and ""Monsters Only"" segments:
Under ""Humans Only"", there are multiple sections:
One about Pixar, itself.
""Story"", about how the film's story developed, compared to the form it finally took, with storyboards and ""Banished Concepts"".
A ""Monster File"" with cast, concepts and a piece on ""What Makes a Great Monster?"".
A ""Design"" section (which includes a ""Guide to 'In' Jokes"")
An ""Animation"" section, which walks us through the entire animation process, as well as showing ""Early Tests"" and ""Hard Parts"" and finishes with a ""Production Demonstration"", in which the viewer can switch on the fly between several views of the production process from storyboards to finished scene (using the ""Angle"" button on their remote).
There is a ""Music & Sound"" section, which includes commentary on the sound design process and a demonstration of bunaural recording (have headphones handy).  I could have wished for a segment here on Randy Newman, his music for the film, and how he works with the Pixar people to produce such perfect music...  well, maybe next time.
And, finally, a section on the film's original release, including a visit to thepremiere, trailers and TV spots, and samples of things that had to be changed for other-language versions (there is, for instance, one sequence which had to be completely changed, because it involved a bit of pantomime which visually punned on an English-only word sound) and then gives us a really neet clip in which the action plays smoothly along with the soundtrack switching languages every few seconds.
The ""Monsters Only"" menu gives us a few things:
""New Monster Adventures"", which includes ""Mike's New Car"" , a music video and material featuring ""Monsters Inc"" characters created for a Japanese TV program (I haven't watched this section yet, i believe it's an interactive game), and two interactive games created for this disc.
""Behind the Screams"" is a section representing primarily the ""Outtakes"" and the ""Company Play"", also found on Disc One.
and, finally, ""Orientation"" is your welcome as a new employee of Monsters Inc.
I understand that this disc has some enhanced features for use in a computer DVD ROM drive, but i haven't experimented with that yet.

1447253,5,B00005JKDR,"Having a young child, we were waiting for this movie to come out on cable or dvd -- no chance of going to a theater yet! So we were delighted to receive an advance copy from an online store and Disney/PIXAR. We've watched the film at least six times in the past four days.

The movie is terrific -- one of those films that children of different ages can enjoy AND adults can watch multiple times without going insane. This is the story of Monsters Incorporated, an energy supply company based in Monstropolis. In this reality, energy comes in the form of children's screams, and to that end Monsters, Inc. employees emerge from closets all over the world in order to collect a few GigaHowls and keep everyone's lamps and toasters running. The best scare team at Monsters, Inc.  is John ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal).

One evening after hours, a child gets through a closet door and enters Monstropolis. Not good, considering monsters are scared of kids and believe their touch is toxic. Over the course of the movie Sulley and even Mike become attached to ""Boo"", risking health and careers to get her back to her home.  In the meantime, incorrigible adorable Boo is having a great time scaring all the big monsters.

The film is incredibly well done, as technically flawless as earlier PIXAR productions, the Toy Story series and A Bug's Life, but even funnier.  John Goodman perfectly voices gentle, affable Sulley, and Billy Crystal creates Mike, a frantic egotist who is also optimistic and loyal.  In other words, with more depth than half the human characters being written today. The animation is stunning, and the story is lots of fun.  Nothing here to disturb little kids, and a lot to entertain them. The only part I didn't like much was the opening credit sequence, which was reminiscent of 60s bedroom farces, but that's what the Select Scene feature is for.

There are two discs here. On Disc One you can view the film in fullscreen or widescreen format.  Audio commentary by the director and staff is available with the latter. English captions, audio and video optimizers, and sneak peeks at PIXAR's upcoming ""Finding Nemo"" and Disney's ""Lilo & Stitch"" are also here. Disc Two contains almost three-and-a-half hours of amazing dvd extras. There's an interesting 20-minute tour of PIXAR; a very funny bloopers reel (that also plays during the credits of the fullscreen version); storyboards; deleted scenes; recording studio footage; character design; trailers and tv spots; footage of the Hollywood premiere; discussion of tie-in toys; a poster gallery; two Monsters Inc.-related segments from Ponkickies, a goofy Japanese animated show; Peek-a-Boo, a game; a history of Monster World; a Monsters Inc. employee handbook; and an introduction to Monsters Inc.'s version of baseball cards called Scarer Cards. The 13-minute original treatment and several scenes from an alternative story are presented that are as funny as the one that made it to the screen.

Our favorite extras were the outtakes; a new animated short, ""Mike's Car""; the Oscar winning PIXAR short, ""For the Birds""; fly-arounds of several movie locations; the guide to ""in"" jokes (eg, the appearance of Toy Story 2's Jessie when Boo is showing her favorite toys to Sulley); a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the technical wizardry required to produce complex backgrounds, Sulley's fur, Boo's shirt and the city of Monstropolis; being able to watch a scene as it was done in storyboard, layout, animation or finished presentation; and a fun 4-minute clip with a few seconds of dialogue in each of the 30+ languages into which the film was translated. There's even a brief appearance by PIXAR CEO Steve Jobs.

Packaging and foldout are nice, and include a contest entry form (to win Disney dvds), a free tie-in storybook offer, and a coupon book (for popcorn; Monsters Inc. tie-ins; Disney storybooks, videos and dvds; and Disney on Ice). With one exception we ran everything on our dvd player without a glitch, and could not be more pleased with this very funny family film and the many many extra features.

Highest recommendation.",1030838400,16,4157,4.998552821997106
1447254,5,B00005JKDR,"I loved this movie in the theaters (saw it 3 times in one week) and I love it even more on DVD.  How is that possible you ask?  Well, this 2-disc set is simply jammed packed with monsterously good information and entertainment for the entire family.
Disc 1 - A smile immediately came to my face when the widesceen version played as a default (you can select the fullscreen version from the menu).  But the widescreen issue isn't as big a deal with PIXAR films since they restructure each frame of the film for a fullscreen presentation.  I haven't read any cooberating info but this seems to be the case with Monsters, Inc. too.  The only other options on this disc are a directors commentary (quite good, with minimal pauses) and an option to watch the film with an isolated sound effects track (very cool).
Disc 2 - After you've watched the movie it's time to delve into the worlds of PIXAR and Monsters, Inc.  The disc is separated into the Monster World which is aimed at kids and the young at heart and the Human World which offers much more depth and insight into the creation of the film.  The games offered in Monster World are fun and easy to learn.  Slowly but surely, games offered on DVD are getting better every day.  And lest I forget the Monster Handbook is a laugh riot!  There is a terrific tour of the new PIXAR studios as well as fly-throughs of some key sets created for the film in The Human World section.  This is also where you will see production art, deleted scenes, the original story treatment as well as a guide to the ""in"" jokes, original trailers, and much much more.  It will take a truly dedicated fan (and most of your day) to sit through it all in one sitting.
All of PIXAR'S DVD releases have been stellar and Monster, Inc. pushes the bar even higher.  By keeping the fun level high (keep an eye out for a wacky monkey) as well as separating the features into a fun and games section and a making-of section they have created a flawless DVD presentation and proved the old addage, ""monsters lead such interesting lives.""",1030838400,14,2056,4.450666666666667
1447255,5,B00005JKDR,"If your kids (or you) have ever been worried about what lurks behind that closet door, this is the film you've been waiting for!  Not only do you get to see a delightful conceptualization of the monster world, but you get to see how good things can be when you face the things that scare you.  Lovable fuzzy monster James P. Sullivan (aka ""Sully"") and his eyeball shaped side-kick, Mike Wazowski, are best friends who also to work together as partners at Monsters, Incorporated.  Their jobs consist of scaring children around the world, popping out through closet doors and doing their very best to get those boys and girls to scream -- because those screams keep the electrical power running in the monster world.  Mike handles the controls as closet doors drop down into special door holder portals, keeping an eye (literally!) on Sully as he leaps through doorways into the human world.
Sully is the top-scarer at Monsters, Inc., who garners praise from the boss and is often requested to demonstrate his scaring techniques to scaring trainees.  While other monsters might just look scary, Sully has mastered the art of leaping out and roaring to full effect.  Sully's career success incites Randall, another top-scarer at Monsters, Inc, to engage in plotting ways to surpass him.
Sully's world turns upside-down when an adorable little girl follows Sully  back into the monster world... panicking the Monster metropolis (who routinely ""decontaminate"" anything human which finds its way into the monster world).  Sully befriends the little girl, names her ""Boo"", and helps her find a way to get back home without being captured by the overly zealous human-decontamination teams.  Many surprising twists, turns, and sub-plots lead to a particularly satisfying conclusion.  This is one movie you won't easily second-guess, and the action scenes are spectacular!  The special effects are excellent and add a lot to the thrilling story... but what gives this film it's soul is the outstanding vocal talent of it's entire human cast (which includes John Goodman and Billy Crystal).
Besides getting an awesome DVD movie, this 2-DVD set includes some wonderful extras that are truly worth the money.  There is a very funny Academy award-winning short called, ""For the Birds"", a hilarious animated short made just for this DVD release called, ""Mike's New Car"", a special feature on the making of the original Randy Newman song ""If I Didn't Have You"", some very funny story board monsters, a wonderful game, a feature that shows how this story was originally written... and much, much more.

1447256,5,B00005JKDR,"From start to finish this movie is pure joy for the whole family. We start with a unique storyline in a part of the world where all of the monsters live and work. Their job is to come through the closet doors of unsuspecting children as they sleep at night, and scare them. The screams are collected for power that lights their world.
The glitch is the monsters are deathly afraid of the children and when one sweet child finds her way back through the closet, chaos erupts for our ""#1 scarer"" Sully, whose voice is creatively executed by John Goodman. The fun is fast and furious, as Sully, and Mike his sidekick, an eyeball with teeth and skinny green legs, performed by Billy Crystal, feel compelled to keep her safe from and evil plot that is lurking in the underworld of Monsters, Inc.
Wonderfully imaginative, with bright vivid colors, animation so sharp you can see each and every piece of fur on Sully as it ruffles in the breeze, and characters you will fall in love with. This DVD is a big-time winner for the whole family.  Kelsana 8/31/02",1030752000,2,1050,4.526315789473684

1447298,4,B00005JKDR,"Kids have always loved monsters, and both kids and grown ups will likely love MONSTERS, INC., a surprisingly witty fantasy that finds the citizens of Monster World popping through closet doors to collect screams--screams that are converted into the power that makes everything from cars to televisions sets run in Monster World.  And Sully (voiced by John Goodman) is the top scream-gatherer at the factory... until he accidentally allows a human child to wander into Monster World and runs afoul of a jealous co-worker's plot to unseat him from the top spot.  The humor is surprisingly sly, and there's plenty for all generations to enjoy.
Although TOY STORY was impressive, Pixar's computer animations have come a long way since then, and MONSTERS, INC. is memorable for both design and visual depth.  And the Special Collector's DVD has a large package of bonus material that will appeal to any one interested in how the film was created.  But there's also plenty on the ""pure entertainment"" side.  The bonus material DVD includes the extremely memorable and hilariously funny animated short ""For the Birds,"" a very enjoyable animated short ""Mike's New Car"" (featuring characters from MONSTERS, INC.), and a tour of the scream factory from a new employee's point of view.  There are also some games that will appeal to the youngest viewers as well--in fact, the bonus material has so much to explore that it will keep both youngsters and young at heart busy for quite a long time.
But the actual movie is the important thing--and it looks and sounds absolutely great on this DVD, which gives you the option of seeing it widescreen or full screen and hearing it in surround sound.  It's all beautifully done, and fans of animated film--and especially of computer animated films--will find this well worth the bucks.  Recommended.",1030492800,3,1831,5.01980198019802

The dramatic premise of the movie centers around the following dilemma:  what to do when your ace scary monster finds a kid too adorable to play Mr. bad guy?  Oh, my, Nietzsche would have been thrilled with this one...
The animation in this flick is spectacular.  Some of the sequences are sort of a cross between THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS and DR. WHO.  Featuring the vocal talents of John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi, this is a rip-roaring hilarious good time for the whole family.  Kids will love it.

1447300,5,B00005JKDR,"Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.

And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), ""Monsters Inc"" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best. It has brilliant animation, delightful characters (""Mike Wazowski!""), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.

The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.

The top Scarer is James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.

Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named ""Boo"") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.

Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.

The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue (""What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?"" ""I get a time out?"" ""Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?"" ""... painted?""). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).

However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story --  Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it (""I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!"").

John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo (""One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!""). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.

It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual ""working joe"" environment -- ""Monsters Inc"" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.",1030492800,9,3354,4.941385435168739
1447301,5,B00005JKDR,"Admittedly, I am a fan of Pixar's work. Their artists have done some incredible animated features over the years. Between the ""Toy Story"" movies and ""A Bug's Life,"" they have managed in a short time to build an impressive track record. Their shorts are also among the best ever produced. So my expectations going into this movie were very high.
The story concerns the monsters in your closet. The theory being that their world runs of the energy produced by children's screams. Sulley (John Goodman) is number one at getting screams. His main rival (Steve Buschemi) will do anything to gain the top spot. Oh, and they consider the touch of a human child to be toxic.
While not as instantly relatable as ""Toy Story,"" the movie builds on the talents of Goodman and Billy Crystal (Mike) to bring you into this make-believe world as Sulley and Mike try to get little Boo back through the closet door to the safety of her bedroom.
Disney/Pixar has presented this well on DVD. Both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions are available on the first disc. The second disc has games, outtakes, an award winning animated short, and a fun (easy to find) Easter Egg.
All in all, if you enjoy Pixar's work, or animated features in general, this is a must have for your collection.",1030320000,51,1263,4.642857142857143
1447302,5,B00005JKDR,"Monster's Inc is the factory that supplies all the energy for Monstropolis, a city that humans never heard of and cannot see. The energy is derived from the screams of children who are tormented during the night by monsters who work for the company. The monsters enter through a fabricated bedroom (closet)door, scare the child, and the child's screams are bottled up and saved as an energy source. Immoral but ingenious!
John Goodman is the voice of James Sullivan (Sulley), the best ""scarer"" of the lot, revered by his fellow associates. His sidekick Mike (Billy Crystal) is a one-eyed ""lover boy"" and jokester. Randall is a nemesis who desperately wants to unseat Sulley as the number one scarer and devises a plot to cheat his way to the top. The plot backfires when Sulley accidentally discovers Randall's plan and ends up bringing an adorable little child into the Monster-World unexpectedly. That's when the real fun starts and it doesn't let up until the closing credits roll across the screen at the end.
The Collector's Edition 2-Disc DVD has several enteratining bonus features: Mike's New Car (animated short), For The Birds (Academy Award winning animated short), A preview of Disney/Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" (slated for Summer 2003 release), and outtakes and bloopers from Monster's Inc. There are also 2 additional interactive features: Monster World lets you go through first day training as an employee at the  Monster's Inc factory (and also includes a history of the Monster's Inc world and a few games). The Human World takes you behind the scenes at the Pixar animation studios and also gives us a peek at deleted scenes.

The movie itself is wonderful and includes the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn. As you probably already know the storyline, I'll just talk about DVD.
You get 2 discs- one contains the movie itself (with the ""full screen"" or ""widescreen"" versions, as well as a director's commentary option)and the second disc is chock full of goodies! You get ""For the Birds"" the 2001 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film (shown in theaters before the movie), and ""Mike's New Car"" (exclusively created for the video and DVD release, as well as an exclusive sneak peek of ""Finding Nemo"", the newest upcoming release from Disney starring Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Willem Dafoe.

The ""Monster World"" door is where the real fun starts- train for your first day at Monster's Inc.; see the employee handbook, and play the ""Boo's Door Game"", which works like a CD rom-type game. Use your remote control to go through doors and find pieces of Boo's door that come together like a puzzle. The kids and I had tons of fun playing this together.

1447306,5,B00005JKDR,"The best films, regardless if they're for kids or adults, all have the same thing in common--great storytelling, characterizations and imaginative direction. Pixar's Monsters, Inc. has all three in spades. From the film's satirical opening m inutes (with its parody of commericals and corporate America)to its last suspense filled frames, Monsters, Inc. packs humor and heart into a fun filled movie. Director Pete Doctor has crafted a film that entertains whether watched for the first time for the tenth.
John Goodman's performance as Sully and Billy Crystal's performance as Mike demonstrate that not all the best acting is found in serious high minded films. Both give comedic performances that rival the best live action work each has done. What's particularly memorable about the film is the imaginative voice casting. Without the right performer, the best animation won't reach an audience. Monsters, Inc. manages to do both exceptionally well. The opening titles (with their witty reference to the old Gerald McBong McBong cartoons)can't even begin to prepare you for the fun that follows.
The extras on this 2 DVD set are particularly fun. The animated short about Mike's new car is a blast (it's only found on the video version) and the inside look at Pixar shows us not only who comes up with these nutty ideas but how they give birth to them as well. There's also a section that shows viewers where all the inside jokes are (although I have the sneaking suspicion that there are still a few gems hidden in there somewhere). The Boo game is fun for little ones and the DVD-Rom features are a nice addition as well.
The digital picture transfer is spectacular. The widescreen and standard screen formats are both available on the same disc (like with Toy Story 2). It's amazing how detailed the sound effects are on films like this. Viewers could listen to this film and still chuckle.
I'd also like to comment on Randy Newman's score. Newman is probably one of the most under rated songwriters/film scorers around. His work on this film (like his best work including his great score for Ragtime) helps accent the action and humor. Newman's sardonic wit is the perfect compliment to Pixar's films.
 Monsters, Inc. (like Toy Story before it) has set a new benchmark for animated family films; it's sleek, intelligent and funny managing to reach kids and adults equally well.",1030147200,7,2383,4.972431077694235

Of all the Disney movies, the Pixars are our favorite, and this is the best of all of them, in our opinion. I can see why Disney will make a fortune on this movie as they did with all the other Pixar movies--they appeal to the whole family, so it is no hardship to the parents to sit through the show multiple times with their eager kids, and, of course, we all want to own the DVD!
Speaking of which, this DVD is a 2-disc collector's edition with many bonus features, including several short animated films, the filmmakers' audio commentary, and hilarious outtakes. You also have a chance to tour and become an employee at the Monsters, Inc. Factory and also take a tour of the real-live Pixar Animation Studios.
As for Monsters, Inc., itself, what I personally love most of all in the Pixar movies is the great humor, and this movie is a scream. Billy Crystal (When Harry Met Sally) is one of my favorite comedians, and he is wonderful as the voice of Mike Wizowski, a small, one-eyed, monster who is full of hilarious neuroses. John Goodman (The Flintstones) is a favorite comedian of mine, too. The character he voices, the large, loveable, fuzzy monster named James P Sullivan, melds in a perfect, comic team with Billy Crystal's character. Steven Bucemi (Con Air) always does a great job as a scary villain, and he is super as the voice of the slimy Randall Boggs. The actor voicing the tiny girl in the movie is fabulous, too, and the character herself is adorable.
As usual, the Pixar animation is mind-bogglingly gorgeous. My favorite scene in the whole movie is when James P is going through multiple, magical doors into child's room after child's room, all around the world. Some of the animation art in those rooms is so stunning, it could hang in a museum. I particularly liked the Paris bedroom.
Finally, one of the most important parts of a movie is the ending, and I found the closing in this one both funny and very moving.",1030147200,,2073,4.545454545454546

But there's more than that.  You have the chance to explore Monstropolis from a human or monster eye view.  You'll find games and more.  This 2-disc edition is well worth it.
""Monsters, Inc."" is a great family film.  It looks great, sounds great, and tells a good story.  The scenes are full of life and color and imagination.  My kids loved every minute of it.  By taking us into the world of monsters who are trained to scare children, Pixar somehow teaches children not to be afraid.  They demystify the terror of the dark closet, while never forgetting to throw in chuckles for the parents in the audience.  When the monsters' world is turned upside down by the unexpected intrusion of a human child, hysteria breaks loose, and everyone's bound to learn something by the end--with heartwarming and humorous moments galore.

""Monsters, Inc."" is a look at the other side of the closet door, in Pixar's finest animation.  What you'll find through that door is a whole civilization of monsters, who scare children for a living; and one particular monster, James P. Sullivan, brilliantly voiced by John Goodman, who has a run-in with a little girl.  Billy Crystal plays Mike Wazowski, the comic sidekick -- the guy who looks like a one-eyed green soccer ball with arms and legs on the DVD cover; Sullivan is the purplish hairy thing behind him.  They work in a scream factory -- hey, what do you think monsters do all day?  The girl is a toddler, barely verbal, and cute as a bug, and she's the center of some of the funniest action scenes in the movie.
There's not a lot to say about the plot, except that it supports some great action and some pretty good comedy work.  Crystal does a fine job, but Goodman's deadpan delivery is even better -- his ""slumber party"" line was my favourite of the movie.  The slapstick is up to the standard you'd expect, and there are even a couple of lines aimed at the adults that the kids may not quite catch.
In many ways the movie is designed to appeal to a Daddy/daughter combination more than anything else; there's a definite tinge of ""what will I do when my little girl grows up and leaves me?"" to the movie.  I don't want to give anything away, but Dads should watch this with their six year old girls snuggled up next to them.
The only reason I haven't given it five stars is that although it's fun, beautifully-animated, and very well voiced, I don't think it quite has that spark that makes an animated feature a long-term classic, the way some of the best Disney movies are.  It's not a musical, by the way -- there's not a song in it.  But if it isn't the best Disney have ever produced, it does have panache, style, and a sense of humour.  You'll enjoy it, and so will your kid.",1030060800,3,2190,4.364532019704433
1447369,3,B00005JKDR,"While I'm not the biggest fan of Disney flicks, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to check out an advance copy of Monsters Inc's deluxe 2-DVD set. Aside from the amazing CGI work that has made Pixar a pre-eminent production company in the field, I found M-Eye to be a decent presentation that makes little effort to break the hackneyed Disney character format of the strong-yet-gentle hero, his cynical motormouth of a sidekick who always has plenty of snide remarks to lay out, and the slimy, underhanded villain. Interestingly enough, I found the guys who voiced these roles-- John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi, respectively-- to fit their characters perfectly. And the usual silly moments that you'd expect from a Disney toon-film also pop up from time to time. Otherwise, it's a fairly charming and safe movie for the young'uns-- well, except perhaps for the Abominable Snowman's lemon snow cones and the deep belch gag-- and a not-half-bad diversion for the young at heart.
The secondary commentary track, covered by four of the picture's producers and/or directors, discusses the talents of the voice actors and some of the original concepts for the film to a small degree. But for the most part their coverage is on the technical aspects of the flick, such as the difficulties of trying to imitate certain surfaces, textures, and shading in CGI (like Sully's ""fur"", for example). I was especially amused by their discussion of how incredibly cavernous the door-storage facility ""set"" was, which allegedly could fit the Statue of Liberty on each ""floor"", were it a real set. The THX-mastered picture and sound were top-notch in the way of sharpness and clarity.
Much like its other deluxe 2-Disc Disney cinematic brethren (Snow White, Tron, et. al.), The House of The Mouse and Pixar threw in everything but the kitchen sink onto the second platter. There's an entire behind-the-scenes tour of Pixar Studios that outlines the production of Monsters Inc from the voice acting to storyboarding and many other phases of production. There's also an M-Eye 'blooper reel', company play program, deleted scenes, a couple of bonus Pixar shorts (both with commentary tracks), storyboard & concept art galleries, the Monsters, Inc training guide, games for the kids, and lotsa other tchotchkes that'll likely take many hours for you to go through. If you don't find one part of interest, simply check something else out!
Then there's the 'practical' special features. The English subtitles match up very well with the spoken dialogue, and even describe some of the sounds being made in each scene. You can also select between widescreen and standard pan-and-scan presentations! You know, just in case your TV screen isn't big enough for you to fully appreciate the widescreen format, or something of the like...

I think the best part of the whole movie (I won't reveal everything) was the chase scene. The setting of Monsters, Inc. (the company itself) fits in perfectly for the chasing, and it was funny, too, which you never expect when you're being chased by a bad guy!

The way that they show how monsters supposedly live is amazing. Who would ever think that it was a job and how they made a living? I never thought that they'd have competition in how many scares they make. And who knew that they were scared of touching humans?!
In this movie, the monsters have a change in heart. They finally understand that they don't have to scare to get their job done. They can keep kids happy with humor. And they are no longer scared of being close to humans.

1447489,5,B00005JKDR,"...While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work. The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.
It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power. It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.
There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures. One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team. Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.
But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's. It's wondrous and funny. In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.
John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee. He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children. He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.
Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye. His comedy is seen through out the movie. Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent. Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.
Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart. Her job is to keep him out of trouble.
I give Monsters, Inc. a ten. It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It makes for great family fun. I also loved the hilarious outtakes with of course, Roz.

Being a computer animation buff since the early days (TRON, Liquid TV, etc.) I was blown away by some of the visuals in this film.  Sully's hair is the most realistic to date in CG films.  The scene in the snowstorm blew my mind!  The lighting, Sully's hair blowing everywhere, etc. was a real visual treat.  The rendering of water was also the most realistic I have seen to date.

From the first few minutes of this film I was captivated and immediately knew that it would be a classic. This is easily the best animated film of 2001 and is so good that it can be compared to some live action movies.
 The plot of this Pixar animation is very fun. In a world where monsters live their lives just like humans do here on Earth, they get their energy sources in a very peculiar fashion. When it is nighttime the monsters go into these portal type things and sneak into childrens' rooms through their closets. When the child screams, that is just a fraction of the monsters' energy. But when a little girl comes into the monsters' world, Mike and Sulley, the two main characters, are in a panic to get the girl back. Thus is one of the funniest animations that has ever come out of the Pixar Studios.
 The voices, music, and computer animation that went into the making of this film were superb. Voices such as John Goodman's and Billy Crystal's will make you smile. The musical score is wonderful and makes this film even more enjoyable. As usual with all Pixar films the plot is very good and has its meanings.
 This is definitely worth buying when it comes out in September. Whether or not you have seen this film in the theaters this is a DVD must have. I strongly recommend this film to anybody that likes the work of Pixar Studios and/or is looking for a feel good comedy. This is a film that will be a classic and that should not be missed.
Happy Viewing!",1020729600,3,1559,4.350515463917525

1447584,5,B00005JKDR,Unlike some movies who on the surface seem to be suitable for children (Shrek) Monsters Inc is truly a kid's movie.  There was no humor that would be unsuitable for small children; even better there are enough humorous scenes and jokes that adults can also have some laughs.  Overall the movie is very funny and very sweet.,1020297600,,323,4.649122807017544
1447585,5,B00005JKDR,That was my reaction when I saw the first infomercial about this movie. What is this? A animated horror movie from Disney? NO. This was the most funny movie from Disney I saw in a long time. I saw this a couple of times and still think the same. It was a master piece of art. Pixar & Disney had make a good job!!,1020297600,,312,3.890625

film was the name Ray Harryhousen. My mother went to school with
him in Los Angeles and was a friend of his. I have some personal
pictures of him with my mom and some other schoolfriends.  Mom
had told me what his interest was and what he had gone on to do.
I just thought it was especially nice to see his name on the
restaurant while we were already completely enjoying the movie.
  Thank you,

This is a really good film and I think that Mike is the best monster, he is the funniest and Billy Crystal as his voice makes him the best character around on  a par with donkey from skrek, this is fun for the family, I recomend this to any one with a DVD player because you will be really impressed.",1020038400,,372,4.095890410958904

1447632,5,B00005JKDR,"Monsters Inc. is one of the funniest animated movies ever to be made. This movie brings together state of the art graphics, with a wonderful storyline and interesting characters. This movie takes place in a city of monsters. This city is just like real life New York, or a big city like that. But what throws in the twist is that the cities power runs on the fear of little children. Many monsters are on the job to scare kids and get the power to run their city. Sully (John Goodman) is one of the best scarers of all time! His helper Mike (Billy Crystal) wants to help Sully to be the top scarer. But there is one problem, if the monsters come in contact with the children, they are contaminated, so they have to get in and out without touching anything in the human world. But then something happens....a small human child gets loose in the the monster's city. And it is up to Mike and Sully to help this small girl escape before an evil monster set on becoming the top scarer can harm her.
This movie is full of humor and full of heart. All of the characters make this movie funny and exciting. This is a good movie for kids and kids at heart. The story is amazing. And even though their is monsters, they will not scare the kids. The small children will like this movie just as much as the adults. This movie is definately worth the money, and will be a welcomed addition to anyone's collection.",1019779200,,1400,4.326996197718631

Simply because you don't know what might be even in an animated movie nowadays. It really is a great movie.  It is extremely entertaining.  The voice talents of john goodman and billy crystal work perfect for the charachters.  The animation is top notch.  I truly feel that the next Pixar film that comes out won't require a screening.  I wish i could say the same for the next disney production.  The only problem with monsters inc is the end because you just want to see more!!!,1018915200,,585,4.401869158878505
1447686,5,B00005JKDR,"As many reviewers have said, Pixar recent fourth hit has made a homerun! After making movies ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story"", and ""Toy Story II"", Pixar and Disney hits it off big with ""Monsters, Inc.""
Children have always been afraid of monsters in their closet. They never realize what an important role they play in keeping the city of Monstropolis running. 'Monster Incorporations' is the corporation which 'takes and stores' 'scream energy'. Hiring a different assortment monsters to scare children to use their screams as energy to power up the whole of Monstropolis, 'Monsters Inc.' is a very powerful company. Until recently when the head of the company, Waternoose (James Coburn), finds out that the business is not doing well. Things get worse when top scare-er James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) gets involved in a situation where a young girl, named 'Boo' (Marry Gibbs), comes from the real world into the monster's world. She immediately attaches herself to Sulley who promptly asks for help from his best friend and assistant, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Can they keep the 'Child Detection Crew' from finding Boo? And can they make sure she gets home before monster rival to Sulley, Randall (Steve Buscemi) has his evil plans for Boo completed? Also starring is Celia (Jennifer Tilly) as Mike's girlfriend whom he's madly in love with, Roz (Bob Peterson) the cantankerous, stubborn, and strict worker at Monster's Inc., and Fungus with the voice of Frank Oz.
A most entertaining and hilarious movie, the perfect to movie to spend time watching with the family. The whole idea of ""Monsters, Inc."" is very original and interesting. From 'scream energy' to Monstropolis, from Child Detection Agency to closet doors being the doorway between the real world and the monster's world. The CG was excellent also, from the quality of Sulley's fur to Mike's eye, everything is well done making everything seem so real. One point I liked best was Randall, the whole idea of him being able to blend in to his surroundings and 'disappear' is pretty freaky for even older kids! Two thumbs up for fantastic work. Pixar also made very good choices for the voice talents of Sulley and Mike. John Goodman I have heard as Pacha in ""The Emperor's New Groove"". But never have I heard Billy Crystal's voice in any animation movie and you've got to admit, he's VERY GOOD at it! Just listening to him makes me laugh, always reminding me of his role as 'Miracle Max' in ""The Princess Bride"" (one of my all-time favorite movies).

But one of the main things I loved about the movie is the well-done script. There are some very obvious jokes while some very subtle and witty humor is put in, making the movie very enjoyable for adults, too. One of the funniest things I liked about the movie is Celia's... hair. She's a monster of course and her hair is actually many snakes so the ends of her hair are snakes heads. And when she gets angry, you can see some tail ends 'rattling' making a rattlesnakes noise! I thought that was VERY hilarious and I was laughing so hard! Also another favorite part of mine is where Sulley is being attacked by Randall and Mike has NO clue to what's going on!
And of course, no one can miss any of the bloopers at the end of the movie. And still even after that, we get to see a very funny 'Broadway musical' (I forgot the name though I know that even just hearing it makes you laugh!). Then keep going to the very end of the film where you can read, ""No monsters were harmed in the making of this movie."" :-) Then there's the very beginning of the movie, before the story starts, you can watch Oscar-Award winning short film ""For the Birds"". It just simply cracked me up! The birds were so funny!
So if I STILL haven't convinced you to see this film, I don't know what else to say but, ""you're missing out on one of the best family films ever."" I know I'll be making sure to get the DVD when it comes out which is jam-packed with special features!",1018483200,4,3972,4.642045454545454

Disney has put out a lot of good flicks with Pixar, but Monsters, Inc. has been the best.  I am a grandmother of one, and the actors portraying the Monsters are incredible as usual--they have outdone themselves again. And the character, Boo won my heart because she resembles my own little granddaughter. And the relationship she develops with Sully is so real and true that the movie just is wonderful!!!!!  That is all I can say about it--and I can't wait to get my own copy of the movie when it comes out on DVD.  -Carolyn B.",1018137600,4,624,4.353448275862069
1447688,5,B00005JKDR,"What a shame that ""Shrek"" had an earlier release date than ""Monsters, Inc."" because this is the better movie of the two...""Monsters, Inc."" is a sheer delight, from start to finish. Cute, I mean REALLY cute, story line about how the monsters actually have a work-a-day world where scaring children is a job for superstars. When a human child makes it to the other side of the bedroom door into the monsters' world, all heck breaks out before the situation can be set aright again...the children in my movie theatre, including 3yr-old Alexander, just squealed with laughter the whole time, as did the adults present, too. And not a fart joke in sight! That's the difference between child and adolescent humor, I guess.

Monsters Inc. is possibly the best 3D movie yet, and definately one of the best animated features made. Was it designed for children... yes, but it is certainly well worth the time to see.  The story is unusual and interesting, and the animation is the best yet in the 3D movie arena. The characters have weight to them, and really fit the personalities of their voice actors.  In addition the attention to detail is outstanding.  As a 3D Animator, and professor of, I would rather have my name associated with this film than any of the others out there.

  I loved this movie because it was funny, had great animation, and was full of suspense. However, it seemed that the movie wasn't nearly as good for children. The adults in the theatre laughed throughout the whole movie, but the children barely laughed at all. The problem is that both the plot and the jokes were on an adult level.
