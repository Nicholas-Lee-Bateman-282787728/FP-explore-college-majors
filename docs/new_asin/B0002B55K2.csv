8025477,5,B0002B55K2,"I enjoyed this documentary recently thanks to Netflix, very interesting and informative,I liked the British Man who mentioned towards the end that recently A lot Of the Jesuits have been taking A ""Left-wing"" slant from the usual helping the poor,if this is the case than it is sad since Leftism is not compatible despite the insistence of a few with Catholicism. The British Narrator however was often slow and it looked like a amateur affair,but it is very much worth watching for any True Catholic.",1296518400,4,500,4.894117647058824
8025478,3,B0002B55K2,"Very interesting video about the history of the Jesuits but the British bozo (brought in for ""balance"" no doubt) was an unfortunate addition. The Jesuit concern for the poor and disenfranchised is dishonored by this man's callous dismissal of their work as ""trendy.""",1275696000,,266,5.209302325581396
