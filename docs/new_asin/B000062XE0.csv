1684405,5,B000062XE0,"This series concludes in a most excellent way, with a challenging whodunit set amidst the antiquities of Oxford.

The way these characters were portrayed introduced me to the world of Dorothy Sayers' post-WWI England, and my only regret is that Talboys was not introduced as a subsequent episode.

Whenever I read (and reread) Dorothy Sayers, it will always be the portrayal of Peter Wimsey by Edward Peterbridge that I envision.  Of all the actors who have taken on this role, *this* version is the finest I've seen.",1140134400,2,517,4.919540229885057
1684406,2,B000062XE0,"Gaudy Night has long been my favorite Lord Peter Wimsey--or perhaps I should say, Harriet Vane detective story.  There's no doubt Sayers recreated Oxford lovingly and with extreme vividness.  Harriet Vane fully comes into her own in this story.  The TV adaptation, however, is truncated, simplified almost beyond recognition.  The various characters are cardboard stereotypes.  The deepening relationship between Wimsey and Harriet is reduced to cliches.  Why in the world were 4 episodes lavished on a much lesser story, ""Have His Carcase"" and only three on ""Gaudy Night"".  This version simply doesn't do the original story justice at all.",1083888000,8,640,5.404040404040404
1684407,5,B000062XE0,"This is but one of the many Peter Wimsey mysteries I have watched, listened to, and/or read.  Everyone of them have had characters so well developed and believable.  This mystery is well deserving of the highest rating for its plot, the scenery, and the acting.  The period was the 1930's, and strong, independent women were an exception rather than the norm.  This story highlights one type of delicate situation professional women could find themselves in during this transitional period.  The majority of the cast are female, and all are very well cast.  There were even a number of catty encounters between various characters, remniscent of ""The Women"", by Clare Booth Luce, which were very likely to have actually happened in the situations these characters found themselves in.  Having seen Edward Petheridge and Harriet Walter portray these characters in a play on stage, their portrayals lose nothing in the transition to TV.  I stongly recommend this show as well as all the other Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries on DVD/VHS.  These shows are excellent entertainment and have class most current TV shows and movies of this genre seriously lack.",1071705600,2,1148,5.096256684491979
1684408,5,B000062XE0,"Edward Petherbridge is brilliant!!
I recently acquired these DVD's (Strong Poison/Have His Carcass/Gaudy Night) and they are now my most treasured set. The performances by Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter are flawless!
This series is a MUST HAVE for all mystery buffs (especially Dorothy Sayer's fans!) For those who were disappointed in the Ian Carmichael series produced 10 years earlier, take heart--you have now found the answer to your prayers!
My only criticism is that there were no more titles produced in this series. I can't understand why they did not continue to make more of these wonderful productions. And furthermore, I can't understand why the BBC took so long to release this series onto Video/DVD. If I had known of the existance of this series sooner, I would have launched a campaign to demand that they make more episodes. Oh well...I guess we will just have to make do with the three gems that were made. (In fact you should probably buy two sets of these, as you may wear out your original DVD's from watching them over and over and over and ...ahem...oh yes back to the review...)
The first two films, Strong Poison and Have His Carcass, are faithful to the books and each is truly a pleasure to watch. The third, Gaudy Night (or ""Gaudy Lite"" as I have seen it referred to) skimps a bit in comparison to the novel. However, the extraordinary acting on the part of Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter more than makes up for this, ensuring that this version of Gaudy Night is a highly entertaining one. This series should have segued into ""Busman's Honeymoon."" However BBC dropped the ball on obtaining the rites and left us all hanging.
Perhaps it isn't too late for a continuation of this series after all. It has ONLY been 16 years since the last episode. Surely if Ian Carmichael could have the audacity to play Lord Peter Wimsey at his age, Edward Petherbridge could pull it off for at least another 20 years or so (and do it brilliantly I might add!)
Needless to say, I have become an instant fan of Mr. Petherbridge and can only hope I may find more of his work on film. (This is a daunting task since this distinguished stage performer seems to shy away from the camera. Something about acting for the love of the thing and not the money. Oh these serious actors!! By the way, isn't he WAY OVERDUE for some sort of Knighthood or something ...hmm??!!)
WARNING: Ordinary television will seem even more unsatisfactory after viewing these DVD's.
As I said before, you'd better get at least two copies of each of these DVD's (or to be on the safe side, you'd better make it three!!)
(NOTE: It seems that the UK version of the DVD's contain an interview with Edward Petherbridge as a bonus feature. Unfortunately for me, the American version does not. You lucky Brits!!)
Enjoy!",1055894400,4,2811,4.6923076923076925
1684409,4,B000062XE0,"This BBC presentation is based on the third novel in the Wimsey/Vane series.  Harriet, motivated by her memories of Oxford as an escape from worldly concerns (such as her involvement in two murders and persistent proposals from Lord Peter), attends a student reunion or gaudy night.  In the course of this she allows herself to be drawn into the mystery of a poison pen writer who has crossed too far into the realms of bad taste and threats.  Gradually she realizes that the matter is getting out of hand, and turns again to Wimsey for help and guidance.
There is no question but that the saboteur intends harm to Shrewsbury College itself, as well as the dons and students who are part of it.  Ugly notes escalate to burnt effigies, and finally to attacks on properties and persons.  Everyone, from Senior Common Room to the least student is under suspicion.
Harriet must labor under the triple complications of the crimes themselves, a mixed reception from the dons of Shrewsbury, and the ever-increasing complexity of her relationship with Lord Peter.  This latter is the reason for Sayers decision to gradually shift the focus of these three novels from Lord Peter (in 'Strong Poison') to Harriet Vane.  In the book, lesser characters appear more often than Wimsey does as the narrative focuses in on a woman who is struggling to find herself and who fears being overwhelmed by what Peter has to offer.
'Gaudy Night' has the best acting of the three BBC presentations, and the most interesting setting, the only women's college at Oxford.  It is easy to fall into the plot and enjoy the intellectual byplay among the characters.  Unfortunately, this production shares the same fault as its companion efforts, only this time it is much worse.  Whereas before the director (Christopher Hodson) limited his deviations from the novels to providing romantic segues from video to video, this time he had made significant deviations from the novel in order to overemphasize the relationship between Harriet and Wimsey.
I hate to get up on a soapbox, but Dorothy Sayers had very good reasons for writing these books as she did.  Harriet Vane is an intelligent, determined woman, who is facing one of the dilemmas of her times, how to be an independent woman and in love at the same time.  In her society, precious few roles were available that permitted both behaviors. Thus, the primary subtext of 'Gaudy Night is the nature of these roles.  But Hodson underplays this, and even goes so far as to create scenes in order to expand Wimsey's role, and thus weaken Harriet Vane's.  Having read the book several times, I found this both distracting and irritating.
Had I not read 'Gaudy Night' I would have found the screenplay very satisfying.  With nearly seventy years between the book's writing and the present day, the number of Sayers readers has dwindled with time.  Hopefully, the availability of the BBC productions will reverse that trend and more people will discover the works of one of the English languages most remarkable mystery writes.",1025740800,17,3045,4.8949416342412455
1684410,3,B000062XE0,"Having seen all 3 of the Rutheridge adaptations of Sayer, I must say I was disappointed with this one, my favorite by far of the 3 novels, just as I was impressed by how well they did Have His Carcase, one of Sayer's less impressive novels, imo.  This adaption cuts alot of what made the novel so interesting.  Wimsey's nephew does not appear.  The subplot of the students, including the one with the crush on Harriet and the one who is suicidal, does not appear except for an early 2 minute interview by Vane of a few of the women students, who then disappear, a singularly pointless scene, as though they decided not to have the student bit after all and then left one scene in by accident.  There is no chess set, and none of the undercurrents between Vane and the Hilliard woman that that event brought out in the book.  Hilliard is just hostile, because she is an unpleasant woman.  Uninteresting. There is no dog collar, for which I was thankful, I'm afraid men who put dog collars on women just brings too many irrelevancies to mind these days.
There is so much of the interaction of the dons that is lacking, there is no development at all of any suspicions and clues pointing at any of the dons, as there was in the book, there is in fact no development of the mystery at all.  Vandalous things happen on several nights, then Peter springs the solution on us all, clever fellow.
But most disappointing to me of all is that this version just did not give us the marvelous presence of Oxford itself as Sayers empphasized it so strongly in the book.  It was key to what happened between Wimsay and Vane and what it symbolized of the primacy and the costs and rewards of the intellectual life was a rich underlying theme for every character, including of course the culprit.  But this production cheated us - vane thinks a few poetry lines re Oxford at the very beginning as she is driving there, then wimsey says something about how awfully serious Oxford makes everyone at the very end, and the whole theme is just absent otherwise.
I like the Vane characterization across all 3 of the videos.  Rutheridge as Peter lacks all the effervescence and whimsey and defensive buffoonery of the Sayers character - a fact that is a big defect imo in Strong Poison but much less so in this video, as in fact Sayer's Wimsey drops his clownishness more and more in the successive novels.",1024272000,8,2382,4.505800464037123
1684411,5,B000062XE0,"Thanks to Volavampire for her review that mentioned Petheridge as Peter Wimsey. I have been enamoured of this detective since I first read Strong Poison when I was in high school.  However, I felt so strongly that Ian Carmichael (I think that was the actor) was NOT Wimsey in any way, shape, or form, that I did not watch the televised versions. I wasn't aware of the ""Harriet Vane"" series with E. Petheridge until I read the review here.  I am totally delighted with his portrayal of Wimsey. He fits my pictures in every way, as does Bunter.  The casting of Harriet Vane is good as well.  For any Wimsey fans, I recommend this DVD set with multiple stars.",1023408000,,656,4.487394957983193

1684422,3,B000062XE0,"""Gaudy Night"" is by far the richest and best of Dorothy L. Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane books. Unfortunately, this television adaptation is the weakest of the Wimsey/Vane series with Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walters.  Unlike ""Strong Poison"" and ""Have His Carcase,"" which were very faithful to the books, this adaptation of ""Gaudy Night"" hacks the book to pieces and makes some significant changes in the plot line, not for the better.  One wonders why the producers devoted four episodes to ""Have His Carcase"" but only three to the much superior ""Gaudy Night.""  Surely with a fourth episode they could have included Lord Peter's nephew, Lord St. George, and some key scenes like the chess set episode and Wimsey and Harriet punting on the Charwell.  Also, whereas in the novel the city of Oxford is almost another character, in this version it is almost completely absent.

Still, there is much to enjoy here.  The casting of the Dons of Shrewsbury College is excellent; these character actresses really capture the eccentricities of the Senior Common Room members.  Lavinia Bertram is a standout as Annie Wilson, very powerful in her big scene at the end.  And of course, Walters and Petherbridge are outstanding as usual.  What there is of Sayers' magnificent book is well done.  One just wishes we had been given more.",1314144000,3,1338,5.013574660633484
1684423,3,B000062XE0,"Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) wrote few novels, but their quality was sufficient to rank her among the best mystery novelists of her era, and she remains a standard bearer to this day. In the novel STRONG POISON, her detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, fell in love with mystery novelist Harriet Vane, and Sayers allowed the relationship to play out over the course of three more works: HAVE HIS CARCASE, GAUDY NIGHT, and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. In the 1987, the BBC filmed the first three works in the series (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer owns the rights to BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, which was filmed in 1940) as a mixture of 1930s mystery and romance. The result was often amusing, but also extremely problematic.

Presented in three episodes, GAUDY NIGHT offers the story of a mysterious vandal and poison pen letter writer at Shrewsbury, an Oxford college for women of which Harriet (Harriet Walter) is a graduate. When Harriet attends the annual gaudy (dinner) for former students, she is quickly roped into investigating the mystery. Finding the whole thing a bit over her head, she somewhat reluctantly summons her would-be lover Lord Peter Wimsey (Edward Petherbridge) to unravel the mystery. But while GAUDY NIGHT is among Sayer's best work, the film suffers from exactly the same problems that beset the previous series adaptations. Casting is an issue, with both Petherbridge and Walter more acceptable than ideal, but more particularly the adaptation completely misses the wry humor that is so much a part of Sayers' work. The upshot is an overdose of British stiff upper lip. To add a final insult, the entire series doesn't look so much like a 1980s effort as it does an early 1970s effort--which is to say that the film technique has dated very, very badly.

Of the three titles included in the series, GAUDY NIGHT is probably the least effectively done, and this is likely due to the great difficulty of adapting the work. As a novel, it contains an extremely large cast of characters, remarkable atmosphere, and plays out largely in a series of dialogues. Even so, fans of Sayers, her novels, and her characters will at least be mildly amused by the effort. Recommended to them, but most others should probably give it a miss.

1684424,5,B000062XE0,"As an avid Dorothy Sayers fanatic, and a lover of all things Lord Peter, this final film (in a series of three) left me fervently wishing ""Busman's Honeymoon"" (what would have been the fourth film) had been made. I own all the Lord Peter novels and collections of short stories, and have read and re-read them all more times than I can say, so to claim rather intimate knowledge on the subject is a justifiable conceit. Petherbridge is the Perfect Peter, and Walters an excellent Harriet. Any supposed lack of ""chemistry"" between them was, to my mind, only the result of good acting, and an excellent representation of the reserved and difficult realtionship between the would-be lovers that Sayers concocted in the novels. The sets were accurate and believable, the wardrobes well thought out and designed, and the rest of the cast also seemed to fit nicely into my mental picture of the characters they played. If ONLY the other Wimsey books had been made with Petherbridge cast as Lord Peter! But at least we have these three films to enjoy.",1274745600,,1044,4.773480662983426

Dorothy Sayers wrote a great original book, and, insofar as the screenplay follows the book, it continues to be a well written mystery. Set in  a women's college in Oxford in the 1930s.

Anytime the screenplay deviates from the original book, it's abysmal, even to the point of changing the history of the character who turns out to be the perpetrator, so that the plot no longer has logic.  Really sad.

-Love's Labour Lost

This is the third Dorothy L. Sayers novel in which mystery writer Harriet Vane has been pursued by Lord Peter Wimsey, but this one has the added attraction of being set at Shrewsbury, an all-women's college at Oxford. Oxford is much more than just a backdrop, however, as it is one of the few places (c. 1930) where women live and are encouraged to live independent lives. Independence, namely her own, is one of the things that Harriet Vane want to preserve.  When Harriet, an Oxford graduate, returns to her alma mater to attend a yearly celebration known as ""gaudy night"", she is re-visiting a stratified and stuffy world full of ancient traditions and customs that she knows very well. Although the university seems like a sanctuary from the concerns of an unquiet world, Harriet is soon informed that things are not as idyllic as they might seem to an outsider, and that something is amiss at Shrewsbury. Previous to her arrival, a series of poison-pen letters have been delivered to various faculty and an unfamiliar sense of menace and threat now intrudes upon the hallowed lives of the university's female fellows. The administration decides not to compromise the reputation of the college by alerting outside authorites, instead they have decided to try and discover the source of the letters themselves, with the help of Harriet of course. Although she's a mystery writer, some of the faculty have decided that being a woman, an Oxford graduate, and an imaginative writer are qualifications that make her their ideal investigator. But not all of the fellows agree, and some are openly hostile to Harriet. The thrill of this mystery is in gaining admittance to the cloistered world of women's higher learning and scholarship, and access to some very effectively and cleverly drawn dons. Every conversation had among their number is full of well articulated views carefully advanced with the support of a wealth of historical knowledge and steeped in rich literary allusion for good measure. Granted, the independent and freethinking female students (they casually smoke cigarettes and openly discuss their affairs) find the female dons to be ""nutters"". And even the freethinking Lord Peter Wimsey has his suspicions about this closed community of women scholars and he suspects that the anonymous author of the poison-pen letters may be one of their own. Peter expresses these suspicions to Harriet:
""Academically cloistered together, celibate, some sexually ambivalent, [the institution is] bound to throw out the odd hysteric.""
But Harriet is not so quick to judge this community that his its own rigorously followed codes of behavior. While conducting her  investigation, Harriet finds out many things about the college, as well as many things about her own temperament. She is adivsed by one colleague that her detachment is ""disconcerting"", and told that if she should ever meet a man that appreciates and respects her dispassionate nature that she should consider herself lucky. Of course, we all know that she has found that man in Lord Peter Wimsey. Much is made of women's instinct and nature and this gaurded community slowly comes to treat Harriet as one of their own and in solving this case she also comes a good deal closer to solving the mysteries that motivate women, as well as the mysteries that lie at the center of her own being. Peter Wimsey, with his razor sharp instincts, may be the one who ultimately solves the mystery(s), but he could not have done so had he not been inspired to do so by Harriet who is the source of the ""Promethean fire"" that warms his heart and sparks his mind.

I don't remember much about the books, except that I wasn't keen on reading them all.  But I love mysteries and I've seen all the Wimsey eipsodes made for television, those with Ian Carmichael and those with Edward Petherbridge.  The Carmichael episodes are far better, for my money.  Carmichael's Wimsey is charming, sparkling, a little quirky and fun, a man you want to know.  Petherbridge is glum, looks very tired and bored.  I don't believe he's attracted to Harriet, no matter how many times he says so.  There is nothing in his eyes.  And Harriet!!!  There's a snotty cow.  Usually looks like she's revolted by a nasty smell.  Nope, nothing anybody could fall in love with there either.

7957698,5,B000062XE0,"""Gaudy Night"" was the third and last installment in the BBC's 1987 production of the ""Dorothy Sayers Mysteries."" The BBC was unable to obtain the rights to ""Busman's Honeymoon"", the forth novel featuring Lord Peter Wimsey and his mystery novelist paramour Harriet Vane. So their relationship is wrapped up in ""Gaudy Night"", based on Sayers' 1935 novel. While ""Strong Poison"" was set in London and ""Have His Carcase"" in a chilly coastal village, ""Gaudy Night"" is cloistered in Harriet Vane's alma mater at Oxford, much like the suspects in the case. Dr. Baring, quick-witted warden of Shrewsbury College, aptly comments of Lord Peter: ""That practiced air of inanity he is pleased to adopt conceals a sharp intellect."" Note that I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on the film's faithfulness.

Harriet Vane (Harriet Walker) attends her first ""gaudy"", or alumni reunion, at Shrewsbury College at Oxford. She is trepidatious given her notoriety for being in close proximity to murder, but she is greeted warmly by the college warden Dr. Baring (Sheila Burrell) and dean Miss Martin (Carol MacReady). For two months, the college has experienced a spate of threatening letters, obscene graffiti, and disgusting pranks that have grown so disturbing that the college asks Vane to help track down the culprit from among the students, fellows (professors), and scouts (housekeepers). Just as it appears that Harriet's life may be in danger, Lord Peter Wimsey (Edward Petherbridge) shows up to join in the sleuthing.

In detective fiction's Golden Age, the crime was not always murder. I find the vengeful pranks of ""Gaudy Night"" a nice change. As is usual for this series, the superb supporting cast elevates many scenes. Particularly memorable is an early scene between Lord Peter, his valet Bunter (Richard Morant), and a member of the German border police on a train en route to Berlin. The women fellows of Shrewsbury College are played by an impressive cast of character actresses and always an intriguing group to observe. They and the academic life in general- are satirized, which is amusing if a little unkind. We gain some insight into the relationship between Lord Peter and Bunter, though it would be nice to have more.

The pacing is much slower & some scenes are inexplicable until the very end.
My greatest issue, however, was with the fact that though I have watched & enjoyed many British/BBC movies & series, I simply could not understand much of what was being said throughout this. The intellectual banter that is meant to showcase Sayers's  brilliance is lost in translation because it's completely nonsensical to one who isn't thoroughly well read in classic  literature  or conversant in the Queens English (& the slang of the genre). Because Gaudy Night is steeped in both, & the plot revolves around your understanding of them, it's incredibly frustrating to feel as if you are watching a film in a foreign language.
