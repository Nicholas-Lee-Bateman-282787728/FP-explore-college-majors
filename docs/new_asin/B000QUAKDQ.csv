8197509,4,B000QUAKDQ,"This IS the Limit Holdem version of the course.
1) Yes, the way Phil's products are being marketted is TOTALLY confusing (note they also sell each belt in this course seperately)
2) If you are interested in NO LIMIT HOLDEM there is a different course called ""Phil Hellmuth's NO LIMIT Black Belt Poker Course"". I don't think they have the DVD version here.
3) If you are interested in Limit Holdem, this is an excellent course.  I also HIGHLY recommend Amazon's DVD version versus iamplify's crappy ipod or mpeg4 version which the audio and video frequently cut out on. Phil Hellmuth is very, very insightful and provides many ideas that cover a range from beginner to advanced. Keep in mind that he is presenting HIS general style of play and approach (which even he deviates from if game conditions warrant). This is not the only approach that works. Personally I like to evaluate the info he presents and blend the ideas I like into my own ""style soup"". That is what any aspiring player should do. Poker is chaotic and ever changing. You have to be flexible with your style. Phil provides many techniques and tools that you can store on your shelf for use when the right moment arrives. He also provides an excellent baseline from which you can start with and then explore from.

All in all, the man knows what he's talking about even if you don",1235001600,,1347,4.608333333333333
8197510,1,B000QUAKDQ,"First, I admit I made a personal mistake buying this DVD.  I just ignored the ""White Belt"" part thinking it was some sort of Helmuth hype, my mistake. The DVDs I have watched by Gordon and Duke are much better, the books I have read by Harrington, Gordon, Brunson and Sklansky are better than any DVD.

But if you are a beginner and want a beginner DVD (instead of the first Harrington book), get Annie Duke's Beginners DVD - it has a lot in it. For books, definitely Harrington and Gordon - I am currently reading Negreanu's Power Hold'Em and Kill Everyone by a group of authors but these are not beginner books.

Black Belt Poker Course (White Belt Only) has as close to nothing in it as you can get without being a test pattern.  There are seven lessons and most chapters consist of one tip - level 7 being how to play AK pre and post flop - Phil advises you ""raise, raise, raise"".  There is also a great deal of filler material consisting of music, video and Phil between each lesson which takes up at least half of the DVD's running time.

The DVD is actually just a commercial for his ""full"" Black Belt course that sells for $149 (you could buy 3 of the Harrington books for that).  When you open the cover it states on an insert that the full DVD is $163 and you get a $34 discount for buying this DVD, so you get the full version for $129. There should be no charge for this DVD, it should be offered for free on an infomercial or in the Walmart .99 cent DVD section.

I purchased some Helmuth DVDs early on and found them to range from bad to weird.  This is no exception.  The one good thing I can say about this DVD is that it is very attractively packaged (which made me think that Phil has finally made a quality DVD on poker).  Instead it was even worse than his previous ""home movie"" style DVDs.",1223078400,2,1810,4.232558139534884
8197511,2,B000QUAKDQ,"I purchased this directly from the vendor site for the same price of $149.95 and was thoroughly disappointed. The course is designed almost entirely for limit hold 'em and very little can be applied to no limit tournament strategy. And no-limit is what i assume 95% of those who buy this want to learn and all of helmuth's 11 bracelets are from no-limit events. Everything about the advertising makes you think this is no-limit and then bam, everyting he discusses is for limit. Furthermore, the course is made up of 48, 3-6 minute clips that each start with this horrendous opening. I am not sure if the DVD is the same since I purchased this for my Ipod but I had to download all 48 clips and then I played it as a DVD as I drove but each new clips started with that same opening that made me want to scream. I highly do not recommend this and instead think you should get his book from Itunes for $24 or any other DVD or book you can find for under $30. $149.95 for this is insane.",1184371200,8,984,4.267379679144385
