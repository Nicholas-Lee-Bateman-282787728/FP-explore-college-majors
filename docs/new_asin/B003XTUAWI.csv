4218775,3,B003XTUAWI,I can't believe that this series is coming out on bluray and NOT the 90s series. The X-men 90s series must be the first one on blu-ray discs in hd quality and 5.1 or maybe 7.1 master audio.,1285545600,3,189,4.0
4218776,5,B003XTUAWI,"Wolverine and the X Men, is an excellent TV series. The characters reactions are very believable and the saga-like, and I love the overall (saga) storyline. Compared to another X men series (X men evolution) this is ten times better. I would love to see it again and another season would be even better! The season end cliffhanger just begs for a second season.",1285545600,,361,4.65625
4218777,5,B003XTUAWI,"You can purchase the entire first season from amazon.ca (canada); it comes in a pretty sweet metal case. It's region 1 so it works with all US players. Just a thought for those of you, who like me, didn't want to purchase 5 separate volumes and also didn't want to wait ages for the US release.

A fantastic series, well worth it to any Marvel/ comic enthusiast and a must buy for any X-Men fan. Series has big story arcs much like its awesome predecessor that I grew up with in the mid-90s.

Enjoy!",1283212800,2,499,4.297872340425532
4218778,5,B003XTUAWI,"The x-men have been lucky in cartoons, having two of the best animated shows ever made. The huge array of core and supporting characters goes a long way towards helping too. The storylines here have been given the same respect of mature treatment as with the 90's series. It might be a matter of opinion but I think this series only just manages to have the edge which is saying something as the original series is still one of the best cartoons out there. If you liked that as well as shows like Justice League Unlimited then this is for you. I can't say enough about the sound quality, it's completely awesome, like nothing i've ever heard for a U.S. television cartoon series. I might even say theatre quality with its wide open feel and surround effects. and the animation is some of today's best. Many characters make an appearance - it was great to see the Blob in there, and again the storylines are respectibly handled, not kiddies stuff, though they will definitely enjoy it and there's nothing in there they shouldn't watch. It's a shame the best series to come out since Justice League has been cancelled. With any luck fan support might bring it back.",1282694400,26,1163,4.596153846153846

4218780,5,B003XTUAWI,"This is the BEST X-Men animated show EVER.  I wish this show would've been on network television, because I think it'd have reached a more broad audience.  Even though the show premiered with over 4 million viewers in the US alone, behind the scenes the show got into some financial problems, and this show has been prematurely cancelled after its first and only season.  The season finale promised a second season full of Age of Apocalypse, one of the most popular X-Men storylines ever.  If you're like me, and you love this show, let's get this show back!  Family Guy was brought back due to high ratings on Adult Swim, and DVD sales.  Why not do the same thing with Wolverine and the X-Men.  Please purchase this copy, and help get this show back on the air where it belongs!

4218784,4,B003XTUAWI,"I'm gonna be Frank here-
Most of my life I haven't been a huge X men fan. Asides fro growing up in a strict house, the over all tone and little details, although sometimes nice, weren't always my cup of tea. Also, as much as I like to be sensitive and wishy washy, some aspects of X-men pulled the victim card pity party a bit too much.
Dude, if Mutants like X-men existed in real life, people would be worshiping them as Demi Gods. They would become Feudal Warlords and Royal Elites, Champions of reknown, warriors of old, kind of like the Biblical and Mythological Nephilim that they are at least partly inspired by.
Just saying, reality check, Marvel. Yes I know you're trying to use X-men as a stand in for the civil rights movement of the 60s and to also stand up for social outcasts, but also, at the same time...human nature determines that people will drop their prejudice and even their pride if someone is powerful enough. Although there would be different hate groups for different reasons against mutants, a lot of the average people in charge would have already been very, very accommodating to many of them to recruit them. Sure some of what they cry about with discrimination would happen in real life, but there would be a lot of people who would drop their morals and worship mutants over their power. Not saying humanity isn't messed up enough to hate people who are different, but at the same time they can swallow their pride to try get cozy with the new big bully in town. I mean, you guys gotta stop acting like people with super powers would be an easily oppressed under class.
People are messed up, but they have adaptable forms of messed up, not just one flavor or gear.
With that little rant over, this version of X men actually avoids over doing it in that department-well as far as X men go. I honestly felt like this X men series was about telling a story with relateable characters, and didn't have as much of an in your face agenda to push. Where as most X men are blatantly far left, which is fine but are usually in your face about it, this one comes off as moderate in comparison. To me this is the X men equivalent of spectacular spider man. A good show that captures what is great about comics while avoiding the sillier tropes, and focuses on telling a story over having the best animation or looking really cool for everybody.
Like spectacular spider man it doesn't have the best animation, but it has it in other areas that count. I don't usually favor X men, except for when they make a good video game (cough cough X men legends cough) but for somebody who doesn't like them as much as other franchises, this show was pleasant and smooth, and I wish there was more of it. It is kind of like Spectacular Spider Man's little brother in quality and style. Some of the best animation Marvel has to offer.",1497571200,,2841,4.444444444444445

4218786,5,B003XTUAWI,"This is a great x-men show. As a 90s kid who grew up watching the xmen cartoons on fox and xmen evolution this was a fun and different cartoon to watch with my kid. It's got different xmen and villains. The storyline is good, it's downfall is honestly the fact it's only one season.

A good X-men show, though not as great as X-men: The Animated Series or consistently entertaining as X-men: Evolution. Wolverine and the X-men feels more in line with the films than the previous shows, while some episodes are brilliant, others feel fairly mediocre. The voice cast is excellent throughout featuring the likes of Nolan North as Cyclops, Colossus, Berzerker and Pyro with strong animation and art direction which are reminiscent of Evolution. Major story arcs like Days of Future Past, Weapon X and The Inner Circle are referenced with the show sadly being cancelled by Disney as Age of Apocalypse is set up for season 2.

4218821,3,B003XTUAWI,"The X-Men has something that the Avengers does not have...a mythology. For 20 years, the X-Men has ruled the comic industry and many of the characters are represented here. My BIG problem is that Wolverine would NEVER be the leader of the team, because he has SO many inner demons. Cyclops is the leader of the X-Men and not Wolverine. Beyond that, the stories do not follow the comics in any sort of fashion. However, it is nice to see them in animated form. My five year old is bored with Avengers Assemble and Hulk: Agents of Smash and walks away. He LOVES this cartoon and I have to limit the number of episodes he is able to watch in a sitting. It is too bad that they axed this show, because it is one of the better cartoons for Super Heroes fans. Being that Disney/Marvel is currently boycotting all things X-Men due to their contract issues with FOX films, this maybe the LAST X-men cartoon, you will see until FOX films gives up the X-men movie rights back to Marvel/Disney.

Animation is solid. The blu ray commentaries are fun as well.",1437609600,,1046,4.447916666666667

4218827,5,B003XTUAWI,"I grew up with the 90's X-men animated series, but I have to admit that Wolverine and the X-Men quickly replaced it as my favorite X-men show.  While that may be controversial to many, Wolverine and the X-Men like Spectacular Spider-Man paid tremendous homage to their comic counterparts.  The show represented so much that was great about the X-men in the 2000's during Grant Morrison and later Joss Wheldon's run with the mutant franchise.

The animation however leaves a bit to be desired, but one cannot deny the fluent comic-feeling story lines that made this series simply the best of the X-men.",1427760000,4,601,4.872549019607843
