7832998,4,630296816X,"I don't understand the previous negative review of this video.  This was Lily Tomlin's first 1 woman broadway show and she won a special Tony award for it.  When Lily finished her run on Broadway she took the show on tour and did a run in Los Angeles, where this video was filmed.  Perhaps the previous reviewers complaints regarding cheesey production values should be blamed on HBO since this was filmed as a special for them.  The brilliance of Lily's performance still shines through however.  The camera gets wonderful close ups which allow the viewer to totally see Lily work her magic while in character with NO costumes/wigs.  I too have the ""On Stage"" album ( which is now availble on CD! ) and the album was made with special sound effects and changes because it was an adaptation FOR AN ALBUM, not the original Broadway show.

If you're a Lily fan already I don't have to tell you this, but for the rest of you out there, buy or rent this video, which soon will be available on DVD.  It is an excellent opportunity to see why Lily Tomlin is the most talented, versatile, funny, original comedian and actresses EVER. She plays about 7 or 8 different characters with NO costume or make up effects.  Nobody does this kind of performance.  This is not stand up comedy.  This is true comedic brilliance woven into an evening of theatre.",1097193600,9,1342,4.573221757322176
7832999,3,630296816X,"Why didn't they FILM Lily ON BROADWAY instead of this Los Angeles performance is beyond me.  I grew up with the Lily Tomlin-""On Stage"" LP, which is the same piece. It had marvelous sound effects and a full stereo soundstage.  It was enchanting, and it was played all the time at quite a few parties back around 1978.
When I purchased this video I was disapointed because of the cheesy production values, and it just wasn't fresh.  I love Lily Tomlin, and as I have said this piece was an instant comedy classic, but the video doesn't get that fact through.",1050624000,4,556,4.485148514851486
