8187365,1,B000MGBLZA,I have no idea why people liked this film. Looks like something a HS kid would do for a film class (minus the boobs) and then get a bad grade.,1235779200,,142,3.7666666666666666
8187366,5,B000MGBLZA,"I've got to say, I can't agree more with the praises given to this flick.  I got a copy of the first Dead Body Man at a horror con and was soon sharing it among my friends.  It became a classic among our drinking get togethers.  There were a few minor complaints with the flick, but this second one wiped em all away.  Rarely is a sequel better than the original, and even more rare in the indie world of film, but this one surpasses the first one.  If you're a horror fan or a comic fan, check this out.  It's a funny as hell story that pulls no punches.  It's refreshing to see a movie that's not worried about being politically correct.  There's gore, naked chicks and all kinds of twisted moments that'll leave you wanting to see more.  Hopefully, this series keeps em coming.  I'd love to see another one and even a comic done. If you like dark comedies, you should really check this out.  There's a lot of bathroom humor, but it's brilliantly interlaced with some deep and interesting ideas.  Trust me.  Watch this and you'll see what I mean.",1178064000,,1048,4.34020618556701

Folks, the on-screen menu is worth the price of the DVD alone. Wait a few moments and you'll see an impatient Willie do some pretty grotesque stuff. Anyways, the story picks up right where the first film left off. For those who haven't seen the first one, the films delivers a nice flashback to get you up to speed on where the film is at. Willie returns to kill more sinners for the man upstairs, and his twin brother escapes and is out for revenge. This film is definately more twisted and gory than the first. There's enough random, off the wall humor to keep the laughs coming and the blood flowing. For those who enjoyed the first film or enjoy a good indie dark comedy..Pick this DIY gem up!",1177459200,2,892,4.651898734177215
8187368,4,B000MGBLZA,"This is a low budget flick but, its so damn funny, you really look past its budget.  I've seen a ton of low budget movies but, this one I really enjoyed.  It had me laughing so, hard I almost... Well, you get the idea.  For a beer drinking good time, check it out.",1177372800,,264,3.943396226415094
