Which if you read that fact else where before seeing the interview, gives you the impression that it was an irritating or upsetting experience for Ray. There is no indication of that. It is interesting however to watch the camera work as it is amusing to see what one does when filming one of the greatest directors of all time! Note the angle coming from behind Ray's head. It is a bit slow, but you feel like you know Ray on a personal level. Any student of Ray and his films should view this for its historical value alone. Ray's English is impeccable.  I wish it was digitally remastered and on DVD.",1412294400,,698,4.453125
