325709,4,6301224612,"I enjoyed this Video anthology of  ""the Boss"". It had a lot of my favorite songs and a few new ones I had not heard before. (They actually were not new songs, but I hadn't heard them before). There was a repeat of one or two songs. But one of the repeats of Born In The USA was an acoustic version and I think I preferred that version to the original one that was released. Over all I was pleased with my purchase!",1355270400,2,414,3.9879518072289155

325712,5,6301224612,"The video is exactly what I expected.  I previously had the VHS version and wanted to upgrade to the DVD version.  The DVD version was excellent quality and it came with bonus videos that the VHS version did not contain.

I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1300665600,,261,4.51063829787234
325713,4,6301224612,"I really like having all of the videos that Bruce Springsteen made during his ""heyday"" which, arguably, he's still experiencing.  However, the 5.1 mixes of the songs are very disappointing.  I think that, for some of the clips, the post-production crew merely threw some reverb to the back surround speakers and that was the extent of it.  Also, why is the legendary Phoenix, AZ performance of ""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" edited, thus excluding the band introductions?  That section is one of the coolest moments in a video loaded with them.  There was plenty of room on the DVD, so the complete clip could easily have been included.

The second disc, for me, is too ""sad,"" if that makes any sense.  There are so many heavy, dramatic songs that by the end of the DVD, I needed to listen to Katrina and the Waves just to get my mood back up.  Usually, I feel the exact opposite after watching anything having to do with Bruce Springsteen, but not after watching this disc.  I felt like weeping.

Overall, one can't deny the quality of the material, but I think it could've been put together in a more balanced and effective fashion.",1273968000,,1133,4.648241206030151
325714,2,6301224612,"New Springsteen fans may enjoy this anthology, but I was disappointed.

325716,5,6301224612,"... the Boss?

Well, just cue up the track Fire, wait a few minutes and, if you *still* have any questions, ask any woman in the room...",1198454400,,136,4.037037037037037
325717,4,6301224612,"First: They should've waited until ""The Rising"".

Second: Bruce has pro-shot footage dating back to 1972-1973. Starting it at 1978 with ""Rosalita"", running through ""Born in the USA"" and then ""Born to Run"" at the end, not to mention a mid-90s ""Hungry Heart"" promo on the second. The continuity is kind of wacky.

There's a whole show filmed for ""No Nukes"". There's ""Austin City Limits"" (which no one can find). There's 1975 footage at the Roxy in LA, and a BBC shot show at the Hammersmith as well as other shows that have been circulating on bootlegs. The Neil Young ""Bridge"" concert. The Barcelona video's great, but the marathon shows he used to do should really be out there for all of us to see...

Once Bruce started doing videos, he wound up getting top-name directors like Brian DePalma, John Sayles,Jonathan and Ted Demme. A lot of them are memorable and beautifully shot, but a lot of the ""Born in the USA"" footage just makes you wonder why he hasn't put out one of the shows on DVD. You see a bit of E Street history, including the era where he ditched those guys for a while, then working with them on ""Murder Inc."". ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and ""Beautiful Disguise"" have Bruce singing live to a backing track, very unusual.

Bruce's fans will love this, but they'll love it more if they put out some of the footage that made people enchanted with his shows.",1103068800,6,1370,4.579591836734694
325718,5,6301224612,Given that it did maybe have a few crappy camera angels & lighting; how could anybody be unhappy with their purchase after seeing him prance around in a pair of tight pants? This DVD collection made me wish I could have seen him in concert...,1094256000,3,242,4.4
325719,5,6301224612,"A nice summary of Bruce's early video work.  However, why the edit on ""Rosalita"" - the band introductions (which were originally included when the video came out in the 80's) were a lot of fun.  I'd love to find a copy of them.
Otherwise, a great presentation",1079222400,3,259,4.48936170212766
325720,3,6301224612,Disk 1 is very good with live performances. Disk 2 was not that great and is videos. I wanted the song Rosalita as that is the best song and is missing from latest DVD's.,1072224000,3,170,4.029411764705882
325721,4,6301224612,"This chonological colection of Springsteen's work is great for any Springsteen fan. The 2 DVD set is essentially his greatest hits in video form. A lot of these videos are live performances and show how great Bruce Springsteen is as a live performer. Bruce Springsteen truly is The Boss, and this video collection adds to the legacy. Highlights of the DVD include a rivoting live performance of War, found on the bos set, and a rare version of Fire, a song he wrote for the Pointer Sisters. This also shows some of the later work, including Secret Garden from Jerry Maguire, and Murder Incorporated from his greatest hits album. 4 out of 5 because of Weak representation form the pre-BITUSA era.",1056844800,6,695,4.75206611570248
325722,4,6301224612,"Bruce Springsteen is quite a performer in a live concert setting.  Fortunately many of the clips feature Bruce in concert over the years.  I really like the opening Rosalita whre Bruce  dances and prances around the stage and the ladies go wild.  The body guards had a busy time at that concert.  Dancing In The Dark is another concert highlights as Bruce is in fine form.  Its truly a highlight when he dances with a lady from the adueience.  Fire and Born To Run are other highlights from the concert stage.
As far as videos go, many of the songs from Born In The USA are quite captivating.  Super footage from I'm On Fire depicting Bruce's infatuation with a lady. Also I like Glory Days and the baseball scenes coupled with Bruce performing in a Jersey bar.  Stevie Van Zandt and Clarence look like they are having fun mugging for the camera.
I would have liked to have seen more songs from Bruce's earlier releases.  Other than that, this is an enjoyable video of one fo the legendary performers of our time, Bruce Springsteen.",1055808000,,1032,4.559782608695652
325723,4,6301224612,"This collection of music videos shows Springsteen's sometimes love/hate relationship with the music video format.  He obviously recognized their value but never quite seemed comfortable in front of the camera.  Not surprisingly, the best videos here are the live performance clips, although some of the conceptual pieces are impressive.
Here's a breakdown of some of the highlights (and lowlights):
Disc Two:
""Human Touch"": The first video of the post-E-Street-Band era, this comes from the same director responsible for ""Tunnel of Love"" and ""One Step Up"" and shows the same basic approach.  The pictures are pretty but the formula was starting to get a little repetitive by this point.
""Better Days"": One of Bruce's least known videos, it breaks away from the ""Tunnel of Love"" formula, even though its from the same director, featuring a live-in-the-studio performance of the song, interspersed with Bruce clowning with his new band and his kids (someone's kids anyway).  The ragged, uneven end to the song is oddly endearing.
""57 Channels (And Nothing On)"": I had never even heard of this video before getting this DVD.  It's as close as Bruce ever got to the too-literal ""match the image to the lyric"" school of video.  Probably the least interesting pure-conceptual video Bruce has done.
""Leap of Faith"": Another video from the same director as the live ""Tougher Than The Rest"" clip and it shows the same basic approach, mixing in footage from other songs and even other concerts.  The performance is energetic enough but the formulaic approach and the lack of the E-Street Band's chemistry undercut the video somewhat.
""Streets of Philadelphia"": The video for Bruce's Oscar and Emmy-winning song from the Jonathan Demme movie.  Similar in some respects to ""My Brilliant Disguise"", combining the studio instrumental track with a  new live vocal track by Bruce recorded as his walks the aforementioned streets.  Clever editing lets Bruce exchange meaningful glances with Tom Hank's character from the movie.
""Murder Incorporated"": A live version of the legendary ""lost"" Springsteen song (It was to be the title track of the album Springsteen scrapped in favor of the more upbeat and accessible ""Born In The U.S.A.""), this was Bruce's first performance with the E-Street Band in almost seven years.  Filmed in front of an audience at a small New York club, the cramped quarters limited the mobility of Jonathan Demme's cameras and the inadequate lighting makes Bruce and the band look almost sinister.  The blistering performance, however, carries the day.
""Secret Garden"": Bruce's love letter to the fairer sex, he's the only person with a Y Chromosome in this video, showing a large variety of women of all shapes, sizes and ages, emoting for the camera.  Tender and beautifully filmed, this is one of my favorites of Springsteen's recent videos.  There are actually two versions of the video on this DVD, the second using the alternate ""Strings"" mix of the song.
""Hungry Heart"": This is a really strange bird, apparently filmed for an anniversary release of the song in Germany, it was filmed ""live"" in Berlin with a new vocal by Bruce over the original 1980 instrumental track.  Features shows of a Bruce playing with a local band and driving around the city past sections of the Berlin Wall.
""Dead Man Walking"": Unlike ""Streets of Philadelphia"", this video features significant footage from the film that insprired the song, making it more of a trailer for the film than the video.  Nothing wrong with that I guess, but makes for one of the lesser contribution to Springsteen's video oeuvre.
""The Ghost of Tom Joad"": In a lot of ways, this is the spiritual cousin to ""Atlantic City"", in that it combines black and white documentary-style footage and nothing of the singer (except as a silhouette in a couple of shots).  This is the more effective of the two because the footage is a better match to the theme of the song.
 ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"": The second video for the same song, this was taken from Bruce's appearance on the Tonight Show.  I don't have anything against this performance or this song, but if they were going to take a second video for a song from a talk show, I would have preferred the version of ""Murder Incorporated"" he did on the Letterman show earlier that year.
""Highway Patrolman"": Here's a video with a long, unique history.  A song recorded in 1982 inspires a Sean Penn film in 1991 and the two get combined for a music video in the year 2000.  I'll say this much, it made me want to see the film (""The Indian Runner"").
""If I Should Fall Behind"": Shot during rehearsal for the 1999-2000 reunion tour, this features a single camera shot of the E-Street Band trading vocals on Springsteen's 1992 song.  Unfortunately, the vocals are a bit overwrought.  The version on the second disc of the ""Live in NYC"" DVD is more restrained and more effective.
""Born In The U.S.A."": If the last video was OVERwrought, this video is badly UNDERwrought.  From Bruce's appearance on the ""Charlie Rose Show"", the best description I can offer of Bruce's performance is ""autistic.""  It's a kinder word than ""lifeless.""  If I had been a member of Springsteen's inner circle, I would have sat on Bruce until he came to his senses and left this video off this collection.  It brings the second disc to a limp and unsatisfying conclusion.",1017878400,34,5350,4.908990011098779
325724,2,6301224612,"The only reason I gave it two stars is because I need to feel I didn't totally waste $24.00. I am a huge Bruce fan but this is the worst of Bruce. The acting videos are campy, the live videos are good. The acoustic Born in the USA is about the worst!!!! It is so pretentious, this is BAD blues at best. Also there is no DVD extras at all, no commentary, no interviews...nothing. This DVD is awful.",1012003200,4,397,4.102564102564102
325725,5,6301224612,"The very first DVD I purchased and let me tell you it was an absolute hit at Christmas time.  You get all the great videos like ""Glory Days""; ""Born to Run"" and ""Hungry Heart"", plus a few concert scenes showing Bruce when he was just starting out.  It really is great.  I suggest that anyone who has a DVD and plans on throwing a party, pick up this DVD.  You will not be dissapointed.  The only thing that could have been better would have been if there were interviews with Bruce himself or The E Street band.  That would have been cool.",1009929600,,538,4.2254901960784315
325726,5,6301224612,"Video Anthology is great.  The ""Born In The U.S.A."" videos bring back fond memories of Bruce's leap into the world of video making (and corny acting as well), as well as my trying to catch the latest ones on MTV.
The only negativity I have is that I seem to recall that the promo video for Rosalita included Bruce introducing the E Street Band during the instrumental break, whereas this version edits that part out.  Still the promo shows a taste of the energy of what Bruce was like live.
It does get a little weak after the ""Tunnel of Love"" videos but recovers nicely by ""Streets of Philadelphia"".
All in all a great addition to a Springsteen fan's collection.",1006473600,,663,4.516666666666667
325727,5,6301224612,"First off, I admit I'm a huge Springsteen fan. Now, onto the DVD. My first copy of this anthology was a dubbed copy of a VHS rental that I played the heck out of. So I was shocked at how good the footage looked on my DVD player. Some of the videos on the second disc I had never seen, like ""Highway Patrolman"". If you like Bruce, this is a good place to start your collection. Sure there are things that should have been included, but lets cross our fingers that the MSG show will be out on DVD soon.",999129600,,500,4.01
325728,4,6301224612,"The Minister of Rock'n Roll has yet to provide us with a video of all live performances, but if like me, you really can't wait, this is a DVD with great cuts that you shouldn't hesitate to put into your library.  It's the closest thing available to a full concert by the Boss for your viewing screen. Its mood ranges from reflectively acoustic, to joyously lighthearted, to passionately engaged.
For anyone who's never seen the Boss live, there are enough such cuts here to begin converting you into a fan.  As long as this world has not yet succeeded in turning your heart to stone, I believe Springsteen's unpretentious sincerity and depth of soul will speak to you through these discs.
Whether in his acoustic version of ""Born to Run"" or in the plugged version, the connection he makes with his audience is palpable. You'll feel what's in his gut and his concern for young people during this live rendition of ""War."" You'll hear an intense form of patriotism in ""Born in the USA,"" not of the sunshine variety, but of one whose heart has the strength to suffer from the sins of his country AND who desires to do what he can to make his country better through confronting rather than hiding from its mistakes.  You'll hear on the first disc his best rendition yet of ""Tunnel of Love,"" a confidently reflective ""Tougher than the Rest,"" and a heart-searing version of ""Spare Parts"" that alternatively tears and sizzles.
On the second disc, ""Leap of Faith"" will give the uninitiated a lighthearted sense of how this man ""gets down"" and connects with his audience -- a connection which for him clearly, is always a personal affair.  For those of us who know already, we'll just smile and sing or scream along with him while we take that ""Leap of Faith"" or while he unveils the ""Hungry Heart"" in each living soul.  Never having spent a night under the trestles, we'll still feel the campfire and the dignity of every human being through the eyes of ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" in two haunting acoustic versions.  When the E Street Band joins him in ""If I Should Fall Behind,"" one can feel the heart, pathos, and hope of those who knew of what they were singing. You're also likely to draw connections in your life, as I believe only the blind and deaf of soul could remain untouched.
While nothing can compare with the live experience of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, this video includes live cuts that are priceless.  Several of the taped versions are done especially well also such as Human Touch, 57 Channels, Streets of Philadelphia -- not to mention the plain ol' spirit of fun expressed in Dancing in the Dark, I'm on Fire, and Glory Days.
For those who have seen him in concert though, we won't be satisfied until we get a video/DVD compilation that simulates his live performances, not from a historical perspective, but simply of his ""best"" performances, available on tape.
For the uninitiated, ""best"" needs to be put in quotes, because the man never performs a song the same way twice.  But there's a huge fan-base out here that would love to see a simulated live concert on DVD, whose company we could keep in our home, while we wait for another reunion of the Boss and the E Street Band.",997228800,3,3202,4.595446584938704
325729,5,6301224612,"Anything Bruce Springsteen produces is great but I agree there could have been more ""extras"" on the DVD including history and interviews. There are many more songs that I would like to see live especially from his latest E Street Band tour ( which unfortunately didn't come to Australia).

325730,5,6301224612,"Bruce Springsteen and his songs stand for everything every young guy dreams about ... and every young guy fears. Songs by Bruce Springsteen are the reason to pack your girl on the back seat of your motorcycle, cool wind blowing in your faces. I practically grew up with the Boss, listening to his songs with passion and intensity, and still feel the wind blowing in my face when I turn up the volume of my stereo, still feel my girl sitting behind me on my tuned Honda, while listening to the Boss. There is something special about his music, a reality that captures your mind and your heart, making you face the hopes and dreads of a whole generation. From Born in the USA, No Surrender or Atlantic City to Born to Run, these songs have a story to tell and you better be listening. When I think of it now, there is no other band or singer I lisented to in my youth, that survived the whole way to being grown up. This DVD is essential, it is rich, it is intense, but most of all it is full of heart. Buy this together with Blood Brothers.",986342400,5,1039,4.252525252525253

325732,4,6301224612,"It's great to have the Boss's music videos on DVD. The first disk is by far the best, encompasing his work from 1975-89. It starts of with a nine minute version of ""Rosalita"" and ends with the slow version of ""Born To Run"". Unfortunately, the second disk (except for ""Murder Incorporated"") is pretty weak . It has his lost days with the non E Streeters  (when he recorded ""Human Touch"" and ""Lucky Town"")and recovers slightly thereafter. If your a true Boss fan, it's worth buying.",983145600,,480,4.647058823529412
325733,5,6301224612,"The original Bruce Springsteen video anthology was release din 1989 and it contained all his video work up to that point.  This reissue expands the original video to contain his work up until 2000.  Mr. Springsteen's songs are vividly written, so they practically beg for video treatment.  In fact, Sean Penn based the movie he made his directorial debut on, Indian Runner, around ""Highway Patrolman"" from Nebraska.  Mr. Penn directs a video for the song that is made of clips from his movie.  Other recent clips includes other soundtrack songs for ""Streets Of Philadelphia"" and ""Dead Man Walking"" directed by Jonathan Demme & Tim Robbins respectively.  Mr. Demme also directs ""Murder Incorporated"" and the most recent video, ""If I Should Fall Behind"".  On his 1999-2000 tour, the song was a shared vocal effort.  Mr. Springsteen, Little Steven, Nils Lofgren, Patti Scialfa and Clarence Clemons would all sing a verse with a group huddle around the mic at the end.  The video perfectly captures this feel with the mic being the center of attention.  A great video.  The older videos still stand up especially the John Sayles trilogy of ""Born In The U.S.A."", ""I'm On Fire"" and ""Glory Days"".  ""U.S.A."" is particularly outstanding and ranks as one of the best videos ever made.  ""Tunnel Of Love"" and ""Brilliant Disguise"" are strong and ""One Step Up"" has a rare ""acting"" performance from Mr. Springsteen.  Two of the most powerful videos don't include Mr. Springsteen at all; ""Atlantic City"" and ""The Ghost Of Tom Joad"".  They are both shot in black and white and the former captures the stark nature of the Nebraska album and the latter (with photos by his sister Pamela) captures the desperation of the Joad album.  This anthology is an absolute must for any Springsteen fan and a great collection for even the casual fan.",982022400,2,1820,4.898692810457517
325734,5,6301224612,"Never owned the VHS version but always had those memories of the MTV videos of the past. No hesitation in purchasing the new DVD Anthology, especially in the expanded version. Also really wanted to experience the 5.1 Dolby Digital upgrade with this offering. The 5.1 is truely an upgrade sonically ! Don't put off getting that DVD machine any longer.  Is great cruising through the old videos, and also seeing old concert footage --Thunderroad, both versions of Born to Run, Tunnel of Love tour footage, etc. Add the 2nd disc to the picture --brought up to the Reunion , and it nicely covers the span. A very satisfying product I must say. It assuredly is a 'must have' for the Springsteen enthusiast, collector, fan, believer.  Would also highly recommend the other recent release ""Blood Brothers"" . And here's hoping for an additional treat with the possible release of a Reunion Tour DVD .",981590400,,892,4.823529411764706
325735,4,6301224612,"This DVD package is essential if you are a Springsteen fan, and the new and seldom-seen videos are great.  I only wish they'd have really put together a *special* package to reward the legions of die-hard fans.  This DVD could have contained so much more information and treats...the discography is weak, with only 1 short audio clip from each of his wonderful albums.  A little more history would have been great, as well as perhaps some footage showing the amazing arc of his career, from cult status, to Bossmania, to his induction into the R&R Hall of Fame, to the triumphant reunion tour of the E Street Band.  Commentary from Bruce and the E Street Band would have been so cool...I'd love to hear his take on what he remembers about that concert that ""Rosalita"" was filmed, when the women all jump on stage and attack him. There are wonderful stories behind all these videos, and with the DVD format, they could really have done it some justice.
And finally, why 2 versions of ""The Ghost of Tom Joad""??  There is plenty of other material that could have been chosen to avoid that repetition.  His appearance on Dave Letterman's final show for NBC would have been a great one, especially if they included Dave's introduction...he was barely able to contain his excitement when announcing his final special surprise guest.  Oh well....still a great DVD.",980726400,9,1357,4.773504273504273
325736,4,6301224612,"Anyone ever notice how Bruce's characters travel through his songs and show up over time in strategic places?  For instance, Mary shows up in ""Thunder Road"" and then in ""The River""  and finally in ""Straight Time"" from ""Ghost.""  What a journey from youthful idealism to reality crash to acceptance of the hard ways of the world.  And I think that free and innocent guy from ""Born to Run"" wound up with nowehere left to run on ""Born in the USA"" and then found a sense of peace on ""Better Days."" But maybe that's just me.  Anyway, this is a stunning collection: part inspiring, part touching, part hard nose storytelling.  The DVD format is fantastic. I got a state of the art home theatre system and this thing sounded great. I liked the newer clips as well as the old ones.  My favorites: ""57 Channels"" for the humor(and the only time I've seen Bruce play bass) ""Secret Garden"" for the  depiction of REAL women which is rare in videos ""If I Should Fall Behind"" who knew all those guys could sing so beautifully! well, I already knew from their solo records but it was nice to be reminded...""The River"" at that point was brand new..could you imagine hearing that thing before it was released? ""Leap of Faith""-this one really captures the spirit of the live shows ""Glory Days""-in a bar no less....I guess these guys have always really just aspired to be a great bar band...somehow they became something more... The only problem I have is that there are not more extensive liner notes..... Also, did anyone notice that new song at the end; it plays over the credits.  If that's Bruce singing, it sounds unlike anything I've ever heard from him.  It's probably called something like ""Lift Me Up""...it is uncredited.....it's just proof that his career continues(which is lucky for us) and he continues to sing a new song....Thanks, Bruce.....",980467200,9,1836,4.709375
325742,5,6301224612,"If you listen and love Bruce, then this is a must have. The days of real videos being played on MTV or VH1 are over. This DVD is really well done and includes the original Video Anthology and goes on to include such hits as Human Touch, Better Days, and The Ghost of Tom Joad.
My only wish is that more of TGOTJ material was included as Bruce is one hell of a performer, even when performing alone.
A nice feature is ""Lift Me Up"" is played when the credits roll.",980380800,,462,4.087912087912088
325743,5,6301224612,"Springsteen's songs are so cinematic in nature, that on some levels, videos seem a good match.  Sure enough, that is reflected in the titles here.  We have no less than 3 videos here with film clips, all stellar films.  We have John Sales directing a short story version of I'm on Fire.  Brian DePalma, Jonathan Demme, Tim Robbins, & Sean Penn also make appearences in the credits.

This is a fine collection of videos, like the music, that is basic, non-flashy, and direct.  It also contains many live concert videos, which, of course, are wonderfull glimpes into the magic that Springsteen brings to the stage.

The Atlantic City, I'm on Fire, Brilliant Disguise, Human Touch, Secret Garden, Ghost of Tom Joad, Streets of Philidelphia, and Highway Patrolman videos are the highlights of the non-performance selections. Of the live footage, an extremely energetic 'Rosalita' from '78, a hilarious 'Fire,' a totally reworked and beautiful 'Born to Run,' an angry 'Spare Parts,' a spectacular 'Leap of Faith,' and a moving If I Should Fall Behind are the best.

Best of all is the closing clip of Bruce reworking Born in the USA solo on guitar for the Charlie Rose show.  This ledgendary athem of rage is transformed into a dying whisper.

This is video collection with very few misses, and a rich collection of Springsteen's quiet but successfull stroll into the world of videos.",980208000,9,1379,4.905172413793103

325746,4,6301224612,"The Double DVD of Springsteen's music videos is a must-have for fans.  The first DVD is basically the exact line-up of the earlier VHS release (1978-1988) which spans from the '78 ""Rosalita"" video and up to the ""Born To Run (acoustic)"" performance.  There always seems something missing from this line-up, though,  since Springsteen was not really making  videos at the time his first several albums were released.  What we get from ""Born to Run"" is basically a clip of ""Thunder Road"" from ""No Nukes"" and then later performances of the title track.  ""The River"" is also only represented in a ""No Nukes"" clip as well (besides a '95 re-do of Hungry Heart"").  Of course, there's absolutely nothing from my favorite - ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"".  Still, you can't really blame anyone about this now - no videos were made...it's just a shame that the videos only really started to kick off in full force for the ultra-commercial push for ""Born in the USA"".
Disc 2 starts with some good videos from ""Human Touch"" and ""Lucky Town"" which in my opinion rank with his best (along with the videos from ""Tunnel of Love"").  Then we proceed through some so-so videos for some alternate projects (Streets of Philadelphia, Dead Man Walkin', Secret Garden, etc.).  ""Tom Joad"" is represented in a video as well as live-performance and there is a superb video by Sean Penn for ""Highway Patrolman"" compiled of footage from ""Indian Runner"".  Disc 2 is emotionally capped by a new video shot in 2000 for ""If I Should Fall Behind"" where Bruce, Patti, Clarence and Nils share time at the mike.  It's a good song for them at this stage - but it's kind of sad to see that they have aged a bit - but there is no way not to notice aging especially if you are watching such a retrospective from 1978 - 2000...that's just part of life, I suppose.  The only real embarrasment (well, maybe just misstep) on this whole collection is a 1995 video for ""Hungry Heart"".  Shot in Europe somewhere (Berlin?), it's just bad all the way through.  Bruce doesn't sound or look very good, the video is dumb and pretentious and the song was never one of his best to begin with.  A small complaint in an otherwise excellent package. Disc 2 also has a discography which also lists each track of each album.  A pre-selected audio clip from each album will play as well for app. 10 seconds before re-starting.
The digital mastering on the discs is good, although I did notice some of that annoying ""shifting"" going on in the background here and there.  Not too bad, though, and it still looks better than VHS.  Audio is in a new 5.1 surround or PCM stereo.  PCM stereo was much crisper and clearer on my system.",979257600,,2666,4.584388185654008
