In this episode, Lt. Columbo must investigate the murder of a nurse who was about to denounce Dr. Barry Mayfield. Mayfield (Leonard Nimoy), during a surgical operation, had sewed with a wrong suture the aortic valve of his colleague Dr. Edmund Hidemann (Will Geer) with the hope that Hidemann would die a few days later. Two scenes of A STITCH IN CRIME will undoubtedly stay in my memory. Firstly, the scene showing the effects of a drug injection on Harry Alexander's mind and, most of all, Columbo's fit of anger against Mayfield. This was the first time we could watch Columbo losing his temper.

A VHS to keep in your library.",1179964800,,1541,7.020833333333333
