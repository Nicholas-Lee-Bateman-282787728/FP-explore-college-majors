8082279,5,B000B63UJG,"Oh the European Style of Horror is impossible not to like. You get vampire women running loose and just a bit too sexy and beautiful to resist--though I advise that you do! ""Fangs Of The Living Dead"" is a Full-Color Vampire Film loaded with everything you could wish for, creepy castle, paranoid villagers, Vampire woman rising out of a fog-shrouded grave and wonderful english-dubbed dialogue! Next, you have the strange Barbara Steele, Scream Queen of the 1960's in a low budget Creature Feature ""She~Beast""! It's also in color and though not as good as her Mario Bava directed Masterpieces, it's still hard to take your eyes off her even when she's a creepy  Monster Maiden!",1356307200,4,677,4.886956521739131
