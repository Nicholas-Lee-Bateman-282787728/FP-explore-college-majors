They rarely point a barrel at one another.

Decent cinematography, but starts dragging after 45 mins of watching them doing patrols.
Def some hardware on display.

Rent me.",1295568000,,245,4.545454545454546
8304559,4,B001G9CNUE,"While far from perfect, the film has great low-budget effects, non-stop action, and a decent (if somewhat convoluted) plot. And at only 65 minutes, it's plenty entertaining and the commentary track is a laugh riot (are these guys high LOL?). Trust me, there's worse crap coming out of Hollywood every passing second! Had these guys been handed a million dollars, who knows what they could have acheived!",1231113600,,403,5.029850746268656
