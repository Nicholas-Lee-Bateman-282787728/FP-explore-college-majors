8701378,3,B00TEPIFEU,"I love Jennifer Kries and have owned many of her DVDs.  She is probably my favorite Pilates/yoga instructor. However, the quality of her DVDs is never good.  I own DVDs that are 10 years old from other instructors that I use all the time and they don't freeze or skip, but this one and several of my other Jennifer Kries DVDs skip so badly that I cannot use it.",1523404800,,361,4.217391304347826
8701379,5,B00TEPIFEU,Great workouts.  Great deal for 4 DVDs.  I like everything JK does.,1518652800,,67,4.5
8701380,3,B00TEPIFEU,"Ordered this over a year ago. I also contacted seller about the sitting series, as well as the navigation guide which the video suggests be consulted prior to beginning. Massage store didn't know anything about this. I have continued to give this set multiple chances over the months, and it's a love-hate thing. The information is beneficial, but there is so much talk-talk-talk that it takes 3x the necessary time and feels very fragmented to be called exercise or meditation. I still haven't figured out how to navigate this set. Instruction seems to be very slow for basic movement; and then for more complicated series, instruction is almost void. It's frustrating. There is also a term Jennifer uses in waking energy, which I have tried to research and can't find anywhere online. I've become a little suspicious about the integrity of this series.",1518393600,2,854,4.979020979020979
8701381,1,B00TEPIFEU,The sitting exercises are missing from the dvd set.,1516492800,,51,4.777777777777778
8701382,1,B00TEPIFEU,"This dvd set is missing all the sitting exercises, they are shown in the introduction sequences, but are not on any disc. These dvds are put out by True Media - are they bootlegs? I have two copies of the Waking Energy dvd that is part of this set, the one by True Media, which I got as part of this set, doesn't have any sitting exercise, but a different copy of the same dvd, put out by Razor, has all the exercises. Why are these missing and nothing is noted about it?  Complete ripoff, why is Amazon supporting this?",1512604800,6,520,4.2
8701383,5,B00TEPIFEU,"Great set of DVD's...lots of choices in types of exercises (yoga, pilates, jazz and a few others). This series of DVD's takes you from beginner of each style of exercise, to expert. DVD #1 is only for beginners w/lots of detail in each style, 2nd is intermediate w/some detail, 3rd is one step up from intermediate and I believe the 4th is expert (haven't gotten there yet). Just wish the segments were only 30 minutes instead of 45 as you progress, so you can do 2 each morning.",1497312000,4,479,4.454545454545454
