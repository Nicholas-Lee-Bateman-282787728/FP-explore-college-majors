2764917,5,B000NDFFMM,"This is a great premise for a tv show. This show could have gone on for years with different characters coming and going. It is a shame that several of the actors,writers,producers left to make Corner Gas,leaving this show to die after two seasons. Is it worth getting?Yes(atleast its two seasons, and not a one season wonder)Does it suck that it ended too soon?Yes,but now you get to watch Corner Gas...",1220832000,,404,4.704225352112676
2764918,4,B000NDFFMM,"Being a fan of Corner Gas, I thought I would give Robson Arms a try. While described as a ""dramedy"" I imagined it to be closer to C.G or even Northern Exposure in style. It's not like either, with a darker look and feel. The stories are very well written with endings that leave you feeling good.
That aside, I did find myself enjoying the characters a great deal and find the humor subtle, which I enjoy. I have come to love this show and am buying season 2 and looking forward to future seasons.
Fine acting and writing make this worthwhile",1207872000,12,542,4.323529411764706
2764919,5,B000NDFFMM,"This series was a delightful surprise. I picked it up after enjoying a number of great Canadian TV programs(DA VINCI'S INQUEST, SLINGS AND ARROWS, INTELLIGENCE)because it featured Mark McKinney and John Cassini, whose work I had enjoyed in those shows. It's an anthology, really, akin to a really satisfying book of short stories. Each 22-minute episode is  a character study that takes you into one apartment in the Robson Arms, so you gradually get to know the eccentric, wonderfully delineated denizens of the building. Unifying elements include Cassini's randy super Yuri, the fountain statue whose urinations are timed suspiciously well to the sexual activities in the building, and the on-camera musical musings of a folk duo who lurk about the premises. The tone of the episodes ranges from farcical to very touching, but there's a core of humanity to each of them that's just lovely. Just be aware: this isn't ABC Family Channel stuff: the language is pretty salty, the sexuality and drug use are frank.",1201132800,13,1011,5.090361445783133
2764920,5,B000NDFFMM,"Megan Follows was great in this show. I think this is one of the best
tv shows she ever guest stared in ever.",1200355200,,109,3.782608695652174
2764921,4,B000NDFFMM,"Whenever I travel in Canada I catch this show. I've been checking periodically hoping it would come out on DVD and here it is! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I haven't actually watched each episode. If you want something laugh out loud funny, with a sexual twist here and there, give this show a chance! And for those of you that long to spend more time in Canada than is feasible, the show may help take a little edge off the longing of wanting to be north of the border.",1174694400,7,490,4.114583333333333
8176849,2,B000NDFFMM,I ordered this series because it had many of the same characters as the show Corner Gas which aired several years ago.  I read the reviews which were favorable and decided to order all three seasons.  That was a mistake.  To me it is more of a dark comedy and I am not a fan of dark comedy.  It lacks the quirkiness and simple humor and lightheartedness of the Corner Gas series so very disappointing.  Had to struggle to get through just a few episodes but since I was stupid enough to order all three seasons before at least checking out season one I will torture myself and watch them in hopes they improve.  If you are looking for something similar to Corner gas this is not it.,1458000000,3,682,4.2890625
8176850,4,B000NDFFMM,"not exactly what I expected-thought it might be like Corner Gas. But that was my mistake, I didn't read any summary before buying--I just saw some of Corner Gas players and wanted it for that. All in all, I'm glad I got it.",1401753600,,223,4.209302325581396
8176851,5,B000NDFFMM,"Enjoy the lives of the people in Robson Arms. How many times have you wanted to know the people in the area you live. This is that chance to see, just who and what your neighbors are.  the land  lord who does little but sure knows when your away, but for personal reasons. The new divorcee with her young son sitting her up on a blind date. the Dr. and his hot for anything young and male wife. the two drug dealers who smoke most of there product as sell it. the May - Dec, gay couple.  Check into the Robson for yourself. it is worth it, just for the stress relief of laughing.",1395964800,,579,4.06140350877193
8176852,4,B000NDFFMM,"I've wanted to see this show for a few years as a lot of my favorite actors from corner gas star & guest star in it. It's a pretty good show, the characters are slightly off beat. I wouldn't watch it with the kids around as it has some very mature themes and there is some nudity & drug use.",1389830400,,291,3.8666666666666667
8176853,4,B000NDFFMM,Leslie Nielsen was an unexpected and awesome addition to the already thoughtful cast of characters.  This series continues to please.,1380672000,,133,5.65
8176854,4,B000NDFFMM,With the Discovery of Corner Gas I was looking for something else new to try. This shows subject matter was a little harsh at first but I stuck with it and  still interesting to watch. Not for kids at all though. The stories are very good and seem real. I have plans on buying Season Two.,1327536000,,288,4.142857142857143
8176855,3,B000NDFFMM,"Season 2 is better than season 1, But season one has some great shows,but not all. It took season 2 to see the plots and cast develope into good shows week after week,More adult themes here than found in Corner Gas. Hank and Lacey(C.G.) are regular guests in Robson Arms,Brent & Wanda (C.G.) appear together in one episode.",1268438400,2,323,4.586206896551724
8176856,4,B000NDFFMM,"A friend who shares my same penchant for quirky Canadian videos recommended Robson Arms.  I loved it!  I sent for all three seasons for myself and plan to give Season One as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift to my son.

I must be jaded.  I say this because I was constantly caught off-guard by the plot developments in this series.  I loved the loony collection of residents, each with their own foibles, whose antics and idiosyncracies often elicited a guffaw of surprised delight.

While it's true there's salty language, and both adult situations and sight-gags, it's somehow not offensive.  While this is not a series a child should view, it's not something a child would be interested in because it's mostly over their heads.

I watched Season One with a smile.  Season Two has less of a smile factor, but it's necessary to understand Season Three, whose smile factor is right back up to par with Season One.

The real tragedy is that this clever series ended at all.",1253923200,4,972,4.6982248520710055
8176857,5,B000NDFFMM,"I have been a fan of ""Corner Gas"" for quite a while, also one of ""Are You Being Served,"" and ""Keeping Up Appearances.""  While ""Corner Gas"" and ""Robson Arms"" are both Canadian, they certainly show the type of British humor that I like.  I have just started to watch Robson Arms--Season 1--I know from the first few episodes that I really like them.  The characters are just that and remind me so much of many Canadians that I have met over 50 years of traveling through Cananda--Western Canada.  Irony mixed with humor and a more simplistic view of life make these number one in keeping one's attention.  I can't wait to watch all of the series.",1239235200,,644,4.517241379310345

First heard of this because I am a fan of CORNER GAS series -- several actors are in both series.  UNFORTUNATELY this series is NOT Corner Gas -- not really funny ""funny"" and defintely NOT for ""family (children)"" viewing.  Was a different view of actors who are in both series but SORRY I PURCHASED --",1237852800,4,494,6.6875
