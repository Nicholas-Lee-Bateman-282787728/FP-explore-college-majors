6155077,5,B00HDOIB7A,"Krrish 3 is definitely worth all five stars! The third in a series of sci-fi movies starring Hrithik Roshan, and produced by his father, Rakesh Roshan, Krrish is about a tender-hearted superhero who can't keep regular employment because he always responds when disaster strikes.  Vivek Oberoi plays a very convincing villain, and Priyanka Chopra (also in the second movie, ""Krrish"") plays his beautiful and intelligent wife. The special effects are outstanding! Parts of the movie might be scary for younger viewers, and there is some fighting, but good truimphs in the end and the world is restored to order! A fun, action-packed movie that will make you feel good.",1391212800,,666,5.110091743119266

6155079,5,B00HDOIB7A,"I honestly don't know why anyone could fail to enjoy this film - it boasts a coherent storyline - rare for Hindi cinema- and although it wears its derivative tag proudly in terms of the storyline and influences, these were present in the previous 2 films in Rakesh Roshans' superhero trilogy - these are no mere copycat efforts though, since what runs throughout the 3 films is a solid storyline with a lot of emotional resonance - something I find lacking in many Western superhero films.

Everything about Krrish 3 smacks of class EXCEPT for the rather unnecessary inclusion of some dubious song and dance interludes - if the gear-shift in tone is meant to echo a more ""mature"" approach to the superhero genre as seen in many recent Western superhero films, it's slightly (only slightly...) de-railed by the rather dated-seeming songs..

The carefree and tongue in cheek nods to earlier Hindi era (60's, 70's and 80's) cinema which peppered the previous two films is lost here with some songs which are a little sub-par. However, from a purely personal standpoint, I loved them and they do kind of grow on you - the sequence shot in Petra, Jordan is helped by a wonderfully evocative song and some truly stunning photography - worth getting Krrish 3 for this alone.

My personal view is that the Roshans should have released the songs as supporting videos as part of their marketing strategy - to echo the smart placement of the earlier films by releasing tantalising trailers - and then left the songs out altogether in the film - that would have set a really serious precedent for a Hindi commercial blockbuster - the film stand up on its own without these sequences for one reason - Hrithik Roshans terrific dual turn as both the titular hero and his father, both in terms of acting and his physical stunt work.

In terms of the acting - the real revelation is Kangana Ranaut, who manages to turn in a superbly controlled performance along with some great stunt work - rare for a Hindi film actress.

Finally, audiences expect a certain level of quality as far as visual effects are concerned, with a very high bench mark being set and exceeded by every new blockbuster - the Roshans have stepped up to the plate in this regard and have delivered an ""A"" class film which deserves its place as an all time box-office smash hit for Indian cinema.",1390521600,3,2349,4.677966101694915
6155080,3,B00HDOIB7A,"If you want to watch Krrish 3 and its predecessors, make sure that you keep Indian films in mind and don't go in there comparing this film to any superhero film. Does anyone even think that a film like Batman would work in the Indian heartland?
Krissh has lot of action, emotion and entertainment to keep you interested throughout its duration. Krrish mainly rests on and revolves around Kaal, the result of an experiment gone berserk played by Vivek Oberoi who operates from Jungfrau and Kaya, a sexy science ka karishma played by Kangna Ranaut, his creation- they have acted well and have to be seen to be believed. While Kangna Ranauts Kaya shines, Priyanka Chopra dwindles in a very miniscule role of no substance as Krrish's wife.
This is the third installment of the franchise ( more will be made, I suspect) and this is mainly targeted towards the kids.
Krrish while not fighting to defeat Kaal and his quest for global dominance through the spread of a virus and creation of mutants is fighting for screen space amongst product placements, which I think is the worst in recent years. Even Hrithik's wife promotes her store the Charcoal project in this film. Advertisements in film plots make me mad.
Krrish also had the worst music of any Rakesh Roshan film to date...period. I cannot remember a single track that registered.
But ultimately Krrish works despite the poor parody of XMen, ET and Superman because Hrithik once again comes to the rescue with his burning enthusiasm, as Krrish he saves mankind and ultimately his father's film from nose diving. In a dual role he is a treat to watch and fun. He looks like a superhero but does not carry the persona of a security officer of a store very well.....If it worked for you the first time there is no reason you would not love the film again. three stars. 11/9/2013",1389744000,2,1828,4.680124223602484
6155081,5,B00HDOIB7A,"My family was introduced to Bollywood through a beautifully made move called Jodhaa Akbar which stars Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai.  We immediately began searching for more movies with these two actors. One of the movies we encountered was Koi Mil Gaya, the first of the Krrish movies starring Hrithik Roshan. We have seen all three in the series, Koi Mil Gaya, Krrish, and Krrish 3, the latest of which we actually got to see in the theater.  All three of these movies fall in the SciFi/Romance category.

If you are not familiar with Bollywood cinema all three of these movies will be vastly different than what you are used to but they are all wonderful in their own right.  Bollywood movies contain music and dancing to express joy, celebration, love, unlike western movies and they can be  ""sappy"" or ""cheesy"" but that is part of the culture and movie experience in India. Most of the movies made in Bollywood are a fantastical escape from the norm.

 **Most Bollywood cinema is not about realism and has some very distinct cultural overtones.  If you watch these movies with this in mind and are willing to explore beyond the western ideas of cinema these movies will not disappoint.**

Bollywood is beginning to spread it's wings when it comes to cinema.  Krrish 3 is a prime example of Indian ingenuity and creativity.  All of the Krrish movies were produced by Rakesh Roshan (Hrithik's father), who was determined to produce Krrish 3 strictly ""in house"".  All of the special effects were done by Red Chilies VFX, a production house in Mumbai, and are as good, if not better, than some of the same kinds of films produced in the west.  Krrish 3 has a good deal of western influence yet wraps it all together in true Bollywood style beautifully.  It has all the elements of a super hero movie we love in the west with all of the elements of Indian culture that make Bollywood films unique and endearing.",1388188800,37,1914,4.674626865671642
6155082,3,B00HDOIB7A,"I have not seen Krrish 1 and 2. The opening of the film explains India's superhero in case you missed them. Rohit (Hrithik Roshan) is a picked on geek who prayed for super powers and got them from a blue alien blurring the religion and science lines. He has a son Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) who is also the superhero Krrish whose identity is known only to Rohit and Krishna's wife (Priyanka Chopra). There is something about the evil Dr Aya (Naseeruddin Shah) in the beginning which you forget about as the bad guy is Kaal (Vivek Oberoi).

Kaal does two things. First he creates a race of mutants as he mixes men with animals. They are not called mutants or X-men, but manimals. The second thing he does is create a deadly virus for which his Kaal pharmacy has the only antidote.

Krrish has super strength, but is not quite superman. He represents a philosophy that all men have the power to do or create good within themselves, blending their basic religious philosophy with superhero movies. Bollywood has no problem doing this and also has no problem tossing random musical numbers into the film (this one has three) making flash mobs look like child's play.

The biggest negative about this film is the English subscripts. They are not used all the time. When they are used they do not follow rules for grammar, spelling, or capitalization...far worse than any of my Amazon reviews. Some examples:

ty=try
cary= carry
leR= left
aRer= after (R=ft)
antidote=antidote, anti dote, or anti dot.
obsorve=absorb
The word ""if"" immediately becomes part of the word in front of it...""ifthere""

Their favorite contraction is: ""who're you."" I always do a double take.

Like most Bollywood productions, they are too long and are divided in half. When you think the film should be over after 90 minutes, there is s second half which should have been a second film.

Not recommended unless you have developed a tolerance for Bollywood productions.",1387584000,4,1935,4.8102409638554215
6155083,5,B00HDOIB7A,"Decided to give this a shot and was not dissapointed at all.
The script is not without flaws but every other aspect of the movie is decent enough to make up for the ridiculous emotional scenes. In general the movie has a high production value.
The cinematography, editing, sets, customs, direction and above all, the visual effects were pretty impressive.
The music was irrelevant and flat, wish could have been eliminated all together.
The actors did a pretty decent job except a few characters that failed to deliver.
Overall it's a collaborative work that keeps the attention throughout, never gets boring.

6155113,4,B00HDOIB7A,"The Indian film industry still lags, tech-wise, but it's catching up. KRRISH 3 is Bollywood's most ambitious motion picture in terms of big budget CG effects, in terms of its best foot forward at competing with Hollywood's slick summer blockbusters. I liked KRRISH 3 very much, but then I'd been waiting for years for this next chapter. Maybe you'll like it, too, dear western audience, if only you can keep in mind that its culture dictates that Indian cinema be unapologetically sentimental, that it revel in a tapestry of vivid colors and indulge in weepy melodrama, that it deliver its themes with the subtle impact and locomotion of a pie in the face. I like it when movies wear their hearts on their sleeves.

I get a good chuckle that Krrish can't hold down a civilian job because he's always having to step out to help people in need. In that sense, KRRISH 3 keeps it real. Sometimes, the only way you can slide with a credible public identity is if you pose as an indolent millionaire playboy. The movie opens in spectacular fashion as Krrish remedies the jammed landing gear of a fast descending aircraft. It's really awesome watching Krrish as he leaps from skyscraper to skycraper, at last achieving enough momentum and elevation to rendezvous with the plane in mid-flight. The CG looks really good in this sequence. In fact, barring a lapse here and there - mostly during the fight scenes, when the combatants' crazy acrobatics just seem off - the CG holds up really well. So, yeah, huge props to India's homegrown f/x studio, Red Chillies VFX. I'm a superhero geek, so the flashy action sequences put a big smile on my mug. Note that I'm not gauging the quality of the action sequences or the CG work against those of, say, THE AVENGERS or MAN OF STEEL. That's just asking for a deflated ego. But I'm excited about the strides that Bollywood's made in this department. The f/x look legit.

It's not as if India doesn't already have its catalogue of cape & cowl crimefighters (Ra-One, Shaktimaan, Mr. India, just to name three). But none of those superheroes is inhabited by Hrithik Roshan who happens to be (sorry, SRK) India's reigning most dynamic performer. He alone makes up for the flaws in the film (and there are some). Guy brings a crapload of star power. He also brings the acting. Hrithik pulls double duty in KRRISH 3, playing the regal Krishna/Krrish and Krishna's sweetheart of a dad, genius scientist Rohit Mehra. Hrithik commits to his dual parts so fully that I had no problem buying into Krishna and Rohit as two separate, distinct persons. He does really good work with the Rohit role. Under Hrithik's care, Rohit Mehra is easily the film's most loveable character. Rohit views the world with such childlike wonder.

Not so lovable is Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), the demented, paraplegic genius and the film's histrionic big bad. Kaal has repurposed his scientific acumen. He's been conducting grotesque genetic experiments. Paralyzed from the neck down, only able to move two fingers, Kaal seeks the elusive bone marrow that would match his DNA and thus enable him to walk. His henchmen have been spliced with his own DNA and with animal DNA, this blend endowing them with freakish abilities. Kaal is telekinetic, his mobile two fingers allowing him to channel this power. You'd think, strapped to a wheelchair for most of the movie, only able to fidget two digits, that Vivek Oberoi would opt for a more restrained, more telling performance. But, no, his line delivery is insane, overwrought, off-putting. He's the film's falsest note.

Compensating for Oberoi's poor choices is Kangana Ranaut who plays the catsuit-clad, shape-shifting Kaya. Kaya's character arc is utterly predictable, and yet there's something so very exotic and interesting about her that it's a pleasure just having her onscreen, never mind that, from the moment you set eyes on her, you can pretty much figure out everything that'll happen to her.

Prinyanka Chopra reprises her role of Priya. That's pretty much all I have to say about that.

Embrace the unabashed sentiments, wallow in camp. It's still Bollywood, and it's still Hrithik Roshan. So there will be singing and dancing and much muscle flexed. You cannot have Hrithik in a picture and not have him dance. It's like hiring Saif Ali Khan and not having him play a charming, irresponsible playboy or having Kajol and not have her be awesome. I really liked two of the musical numbers: the jazzy-cool elements of ""Raghupati Raghav"" in which Hrithik shows off his moves (and Priyanka not so much because of her constricting dress) and the seductive groove of ""Dil Tu Hi Bata,"" which is the desert dream sequence with Kaya and Krishna. (To quote music director Rajesh Roshan: ""It was a little new for me, to make a love song for a mutant."")

Expect Mumbai to get demolished like Metropolis and New York. Except unlike in MAN OF STEEL, it's shown here that Krrish, even as he takes on the murderous Kaal, is very much on high alert to prevent as much collateral damage as possible. Although, okay, there is one nitpick (and a SPOILER alert for the rest of this paragraph): I could've sworn there's a scene in which Krrish saves a baby and leaves him on a pile of debris. And, moments later, Krrish hurls Kaal right at that very same pile of debris. But the baby had probably crawled away to safety by then...

Expect also a grip of dramatic poses. Because if you can't pose dramatically when you have on these awesome black leathers, then what's the point of it all?

KRRISH 3 is a flawed desi superhero film made watchable by virtue of Hrithik Roshan's unflinching committment and visual effects that are near par to what Hollywood's been producing. You may have to cut the plotline a break - it's your typical superhero hokum and blarney, with a dash of Bollywood cheese thrown in. It's also commercial cinema at its finest. There's nowhere to look on the screen where there isn't some sort of in-your-face product placement. If only I recognized even one brand (Flair pens? Forever Jewelry? Bournvita? Del Monte? The heck are these?). The final word: KRRISH 3 is fanboy rapture for those who'd spent years replaying and wearing out their copies of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koi-Mil-Gaya/dp/B0001EQI8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koi...Mil Gaya</a>&nbsp;(2003) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krrish-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B008NW4Z3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krrish (Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles)</a>&nbsp;(2006), two films that admittedly receive weightier treatment.

6155118,5,B00HDOIB7A,"As a major fan of Hrithik Roshan, Bollywood, and this franchise in general, I have to say that I went into this installment of Krrish cautiously optimistic. The previews, and the music weren't exactly promising me the magic of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koi-Mil-Gaya/dp/B0001EQI8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koi...Mil Gaya</a>&nbsp;but I knew not to discount the power of Hrithik's commitment to excellence. This movie has a lot going on with it, and I'll be honest there's a lot of source material culled from different superhero mythologies, but don't get it twisted this epic and the characters in it belong to themselves. Just don't be snotty, in just over a decade the Rohans were able to create a viable superhero franchise when everyone said that it couldn't work. What makes this extraordinary is that there is nothing ""Western"" in the perspective here, despite using elements of our superheros: X-Men, Superman, Ironman, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, and others, this is entirely immersed in Indian culture and values. Is it perfect? No, it's got flaws in execution. However, the evolution of the Krrish mythology continues to get better and be true to itself.

First up lets give some love to the Special Effects. Special Effects cost money, and beginning with Koi... Mil Gaya the Krrish franchise has consistently pushed the envelope to bring better and better Special Effects to Bollywood, and it works. Are they up to the standards we get here in the USA in 2014? Not quite. Will they be up to that level when Krrish 4 comes? I'd definitely bet on it! The crumbling buildings, need a little work, as does the flight scenes, but on the whole this movie is a visual treat! Bravo FilmKraft and Red Chilies excellent job!

Now, for the script. Is some of the dialogue a bit cheesy? Yep. Is the premise of what the bad guy wants to do ridiculous? ABSOLUTELY! Hindi films love to completely disregard medical science! However, no self-respecting Fantasy fan can quibble too much. After all, George Lucas has his midichlorines! So, all this can be ignored. My main two issues with the script have to do with a lack of character development for the mutants, and they should have had Rekha mentioned in more than just the prologue! Her funeral picture WAS NOT ENOUGH! Rekha was so important to the mythology of Krrish that I felt like there's this gaping hole in the narrative. I was thrilled that they kept the memory of Nisha alive too!

Now, production, costumes, makeup, sets, etc... Amazing improvement over the last two films! That's not to say there weren't some missteps. First, Ms. Copra's micro-mini red dress was just impractical for the scene, she couldn't really dance because if she moved the wrong way she'd flash the audience! I don't deny the lady's sex appeal, or the fact the boys will love to look at her legs, but three or four extra inches wouldn't have spoiled the view any! Also, they didn't hide the fact that Kaal's metal suit was football gear spray painted silver well. The sets were spectacular! Of course the cinematography was outstanding. Kudos to the makeup artists for the ladies, but Mr. Roshan's kept forgetting to cover his tattoos! In some scenes they're covered, in some they forgot. I dislike inconsistency! At least Krishna's wardrobe got updated and no hideous shirts! Not that he wore many... (yum!)

Now, direction. Thank you Rakeshji, you've given up on claustrophobic shots, cheesy sound effects, and you didn't make your son do anything remotely hammy al la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaho-Naa-Pyaar-Hai-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B000PMGS4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai Bollywood DVD (With English Subtitles)</a>! I'm so glad. I'm not sure how much Roshan Jr. had to do with that, but he did take a lot more responsibility as an Assistant Director in this film, and I do think the influence is there. Rohit, and Krishna, belong so much to him that it's obvious he's deeply invested in protecting them.

Which leads into the performances...

First up, is Hrithik Roshan. Good-Golly Miss Molly, the man's a freak of nature! Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding! The marketing trick is to say he played three roles: Krrish, Krishna, and Rohit, but I couldn't separate Krrish and Krishna the way you would Superman and Clark Kent, so I'll call this a superlative double role. Rohit, and Krishna are such different characters that I find it mind-blowing that he managed to pull it off in the same frame. While we do get a glimpse of it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krrish-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B008NW4Z3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krrish (Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles)</a>&nbsp;nothing can really prepare you for the full impact of what Roshan Jr. accomplishes here! The physical transformations, the mental and emotional shifts he pulls off are nothing short of genius! Rohit once again entrenches himself in your heart and makes you want to become the very best version of yourself, and rightly becomes the ultimate hero of the film. Krishna has a new maturity in this film, while still retaining his charm. He also has deeper shades of darkness and self-doubt that makes him more real. This reflects Roshan Jr's. development as an actor, always pushing to better his craft. Jeeze if he gets any better he'll have to go global, then world domination is assured. I feel bad for all the mere mortals who will have to compete.

Priyanka Chopra does a much better job in this installment than she did in Krrish but to be honest, now that I've truly seen Kangana Ranaut in a full-fledged role, my opinion of Ms. Chopra as an actress is still slowly sinking. She did have moments where she shined, but as a whole she just wasn't impressive!

Kangana Ranaut is INCREDIBLE! In Bollywood, she's considered a fantastic artist. Commercially, she has yet to make a splash as a bankable heroine in her own right. She has incredible chemistry with her fellow actors and she needs a real break! I want her starring in a film with Roshan Jr. where her character actually triumphs for a change! Come on, FilmKraft, make it happen! Kaya is an amazing character, and an amazing performance! She wasn't in the film NEARLY ENOUGH!

Vivek Oberoi plays Kaal, a role Roshan Jr. had originally fought his father hard to play. Now, in my opinion Mr. Oberoi does an adequate job with the character. I believe him when he explains that he worked hard to get it right. HOWEVER, in this instance Father should have listened to the son or gotten Aamir Khan to do it. Fine doesn't cut it when it could have been so much more than FINE! The sad part is I think Mr. Oberoi suffers from delusions of grandeur because in an interview he remarked that ""people"" told him his performance was on par with Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"" okay... no wonder Aishwarya Rai didn't keep him around long. Ego much? Again, he's not bad, he's just nowhere near as good as he thinks he is.

Music: Stop, Chacha Roshanji just stop! On it's own, the soundtrack is pretty awful. In the context of the film, it's serviceable. I just thank God the song ""You're My Love"" was cut from the film. The title might sound good, the song itself not-so-much. ""Dil Tu Hi Bataa"" is Roshan Jr's. favorite, and it's a good song, but I honestly didn't like the way it was filmed for the movie. Don't get me wrong, Jordan has amazing scenery, and I respect anyone who works through sandstorms, but the way the song was presented didn't fit with the narrative. Of course, all this can be ignored if one just loves to stare at the perfection that is Hrithik Roshan's torso, but objectively speaking as a story element, it could have been done much better!

Final Caution to Parents: I wouldn't call this movie graphically violent. It's on par with the superhero movies we have here in the States. BUT I do think that parents should watch it first and decide if their younger children should see it. There are some scenes and moments that could disturb children who are particularly sensitive, so do use sound judgment. Still, this is definitely a great family film, and it has a great message that may sink in to kids.

Special Features: Making of the movie, Making of the Musical numbers, and a writers' interview. All these are interesting but tend to repeat information. It's mostly in English, except the writers' interview. Which if my rudimentary understanding of Hindi is anything to go by was rather boring.

Looking forward to the next chapter SuperSonic everyone!",1392595200,10,8660,5.056022408963585

8631690,3,B00HDOIB7A,"I purchased Koi Mil Gaya and both the Krrish sequel films because I had seen a few other films starring Hrithik Roshan (HR) and I really appreciated his character portrayals and acting abilities (and his incredibly graceful dancing). For some reason I did not realize that he starred in Koi Mil Gaya. I thought he did not make an appearance until the second film but since I wanted to see how the story began I started by watching Koi Mil Gaya. As a result, it wasn't until his character started to transform that I did a double take and paused the film to check the DVD case. HR's portrayal of Rohit Mehra was so effective that I did not even recognize him! I had noticed his unique right hand but I thought this was a prosthetic special effect after I noticed that the alien, Jaadu, had a similar distinction, which I kept expecting to become a plot twist (I honestly had not noticed in any of the other HR films I had seen to that point that this unique right hand is uniquely his). Regardless, I was amazed by how he disappeared into the Rohit character so I was really looking forward to both the Krrish films.
  My immediate response to Krrish was, Who is this terrible actress?! when Priyanka Chopras character, Priya, appeared. Even though I had read a biography posted about her and I knew that she appeared in Krrish, I did not recognize her and I was shocked when I observed how bad her acting was. Prior to Krrish I had seen her in one other film, Barfi!, and I thought she had created a good character. However, after seeing her in both Krrish films I am forced to attribute her performance in Barfi! to the director, Anurag Basu, and to her co-star, Ranbir Kapoor. Her character in the Krrish films was not very interesting so maybe that was why she overacted, but right off I started gritting my teeth while watching Krrish when I realized that she was going to be a key character throughout the film. The bio I read did not mention that she also appeared in Krrish 3 so I was immediately discouraged when I discovered that she was, and she was equally disappointing (and Im a tiny bit ashamed to admit that I kept hoping her character would get killed or die).
  I was so happy with the final plot twist at the end of Krrish that I was really looking forward to where the story might go in Krrish 3. So my second disappointment with Krrish 3, after the Priya character resurfaced, was that after looking at the images on the DVD case I assumed that aliens would be making an appearance, which would be in keeping with the original film. However, when the characters turned out to be manmade mutants my response was, WHAT!? (and the film borrowed heavily from the X-Men and Matrix films).
  My next disappointment was with the focus on HRs fantastically buff body, which was repeatedly displayed to some degree throughout the film (particularly his pelvis, which was exposed to a point just shy of requiring an R-rating). Dont get me wrong, HRs body, much like Hugh Jackmans, is always worth a look but I know what is there (mostly-ha); it is how well developed HR's acting and characters are that I value seeing in his films. Ive noticed that in his more recent films he displays his body and demonstrates his sex appeal more frequently. Unfortunately, I find that this diminishes his performance and I feel sadly disappointed when I see this because it smacks of pretention and maybe insecurity. This tendency was illustrated perfectly in the musical number in Krrish 3 that featured the Barbie Doll mutant who falls in love with Krishna fantasizing about sharing passion with him on some rocky, barren terrain which was merely an excuse to display her in several ridiculously sexy outfits and poses while Krishna obliges her longings in various states of dress and undressa scene that was completely unnecessary to the film. I was so embarrassed by this scene that I fast forwarded through itwhich I have done maybe twice before with a film I haven't already seen (but for different reasons).
  What I did value about HRs performance was his Rohit characterization, which was the type of acting I always hope to see from him. I kept forgetting that he was portraying Rohit as well as Krishna/Krrish. What I found disorienting however was how much Rohit looked like Nicholas Cage (particularly when he was portraying the older version of his character in Peggy Sue Got Married). This was very distracting! What was equally distracting was the haircut Krishna/Krrish was wearing made HR appear too much like Mel Gibson in the early Lethal Weapon filmsand I kept blinking my eyes to try and rid myself of this image!
  I sincerely hope that HR moves beyond the need to display his physique so significantly because I believe he has an extraordinary talent that could develop into a lifelong asset should he choose to continue making films. I read somewhere that Krrish 4 is presently in production but if HR attempts to create another father/son dual role it will likely be difficult for me to see that film because he is now in his forties and no matter how much makeup or film touch-ups are applied, its in the eyes, if you know what I mean. I don't want to see him acting like a twenty year old. I like him as he is.
  Lastly, the plot construct that made me groan was the overuse of children and babies in danger. There were three emphasized instances of this in Krrish 3. The first instance I sat through patiently. The second instance I sat through impatiently. The third instance made me call out, Oh for crying out loud! Im sorry, but rescuing the baby in grave peril just doesnt work in general because I know there is absolutely no way that infant is going to get squashed by the top half of the skyscraper building that is plummeting toward it! What does make me cringe is when adults get harmed and this is a matter of less significanceit must be a child or a baby being rescued from mortal danger for him to be a hero? Yikes!
  All in all, I found Krrish 3 to be over and underacted, disjointed, body beautiful focused, and formulaic. I genuinely hope matters improve in the next installment.",1505692800,,6120,4.582266910420476
