8293971,5,B001DKQDVG,"These 2 Mickey Rooney films are a delight from a simpler time. Hoosier Schoolboy features him as a troubled student, perceived as a ruffian by the school administration. However, Mickey's new teacher digs a little deeper to reveal the source of the boy's behavior. It turns out Mickey's just sticking up for his alcoholic father, a former war hero.
Then there's Little Pal, which has Ralph Bellamy as a doctor treating a crippled Mickey Rooney at his health farm. Can the doctor, known as a healer, get Mickey to walk again, or will a wealthy socialite seduce the doctor? Very sweet, feel-good movie.",1217635200,2,600,4.834951456310679
