8685672,5,B00OZ1QITM,"I just purchased this one a couple days before Lemmys passing (also 1916 album) so you can imagine my emotion when finally arrived while I got the sad news while this bluray and the cd were in their way to my home , 30 years back in 2004 when this show was filmed  , now ten years after Lemmy has left us , as someone said ""Rock N Roll is a little bit less cool from now on""

its very true

Thanks for everything Lemmy
