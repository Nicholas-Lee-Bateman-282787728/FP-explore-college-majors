8326531,3,B001KGDMKI,"Honestly, I bought this DVD solely to see Juan Villareal (I think I spelled it right). He doesn't have any specials so I've been looking for him within other productions. With that said, I didn't even look at the other comedian's sets. But it is very clear that this is a very low budget production. The a/v quality is not horrible but not great, and the the editing is just bad. However, Juan was hilarious as I expected so it was worth it. I'll update this again after I watch the whole thing and give it a complete review.",1367712000,,525,4.313131313131313
