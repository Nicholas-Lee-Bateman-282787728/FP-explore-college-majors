2583517,3,B000FS9FDK,"It is, as several other reviewers have noted, sad to see the end of Dark Shadows in its original incarnation, but I for one, bought Set 26 simply to be a ""completist.""  I never really enjoyed the final plotline set in 1841 parallel time, and I really consider this storyline to be the final nail in the coffin.  Yes, the writers were running out of ideas and one could argue the show ""jumped the shark"" several times before, but I think this is where the shark bit back.  Jonathan Frid said in interviews he welcomed a different character to play but he appears tired and listless, only Nancy Barrett and Lara Parker seem to enjoy the new characters. Joan Bennett is professional as always despite not having much to do.  Many of the special features have been available on single DVD's.  MPI really could be accused of a ripoff by selling at the same price as the sets with 40 eps.

I too look forward to the DVD release of the pre-Barnabas episodes.  I have them on VHS and the visual appearance (in stunning B&W) and more traditional soap opera dialogue are far superior to what now looks garish and grotesque in color as the series ended.  I don't know exactly what happened in terms of budgeting, but the older eps had actual outdoor location shots, car chases, and some surprisingly funny one-liners from characters who became so SERIOUS once the show went completely supernatural.  Roger is especially a hoot.  And the flubs and bloopers everyone enjoys watching in the color eps are few and far between in the old shows too.  I hate to sound disenchanted but it seems like the cast and crew got sloppy as the show went on.

Still an important part of TV history and it is cool to say one owns every episode.",1172448000,28,1715,4.514563106796117
2583518,4,B000FS9FDK,"Like most reviewers here, I used to watch this show after school in the 60's. I'd run home from school to get to see it twice in the afternoon, once at 3:30 on a Chattanooga station and then at 4:00 pm on my Atlanta channel.  Even as a primary school student, the combination of vampires, witches and werewolves didn't scare me one bit.  I was fascinated!  And just as an aside, the question asked of the boys of my generation was always, ""Ginger or Mary Ann?""  Incomplete.  It should have been ""Ginger, Mary Ann or Angelique?""  Angelique wins hands down!!  Even at 6 years old I knew she was The Bomb!!

This DVD set still has the actors playing many different roles, some of which had no bearing on their earlier ones.  It doesn't matter, the show was wonderful and was one of the most fun of any I watched during those years.

I actually rediscovered the series again in 1997 on Sci Fi and taped it religiously to watch after work.  I remembered most of the story lines and enjoyed it once again.

Series purists will love this collection and wish there had been more.",1169078400,42,1071,4.408163265306122

2583520,5,B000FS9FDK,It's a wonderful opportunity to see again a very interesting and old TV serie and DVD system gives the chance to the dark shadows fans.

2583521,3,B000FS9FDK,"I and my daughter have watched the whole series, which I watched in fits and starts as a kid.  The show really was all nicely wrapped up when Barnabas, Julia and Professor Stokes came back from the past as part of the 25th box set.  They had fixed everything, explained away everything and the episode had a really satisfying feel to it.  I've never seen a more perfect place for a beloved series to end and yet, they kept going to the Brutus Collins story line which was seriously bad.  To bring in a new character, Morgan, at this point in the series seemed weird, it having been pretty much an ensemble show for the whole run until that point.  And, he was not a good actor.  Of course it's hindsight, but every character they brought in for a brief stint was pretty bad.  Additionally, Mr. Frid was a great Barnabas and should not have played another character, Bramwell, though I'm sure he was tired of being a vampire.  Of course, if you've watched all 25 box sets, you have to get the final one, but it had the definite feel of something good that went on a little too long.",1167868800,11,1081,4.343283582089552

2583523,5,B000FS9FDK,"Yes, Set No. 25 is the final set of the series - that is, starting with the arrival in the first set of Barnabas Collins - but don't forget that that Barnabas arrived in Episode 207, so there are the 206 before that.  MPI has confirmed that they will follow the initial 26 sets (just as they did with the VHS series).  So sfter No. 26, we can look forward to another five sets of the pre-Barnabas ... some great stuff.

For now, the end of the series brings an end to the cursed room, and the (latest) curse on the Collins Family.  Or does it?  When Thayer David tells us in the series' final closing monologue that a girl is found in the driveway, with two puncture marks on her neck...it's just from an animal bite.  Right?  Isn't it? . . .

No?",1155427200,27,747,4.138888888888889
2583524,5,B000FS9FDK,Yes - this is probally either the second to last or the last 40 episodes - which will have several events such as some one crossing over into the parallel time room just he dies - leaving the others to wonder why. The Collins couple will get trapped into the room and survive the night and end the curse and the show will return to the present time where Julia and Barnabus will attend David's graduation and a statement that dark shadows never set down on Collinwood again,1152662400,2,473,4.386363636363637

2583540,5,B000FS9FDK,"Along the stormy seashore of Collinsport, Maine, a tale unfolds:

""Full fathom five thy father lies,
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes,
Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.""

-Shakespeare, ""The Tempest."" Ariel's Song, Act I.2.

You sailed the tempestuous seas to the far shore of this spectacular saga! Now, you can begin again, entering the gothic theater of ""Dark Shadows,"" where many a seaweed dredged, spooky sea-change lurks.

Coping with a long, painful battle with a disabling spine disease, I faced years of pain, with faint hope of recovery (and no support from family or friends). I've noticed that many ""Dark Shadows"" fans discovered the show whilst dealing with long illnesses, or recovery from accidents. The entire series, an immense achievement, provides many a creative soul, and/or those isolated by health issues, so much reprieve or distraction from pain. And a leap into a rich, imaginative world.

A Gothic Danse Macabre lurks around the edges, rattling leaves and ravens welcome: ""Dark Shadows"" will transport you into a land of perpetual Halloween. In this ""Collection 26,"" Jonathan Frid is marvelous in his last incarnation, warmly human, where he doesn't need to be bitey to make his Catherine swoon (the remarkable Lara Parker/moonlit witch Angelique). The last episode is sheer perfection. Never have I witnessed such a loving and humorous closure to a superb series. No wonder there is something special, quirky in a fun way, with fans of this unique show. I've lived in haunted places and spaces, and look forward to drawing the curtains and starting the whole thing over again, with the ""Beginning"" series and plenty of clam chowder and crackers.

In the words of the dread-filled narrator in Richard Lortz's obscure decay-ridden gothic novel, ""I've married a vampire's daughter - she's got her father in the trunk!""

2583541,3,B000FS9FDK,"The 1840 parallel time story continues in this set, as the Collins family searches for clues to the curse that's been placed on them and hopefully end it for all time. There's also the Wuthering Heights inspired storyline involving Bramwell (Jonathin Frid) and Catherine (Lara Parker) and her sister Daphne (Kate Jackson). What a snooze-fest that is, plus everyone else is just so busy acting bored or overacting period. As much as I've enjoyed watching this series over again, I have to say I am very glad the plug was pulled on this. The stories had all been told and retread one too many times and it was time to move on. I'm very glad I obtained this from the library and not made a purchase of it, and admit to fast forwarding through quite a bit.

The series itself is over with the first two DVD's, the other two have lots of bonus material for the die-hard fans. There were clips from a couple of the DS conventions, some best of scenes, and more like that, although I think I'd have enjoyed them more if I had some time between watching the entire series. I did get a kick out of the movie trailers section, which are trailers from older movies where DS stars had acted in. Oh my, those were some seriously ""B"" movies there :)

I'm glad I went down memory lane with these, but I'm also glad it is over and I can move on to something else. Like books.",1329523200,,1359,4.346456692913386

2583548,5,B000FS9FDK,"I LOVED this story! With a couple of exceptions the actors are GREAT and obviously happy to be doing something different and not another retread plot. (Such as Gerard's ghost) 3 drawbacks of this story--Miss Bennett is under-used and Grayson Hall is shoved down our throats as a lead (yet again) but I suppose if one's husband is a writer one gets used a bit more than one normally would.  Another HUGE mistake was allowing John Karlen to have such a large role, as in the previous story, and his downright TERRIBLE hamfest as ""Kendrick Young'. He is simply skin-crawlingly sleazy and more over the top than William Shatner at his worst. The 3rd is, while the talented Frid gets to play something besides a vampire, the character of 'Bramwell' is SO arrogant and obnoxious it is impossible to believe the writers intended him to be the ""hero"" instead of the idiotic,self-righteous,fool he turns out to be. It is implied that he rapes ""Catherine"" after he kidnaps her and she is STILL in love with him?!?!?  ""Morgan"" may have been spoiled and egotistical but I rooted for him because he is taken advantage of by a schemeing, greedy woman who only wants his money and name, who gets preganant by another man, who tortures him by playing him for a fool and, with the help of ""Bramwell"" and a ghost, finally loses his mind. I felt sorry for ""Morgan"" and for poor ""Daphne"" for being cruelly used and abused and by the ones they loved and married. ""Bramwell's"" treatment of ""Daphne"" is unforgivable, as was ""Catherine's"" treatment of her own sister. And in the end we are supposed to be happy that ""Bramwell"" and ""Catherine"" are together?!? They deserved to be together alright--in the 42nd level of hell! Then we have the ending narration that informs us that ""Flora"" gives ""Bramwell"" control of the family business--yeah right! Let's see ""Bramwell"" and ""Catherine"" are responsible for ruining her family and killing her son. I'm SURE she'd just leave ""Quentin"" with nothing and give everything to him.

 I have never been one to wax maudlin about celebrities. But these personages became so special as you learn how they really weren't actors, but performers, doing live stage in front of cameras. You feel as though you got to know every single one and sometimes could even guess what quip or sarcasm they may thru at each other at certain points and I even thought it would be funny to maybe watch again and have a sherry with the character at the same point they did which probably would have left me inebriated daily depending on how many episodes I watched.
 I gave this DVD set 1 star because as many have mentioned, the show could have been wrapped up after they returned to the proper time having set straight the problems with Gerard Style and the happenings with Quentin.  I didn't much care for the Loony room time-line. I didn't think it was needed.

 I thought it would have been nice for Curtis to allow the cast to say a few words to us the viewers summing up their feelings on the end of the show, when Joan Bennett and Grayson Hall and Thayer David were still with us. A lot of tv shows do that today when they end their run and have the whole gang saying farewell at the end of the final episode.
  I would have really dug the opportunity to just stand up and clap for them all as a group, a tear in my eye no doubt.
  I went to some conventions but it wasn't the same, it wasn't personal enough as sitting in my living room yelling Encore as the final credits rolled.

2583554,4,B000FS9FDK,"Dark Shadows volume 25 winds up the 1840 Judah Zachary plot with lightning speed, and brings to an astonishing and unexpected - and tragic or bittersweet, depending on your point of view - conclusion one of the most long-lasting relationships in the series.  Barnabas, Julia and Professor Stokes return to the 20th century to learn that their journey to the past has been a success: All at Collinwood are safe and well, and it is on this happy note that we say goodbye to the Collins family we have known for so long.

With scarcely time to catch our breath, we move on to 1841 Parallel Time.

Apparently I'm one of only a few Dark Shadows fans who enjoy the 1841 Parallel Time story.  Although it was disappointing not to have a familiar guide to this new situation (as Vicki was in 1795, or Barnabas and Julia in 1897), the new characters played by the Dark Shadows troupe and their various problems (a curse! the lottery! no vampires or werewolves!) quickly became interesting to me.

How much younger Jonathan Frid looks, despite Bramwell Collins's dour and brooding demeanor (hello, Heathcliff!).  How nice it is to see Lara Parker playing a character who doesn't resort to magic every minute to bend people to her will (she has her feminine wiles instead).  How interesting to see how things might have ended up for Barnabas and Josette. How much more explicit (compared to the 1960's episodes) the plot can be in 1971 - without vampirism as a metaphor for sex, we have actual sex.  Oh, all right - it's in the code of TV writing and directing of the time, but it's something.  Does anybody remember the late episode of Star Trek, where Captain Kirk is sitting on the bed pulling his boots on while the lady stands at a mirror and combs her hair?  There is an unexpectedly hot scene like that in Dark Shadows volume 25.

While one of the new characters is a prig and an annoyance, he is necessary for the story to play out.  In some ways Morgan Collins, played by Keith Prentice, has to carry the burden of the stuffy guy normally played by Louis Edmonds, only with dueling pistols.  Kate Jackson's Daphne in this plotline is a nice change from all the governesses and quite a bit different from the Daphne who was at the mercy of Gerard and Samantha in the 1840 non-parallel time plot.  She has some toughness and grit, and one ends up having real sympathy for her situation.

Overall, I give volume 25 (and volume 26 with the concluding episodes) high marks.  Keep an open mind and enjoy these episodes for what they are - a new direction for a well-loved troupe of actors.",1251072000,20,2581,4.554112554112554
2583555,4,B000FS9FDK,I gave my wife the whole collection of Dark Shadows when the Sci-fi channel discontinued it on cable.  Since she had the collection she watched it 3 times already.  The last time I watched it with her.  We were in grade school when it was originally aired on TV.  She would go home to watch it.  And still today enjoys it very much.  I never watched it until recently.  It kept my attention through all of the DVD's.  A lot of the time I was looking for the bloopers which came at a regular pace. If you want something entertaining this will satisfy you.,1246579200,2,554,4.259615384615385
2583556,5,B000FS9FDK,"Sadly the series end left the cast back in the 1860's which is pretty much the only plot thread resolved. The DVD does have some bonus features where the writers surmise how some of the characters might have ended up in 1970.

In a way the final episodes do deal with the later day characters as the storyline is about the locked room and the family curse. Several bonus features flush out the set on disc 4. The promo clips from various television shows with Jonathan Frid were a nice feature. Dark Shadows had something rare, a nearly flawless cast that jelled together perfectly. That led to a series that rose over any script imperfections or technical errors and might help to explain why the show is still popular today.",1178928000,23,726,4.584615384615384
