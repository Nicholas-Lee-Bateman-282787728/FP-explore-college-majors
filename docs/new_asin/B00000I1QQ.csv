1219005,4,B00000I1QQ,"There is something to be said for using animation to depict tragic events. It shields one from the full horrors of past events, without lessening the level of empathy and compassion for the characters. It makes it a little easier to watch. Barefoot Gen is a well done animation addressing the before and aftermath of the Atomic bomb.

I will never ever believe that dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was right. After learning about the atrocities and people hurt/killed...Truman and those who flew the Enola Gay have a lot of blood on their hands. I say this as a human being.

Good film. Strangely optimistic and upbeat.

Barefoot Gen II is just as interesting and lively to watch as the first. Although it was produced 3 years later, the second movie is really good too and picks up on Gen, his mother, and Ryuta as they struggle to survive. This film is just as optimistic and feel-good as the first, despite difficult tragedies that occur.

Gen continues to live strong like the wheat.",1345334400,,1006,4.698863636363637
1219006,5,B00000I1QQ,"Barefoot Gen may be a rather low-budget anime, but it makes up for that with punch, and then some. This is a horrifying account on the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, seen through the eyes of a young boy (being the author who penned the manga on which the movie is based).

True horrors unfold on the screen. When the bomb explodes, the devastation unfolds before our very eyes; people and animals melt, some not even to death. Young Gen was lucky to be shielded by a tree, thus saving him from the explosion and the radiation. Most of his family weren't so lucky.

What's most unsettling about the film is that we know more than the characters. We know what's going to happen to the city very soon, but they are all unaware. To them, war-time Japan has become routine, and Gen and his little brother Shinji act as boys do, their main concern being food and helping their heavily pregnant mother. War is taking its toll on everybody in terms of food and income, and this is what the characters deal with, even Gen's sister and father (who openly thinks the war is a big folly) but they always have each other to fall on.

Then, about one third of the way into the movie, Enola Gay arrives and blows the movie's universe to pieces. Gen and his mother go through things no one should have to go through. Barefoot Gen is a difficult movie that will shake you; a horrible reflection on the fact that the number one casualties of war are civilians, people just trying to live their lives. The second viewing is even tougher than the first, because by then, you know and care for the characters and worry about what will happen to them. None of them deserved what happened.

But Barefoot Gen isn't just interested in showing you what happened. It tries its best to raise your spirits. At the end of the day, life goes on, unfair though it can be, and you can overcome even the most colossal situations with a little spirit. That's wonderful.

The sequel is also here, which is not as shocking but more about the aftermath of the bombing, what growing up in post-bombing Hiroshima is like, a city populated by many children now without families, the streets thus being their only home. It's a good movie to close the story's arc. Overall, one of the most powerful war movies out there.",1316131200,6,2275,4.4855072463768115

Barefoot Gen (Mori Masaki, 1983)

Barefoot Gen is something more than a manga; Keiji Nakazawa's wildly popular ten-volume series (only the first four books of which, until very recently, have ever been available in English; volumes 9 and 10 are still not available in translated editions as I write this) is one of the definitive accounts of Hiroshima from a Japanese point of view. They are all the more so for treading the line between moralistic and preachy and, in the first four volumes at least, coming down on the right side of that line almost all the time. There have been a number of film adaptations of Gen, but Masaki's anime (the others have all been live-action films) seems to be the best-known of the bunch.

The plot: Gen (Cardcaptor Sakura's Issei Miyazaki) and his family live in Hiroshima. They're of the working-poor class (and in the manga are outcasts, because of Gen's father's anti-war stance; while passing reference is made to this in the anime, the extensive subplot surrounding the family's ostracism is almost entirely excised from the film), barely scraping by thanks to wartime hardship. We get a picture of their lives before the bomb, and then we get the bomb itself. While the film is presented in the kind of anime style one often sees in anime aimed at younger viewers, the scene of the bombing itself should probably be screened by parents beforehand to judge its appropriateness for younger children. This is brutal, if stylized, stuff, and Masaki doesn't shield his viewers. The remainder of the film deals with the beginning of Gen's post-bomb life, as he tries to make enough money to keep his family fed while dealing with the horrors that surround him constantly.

There are some abbreviations (as I mentioned above regarding the ostracism subplot) that give the thing a lighter (in substance, not in tone) feel than the manga upon which the film is based, but it's still an excellent introduction to a thriving subgenre of popular Japanese literature, as well as one of manga's most enduring, if unjustly overlooked, works. Certainly worth looking into. ***",1238371200,2,2217,4.857142857142857
1219008,5,B00000I1QQ,"Barefoot Gen: 9/10

A line from Apocalypse Now kept creeping into my head whilst I watched this - ""The horror, the horror...""

Barefoot Gen more than lived up to my expectations. I'd read before watching that it's very similar to Grave of the Fireflies, it being story about children trying to survive during World War 2, and they are indeed worthy of being spoken of in the same breath. There aren't many films, live-action or animated, that have the sort of impact these films do on viewers.

Barefoot Gen is a story told from the viewpoint of a child, the story being about the Hiroshima bombing. Instead of rushing into the bombing, time was spent showing the viewer Gen's (Gen is the main character) family and how they struggled to survive with little to no food. Gen spent a lot time with his younger brother during the early section, trying to find food for their pregnant mother and, basically, acting like kids do. This early pre-bombing section was good because it allowed viewers to become emotionally attached to the family and made them want the familty to survive.

And then, suddenly, the atomic bomb hits and, in graphic detail, you see people falling apart and getting burnt alive. Eye sockets fall out, skin melts...it wasn't easy to watch. Gen then rushed back to home to find his father, brother and sister all stuck under their house, which had collapsed due to the blast. After Gen and his mother couldn't lift what their family was stuck under, Gen had to pull his mother away from their family in order to save themselves due to the fire spreading, but Gen first made a teary-eyed promise with his father - his father made him make a non-verbal promise that he'd protect his mother and the child growing inside her.

It continued like that until the end. It was realistic to the point of being painful to watch. Animation or not, it was hard not to see what was happening as real. Barefoot Gen was based on the real life story of the author, so it'd be wrong to view as ""just a silly cartoon"" because of the lack of real actors, but it's rare for animation to have that sort of impact on me.

There were a few things I wasn't impressed with, such as the semi-annoying voice actor of Gen, how easily Gen's brother was allowed to be replaced by someone who looked like him and how well Gen and his mother handled losing their loved ones, but the good outweighed the bad. It was a wonderful film, and I highly recommend it to anyone with interest in the more realistic side of anime.

Barefoot Gen 2: 7.5/10

Barefoot Gen 2 continues the story 3 years after the end of the first film. Japan has started to return to normal but there are still problems like starvation and people being homeless. The bombing resulted in a lot of kids having their entire families killed and that obviously meant there were a lot of kids living on the street, unable to even get education because people need to pay to go to school in Japan. The story in this film focuses on a group of kids Gen befriends and shows how, even after the bombings had stopped, Japan was still far from repaired.

In all honesty, there didn't need to be a sequel made. The first film covered everything important and only the left the aftermath, which was never going to be as powerful as what came before, to be shown. The film had potential but a lot of the potentially interesting aspects, such as how people with burns from the atomic bomb were treated like monsters, were never looked into too deeply. Although I didn't feel the film was bad, I felt it wasn't made with the same amount of effort as the first and, quite simply, the story was weaker due to it not having to cover anything as horrific as what was shown in the first film.

A decent sequel, and a very nice DVD extra (both Barefoot films are on the same disc), but not worthy of a high rating.",1234051200,3,3845,4.472182596291013
1219009,3,B00000I1QQ,"Barefoot Gen is at the same time a compelling visual of the horrors of war and a cheesy soap opera; a devastating tale of courage and survival and a badly written one dimensional flick. Gen can be seen as the polar opposite of the epic masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006HAWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, for although they deal with similar subjects the way they go about doing it are completely different in both style and quality. Where Fireflies focuses on the small picture, one brother trying to care for his litter sister, Gen is bent upon showing the ""big picture"" of the war, the devastation that it brought upon the whole country. The difference is that in Gen, to get the desired emotional response they had to kill over 200,000 people, and when the mass deaths stopped so did the films quality; in Graves they only had to kill one, and that one death was more meaningful and more heartbreaking then all the millions of deaths in Barefoot Gen.

Gen is an energetic ten years old boy, living with his pregnant mother, his pacifist father, his overbearing older sister (about fourteen) and his loyal disciple, Shinji, whose maybe six years old. The war with America hasn't yet reached them in Hiroshima; they have food shortages, and every now and then they are rudely awakened by air raid sirens, but other than these inconveniences they are able to live their lives without the threat of being killed on a daily basis.  But their mother is getting sicker, and baby in her womb is in danger of dying. Gen and Shinji take it upon themselves to find good, healthy food for her to eat. The movie is a feel good, heartwarming story about family trying its best to live their lives while their country falls apart around them.

That all changes, however, on August 6, 1945. On that fateful day Gen is on his way to school when he glances into the sky and sees a lonely B-29, the sun reflecting off its wings, flying overhead. A young girl beside him comments on how strange it is to see an American bomber all alone. Gen drops a pebble and bends down to pick it up; a moment later the sky turns white, a thunderous boom splits the air, and Gen looks on in horror as the girl who, seconds before, stood beside him took the full force of the atomic blast, her eyes melting out of their sockets, her skin instantly turning charcoal grey, skin peeling off her arms and legs. The visuals of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima is almost enough to make me a pacifist, its devastation so real and unquestionably brutal that only a heartless monster could watch it and not think about how evil war is. It's all too much for anyone with a weak stomach; a small girl instantly turning into a skeletal; a baby suckling on the breasts of its already dead mother; a young boy trapped beneath the weight of his own home, screaming, pleading, for his mother to save him before the atomic fires burn him to death. A dead infant in its mothers arms; zombiefied children, transformed by the radioactive fire, shambling about in the ruble, their eyes and skin melted away, seeking out the relief of water and drowning to death once they find it. Gen survives by sheer luck, but his family isn't so fortunate. The death and sorrow of these twenty minutes of film are almost unsurpassed in film, anime or otherwise.

Unfortunately once the initial shock of the bomb subsides the weaknesses of the film return in full force, driving the memory of those twenty minutes away and forcing the viewer to suffer though another hour of bad writing, bad acting, and an overall bad war commentary. No attempt is made to make Gen into a rich, three dimensional character; he serves as a plot tool only, the eyes though which we are shown the devastation of the war, but little more. The film takes the most illogical plot turns, and the characters act and speak in ways that will make most people scratch their heads in confusion. When the filmmakers realize this, they kill someone else off, but this time the emotional impact is more like a cheesy soap opera then anything else.

Barefoot Gen is simply the cartoony version of Grave of the Fireflies. It is in every way Graves's inferior, in animation, music, character development and plot, it fails in every way to match the creative guineas of Ghiblis classic film. Those who have never see Graves might find this a breath of fresh air, but to those who have Gen will be nothing more than a cheap imitation, void of the same life and warmth which resonated so well with Graves. If not for the twenty minutes of death and suffering, this film would be nothing more than a bad war movie.

Film one; 3/5.
Film 2; 2/5.
Overall; 2.5/5. Rounded to three.

When I first heard about this movie's existence (in the mid-1990s) it seemed so difficult to understand why and how this movie was created.  When finally got my hand on a copy of the film and read the few volumes of the comic it was based on, it seriously causes to reconsider any preconceptions you have about war, be you victor or vanquished.

Barefoot Gen set is a collection of the two films released in 1983 and 1986 adapted from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/eponymous-comic-series/dp/0867196025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">eponymous comic series</a>&nbsp;created by Keiji Nakazawa. Loosely based on the life of author before and after the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, the films are further dramatized and abridged to first five volumes of the ten volume series.  Like most recollections of the nuclear bombing, Barefoot Gen starts depicting life before the bombing as any child coming to terms with war and generally frustrated with it by way of the harsh interruptions on normal life like the severe rationing, air raid warnings, compounded by the poverty that Gen and his family lives.  After the bomb drops, Gen and his pregnant mother are the only members of his family to survive but are treated as pariahs.  The general populace, unsure what to make of survivors who are suffering from traumatic injuries and radiation poisoning, make survival even worse until Gen, his mother, and ""adopted"" orphan who looks surprisingly like his dead little brother, take the  initiative to survive on their own by accepting odd jobs and working in black market.

Its shocking in so many ways. If you are the kind of person that cried when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bambi-s-mother-died/dp/B0002YLCOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bambi's mother died</a>&nbsp;or when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simba-s-father/dp/B00PE4EEE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simba's father</a>&nbsp;went to the great savannah in the sky, this film is NOT for you, and yet like Saving Private Ryan, you don't want to look away.  For those completely oblivious to Japanese Animation AKA Anime, the film industry uses for variety of genres that go far beyond the American limits that largely relegate it as something for children.  The bombing sequence is tough to watch - classic 80's anime character design women, children, and animals are obliterated in painstaking detail and if they aren't, they are horrendously maimed for the reminder of the movie.  If that is not bad enough, the discrimination Gen's family face afterwards is just borders on disgust and rage for indifference a populace can display.

Once you get beyond its initial shock, it's an inspiring movie of sorts. Gen, taking to heart his father's advice to grow like wheat, doesn't succumb to the incredible incapacitating grief that befalls other characters and does persevere in the years after the bomb and yet before Hiroshima begins shows actual healing (I don't think that happened until the 1960s).  For those interested about Japanese perceptions about the August 1945 bombing, I would strongly encourage you to be buy Keiji Nakazawa's ""Barefoot Gen"" comic series because a movie is almost never as good as the book - its not book really, its an ten volume manga (comic) series.",1439942400,5,3674,5.857677902621723
