6114376,5,B00GU8HIMY,"Tyson is raw, honest, and at times alarming. This DVD is not for everyone. This is Mike Tyson, after all. Much of the material ain't pretty...as Mike would say. But, know this if you consider buying it. I loved the honesty.",1394582400,,223,4.463414634146342
6114377,2,B00GU8HIMY,"Despite some of the sideshow antics surrounding him, Mike Tyson's life has been very serious. His pre-boxing tale is one of a broken home, a violent youth, multiple incarcerations, and the loss of his mother and his mentor. His professional career was a success because he was the best violent man in a room full of violent men, and it was tainted by alleged nefarious actions by boxing promoter Don King. During that time, Tyson's personal life was plagued by a horrendous celebrity marriage to actress Robin Givens, in-the-ring controversy, out-of-the-ring violence, and a rape conviction with subsequent jail time. His post-boxing life includes the accidental death of one his children.

Mike Tyson's life has been very serious. Yet the boxer-turned-celebrity, working from a script written by his current wife Kiki, avoids the opportunity to bare his soul and instead turns Undisputed Truth into Inconceivable Stand-Up.

Have no illusions. This is not a case of a man making light of his past because he's learned to laugh in the face of adversity and face new challenges with a smile. This is schtick. Consider this gem of a line: ""The juvenile detention center was like Cheers: there everybody knew my name.""

[ crickets ]

Director Spike Lee stops short of adding rim shots to punchlines but something about the audience's reactions throughout the show smells funny. There is laughter where it should not be. I don't know if there is a laugh track, or if audience members were directed to laugh loud, or if audio levels were strategically manipulated. But something about much of the laughter rings false. And I don't think it's me. I've seen enough comedy in my life to understand what is meant to be funny even when it isn't funny to me. I understand that humor is as subjective as you can get. This isn't that.

Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth is a difficult watch, a statement that goes beyond the schtick. Tyson, who by the time this was filmed had been through his material countless times, lacks any sense of storytelling timing or cadence. He hits marks and says lines the way someone who can't waltz makes his own matter worse because he's so busy counting 1-2-3, 1-2-3 in his headhe abandons any and all sense of natural action.

There were interesting facts to be learned about Tyson and his life, but they whizzed by so quickly in an effort to get to the next joke or the next fact that there was no chance for Tyson to seems reflective or for the viewer to digest them.

Tyson also gets winded very easily. I mention this not as a criticism of his physical condition (let's just say I'm no role model), but rather because he is speaking to an audience. After he physically exerts himself (mimicking old boxing moves, for example), he is trying to continue his story through panting breath, which makes him that much more difficult to understand.

I lay as much of this at Spike Lee's feet as I do Tyson's. A director is responsible for controlling the actions of his performers. Here, Lee just lets Tyson ramble to whatever words Kiki has put on paper. This includes an incomprehensible 13-minute stretch focused on a story about Mitch Green, a boxer who Tyson defeated in the ring and also had a physical altercation with in the streets. Thirteen minutes! Mitch Green, who is, at best, a footnote in Tyson's history, gets more story time15% of the entire show, by the waythan any other part of Tyson's life. It is stupefying and frustrating and ultimately disappointing.

The 1.78:1 anamorphic presentation is perfectly clear, although there is very little to spotlight with a one-man stage show. It captures the lighting well and when the camera cuts to audience members, their shadowy images are clear as well. The mix of Tyson and the crowd heard through the Dolby 5.1 is balanced nicely, and the film's soundtrack, which features songs from artists ranging from Nat King Cole to RUN-DMC, sounds good.

In addition to the digital copy, there is only one extra, a featurette titled ""Conversations."" This is nothing more than HBO's 2-1/2 minute promo, where ""conversations"" are actually ""soundbites"" from Tyson, Lee, and others involved in the project.

6114378,4,B00GU8HIMY,"I am an unabashed fan of Iron Mike.  The fighter.  I am now a fan of Mike, the man. I continue to watch the fights and the many documentaries on him.  I came to this work knowing some stuff.  Not much was new but it was so rewarding and in a lot of places fun to watch Mike talk about what would be terribly painful and sometimes embarrassing experiences.  I came away thinking, I love it.  The vulnerability that so much of society is lacking.  Everyone so afraid of being hurt that they live a life unknown or unknowable.  Not so for Mike.  Mike lays it out there.  I read his book so I don't wonder what he's not telling us.  He's telling us who he is and who he was, all the while admitting that back then he didn't even know.  There is no shame in it.  When we are young, most of us don't know who we are, we know what we do.  Who we are is the question that living life will hopefully answer.

I would encourage the reading of Mike's memoir.  I defy you to put it down once you've picked it up.  Mike is a rather masterful storyteller.  I am rooting for him to conquer as he once did in the ring.",1392163200,7,1102,4.0
6114379,5,B00GU8HIMY,Saw it on HBO very emotional and touching story he set his record straight  go Mike much love. He got down to the roots of his life with the truth.,1386806400,4,147,3.9
6114380,5,B00GU8HIMY,"Not being a boxing fan at all, I watched Undisputed Truth completely by accident and was taken in by the mix of humility and self-respect this man showed. Since most of my impressions of Mr. Tyson came from media reports, they were sketchy and sensation-filled. This film, however, presented an insightful view of a ""rags to riches"" and back again story in a way I've never seen done. The narrative style interspersed with photos and video clips made viewing easy and enjoyable. But more than that, Mr. Tyson's open honesty - clearly accepting responsibility for many of his mistakes, while often forgiving others for theirs - gave me a different view of the man than what I'd expected.
It also showed a man, who faltered several times in life but got up and continued on anyway - a valuable lesson for many.

Someone mentioned that it is a picture of a reasonably good man with flaws - I think that is true - and the fact that he is willing to show that openly in the film is what makes it remarkable.
I didn't read the book, but congratulations to all who made the film possible.",1386374400,23,1081,4.51530612244898
6114381,5,B00GU8HIMY,"Love him or hate him, Mike Tyson will always be a controversial figure within the realm of boxing. He will also always be the guy who was, ""Knocking mother-f'ers out in 8 seconds!""

Undisputed Truth is a raw, in-depth, heartbreaking examination of a man who has come to grips with his inner demons and beat them down like so many other opponents. Tyson holds nothing back in this one man show. He mixes his wicked humor with picture perfect direction by Spike Lee to create a masterpiece that should go down as the definitive story of his life (up to this point).

Undisputed Truth is as much for the public as it is for Tyson himself. This film does an amazing job of closing the book on his storied past. One gets the impression that the ""new"" Mike Tyson just wants to move on with his life and begin anew, writing the next chapter of his existence without the evil influences of his past. Tyson is not running from who he was, he is embracing it, unapologetically. He knows that we all grow as people in this life and that who we were does not define who we can be.

Tyson is still a champion.",1386028800,11,1096,4.336585365853659

I think that the way that Mike did it was brilliant. I can see why Spike Lee pick it up and added the ""extra"" to it.  It was also nice to see Mike Tyson maturity and growth. I can say that i was pleasantly surprised and entertained at the same time. Mike Tyson shared his story in a witty way. Kudos to his wife for writing it. Congratulations to Mike Tyson taking his power back and having the courage to share his journey. I have even recommended the movie to others to watch.",1459555200,,634,4.188524590163935

6114399,5,B00GU8HIMY,"The story of Mike Tyson is definitely one of my personal favourite ones EVER. I have seen many documentaries of Mike Tyson and I have looked into other areas of his life. I am not into boxing or any sports of that kind. But Mike's life story is really something incredibly inspiring. There are tons of stories of this kind, where a poor man, against all adds hits the top, and makes it. But Mike Tyson in many aspects stands alone, strong and super-cool. In ICON-athlete category to me he is with Bruce Lee, Maradona and Pel, and totally belongs to the world ... From a ""human"" perspective, his highs and lows are truly unbelievable - SUPER-HUMAN. Mike is still going and seem to be in a great place in his life, fairly sane, still very strong and with great sense of humour.

Over-all, the ""movie"" is incredible. It is a testament of Mike's state of mind at the moment, and his place in his life at the moment. It's Mike Tyson telling his own life story, in his own words, on the stage right in front of the audience. It's semi-scripted stand-up, based on the book of his own biography with title of ""Undisputed Truth"". It was all done and filmed in smaller venue. I'd call this very up-close and personal. It shows Mike Tyson in very accessible light. He appears to be happy and fairly stable. In this movie his personality is HUGE. He is very entertaining to listen to and really seem like fun guy to be around with. It's almost shocking how strong and big personality comes from boxer. In theory most successful ""athletes"" are ponies of some-body else's ideas, support and money. The story of Mike Tyson definitely has elements of that, but it does NOT define him at all. His life's journey took him in million directions, to all time highs to 100 feet below ground and he comes back up every-time ...

I am really NOT Spike Lee fan and because of that, I resisted this DVD for a long time. I don't see any ""typical"" Spike Lee in this - it's PURE dose of Mike. Great, great, great experience - Long Live Mike!!!",1456876800,,2015,4.428571428571429

6114411,5,B00GU8HIMY,Mike Tysons life has been talked about by many people who have banked off of his bad choices. It's about time that you hear the truth from the man himself that is still writing his story. For him to still be relevant still says a lot that he has a fighters heart to not give up on life.

6114466,2,B00GU8HIMY,"In short - I found this film to be dull and pretentious. I am not a Spike Lee fan in particular, and it did not go unnoticed that his named was mentioned a dozen times. I am aware that Mr. Tyson is no thespian. However I felt as though Mike's demeanor was cantankerous, his lines were forced and over-rehearsed, and his presentation awkward. Anyone who knows anything about this man knows he is a product of the streets but I felt like that fact was being rammed down my throat for the first half of the program. The adulation and repeated ovations for Cus D'Amato were puzzling as Mike was not flattering to him at all. The guy who yelled ""We love you Cus!"" may have been referring to someone else. I have enjoyed some really excellent candid interviews with Tyson that did a much better job a reveal what sort of fellow he really is. This could have been a lot better IMHO. The cheesy sound effects, props, and atmospherics were a hindrance. I think the big screen behind Mike was a nice touch, and the concept a good one - but I think it missed the mark by a long shot.",1411430400,3,1072,4.285714285714286

6114471,3,B00GU8HIMY,"Mike Tyson has been a celebrity unlike any other when it comes to the world of boxing. Certainly the most famous boxer in history has been Mohammed Ali. His life had its share of ups and downs but not near as many downs as that of Tyson. Unfortunately most of those down times were brought on by Tyson himself, his attitudes and the demons that ate at him while he was on top and as he slid down.

MIKE TYSON: UNDISPUTED TRUTH is a captured performance of Tyson's one man live stage show. In it Tyson prowls the stage like the boxer he is offering stories of where he came from and what formed him into the person he is today. He came up in the hard streets of Brownsville, a tough kid who more than likely would have turned to a life of crime had it not been for someone who saw something in him. That someone was Cus D'Amato.

D'Amato was a manager and boxing trainer who saw in Tyson the makings of a champion. Taking in the young boxer in training he worked with him and eventually did get him to the hallowed halls of being the best boxer in the world. But there is a price to pay for achieving greatness at a young age and being told by everyone how wonderful you are. Tyson's slide into drug addiction is rivaled only by that of his addiction to celebrity, something that you gather still plagues him to this day.

Tyson discusses everything, laying it all on the table. He discusses his marriage to Robin Givens. He discusses his feud with Mitch Green. He talks about his trial for rape. He talks about Don King being someone who promised the world and took it all for himself. Through it all he talks about the one person he knows better than anyone, Mike Tyson.

His performance here is better than one would expect. He speaks intelligently and clearly, not at all influenced by any of the demons of his past. He displays quiet humor many times throughout the show. He talks openly about the mistakes he's made. And yet when all is said and done you have to wonder if he will learn from his many mistakes or simply repeat them once he gets back on his feet again.

Not only that but there are times in the show when he makes a joke at the wrong moment or at the expense of the reputation of someone else who isn't there to defend themselves. It's one thing to deny a rape charge, another to reply to that person face to face. Some of the jokes lend themselves to making you wonder just how sincere his denial is. But that's something that only the two people in the room will ever know the honest answer to.

In the end the DVD offers a good look at the man who is Mike Tyson. You might walk away thinking differently of him. For myself I found him to be a much more complicated person than I thought he was when I pushed play. He's still troubled, he still is seeking fame and he still has his demons to contend with. As the curtain falls and he ends the show I found myself wishing the best for him. All we can do is wait and see.",1409356800,,2942,4.207446808510638

laugh, but most of all it will lift your spirit. In this amazing athlete and one of the best boxers of all time, if not the best, is a
soft soul full of compassion and true love. Remember, God gives the toughest tests, to the toughest people. Mike Tyson, you are one of them. Thank you for the fast shipment and great pricing.",1403222400,2,447,4.149425287356322

6114476,5,B00GU8HIMY,I recommend everyone to watch this. Mike Tyson is able to keep you interested. He spoke about his life and even joked about himself.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well he captured my attention throughout in entire stand up. He has come a long way. A Must See.,1402358400,,264,4.387755102040816
6114477,5,B00GU8HIMY,I originally saw this on HBO but didn't get to really watch it. So I purchased and I laughed the entire show. Mike has evolved into a man everyone can be proud of and enjoy his story. He told a great story of pain and sorrow but put a comedy spin on it. Definitely is a must see because it changes your opinion you have of a man I must say we really didn't know.,1400544000,2,362,3.84

6114479,5,B00GU8HIMY,"The quotes the life story all of it was amazing this is a must watch even if you are not a fight fan it's hard hitting reality of rise from the gutter to the top then back down and up again. An experience you cannot google but it is amazing to hear it from someone who is ""AWARE"" of where he came from where he ended up and where he's going.

This one quote in the movie was AWESOME and I'm buying this right now.

Demons
So one day Im in Cus living room and Im reading a boxing encyclopedia, said Tyson in his routine. Great fighters like Sam Lackford, Harry Greib, Jack Britton, Ted The Kid Lewis, Willie Pep and the great, legendary Sugar Ray Robinson You add up all the fights, thats like 1500 fights. I gave up right there. I said, Cus, I could never be like them, I cant do this. Then he looked at me in the eye and said [doing an impression of DAmato], Mike, you gotta read the whole records We never hear any more about the guys that they knocked out Know why, Mike? Cause at one point someone knocked them out But these men you're reading about, these champs, they never quit. They never got discouraged, you know? And thats why these [other] guystheir demons will follow them forever, Mike. Cause they had a chance to face their demons and they didn't You have to face your demons, you hear me, Mike? Cause if you dont, theyll follow you into eternity. And you remember, Mike, be careful how you fight your fightscause the way you fight your fights, will be the way youll live your life. Then I never quit again.",1398211200,,1522,4.244827586206896

8627590,5,B00GU8HIMY,"Complete and total honesty, with self-deprecating humor, humility, and self-awareness.  This is an exposition of a man's life, full of tragedy and pain, not just Mike Tyson telling his side.  He gives his wisdom with a laugh, his enormous gap-toothed smile, and shares the lessons of pain and hardship, often of his own and admitted design.  Regardless your opinion of Tyson the man, his performance is utterly compelling as an act of reflection on awful events and mistakes, with a sober and positive self-reckoning.",1484784000,,517,5.130952380952381
