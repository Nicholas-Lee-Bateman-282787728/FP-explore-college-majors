8208510,5,B000TAX788,"Gary Null knows his stuff.  While there are extreme cases who may find psychotropic drugs effective, there are other paths of less toxic and dangerous nature for the vast majority of people.  Gary Null is big on changing diet and exercise.  I would also suggest NLP, hypnosis, and Time Empowerment/Time line therapy to release the inner issues and give direction and effectiveness to unconscious strategies of learning, listening, and behaving.  I also notice the parents of most kids with these problems have trouble with the negative formulation in their language.  Meaning, however loving and kind they may be, saying, ""What's wrong with you?"" over and over, or ""Don't be annoying."" or, ""Don't do that."" actually programs the unconscious mind to enhance those unwanted behaviors... why? because the unconscious mind cannot process negatives... so, ""Don't do that"" consciously means ""stop"" but the signal to the unconscious is, ""Do that"" so ""Don't get hurt"" says ""get hurt"" got it?  The alternative is to frame statements in positives, like ""Do your homework now, okay?"", ""Be careful"", ""Clean up your room now, okay?"" and the best thing to say allot and never qualify, ""I love you so much""  Also: and this is huge- statements go right through the mind... question inflection (a rising tone at the end of your question) and command inflection (a falling tone at the end of your command) have a dramatic effect.  Do it.  Instead of  ""Clean up your room now."" said flat, drop your voice on 'room' and more on 'now' you may have to practice so it will sound natural, you may have to raise the pitch of your voice in the beginning so you have somewhere to go down to.  Questions and commands get results, statements get frustration.  Beside kids, it works on all humans.  Enjoy your results.",1213401600,5,1788,4.900332225913621
