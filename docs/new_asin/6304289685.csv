832566,3,6304289685,"I pulled out my Bible while watching Samson & Delilah.  There were several inconsistencies and the order of some events were completely wrong.  Samson seemed very weak.  He was straining to lift things that he  shouldn't have had a problem with and even though they didn't show him  lifting the city gates, it would seem ironic that he could do that by  himself, but strain to lift up an average sized man.
I found this film a  bit dissappointing, especially after watching Joseph.  I began to collect  the entire Bible Collection set and Samson & Delilah was my  second.
If you are looking for a video to rely on completely to display  Bible truth, this is probably not the video for you.",942710400,37,689,4.565573770491803

832683,2,6304289685,"The greatest events from The Bible come to life in The Bible Stories, a series of full-length films presenting powerful and moving tales of faith and glory.

The tale of Samson and Delilah becomes a riveting narrative of betrayal and redemption in this lively adaptation. Chosen by God to defeat the Philistines, Samson (Eric Thal) is imbued with tremendous strength: but when he is charmed by the seductive Delilah (Elizabeth Hurley), the mighty Samson is brought to his knees. Only through divine forgiveness can he regain what he has lost in order to stand against the tyranny of the Philistines.

The Bible Stories: Samson and Delilah is the incredible Biblical story of the Old Testament strong-man Samson brought to life on film. A judge from the Biblical book of Judges, Samson was a very unique character, known for his rebellious nature and uncontrollable anger. In this story, a simple shepherd becomes well-known for his unbelievable strength and has several violent encounters that only help to further his name as the strongest man alive. While he may have seemed generally uncouth and completely useless for Gods will, God was still able to work incredible things through the bizarre life of this man.

As Samson grew up, he ended up meeting a Philistine woman by the name of Delilah. Succumbing to her beautiful looks and sultry personality, he ended up marrying her. After many attempts at finding out what gave Samson his supernatural power, he eventually revealed it to be his long hair that had never been cut. Quickly after telling her, Samson found himself tied up with Philistines cutting his hair. Delilah, a spy for the Philistines had uncovered his secret and had sent the Philistines in to finish him off. Rendered useless after having his hair cut, Samson becomes a prisoner to Philistines. A trophy to the Philistine army, Samson is taken and humbled. Here, he works his last and greatest deed, affirming his title as a judge of Israel.

Dennis Hopper, Michael Gambon, and Diana Rigg also star in this dynamic entry in the Bible Stories series of films.

This is pretty realistic stuff and pretty brutal making this film not recommended for children. The performances are all around solid. With the exception of two steamy scenes, it sticks to the story. The scenery and costumes are wonderful. There were several inconsistencies and the order of some events were completely wrong. Samson seemed very weak. It has three great lead actors and a famous director, but it is greatly weakened by too much fictionalized filling-in around what the Bible says about the story. The movie is based on the three chapters of the book Of Judges from Chapters 13 to 16.

I would not recommend this movie if you are looking for an accurate portrayal of the Samson and Delilah story based on the Bible. I think it is not really a family friendly movie depending on the age of your children.

832811,4,6304289685,"Samson and Delilah is a German/Italian/American TV movie that tells the story of a man chosen by God among the Israelites to destroy the Philistines. This 3-hour telemovie is based on the three chapters of the Book Of Judges from Chapters 13 to 16.

The telefilm starts with the story of Mara and Manoah,an upright Israelite coup who were blessed by God with a child after many years of prayer to the Lord. The were given a son and they called him Samson. He grows up as a shepherd but he possessed an unusual strength who could battle and kill the Philistines on his own. Then,he falls in love with a lovely Philistine woman named Delilah,who ultimately betrayed him. The film ended when Samson became a slave of the Philistines and was given by God an opportunity to redeem himself when he regained his strength and managed kill many Philistines which is more than he ever killed during his lifetime including Delilah. This led to the liberation of the Israelites.

The TV movie maybe three hours but it was definitely a good film about Samson and Delilah for multiple reasons. First,the acting was brilliant. Thal was commendable as Samson while Hurley was gorgeous and luscious as the courtesan Delilah. Their romance that consists of love,seduction,deception and betrayal was definitely interesting. The themes of faith in God was also looked upon especially on the parents of Samson who managed to have their prayers answered after years of difficulty of having a child. Other themes such as arrogance;the burden of having an unusual gift;being of service to God;learning humility and being forgiven by God will be learned from the character and life experiences of Samson. Despite the fact the writers added many things to the story of Samson like the addition of Naomi,it still provides us a great story about one of the great judges or heroes from the Bible.",1444780800,,1867,4.867924528301887

Like the jawbone killings, burning of the crops, the marriage scene, this movie added scenes that didn't belong just for drama. Also, slight sex scenes.",1375574400,,349,4.737704918032787

I also thought the male actor on the cover was appealing but in the movie, he wasn't as gorgeous as on the cover. Overall, it did have a sensual scene that I wasn't expecting, but at least you were able to see some parts of the movie which seemed more realistic and could clearly understand Samson's love for women--which also lured him to his death.

833131,4,6304289685,"Samson killed infinitely more Philistines with the jawbone and columns and carried their city gate miles, but I guess they just didn't have the budget to visualize it.  The acting is what's important and they succeed here.  Samson was a guy who just didn't fit in with the guys and became too much the ladies man.  Things would have gone so much better if he had only stayed with Israelite women.",1354492800,,396,4.549295774647887
833132,4,6304289685,"The casting is overall well done and it is exciting and gripping throughout-not a dull moment
Eric Thal plays a strong and passionate Samson who will be driven to destruction through lust and the drive for revenge. Elizabeth Hurley plays a deliciously scheming and cynical Delilah, Turkish actress Jale Arikan is probably the best actor in this as the fiery Hebrew girl who truly loves Samson. and the magnificent Diana Rigg skilfully plays Samson's mother Mara.

The dialogue is intelligent and perceptive. The main problem is that the place where this was filmed was Morocco, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, and this is clearly the Sahara and bears little resemblance to the Holy Land.  why was it not filmed in Israel?
Nonetheless the  the narrative was close to the Biblical account, and the filling in done creatively.
I enjoyed this movie until the end , and found it quite absorbing and inspiring.",1353196800,2,908,4.921568627450981

833136,3,6304289685,"I enjoyed this version of the Biblical tale, though as other reviewers noted, it is a shade too long and many of the performances are uneven at best. Overall, the writting is excellent, thoughtful, and enhances the Biblical narrative. Oddly, though, the writer(s) made a bold choice in this story by attempting to humanize Samson's Philistine opponents, giving them some depth as well as a touch of sympathy. No doubt this is a more honest approach than what is presented in the Bible, where the Philistines have only one role to play---that of evil enemy. However, painting Israel's hated enemy with a more realistic brush also creates unnecessary conflict for the viewer, leaving unanswered questions as to the motivations and actions of several main Philistine characters (who seem to be acting against their own interests to further the story). Rather than enhance the plot of Samson's struggle, this actually serves to weaken it in some ways.

Aside from an above average script (for television), the production itself is flawed in a variety of ways. Filmed in Morrocco, the locations have that unmistakable look of the Sahara that shares nothing in common with ancient Palestine. Frankly, the sets are ugly, drab, and colorless. The casting is also a mess, with a handful of very pale-looking British and American actors surrounded by Morrocan extras: why would some Israelites and Philistines be so pale and speak crisp English, while all of their compatriots look Arabic and speak with thick accents? This obvious discrepancy detracts from the story. The costumes are well done, but nearly everything else is visually dull and shabby.

Finally, having read other reviews before seeing this version, I had the impression that several scenes were just shy of soft-porn. Much has been said about the sex scenes between Samson and Delilah. It's all much-ado-about-nothing; there is zero nudity in this movie, and watching two actors lying in bed together, covered from the shoulders down, while kissing passionately does not a porno make.",1322956800,,2042,5.147590361445783
833137,3,6304289685,"Elizabeth Hurley made a realistic Delilah. Surely, the real Delilah was not chased by Samson because she was a paragon of chastity or a plain Jane.  Dennis Hopper plays a wise and seasoned Phillistine general, pure invention for the movie. Surely, the Philistines were not all bad, unlikeable people, so that makes sense. Having said that, the movie is way too long...3 whole hours. I am sure the point could have been made in 2 hours max. The sex scenes between Samson and Delilah are long and suggestive, surely causing discomfort with parents trying to watch with their young children.  They should know to watch first before showing the kids in any movie done after the 1980s and surely any movie starring Elizabeth Hurley amps up the sex a little bit. Is she doing this kind of stuff anymore, this Joan Collins successor, because she herself is getting up there in years?

One more question I have. Was there a Gaza in the old testament? The Philistine city is called Gaza in the movie. Wikipedia indicates that indeed, there was a Philistine Gaza. Who are the modern day descendants of said Philistines. Surely, they are one of the regions many monotheistic groups.",1310083200,4,1171,4.787128712871287

833140,1,6304289685,"Folks, if you want typical Hollywood sensuality, then buy this.  If you want Biblical message without sexuality, DON'T BUY THIS.  The level of the ""consummation moments"" where Samson is showed having sex with Delilah is WAY TOO detailed and down right animalistic.  Delilah is shown to picture (AND ENJOY) a great lion attacking her, in her mind, while Samson is (with music and sound to amplify the moment) over-top of her and reaching a climatic moment during their sexual intercourse.  The sexuality is overbearing for the screen, and takes the Biblical and spiritual moments completely away from the film.

For thousands of years the Biblical account of Samson has been around, and the Holy Scriptures themselves tell us about Samson's sinful sexual relationship with Delilah, and we ALL GOT THE POINT from the Bible.  We didn't need God to have inspired recordings of the detailed sexual moments in order for us to understand the tensions (or the lessons!) involved.  Hollywood is tattooed all over this one, and we recommend this movie go to the garbage can.  We cut our DVD in two and tossed it!  Oy!

HOWEVER, you can safely buy an older film, with more Biblical accuracy (way more ""honorable"" film) and enjoyment, that's called ""Samson and Delilah"" presented by Cecil B. DeMille, Paramount Pictures, 128 minutes, made in 1949.  Technicolor was done well!  Oddly, the DVD came from ""Zhi Sen Studio Inc"" in Taiwan...but you won't regret it!

First the good points: (1)casting was pretty good (2) I think they really got a great feel for Samson and his struggle/ burden of strength. Not so great parts: (1)there was a sex scene that could have been avoided in my opinion. I watch these movies with my children and didn't expect it. It's not raunchy or anything, but it is there. (2) They took alot of ""creative"" liberties in order to get the point across.

Liz Hurley, gorgeous and not given enough screen time in my opinion.  The acting was also very good.  But the script was boring.  And the only thing worse than boring, is boring and long.  They added characters and situations that did not exist in the Bible version, and which did not add anything interesting to the story.  And then they omitted situations that were in the Bible and were actually exciting. For example, when Samson burned the Philistines fields by tying flaming torches to the tails of foxes.........A potentially great scene, omitted.

Some of the characters they added were long-winded and again, boring.  They did focus a great deal on his internal struggle in dealing with the calling by God to free his people, all the way from even before his birth to the very end.  And many characters were looking to him to save Gods people.  So that was actually very spiritually thought provoking.  I guess I was looking more for the exciting scenes, heroic scenes, a little more Hollywood, shall we say, and a little less Sunday School.

833197,3,6304289685,"This movie is the story of Samson and Delilah. Samson was born to a barren couple of Israel and destined to help free his people from the hand of the Philistines who had overrun their country. But Samson had a weakness and this was women. He also had another, and this was his temper. The Philistines figured this out and used his weaknesses against him. First with his first wife and then again with Delilah.

The movie, for me, moved a bit slow. I felt they spent time on aspects that they didn't need to and this bogged the movie down. The acting was ok here. I felt the direction was lacking also. I expected this movie, even for a made for TV movie, to have a lot more life and spark and it just didn't. I was a bit disappointed.

I will say, and this came as a surprise, this movie had a young Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a young Samson and that was interesting to see.",1232582400,,871,4.178571428571429

With the exception of two steamy scenes, it sticks to the good book with some decent interpretations added to the dialogue. Overlong at three hours, the camera shots and scene changes, nevertheless, keep it visually appealing.  Some of the battle scenes are admirable indeed.  Eric Thall and Elizabeth Hurley star in the leading roles, and while they're not Emmy or Oscar contenders, Thall's performance gathers more substance near the end of the story.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of General Tariq isn't a career best, but he ups the quality of the acting, and Michael Gambon gives proper stature to King Hanon.

833279,4,6304289685,"TNT produced a wonderful series of Old Testament dramas. All are good but some are better than others. This one falls somewhere in the middle.

Samson is a child gifted with superhuman strength. He is an Israelite and his people are under the thumb of the Philistines. He is God's chosen instrument for deliverance.

He would seem a strange choice. He is not exactly a pious individual. He is fairly faithful to his vows but sees nothing wrong with having a good time. This is especially true when having a good time involves a beautiful girl of the Philistines. Over time, he lets the treacherous beauty in on his secret and the result is terrible. He is deprived of that which makes him great to begin with and winds ups as a blinded slave.

The redeeming quality of the story is God's ability to take an imperfect individual and use him for great purposes. Nobody is beyond the pale. That is the central message and it is well done.

On the minus side, there are some non scriptural elements. This is to be expected for a long production of a fairly short biblical story. In my mind, these do not detract from the centrality of the message. Some of the acting is a bit underwhelming but it is by no means bad. All in all, this is a good show.",1176768000,4,1245,4.4

833283,4,6304289685,"This film includes a lot of embelishment as well as fictional characters to fill out the story of Samson, taken from Judges Ch. 13 through 16, but the essence of the story is intact. A man who loved the God of his fathers, but also the women of his enemies, the Philistines, and finds his real strength only after he has lost everything.
Samson is portrayed as man who never cries, not even as a baby at his bris (circumcision), or his father's death, but the feelings of lust and revenge weave continually through his story, and there are many brutal scenes, making this film not recommended for children.

As Samson's mother Mara, Diana Rigg is superb; she is a ""type,"" like Sarah/Isaac, Rachel/Jacob, Hannah/Samuel, and Elisabeth/John the Baptist, all barren women who miraculously give birth to a son that becomes a leader/savior of his people.
Eric Thal is effective as Samson, very big and brawny, and he looks great on horseback. He also carries off the end parts too, which could easily have become cartoonish.
Michael Gambon is terrific as the wily old King Hamun of the Philistines, and in the most bizarre casting, Dennis Hopper as a laid back general. Elizabeth Hurley's Delilah is a cool, calculating vixen, and beautiful enough to make the most of Samson's weakness. Max Von Sydow does the narration throughout the film.

The Philistine interiors are very imaginitive, with their grotesque gods and massive columns, and the devastation of them well filmed. The fight with the lion is cleverly done also, with lots of grunts and roars from man and beast.
Filmed on location in Quarzazate, Morocco, it has a marvelous score by Marco Frisina, the excellent cinematography of Raffaele Mertes, and well paced direction by Nicolas Roeg.
""David,"" ""Solomon,"" ""Jeremiah,"" and ""Abraham"", are my favorites of these above average made for TV Bible stories, and this film, though not one of the best, is highly entertaining with some good acting. Total running time: 182 minutes.",1080864000,47,1980,4.942942942942943
833284,3,6304289685,"With a running time of 182 minutes, most people should be able to find this story in the Bible and read it in the time it would take to watch this film.  People who expect reading the Bible to be like going to church might have trouble figuring out Judges 15:20:  ""Samson was judge in Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years.""  In the movie, Samson is more like a modern action hero.  The big joke at the beginning of the movie is the weapons of the Hebrews, made of a lesser metal than the steel swords of the Philistines.
Dennis Hopper makes an interesting general for the Philistines and friend of Delilah.  Anyone who has known people like this will have no problem understanding Judges 16:13:  ""Then Delilah said to Samson, `Up to now you have been laughing at me and telling me lies.  Tell me what would be needed to bind you.' ""  The United States has been playing the Delilah part in that part of the world since the Samson stunt of the terrorists on September 11, 2001, and people who wonder mainly *whatever happened to Delilah, anyway?* might be interested in the final scenes of this movie, to see if she escapes from the building that Samson pulled down after he had been blinded and was exhibited in chains.

I found the story lagging (one tape would have sufficed) with many biblical inaccuracies including odd characters of no biblical origin.  Additionally, I thought Dennis Hopper was horribly miscast.  His dry way of speaking seemed too distracting.
Although Eric Thal protrays a pensive Samson, the war between Samson's lust and his passion for God was not at all believable.  His period of serving as a judge seemed more like a trist.  Admittedly, I enjoyed Elizabeth Hurley as Delilah (I think this is some of her best work anywhere).  In my opinion, you'd do best to pass on this video.",1032825600,11,638,4.91588785046729

The movie doesn't even show him taking the gate of gaza; but it sure does show the prostitutes in his life.  I said the movie slacks off on everything maybe I shouldn't have said that.  It doesn't seem to slack off much on his sex.  For crying out loud this is supposed to be Christian.  Oh and also it definitely isn't biblical the story is so messed up the only real similarity between it and the Bible is the names.

833287,4,6304289685,"This Italian production is not your usual Bible-epic.  With striking set design, beautiful art direction and oftentimes alarming attention to period detail, this is pretty realistic stuff.  And pretty brutal.  A lot of this can be attributed to British art-house director Nicolas Roeg, who has made ""Samson and Delilah"" perhaps his most ambitious film to date.  At 180 minutes there is nary a dull moment.  Roeg afficianados will appreciate the customary Roeg flourishes:  shocking edits, liberal use of the zoom lens, intentional placement of humor and a general atmosphere of mysticism and otherworldliness.  The performances are all around solid.  Dennis Hopper turns in a clever and decidedly Hopper-esque performance as a reluctant Philistine general.  Eric Thall, as Samson, comes across as vulnerable and humane yet entirely believable when coerced to flights of rage.  His long hair doesn't look fake, chalking up another high mark for this film's realism.  And Elizabeth Hurley as Delilah?  Well, what more needs to be said?  She really delivers with her greedy seduction of Samson and subsequent guilt.  Not to mention, that in her Delilah garb, she is absolutely gorgeous.  All in all a surprising and entertaining  movie for Nicolas Roeg and all involved.  Be sure to keep rolling for the credits as not to miss the Ennio Morricone-scored end titles.  A short and haunting piece that is very appropriate.",969926400,68,1416,5.245535714285714

7867175,2,6304289685,"This movie had/has a lot going for it. Dennis Hopper, Nicolas Roeg, an Italian production, and Elizabeth Hurley are just a few. The authentic old world setting and decent direction also hold this film together. What it lacks is a decent script. Now I can care less how ""Biblically accurate"" these movies are. It's not about how closely to the letter the filmmakers are staying, but rather how true to the archetype, the psychology behind the story, that really defines a classic. That is what is missing here. It's not a word-for-word reenactment, it does deviate from scripture, but it does so in a way that doesn't really make sense, nor has it any profound significance (as in the greek tragedy approach that DeMille took). Since Saint-Saens classic Opera, the tendency has been to portray Delilah as a sort of royal courtesan and rather intimately connected to Samson, rather than the random woman she probably was. This film is no different. Also elevated to the status of ""main character"" is Dennis Hopper's utterly fictional, and somewhat arbitrary character of the Philistine general, who simply seems to exist for the eccentricity factor. (Still, the man is brilliant, even in lame roles.)

Another thing that gets to me about these made for TV biblical films from the 90's is that they all seem to take place in crumbling ruins. Didn't people in the Bronze Age know how to upkeep their clay-brick structures, or did they originally design them to look so decrepit? I'm sure the ancient middle-east was incredibly colorful. Not the dull grey and brown that is portrayed in these films. If the temple of Dagon was really so shoddy, Samson wouldn't have had to wait for his strength to return to tear down those pillars.

But then there's the portrayal of Samson himself. So typical of the mid to late 90's post grunge youth. He was angry, disenfranchised, spoiled, petulant, selfish, lazy and bitter... for ""no good reason."" Sounds like so many other young middle-class guys I grew up with from this era. He is portrayed as having zero heroic, or leadership qualities, and is practically bullied, and even betrayed by his own people into doing ""something"" with his special abilities. (Super Human Strength) He comes to their rescue grudgingly. In the end his response is to leave. Again, this is a Samson of the 90's. A selfish, feel sorry for myself, why does everything suck, type of Samson. The Biblical narrative actually makes a whole lot more Sense, and Victor Mature's self assured, charismatic, somewhat arrogant, but gentle (until pissed) portrayal is probably more like the real thing. Yes Samson had character flaws, but there's no way he could have served as Judge of the Tribe of Dan for 20 years without some strong leadership qualities and a massive ego.",1498089600,3,2777,4.89384288747346
