8022241,1,B000248WZ4,"You'll notice that of all the recent Super Bowl DVDs, this is the only one that's out-of-print. This is because it failed to sell well outside of Colorado. I mean, see for yourself! One can buy a used copy of this Super Bowl DVD for as little as TEN CENTS, per the date of this review. That's because every NFL fan  knew, before the DVD was ever in stores, that the outcome wasn't decided by the Broncos' own merits or capability, thus the title ""Best-Ever"" became something of a sick joke amongst true NFL--not just Packers--fans. Fraudulent title, fraudulent finish! HERE IS WHY. HERE'S THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS GAME, FOR HISTORY'S SAKE.

Denver didn't even win the game by themselves! In the final 1:45 of the game, Green Bay's then-head coach, Mike Holmgren, yells for a time out, then calls his entire defensive unit, not just the usual defensive captains, over to the sideline. Holmgren publicly admitted a couple of days afterwards that he'd told his whole defense to ""LET (Broncos' halfback) TERRELL DAVIS SCORE A TOUCHDOWN"", so that the Packers could get the ball back with some time left in the game. If you watch the next play, when it is shown in slow motion, no one on Green Bay is knocked down by the Denver offensive line. Several players were close enough to have stopped Davis short of the goal, force him to fumble, or anything that could've easily happened in Green Bay's favor.  NO one even makes an effort to touch Davis when he scores what proves to be the Super-Bowl winning touchdown. The Packers' coach, therefore, conceded the game-winning score! No coach had *ever* done that before. That's absolutely THE biggest coaching blunder in NFL history!

Why did he do this? Holmgren admits that ""he lost track of which 'down' it was"", and he was furious at himself for such a stupid, stupid mistake.

THE BRONCOS DID *NOT* WIN SUPER BOWL XXXII BY THEIR OWN ABILITY...GREEN BAY'S COACH *GAVE* THEM THE GAME! HE GIFT-WRAPPED IT, IN FACT!",1318464000,2,1952,4.712609970674487
8022242,2,B000248WZ4,"A good recollection of a mediocre game.  To label it as the ""Best Ever"" is ludicrous. Super Bowl XXXII ranks somewhere in the 11th to 15th best.  Just because elway FINALLY won does not make this the ""best ever"".",1161043200,4,212,4.410256410256411
