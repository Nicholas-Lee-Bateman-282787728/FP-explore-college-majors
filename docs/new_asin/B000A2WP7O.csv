2351871,1,B000A2WP7O,"The Last of the Mohicans is my all-time favorite movie--that is in the original format. The DVD sold in the US is the Director's Cut and leaves me with disgust and outrage. The war at the fort is now way too long and my most favorite moments have now been deleted and replaced with counterfeit moments. The music does not even seem to flow the same way. I went to Wal-Mart the other day and found a DVD just entitled The Last of the Mohicans, but don't be fooled. Notice carefully that whoever packaged it is obviously feeling the heat of those like me that feel the same way. They carefully place a paper over the what is truly the original. It is the worse-than-awful Director's Cut. If you want the best edition, buy the VHS version if you can find it or the version from Great Britain which is owned by Warner Brothers not Fox. Even with the lesser quality of the VHS over a DVD, you still will walk away with a far better deal.",1245110400,56,932,4.271186440677966
2351872,5,B000A2WP7O,"We all know that retarded question:  what movie/book/poem/appliance would you take with you if confined to a solitary exile for life?... Well, if I ever have to answer that question, this as true as it gets...  This movie comes with me - hands down and no competition (well, provided that the deserted island is equipped with DVD/VCR player and enough reliable electricity to run it - oh, hell - forget that: I would pedal a stationary bike to generate electricity...).
This movie is as perfect as perfect gets.  The script, the actors, the breathtaking scenery and the music that brings it all together.  Yes, I read the book.  It probably sucked, but I could not care less - I was 12 and forever infected with the romanticism of the last frontier (that was before ""Star Trek"", mind you...).  When the movie came out, I was much older, somewhat wiser and more discriminating, and no less a romantic fool.  I fell head first, and it was not till I watched it for the tenth time or so, before I started to get pass the overwhelming gut feeling and into the details that make this movie a masterpiece.  OK, there is Daniel Day - Lewis as Hawkeye (very different from Cooper's asexual scout hero...) - visually enticing, to be sure and a competent actor - no more, no less.  Than, there are others: Wes Studi as savage and cruel, yet compelling Maqua.  Eric Schweig as Uncas - casted as stereotype, managed to overcome it and more: packed an entire romantic story of love and ultimate sacrifice into few stolen glances... Opposite him, Johdi May  as Alice - timid British girl overwhelmed and bewildered by the carnal reality of the Frontier - facing the cruel odds, she grows up in matter of days if not hours.  The final scene over the cliffs is a masterpiece:  Alice moves away from her captor, horrified and shocked, she glances away into unimaginable abyss, and when she looks back, her face is transformed in a matter of seconds - from uncontrollable fear to serenity of understanding and acceptance... The final moment, when she looks away, almost like a girl shying away from lover's glance is so breathtaking when one realizes it's the world she shies away from, in such a soft and sweet, yet final gesture...
And of course - Madeleine Stowe as Cora.  One might not consider her role such an outstanding accomplishment (as it is, to be sure...) - if not for the remainder of her movie career so far.  Madeleine Stove managed to portray characters who border on timid and forgettable - characters who try to be pretty, seductive, memorable,  and who never quite manage it... She seems always that bland girl on the brink of attractiveness - by intention or accident, she never seems to find the groove that would make her shine.  Until she became Cora - and she shines indeed!  Fragile and demure, yet strong and irresistibly  beautiful she is positively radiant!
All of that - and then there is the music score by Trevo Jones and Randy Edelman - absolutely genius.
Yes, yes - if I have to pedal a stationary bike on that deserted island - please, let it power the DVD player that plays ""The Last of the Mohicans""...",1214179200,2,3121,4.631578947368421
2351873,1,B000A2WP7O,"I simply want to keep what so many others have said at the top.  This is the worst directors cut ever.  It is so bad that I would rather watch Lucas's butchered versions of Star Wars over and over again before watching this.

Not only was one of the best musical moments in film history removed, but one of the worst pieces of dialogue was put in!  Honestly, do we need another guilt trip speech about the raping of this land?  It's totally unnecessary and doesn't fit.  In fact, that message was more clear before this dialogue was added.  All that added dialogue did was pull you out of any feelings you were having about what has been done to the American Natives.  Myself, having some of that blood in me can say that with complete sincerity.

I would beg Fox to put out the original theatrical version of this film on DVD, but it will most likely never happen.  As I see there are endless complaints here and they have yet to do it.  If you really really want to see this movie, rent it.  Don't waste your money on this horrible version of a once terrific film.",1204329600,89,1066,4.301507537688442
2351874,3,B000A2WP7O,"I consider Michael Mann's 1992 version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" to be a great movie, and one of the best date movies of all time.  You think I am kidding?  Find a better combination of action and romance that this film.  Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) runs through the forest with an intensity that is frightening and when he finally gets tired of just looking at Miss Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), he does not need words, just the sound of a fiddle being filled in by a string section.  That is why I can also say try to find a movie with better music for both the action and the romance (I figured out how to play the main theme on a cheap mini-organ).  But I will not belabor the point because I have to think I am preaching to the choir when it comes to speaking of the quality of this film (Just avoid the book, because I could not get halfway through Cooper's novel).

But this Special Edition DVD is a disgrace and the fact that here we are more than a half a decade latter since this DVD came out and we still do not have something worthy of this film.  This DVD loses one star right off the bat because here is what it describes as being ""BONUS FEATURES"": widescreen format, scene selection, and subtitles.  Excuse me for living, but I would consider those standard.  I have a DVD of ""Zulu"" that has all of those things (albeit only four chapters) and still has biographies to read.  The standard for special editions has been set by James Cameron, first with ""The Abyss"" (on Laser Disc originally) and then on ""T2."" Just look at what ever DVD you think gives you everything you want and more about a favorite movie and compare it to this barren effort.

This DVD loses a second star because what has been added to the film as part of the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" actually takes away from the film.  To tell you the truth, I did not think that was possible.  But the scenes that are added to the film do not add anything significant. They come across as padding rather than adding depth, so just make them deleted scenes.  But even worse, there are a couple of well remembered scenes for which the music and editing have been changed to the point that the scenes are just not the same.  Even my kids picked up on this (we still have the laser disc).  There are few films I have enjoyed more than ""Last of the Mohicans,"" but it is currently the most disappointing DVD in my collection because I know what it should be.

The one strength of this disc is that the screen ratio is back to the original, which is NOT TRUE about the Laser Disc or the Widescreen Video Tape. For proof look at just one scene, the one where the British leave the fort and get attacked on both sides by the Magua's warriors. When I saw the film in the theater it was this scene that made me immediately think: ""They HAVE to do this widescreen. Anything else destroys the film."" I remember that Cora and her sister rode their horse over to a tree on the right, got off, and hid behind it. On the VHS and the Laser Disc I could not see that. I thought I was crazy and had imagined that part of the action, but when the movie aired on TV the scan and pan caught the scene. So the good news is that on this DVD you can see everything.

If you loved this movie, by all means, rent the DVD and check it out.  But be prepared to be disappointed.  I watched the movie again and there are still scenes I love, but then one of those ""expanded"" moments comes along and it makes me want to cry.  I have been waiting this entire century for them to go back and juice up this DVD as Cameron finally did with ""Titanic.""  I want a DVD edition worthy of this film and my patience will run out by the end of this decade.",1143072000,81,3693,4.223328591749644

2351997,4,B000A2WP7O,"It is 1557 a confusing time with the French verses the English and the various Indian tribes taking sides. There are innocent settlers just looking to be free caught up in the conflict.

A small contingent of British are escorting two daughters Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) of a British colonel to a near by fort. They are betrayed and three trappers come to the rescue thus setting the story of the ""last of the Mohicans"" begins.

I do not want to go into details as it will undermine the surprises. Let's just say you will not be disappointed.

This story is based on the 1936 screen play and embellished to a full movie. The scenery is breath taking. One item you can spot right off is that the people in buck skins blend into the back ground; however the British, French and colonel's daughters conspicuously stand out.

Many of the scenes are also surrealistic and have an ethereal feel. This combined with such songs as ""I will find you"" in the back ground lure you into a timeless feeing. Even at the end of the story you are waiting for more.

I have seen the original movie literally hundreds of times, as well as the director's cut.  I could recite every single difference between the two versions.  I wanted a DVD for myself of the original, but they don't exist.  So I ASKED, specifically here, BEFORE I PURCHASED IT if in fact this was the original and not the director's cut and was told that it was.  I just received it today, popped it in and watched the entire thing, and IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, IT *IS* THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  They have put it in an original Last of the Mohican's cover, they have modified the start menu (which is ridiculously noticable bcz of all the pixelation on it like somebody took a snapshot and blew it up too big) and then put it all on top of the Director's Cut.  That's a whole lot of going out of the way to be a criminal.  Needless to say, I will be complaining to Amazon, requesting a refund, and send this back.  This company should, in my opinion, be prosecuted for fraud at the least as well as investigated by the FBI.",1499990400,11,1151,4.287037037037037

There is war between the English and the French. The principle character in the film is a white man, liked by all who know him, who was raised by a very likable Indian, a Mohican, when his parents were killed as his ""white son,"" together with the Indians natural son. The hero does not want to be drawn into the fight between the two European nations, but because of his love of a woman, he joins the English to protect her. Beside the good Indians there are bad ones, just as there are good and bad white people, including military people on both sides. Some Indians help the French, some the English.

4/05: I consider The Last of the Mohicans one of the all-time great films.

When I saw the picture at the theatre, it was just brilliant, and I hadn't seen anything like it before or since then.

Hence, Michael Mann is one of the best directors in the history of motion pictures. All he does is make visual masterpieces.

The Last of the Mohicans should have received a boatload of Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (at least twice), Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

It's impossible to deny how good Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeline Stowe, Wes Studi, Russell Means, Steven Waddington, Maurice Roeves, Patrice Chereau, and Eric Schweig among others were in the film.

As Magua, Wes Studi turned in the best performance of 1992, and it's not even that close. If anyone remembers The Last of the Mohicans, it's Wes Studi's performance because of how he shows his emotions.

Wes spoke four different languages: French, Huron, Mohawk, and English. During the scene on the cliff, he twisted his knee and tore his cartilage, forcing him to have an orthoscopic surgery before returning back on the set a week later. That's why he is seen wearing a brace or rather a legging over it.

Some of my favorite lines of the film are:

""Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden-like, turn left.""

""l, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans.""

""It is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could possibly have been.""

""I do not call myself subject to much at all.""

""In case your aim's any better than your judgment.""

""I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't no damn militia.""

In response to ""What are you looking at, sir?,"" ""I'm looking at you, miss.""

""Yes, and, 'do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense.'""

""Magua's heart is twisted.""

""We're sorry to kill you, brother. We do honor to your courage and speed, your strength.""

In Huron, ""Magua understands that the white man is a dog to his women. When they are tired, he puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness.""

""Magua said, understand English very well.""

""Some day, I think, you and I will have a serious disagreement.""

""A breed apart, we make no sense?""

""When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife, so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.""

By the way, the DVD version of The Last of the Mohicans is atrociously bad. Because certain lines and shots are cut out and new but unnecessary shots are added in, the spirit is just not the same as the theatrical version. The battle scenes are too long and boring. That's why I still have the VHS copy (in fact, two) and prefer to watch that one.

All in all, there's nothing like The Last of the Mohicans.

7/07: I said it before and I will say it again: The Last of the Mohicans is a unique masterpiece.

Wes Studi was snubbed big time for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. If not for him, I don't think The Last of the Mohicans would have been half of the film as it is.

Daniel Day-Lewis is at his sexiest and is complemented well by Madeleine Stowe. They have some of the best romantic scenes in any film.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans might be the best picture that Michael Mann has ever directed.

7/11: Wes Studi was clearly robbed of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans is a masterpiece.

2/17: Still a great film.",1487030400,,3627,4.540832049306625

Some dialogue has been cut or expanded, which I can accept, but leaving out Clannad's amazing song ""I Will Find You"" from the pivotal scene is a major loss. I'm no audio professional but the remixing is not good, either. I needed to adjust the volume up and down throughout the movie, and the unevenness was distracting (the sounds of Hawkeye picking up a musket being much louder than dialogue, for example).

The scene that has the beautiful song ""I will find you""is gone from the movie!!The last scene was not in the original VHS. It had no reason to be there. It took away from the movie for me.
Why the actor who played Duncan was not nominated for an Academy Award is some thing many people don't understand.
He was so raw and believable. He was born to play that role.

2352521,3,B000A2WP7O,"Clearly, a lot of thought has gone into getting historical details right here -- the costumes, the domestic and military interiors, the looks of frontier fortifications, the military formations of the British troops in relation to what we might call the freer style of Indian warfare.  Add to that nice camerawork in capturing both wide natural vistas (North Carolina subbing nicely for the Adirondacks) and the denser visual context of the forests -- but that's about it.  The story itself -- the characters and their relationships -- isn't all that interesting.  That's no fault of the actors -- we all know that Daniel Day-Lewis and the others are capable of more than this -- but the characters are flat as written (partly Cooper's fault, from the original novel, partly the screenwriters') and the result is that we have a kind of costumed action movie, with lots of formal and rather static military scenes interspersed with lots of fast running through forest -- with never a trip over a root and with an obviously speeded-up pacing.  Old Chingachgook can really move!  The movie really focuses more on setting up the British and French conflict in the Americas in 1757 (during the Seven Years War) as a background for a story of rugged individualists who really want no truck with the British OR the French.  Both sides have their Indian ""allies,"" but Hawkeye (Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means) and Uncas, the last of the Mohicans (Eric Schweig) seem to just want to head west, to where the frontier is less contaminated by European politics.  Neither the English nor the French come off well here, the former being arrogant and inflexible and the latter being deceitful and emptily formal.  The personal vendetta of the Huron warrior Magua (Wes Studi, always good to see) against Col. Munro and his family seems a bit anachronistic, more in keeping with a gangster movie than an historical one.  The attraction between Hawkeye and Cora (Madeleine Stowe), the daughter of the stiff-necked English Colonel Munro (Maurice Roeves), involves intense looks and heavy breathing, but that's about it.  We're to understand, I think, that class and perhaps racial bounds mean nothing to the individualists -- so, I suppose, they can stand in nicely for attitudes that the audience can largely sympathize with.  I hadn't seen Maurice Roeves since Joseph Strick's 1967 ""Ulysses"" -- an effort to film Joyce's novel, with Roeves as Stephen -- and it was good to see that he was still working and still effective.  ""Ulysses"" had its problems as a movie, but it was much more interesting than this one.",1471392000,,2602,4.970046082949309

I asked my boyfriend what I missed but he kept saying ""shhhh, I can't follow whats happening if you keep talking in my ear""  So I got mad and left the theater.  After the movie my boyfriend and I had a fight.  I told him if he would just drink diet, my legs wouldn't be so sticky.  I didn't let him drive me home so I just walked in the rain.  I hate that, last time we got into a fight, I had to call my neighbor's husband to come pick me up.

2352781,4,B000A2WP7O,"This is my favorite movie of all time, the only reason I give it a 4 star rating is because it is the directors definitive cut which has some changes from original film. I prefer the original cut better as it is what I always watched from childhood into adulthood. I actually went out and bought a few VHS copies to make sure I always have the original cut. The directors cut just takes out a few small parts of scenes for no reason including taking out half of the ""I will always find you"" speech between Cora and Hawkeye from under the waterfall. No reason should have been messed with. Other then the few changes to key scenes, the quality of the movie and everything else was awesome, but if you are a big as fan as I am just be prepared to miss some of the best lines in the film.",1459209600,,785,4.137254901960785

Three trappers protect a British Colonel's daughters in the midst of the French and Indian War...based
on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name and an earlier film adaptation.
Michael Mann has headed several of my favorite movies: Miami Vice, Collateral, The Insiders.
This was one of his early successes. Mann has a touch for visuals, his movies always are great to look at. In this one he also has a classic story re-told with his visual touch.
Having seen it quite a few times over the years? I have to say I can be more critical now days with it. For instance, the music, once considered grand by me, is somewhat repetitive, almost grating. But it does lead to a climatic seen you won't soon forget.
This is one of his best and a great classic tale undiminished by Mann. In fact I would say it might inspire some to read, or re-read Coopers classic novel.",1455580800,,896,4.469512195121951

2352988,5,B000A2WP7O,"I will not get into the discussion here of the technical differences between the Director's and Theatrical Cuts, other than to say my DVD version is the Theatrical Cut.  But this is a great film and remains totally engrossing on a recent viewing.  So much so that it seems to stand above and outside the time it was made.  At the time action films were having a real heyday in Hollywood, and this certainly has action elements.  But the narrative and the characters make it something else, and the net result on the thematic level is compelling.  The narrative reaches a stunning crescendo, so artfully developed as to be among the greatest ever at such an achievement, followed by a coda at the end where the surviving characters look to their future, their place on this Earth, and in so doing speak to us.  That who is the last referred to here stands in for all of us in terms of how our lives are finite, and what do we do with them to live up to that which we should.

But the foregoing is merely the overall theme, tied up at the end, while before we reach the end the viewer is given a truly exceptional cast led by the brilliant Daniel Day Lewis in one of if not his greatest roles.  Madeleine Stowe is extremely well cast and totally convincing, not to mention a great beauty, in the female lead.  But there is not a missing beat or false moment in the performances of the entire cast.  Particular mention goes to Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Russell Means and especially Wes Studi as Magua.

Michael Mann has had his controversial and less effective moments, but this is I think his greatest work.  The editing, attention to all detail, and perhaps most compelling is the effect of the score and its role in the storytelling.  Some over the years have been put off by some of the scenes of violence, but the conceded brutality of the film has a solid and compelling purpose, with none of it gratuitous.

Despite the observation about the violence, this is also an intensely romantic film, with the developing love between the male and female leads subtly mirrored by another, more mysterious, relationship.  That one reaches a melancholy ending to say the least that nonetheless heightens the sublime aspect of it, and on a mundane level that is nonetheless worth mentioning this film can be seen as one of the great date movies of all time.  Also deserving of mention is the historical context of the film and how the tribulations of the colonist settlers in the frontier of upstate New York speak to us today.

The end result is a timeless film that only gets better with repeat viewings.  Most I think whe give it a chance will love it.  (Hopefully you will not be put off by the complaints about the different versions of it.)",1448841600,2,2737,4.526422764227642

The closer I look the better it gets. By the way from a historical perspective, the surrender happened to the same Cournal Monroe.  After the surrender the French where suppose to protect the British, solders men, women and children and they did not.
The massacre was real and worse then the movie. Cournal Monroe did have children, but his daughter was not at the fort.  He did die, but not until he was safe in a British Fort and few weeks later.  The Mohicans are still with us so they where not the Last of The Mohicans.  By the way the Mohicans did help the colonist..  From the French and Indians War to the present.

The photography is great. The casting and acting were great. But, I was particularly struck by the dissimilarities between the book and the film. Here is what they have in common:
Hawkeye and his two confederates; the Colonel and his daughters; the major, and the antagonist, Magua, were in both.
The plot of the movie was somewhat similar to that of the book, but enough different as to create wonder if they were intended to represent the same work. The beginning, middle and end of the movie were all different from the book.

The movie feels like it's missing great chunks (I read afterwards that Michael Mann had to cut it down from 3 hours to 2, so that might explain it) plus it felt overly dated with a lot of typically Michael Mann mood shots of actors gazing towards a horizon/sunset/flaming fort, etc, accompanied by a Terminator-style, synth soundtrack, bearing no relation to the time period portrayed. It should be epic but I found it a jarring mess. My son isn't that picky and he thought it was terrible.

I had to keep turning it up for dialogue and down for action/music. I watched another movie immediately afterward just to make sure it wasn't my TV or something.

2353339,5,B000A2WP7O,"'Last of the Mohicans' is certainly one of my all-time-favourite movies, it has everything from love and
revenge to some brilliant action sequences.
The story is set in the middle of the 18th century at a time when 'Britain' and 'France' were in conflict
over the Northern Territories.
The British demanding that many from the Territories left their family to join a 'Militia' to fight the French,
while the French had help from the Indian tribes such as the 'Huron'
'Chingachgook' (Russell Means) along with his son 'Uncas' (Eric Schweig) and adopted son 'Hawkeye'
(Nathaniel Poe) played by 'Daniel Day Lewis' make a living in the forests close to Hudson-Bay hunting
as 'Chingachgook's' forefathers had done for centuries past.
The three are challenged to join the Militia' but refuse to do so.........
The Daughters 'Cora' (Madeleine Stowe) and 'Alice' (Jodhi May) of the commander at 'Fort William Henry'
'Colonel Edmund Munro' (Maurice Roeves) are on route to join him.
A column of soldiers accompany them commanded by 'Major Duncan Heyward' (Steven Waddington) who
has romantic notions toward 'Cora Munro'....they are joined on the journey by supposed friend of the British
'Magua' (Wes Studi) who acts as a guide.
However on route the column are attacked by followers of 'Magua' ...in the close-by forest 'Hawkeye' along
with his adopted family hear the disturbance and go to investigate.
'Alice' and 'Cora' along with the Major are saved by the three, the remainder perish at the hands of 'Magua's'
warriors.
When arriving close to the fort they find it to be under siege by the French. however 'Cora' and 'Alice' are smuggled
in by a little ingenuity from 'Hawkeye' 'Chingachgook' and 'Uncas' to join their father.
The fort is heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the French, with no help coming 'Colonel Munro' is forced to
accept the terms of surrender offered by the French Commander, they are offered safe passage on the understanding
that they just keep travelling until they reach the shores of Britain,though the French Commander knows that he is
only releasing the soldiers to fight another day.
'Magua' who has vowed to avenge his children that 'Col Munro's' forces had killed sometime before, he intends to kill
'Cora' and 'Alice' then rip out the Heart of the Colonel.
'Magua' and his warriors ambush the retreating column, only the few survive, 'Hawkeye' who has now fallen for 'Cora'
saves the sisters again with his adoped brother and father-figure escaping in a canoe, as have 'Major Heyward' and
a small number of soldiers.
The story continues with 'Magua' and a now small band of warriors giving chase one that will lead to tragedy for some,
with a finally as 'Magua' squares up to both 'Uncas' and then 'Chingachgook' one to one.
As mentioned earlier this remains a favourite of mine, it has a good story-line coupled with plenty of action sequences.
This was 'Daniel Day Lewis's' screen-debut, what a superb opening role for him.
The Blu-ray upgrade is superb.

2353381,2,B000A2WP7O,"The film is finely made with some great battle scenes. My complaint is the way the J. Copper novel (claimed as the First American Novel) was ground up and re-pressed for the movie.
Here are some differences:
Movie Hawkeye: Romance novel handsome D. Lewis who is adopted stepson of Chingachgook  falls in love with Cora.
Novel Hawkeye: Old backwoodsman with a backwood dialect. Friend of Chingachgook and more of a father figure to Uncas. No romantic interest in Cora
Movie Chingachgook: Statuesque and has little dialog.
Novel Chingachgook: Moral and  spiritual center of the novel. His musings provide the back-story to the events and give the novel its poignancy.
Movie Uncas: More of a prop.
Novel Uncas: Provides a dramatic speech when a lost tribe of the Delawares discovers he is their chief.
Movie Cora: Love interest of Duncan and Hawkeye.
Novel Cora: Part African American daughter of Monro. Strong willed. Worries about acceptance in English society.  Mangua wants Cora for his wife.
Movie Duncan: Dastardly double crossing Englishman in love with Cora.
Novel Duncan: Honourable  soldier in love with Alice. Ignorant of the ways of the wilderness. Tutored by Hawkeye.
Movie Gamut: oops not there.
Novel Gamut: Spiritualist who believes in prayer and song. In the end he risks his life to save Uncas.
Movie Ending: Romance novel stuff.
Novel Ending: Solemn. No Hollywood Ending.",1433894400,3,1387,5.123893805309734

2353530,5,B000A2WP7O,"This is one of my favorite movies. So much so, that I went back and read the book. Remember how people always say the book is better? Not so in this case. One of the principal characters, Hawkeye, was much improved in the movie version. I found the original Hawkeye from the book hypocritical, criticizing books and writing, then in the next scene being a windbag of a poet, using larger words than his self-professed lack of education would allow. Also, the author Cooper made the whole thing one big tedious poetic romantic thing, but the movie filtered all of that tedious waste out.

The movie version of Hawkeye was what I liked the most. The movie, did, however, take liberties with the basic script, killing off Alice instead of Cora, and killing off Duncan and COL Munro, who both survived until book's end in the book version.  In the book, MAJ Hayward offered to give his life in place of Cora, but Magua refused, and no one was killed at the time. In the movie, the Indians accepted the Major's offer and killed him outright. In the movie, Magua killed COL Munro following the surrender to the French, when the Hurons caught up with them after leaving the fort. I found this an acceptable change, because COL Munros presence did not add a whole lot to the rest of the story.

However, the changes improved it somewhat, even though the book's version of the funerals of Cora and Uncas were part of the best of the book's story. The characters were all believable, devoid of the books Hawkeye with all of his ramblings about whites and Indians, and made a great modern adaptation of a classic work.",1427932800,,1607,4.572916666666667

2353610,5,B000A2WP7O,"This film is a magnificent interpretation of Fenimore's classic work, bringing vividly to life so many of the unforgettable scenes described in the book. Fenimore's prose can sometimes be heavy going, but the film has extracted the essence of the plot faithfully (there are some differences but nothing drastically Hollywood eg The Man In The Iron Mask) . The actors chosen were perfect for the role. Daniel Day Lewis is the quintessential Hawkeye, all one imagined the character to be. He is a very fine actor and this is one of his truly memorable roles. Another classic performance is given by the character who plays Magua, his every expression conveys hatred and a deep sense of malice. All the supporting cast do a fine job in conveying an authentic feel to the historical drama. The story is set amidst breathtaking scenery of forest, river and mountains, and the haunting music plays in your mind long after the film is over. The costumes are just gorgeous, the camera captures every detail of colour and form. From the opening scene of a stag being hunted to the unbearably moving final scene where the last of the mohicans contemplates the loss of everything in the world dear to him, of ideals betrayed and greed and cowardice triumphant, there is not a wasted moment. The film gives a realistic portrayal of what true love is, without ""Titanic"" style theatrics. Given the backdrop of savagery and bloodshed, the love theme is all the more poignant. You can watch the film at two levels. One level is just good old fashioned entertainment, with your heart beating faster and faster as the final scene approaches. You can also interpret the film at a deeper level. Many of the events depicted in a fictional setting in a frontier environment are actually happening today, not just in America but all over the world, the context is different but the struggle is the same. The film is very inspiring, and can be watched over and over again. Together with ""Rob Roy"" , these two films are to me the best adaptations in the 1990s of classical adventure stories. There was an older movie version made in the sixties, but that version pales in comparison to this definitive adaptation. The only criticism of the film is that it should have been made as a 3 hour film so that the character of Uncas and the younger Munro daughter could be developed better, as in the novel but this is a minor point. You might also like to consider re-reading Cooper after the film, it makes the book seem more alive now you can visualise the settings of some of the scenes. I'd strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for high drama, great acting, a thoughtful script and fabulous locations. Its rare to come across an adventure film that makes you think deeply ! Please note that if you want to buy this DVD do NOT purchase the Director's Cut on the Amazon USA web site. Instead, purchase the movie version on the Amazon UK web site.

2353613,5,B000A2WP7O,"Based on the written novel by Author James Fenimore Cooper THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, the famous literary classic is brought to the big-screen in an epic way. Academy Award winning Actor, Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, the American frontiersman who in his youth, was adopted by the majestic Mohican Indians. This gave him a great advantage as a hunter, trapper, scout, woodsman and diplomat, in negotiating peace and trade treaties between the French and English, American colonialists and the Indians. But, when his love for a British Officer's daughter is resisted by her father along with the Indians from another tribe who were employed to work for him, who were originally at peace with Hawkeye but had old scores to settle against the American colonialists, all hell breaks loose. Suddenly, the French, English and Americans are fighting each other and are also caught in a cross-fire between various Native American tribes, who were at war with each other for their own reasons. Breathtaking, majestic, cinematic beauty throughout the film which engrosses the audience into another time and dimension as only, great movie-making can bring it to you. This 1992 movie, which graphically illustrates frontier struggle and a passionate love story, is as adventurous as it is enthralling. An excellent, entertaining movie and a definite epic, home keeper for your DVD collection. Nina Kish",1422835200,,1394,5.227678571428571

I watched the theatrical version years ago and I'm watching this one now. Really, I don't see much difference. It is still a great movie. Also, some commented on the streaming (Amazon Instant Video) being ""too dark to watch"". I can see the scenes perfectly well. Two slight flaws though- one, for some reason, there are NO CLOSED CAPTIONS at all. Personally I like closed captions, I am probably missing a few lines here and there now. The second thing is, I bought the HD version but of course, this is an 80's movie- there is only so much resolution you are going to get. So I'm not sure it's any better than SD.

2353691,2,B000A2WP7O,"I has nice moments and certainly beautiful cinematography. Day-Lewis, Schweig, Means, and Studi are all excellent performers. But the meat of the film... well, just isn't very meaty. The story is virtually non-existent, characters do highly questionable things with little explanation, and the historical accuracy is dreadful. (I know, it's a movie, it doesn't have to be accurate. Spare me.)

I have read the books (the 'leatherstocking tales' by James Fenimore Cooper on which this movie is based) and found them vastly superior to the film in every way. More specifically I have read the first 3 in the series ""The deerslayer,"" ""The last of the Mohicans,"" and ""the pathfinder."" I got to the fourth ""the pioneers,"" took three stabs at it, and surprisingly have not been able to finish it. Too slow and convoluted. I'll try again some time.

Overall I'm not sure why this movie has such a cult following, I think it has more to do with the 'mythos' surrounding Native Americans and the Colonial days of America than with any great tale telling or memorable plot or dialog. I am intrigued by this history as well but would suggest the Spielberg series 'into the west' or ""dreamkeeper"" for a slightly more meaningful approach",1419638400,,1224,4.908212560386473

2353750,4,B000A2WP7O,"I enjoyed this film. It was a good historical film. In this film, I notice that the idea of identity in Latin America was shown. This film depicts the identity of the Indians. They want freedom and they do not want to be tie down. It was the same for Latin America. The people wanted their own life not a life that was expected or given to them because of what the authorities wanted. Latin America has this idea that tells a great deals of who you are. Thus, one specific character that stands out to this idea of identity would be Hawkeye. He is an adopted white man who joined the group of two Indians. He identifies both with the white men as well as the Indian men. He considers himself to be white but socially he is Indian especially with the Mohicans. The idea of identity in Latin America may seem to vary. It can be the identity of where you belong, who you are, what you are, and you, yourself as a whole. Hawkeye is that sole example for this. He does consider himself part of the Indian group but at the same time he cannot sway away from his genuine race, white. Although he is very open to different races, he is to a certain degree, does not consider interracial relationship to be okay between man and woman. It brings back the idea that he may want to keep the culture/race of a land to be genuine. In this case, Hawkeye may be the representation of Latin Americas identity back in the days when a mixture of others and the peoples of the country are against each other. The idea that if you are mixed race, then you may not belong to any one of the race. However, you may or may not be the hope of a racewhether it is for power or influence. Basically, regardless of whom you are and what you are initially, you cannot be someone of whom you are not born as. It is an identity that you cannot get rid of or distant yourself from. Hawkeye does seem to symbolize thatthe idea of identity in Latin America.",1417564800,,1922,4.239782016348774

2353752,3,B000A2WP7O,"SPOILER ALERT
The Last of the Mohicans was a good film overall. I enjoyed watching it while applying the lense of Doris Sommers foundational fiction even if it wasn't so much portrayed as such. The film itself is nothing complicated to understand, much like the novels and films associated with these types of concepts. For this short analysis I would like to focus two of relationships trying to take place in it. The first being Uncas and Alice. Uncas is a full blooded Mohican who essentially falls for one of the daughters of the British Colonel Monroe whom he and Hawkeye, an adopted white man into Mohican care, have strong disagreements with. This relationship is not successful. Uncas and Alice both die in the sake of love. These characters represent two different cultures coming together and not accomplishing their union. This is interpreted into actual history as a portrayal of what really happened here in the United States since Native Americans were never really mixed in with the growing country. Instead, relationships like these were very unlikely forged and also frowned upon. Uncas cannot have Alice because their society, one filled with war, will not allow it. One could then argue that Hawkeye and Coras relationship could represent the two cultures fusing, but not entirely.
Hawkeye was only adopted into the Mohicans, he was born into them. Like the rest of the former indentured servants, he still has rights and possibilities that the other natives did not. At the end of the day, he can cut his hair and dress like the colonists and fit right in. Here, race proves itself to indeed be real since the color and physical aspects of a man or woman can determine a lot. His relationship with Cora could be said to be fulfilled, but again the two aren't mixing cultures entirely and creating a new one like Enriquillo and Mencia created in Manuel Galvans The Cross and the Sword. Instead, like in reality, some Native Americans are introduced into the already established lives of the colonists. Hawkeye will not change Cora like Uncas might have changed Alice. Hawkeye does struggle with his own identity, like Enriquillo, and his affection for Cora adds to this. Overall these two relationships really mirror history and how two already established cultures do not always mix together to create a new one. I would argue that this is what Doris Sommer calls a foundational fiction because of how easily it tells history through love and the clashing of two distinct cultures.",1417564800,,2501,4.914893617021277

During the third year of the war (1757) with England fighting against the French and the Huron tribe fighting control of the Americas, are two british sisters being accompanied by a small patrol of English soldiers to take them to Fort William Henry.  Their mission is to reunite with their father, a proud and very stubborn british officer who is also the commander of the fort.  They are not long into their journey when they are attacked by the Huron.  With so many dead, three men come to their aid. Hawkeye, white son to Chingachgook who adopted him when he was a baby.and the only father he has ever known. He was commonly known to his very good friends and others bearing his christian name Nathaniel. Traveling with his father and his brother Uncas they come across the harsh scene before them and rescue the two british sisters and a british officer.  They agree to guide them to the fort but when they arrive, the world in which they knew it has been ravaged by war. Miss Cora Munro (portrayed by Miss Stowe) and Nathaniel (portrayed by Mr. Lewis) are falling in love and Uncas is falling in love with the younger sister Alice.  As the fort starts to crumble, their love will truly be tested by a ravenous conflict of war not to mention their fate and the very core of their own survival!......A passionate love story mixed with excitement, suspense and thrill-seeking moments. A beautiful musical score with memorable historical sites.

While the number of tribes is vast in the country and most of them now are located West of the Mississippi, this film gives students a peek into the tribes that once lived in the Northeastern region and the forces at work during the 1750s that lead up to the Revolutionary War.  This film is so visually lush; the story is epic, romantic, and heroic; the acting is superb.

The story of Nathaniel (Hawk-Eye) and Cora, unfolds in the backdrop of the French and Indian War. The director does a beautiful job in capturing Cora's gradual immersion into America's wild, frontier culture, and her sister's struggle to adapt in this raw world. Duncan embodies an Englishman who also gradually loses his Englishhood and becomes by the end, an American. (the loss of the wig, the missing jacket, the break down in his ability to control his emotion).

My one complaint was the deviation from the book in which Magua's bitterness does not stem from his love and resentment for his lost family, but rather his own battle with alcoholism. I understand it added a dramatic effect to this brilliantly depicted movie, but I think such a struggle could have also been captured brilliantly in this movie.",1404950400,,884,4.847682119205298

My degree in history came in handy for this film.  With attention to detail, the film is not only breathtaking in scope, scenery, and impact, it is a living history wherein you can see a slice of 18th century life.
The film is another rendition of James Fennimore Cooper's famous tome.  However, it's 100x better than the old Hollywood film of the same name.  This one is nuanced, showing the motivation of the French as well as the English, the nature of the Indians fighting for each side (i.e. the French-Indian War), as well as the colonists (i.e. us) who are cast adrift by an English parent country itself under siege by the powerful French regime opposing them in every (war) theatre.

The movie covers the daughters of the English commanding officer in the area and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile wilderness, beset by the French&their Indian allies, and the spectre of being alone.  Somehow, some of the heroes survive while others do not.

The supporting cast were excellent, a perfect foil for the two main characters.",1400889600,3,449,4.6835443037974684
2353964,1,B000A2WP7O,"There is painful, and there is very painful. This revisionist cinematic production of James Fennimore Coopers The Last of the Mohicans falls into the latter category. Or at least thats true if historical accuracy, believable acting, and a well-written plot mean anything to the vast array of viewers. Or at least a chosen handful of them. But I digress.

  The story opens in Colonial America during the French and Indian War, whereupon we are promptly introduced to Daniel Day-Lewis playing Hawkeye, a buckskinned frontier scout known as The Long Carrabine who looks just a little bit too prettied-up for the part. Traveling with his adopted Mohican father and brother, Chingachgook and Uncas, he makes a pit-stop in a remote settlement where British officers are trying to coerce American colonials to reinforce the defenses of local British forts against the French attacks. In true stereotypical fashion, the redcoats are portrayed to a man as dandified tyrants, fanatic about their duty to the Crown but with a definite lack of talent for real fighting.

  The colonists refuse to comply with British demands, saying they will not leave their women and children defenseless at home while they are serving elsewhere. Hawkeye, loitering around in the crowd, also gets his chance to make a splash by announcing that he doesnt see himself as subject to any man. And here we come to first major bend in the road: unlike previous productions, Hawkeye is most certainly not on the British side.

  Realizing they can make a process a lot easier by just lying to the colonials in order to gain their allegiance, British General Webb makes a cursory promise that they can leave to protect their homes should they see fit (accompanied by ominous music and an evil snicker, of course). Then we get our first up-close glimpse of Major Duncan Hayward, a young British officer who we remember for being a nice guy in the book and past film versions, but who has now been transformed into an incorrigible louse. He gets to give an overblown speech about making everywhere England at the council-of-war, and then speedily exits to take care of some personal business.

  Enter Miss Cora Munro, played by the attractive Madeleine Stowe. She is the eldest daughter of the British commanding officer at Fort William Henry, and it is up to Major Hayward, an old family friend, to get her and her younger sister, Alice, safely to the fort and their father. From the get-go, Duncan seems to have an unlucky streak in both love and war, since his marriage proposal to Cora doesnt particularly exhilarate her and his detachment is subsequently wiped out by renegade Indian scouts.

  Duncan and his lady-friends seem doomed to be tomahawked (especially since Duncan is less than athletic in hand-to-hand combat), but then, charging out of the woods just in the nick of time comes the dashing, crashing, mans man, Hawkeye, who shoots up or scares off all the attackers with the help of Chingachgook and Uncas. Yes, one must wonder how they manage to do what a whole detachment couldn't do, just as one would wonder how Mel Gibson manages to annihilate a British detachment with just two little kids as back-ups in The Patriot. But for Cora Munro, logistics don't matter. Hawkeye is her hero, and love is soon wafting through the wilderness air. In keeping with his buoyant perspective when facing set-backs, Duncan begins scheming to do away with The Long Carrabine.

  By the time everybody makes it to Fort William Henry under the cover of a French barrage, things inside are looking pretty bleak. Colonel Munro, who in the book and other movies had been portrayed as a rather proud but basically decent career officer, is remade into a war-criminal who has incurred the particular wrath of a Huron warrior named Magua because of atrocities perpetrated against his tribe. Munro also goes back on the promise to let the Americans go home should their homesteads be attacked, even though Indians are massacring everyone in their path.

  Hawkeye, of course, has to step in here and help some of the colonials escape after a cozy fireside chat where the Americans assert their opposition to tyranny in true revolutionary fashion, even though the foreshadowed revolution is a long way off. For this good deed, Hawkeye is thrown into the forts prison and sentenced to hang. Cora makes a gallant effort to plead for his life in front of her father and Duncan, but to no avail. Duncan even goes so far as to deny that a promise granting the Americans leave to go home was ever made, and his-would-be-fiance proceeds to disparage him and make a rousing declaration in favor of freedom for the colonials.

  Cutting to the chase, when the fort finally surrenders to the French, Magua and his Hurons disregard the terms of surrender and slaughter many of the British and American prisoners. Once again, Hawkeye, who conveniently hasn't been hanged yet, rescues Cora and Alice, and starts paddling up-stream in a convenient canoe that happens to be on-hand. Duncan, also renting a parked canoe, follows in hot pursuit. Yes, the whole thing does look as ridiculous as it sounds. Anyway, after everyone bales out near the rapids and cools off behind a picturesque waterfall, Hawkeye breaks the news to Cora and Alice that their father has had the misfortune of getting his heart cut out by Magua. And speaking of the devil, Magua shows up as if on cue, encircling their waterfall oasis.

  No matter where you go, I will find you! declares Hawkeye, in order to thematically synchronize with the title song track written by Clannad, and then he and his Mohicans leap through the falls and head for the hills while the girls and dear ole Duncan are taken prisoners. But to their credit, its not long before Hawkeye and family show up again at a nearby Huron village where Cora, Alice, and Duncan are about to be burned at the stake. During a long and messy transaction involving walking the gauntlet and using Duncan as a French translator, Hawkeye tries to convince the Huron top-brass to release their prisoners unharmed. The top-brass decide to compromise: Duncan will be released, Alice will remain in captivity, and Cora will be incinerated.

  Not a good deal as far as the two rival lovers are concerned, and they start whining in unison, Take me! Take me! (I couldn't help but mentally insert, No, take me..out of my misery!!!) Showing impeccable good taste, the Hurons choose Duncan, who had purposely mistranslated Hawkeyes attempts to offer himself in exchange so that he would be taken instead. This touching gesture of last-minute redemption results in him being raked over the coals, with Cora shrieking What are they doing to Duncan?? (Great minds think alike: I asked the same thing at the beginning of the film when I realized they had transformed him into a rat!) In the true spirit of throwing someone an anchor when they're drowning, Hawkeye then uses his marksman to skills to.er.end his rivals pain.

  With only a few more main characters left to deal with in a film thats running overtime, Uncas is killed trying to rescue Alice, Alice jumps off a cliff (no, we don't know why), and Magua is killed by Chingachgook. With no further ado, Hawkeye and Cora smooch on the bluffs as the sun sets over the wilderness, and Chingachgook makes a few dour predictions about the future demographics of Appalachia since he is, evidently, The Last of the Mohicans. Or maybe hes just saying that to attach himself to The Wild Bill Hickok Show in the future. Its a non-issue.

  By now, you have probably realized Im not a major fan of this chick-flick-romp-in-the-woods. But even so, Im going to go the extra mile to say something nice about it. Ill admit that it does have some appealing visual features. Costuming is good, props are good, sets are good, and scenery is good. One scene that particularly stands out as a majestic display of old-fashioned pageantry was the parlay between Colonel Munro and General Montcalm in which both armies line up in their spit-and-polish best with colorful banners flying against the backdrop of lush forests, dark mountains, and a foreboding cloudy sky.

  Also, I must say I absolutely love the music track by Dougie MacLean entitled The Gael, which I first heard played by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. I think they did a much better job than the actual film rendition, and I feel the tune itself is a thousand times more inspirational than the motion picture to which it has been inextricably attached. Mores the pity; I want it to sign a petition to have it rehashed when someone takes the notion to create a good big-budget blockbuster set during the French and Indian War!

  As for any spiritual overtones, I suppose I could say that the main characters seem to have a belief in the afterlife, and Chingachgook does offer a memorable prayer to The Great Spirit for the repose of his sons soul. But thats small pickings in comparison with James Fennimore Coopers novel, which makes numerous references to faithfulness of the characters and their belief in the workings of providence. Traditional Christianity definitely takes a back seat to native spiritual practices in this rendering. While the film does not contain anything directly immoral (except perhaps gratuitous fight/torture scenes which can easily be skipped without missing out on what little plot exists), there isn't anything outstanding in the realm of virtue either.

  I guess Duncan sacrificing himself might have been a nice twist, if the rest of the plot hadnt been so lame. But the fact is it was so lame. Theres really no way around it. The romantic triangle totally underwhelmed me by its superficiality and predictability. It lacked the substance needed to sustain a would-be epic, especially because so many of the other characters had been made unsympathetic or downright detestable, and was bolstered by pathetic pop-music-generated dialogue. Acting was equally horrendous, with the noteworthy exception of Jodhi Mays dramatically intense facial expressions before taking her flying leap onto the trampoline below the papier-mch cliff in her role as Alice.

  I found it very hard to get past the obvious agenda being pushed in the movie, portraying the British as monsters with the French not much better. The Indians and American settlers, on the other hand, are portrayed as being victims of Imperialism who would live in peace and harmony if not for the intervention of the big-bad-big-wigs from Europe. In reality, Indian tribes were almost constantly fighting each other before and during the colonization of America.

  Furthermore, it was the white settlers who had as much, if not more, to gain from the wars of colonial expansion as their British rulers, and this was proven by their resentment of any attempt of British authorities to curtail their incursions into Indian lands. Trying to constantly pit the British and Americans against each other in the colonial period is simply overdone, and I do wish more motion pictures would decide to focus on the positive connections between Mother Country and her Colonies.

  I have no problem with an honest, critical analysis of European Imperialism and the class system it was built on. But it irks me to no end when self-righteous revisionists try to generalize and condemn whole swaths of people from a different time period because their views did not coincide with present-day political correctness and their customs relied more on ceremonial decorum than is currently fashionable in our jeans-and-tee-shirt society. Even the best ceremonial scenes from The Last of the Mohicans tend to be tinged with attitude of contempt for the ways of the past and the code of honor to which gentleman were taught to follow. By making it all seem stupid and shallow, the film has instantly lost touch with the past it aspires to represent.

  I am not a book purist, and am usually fairly lenient on film adaptations for their tweaking of original plots. After all, visual dramatization is a different art form from written novelization, and different considerations are needed to make it work. However, this particular film had me yelling at the TV almost the whole time, and I couldn't be bribed to watch it again. When movie producers try to completely reinvent the wheel by projecting modern perceptions into the past, vilifying characters we used to like, killing off others at random, and then introducing a synthetic romance to plug the holes in their cynical plot, I say the whole enterprise has gotten off message and its high time to toss the camera reels in a back-lot ceremonial fire with the incomparably luckless Duncan.",1400889600,3,12687,4.9217065166432254

So much about this movie that I love. The movie has a little bit of everything in it. I love that it was filmed during the French and Indian War, first and foremost. The plot of the story and clashing of cultures is what originally caught my eye when the movie originally came out. The romance and chemistry between the two main characters, Hawkeye (Day-Lewis) and Cora (Stowe) is breathtakingly undeniable.  The scenery...my goodness, the scenery is beautiful. The struggles, the betrayals, the loyalties of everyone keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, one phrase uttered by Hawkeye to Cora when they are under the waterfall, ""I will find you"". That one phrase stole my heart and at that instant a movie that I already knew I loved, became one of my all time favorites. I would recommend this to anyone who hadn't seen it.

It's both adventure and romance.  Daniel Day-Lewis is just great as the lead.  You feel like you are living in those uncertain times on the American frontier and it has sparked an interest for me  in reading more about that period.  The theme music is sweeping and majestic.  I often listen to clips of it at work when I need to escape the petty politics.  This movie is on a par with Dances with Wolves, if you liked that one.",1378857600,,600,4.294642857142857

The distinctive cover remains distinct from the other ""widescreen"" versions, except that this has ALSO been changed to widescreen, with the corresponding languages switched over to English and French, the languages of ALL of the other Region 1 DVDs.

I know of a teacher who has 'dysfunctional' teenage students that change their habits and open their mind to more about history after seeing this film.  He plays this and ""The New World"" film every year and students are asked to voice their feelings and ""open up"" as never before.  Often they continue speaking about what they saw and even their families and friends want to see this film.  The ""reality"" dawns on them and they become interested in class as never before.
(Daniel Day Lewis is ""Real"" as he recently was in ""Lincoln""....and the native Indian was in reality an ""Indian"" and able to ""Be a Mohican"".

2354154,5,B000A2WP7O,"Set 19 years before the American Revolution, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" describes the brutality-of-life in early colonial America.

With significant emphasis placed on the uneasy relationships between the English and early American frontiersmen and the alliance between the French and Huron Indian tribes, historical events of the times unfold through the lives of Hawkeye (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) and Cora (Madeleine Stowe), the daughter of the aristocratic Colonel Munro.

Hawkeye is the adopted son of a Mohican family, at odds with the British, but co-operative. When fate isolates him and Cora along an action packed trail, the drama unfolds.

Magua is the out-cast Huron tribesman out for revenge and swears to eat the heart of Cora's father. He soon becomes the enemy of Hawkeye.

The filming engulfs the majestic mountains and cathedral-like forests of colonial New York and Pennsylvania (more likely Kentucky and West Virginia).

It is a great American classic, which because of its popularity in Europe, helped establish literary authenticity for America. I must read for all Americans.",1354838400,,291,4.7254901960784315
2354190,1,B000A2WP7O,"Love the movie, but I hate the director's cut version of the LotM.  After Hawkeye jumps out the waterfall and begins running up the mountains, they have changed the musical score.  ugggh.

2354191,5,B000A2WP7O,"Great movie with fine acting by Daniel Day-Lewis.  The story does not really follow the book, but none the less is exciting and very viewable numerous times.

2354192,5,B000A2WP7O,"First and foremost, I must say that I absolutely love this movie! I could not find myself to take off any stars because I feel I would be doing an injustice to the magnificent actors and actresses that starred in it. 2 days before receiving the directors expanded version by mail, I watched the theatrical version through you tube (thank goodness for the generous soul who uploaded that version).  I completely and utterly agree with the masses, when they say, that the important lines that help create the movie are missing in this version.

It is very difficult to understand why Mr. Mann would choose to delete such monumental lines from the movie. Specifically referring to this scene:Hawkeye: He said ""Do not try to understand them"". Cora Munro: What? Hawkeye: Yes, and, ""do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense"".(I almost threw something at my flat screen while watching this version becasue this line was not in it!!!) A big portion of the movie is made up of picturesque scenes that complete this film, and those too were shortened by this version! In any case, I will definitely be buying the Definitive version",1353974400,41,1177,4.736585365853658

2354195,4,B000A2WP7O,"I had seen the theatrical version of this movie.  All I can say is ""WOW"".  Loved it!  The Director's cut, however, is somewhat different and has a musical change that takes away from one scene.  Having 'The Kiss' in the background of when Daniel Day Lewis is running up the slope makes that scene more moving than the Clannad song.  Both versions are great, but I would opt for the theatrical version.  However, it takes a bit of research and doing to get that version because it is only sold in the U.K. and must be 'hacked' to work on the U.S. players.  Worth the trouble, though.",1351900800,,582,4.383177570093458
2354196,5,B000A2WP7O,"We had the movie on VHS and when we watched it back in the 80's we said that we wanted to go to visit Chimney Rock, N.C.  This past Fall we did visit Chimney Rock.  What a beautiful, inspiring place.  When we came home we wanted to watch the movie so we ordered a DVD.  It was great to watch the movie and equate scenes with what we had actually seen.

But the seller sent a movie that was just like new. Seller shipped promptly and product was in great shape. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie: Don't worry too much about the ""R"" rating. There's no sex and no nudity. The fighting isn't bloody/gorey. It's far tamer than you'd see in crime/war tv shows nowadays.",1341705600,,451,4.445783132530121
2354216,5,B000A2WP7O,This was a very enjoyable DVD! I had seen the original movie in theater many years ago starring (I believe) Randolph Scott. I hadn't seen this movie with Daniel Day-Lewis before so it was quite the experience.

The love story is not the main theme of the book by James Fenimore Cooper (classic novelist). But, it is a good read and the movie is a good story.  The music score is fantastic.  You definitly want to keep this in your DVD library.",1335139200,,375,4.405797101449275

I found my copy to be excellent and the story, the cinematography, the music, and the acting as good as when I saw it in the theater back in 92. It still remains one of my favorite movies.",1334534400,,261,4.326530612244898
2354220,5,B000A2WP7O,"This is a movie which has been a favorite of mine. I didn't rent it but I found it in my house, watched it and enjoyed it.

The plot is about the proud daughter of an aristocratic British general and the warrior of the Mohicans named Hawkeye who was an adoptee, and the trials surrounding their fondness during a time of tempestuous circumstances, mostly the ongoing warring between them and the British, who end up being surrounded and flanked by the French and I won't give away the ending but it is a fast paced film that isn't boring and features some real beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed it enough that I would watch it a third time and I can say I highly recommend it.

2354222,5,B000A2WP7O,"Was ""Nathaniel"" 20 when he fought the French and American War with the Tomahawk and his eventual wife with the pistol, which then led to the formation of the militia known today as the NRA? I may have a bias here for a potential lost family member who began a tavern, which led to the civilians fighting for the Revolutionary War with George Washington. This is the beginning of America's brutal roots with Europe and the Native American Tribes. Nathaniel is known as Hawk-eye and holds a rifle steady, therefore, his adoptive Native American Father names him Long Rifle. The Chief has a son Nicholas and they are brothers so along with Nathaniel, they transport two daughters to their father in a war infested nation. The film never stops and is gripping with its ending. The Law is brutal and demonstrates the magnitude for an ""eye for an eye"" especially with the Chief Eagle with no judicial court.",1316649600,,901,4.708860759493671
