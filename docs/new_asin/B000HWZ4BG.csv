2645509,5,B000HWZ4BG,Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain are awesome together and I forgot how much I love this show!,1223683200,,87,4.176470588235294
2645510,3,B000HWZ4BG,"""Lois and Clark"" was a light-hearted comedy that centered more around the Clark Kent persona of the Superman sagas. As a superhero, Superman was always overladen with super powers and, as such, was a boor unless someone had the Kryptonite to go after him. I remember years ago, Superman had a race around the world against the Flash. The Flash had only one power, and that was extraordinary speed, but D.C. Comics could never bring themselves to give the race to the Flash, so they made it a draw--a cheap niggardly thing to do to poor Flash. Could not Superman have simply said, ""I'm fast, pal, but you're way out of my league!"" No, they couldn't even give the laurel wreath to poor Flash! Fortunately, in these seasons of Lois and Clark, a more lighthearted approach was taken.

""Smallville"" always bored the living daylights out of me. It was far too touchy-feely for my tastes and could have been full of bullies, field trips to the big city, practical jokes on farmers (having steel implements appear bent into pretzel shapes and left in various places in about town and the local environ), but that would have required more creativity than was available. It also could have been set back in the early 40s, which would have given it a fun backdrop.

Anyway, Dean Cain was great, as well as Miss ""they're real"" Hatcher. This is quite a deal. If you've never seen the show, lucky you. This and Stargate SG-1 (4 stars) are worth checking out.",1220918400,4,1444,4.63671875
2645511,4,B000HWZ4BG,"The series is just plain good fun, harmless for kids and can be watched by the family, a worthy continuation of the Superman legacy.",1211846400,,132,4.541666666666667
2645512,5,B000HWZ4BG,"Well, Ive watched all 4 boxsets in their entirety, all 88 episodes, including the bonus material.  Most fans love the show so I won't get into why its so wonderful and the great chemistry between Dean and Teri, blah blah blah.  Lets get right on to it.  Whats the best material and what, if any, are the problems plaguing the boxsets?

  There are 3 things that are completely worth your attention, and the majority of it is on season 1.  The commentary for the pilot, and the 30 minute looking back documentary.  The other commentary is on season 2 and its on Deans Season's Greedings episode.  Aside from that, the effort put forth as a whole for bonus material on these 4 boxsets is pathetic.  There is plenty of other stuff out there that they could of included.  ABC promos for every episode exist as well as other spots that appeared to promote the show, and none of it appears on these boxsets.  There is also no comments on the wedding arc in season 3, and nothing to explain the shows untimely demise in the 4th season boxset.  It's simply pathetic.

The 4th box needed to explain what was planned for season 5 had the show continued, and none of it is explained at all.

  How is the transfer and sound??  Seasons 2,3, and 4 look fantastic all throughout.  However, season 1 gets the lowest grade in the video department.  The pilot, though crisp, has all sorts of source defects and dirt present.  Also, several episodes following the pilot, look too soft and muddy in its picture and detail and color.  This significantly improves though by the time you reach the latter half of disc 3 and on to disc 4.  The sound is standard; nothing too impressive.

  Finally, lets talk about the packaging and any other problems related to the dvd's themselves.  The covers work for me, though id say season 1 is the best.  It has a chrome appearance that is just really impressive.  All the others are a dull cardboard.  What they did inside each box has driven me nuts since season 1 was released.  The discs are packaged practically stacked on top of each other.  They overlap; which means that if you want to get to disc 2, you have to pry disc 1 up out of the box in order to get to disc 2.  That is just ridiculous, and for those who aren't especially careful with their purchase, it can be really easy to scratch the discs in this format.  While my wife and I have been watching the series in order, I just remove disc 1 from the box and lay it aside in another case so that I have a space freed up for the other discs in the boxset so I can get to everything easier.  That has worked for me.  Though it is annoying that I have to move discs around in the first place.  I would have preferred the WB package them like a book with one disc per tray, but thats just me.  Also, the first 2 seasons feature a moving main menu screen which was really impressive.  The WB then decided that for the last 2 seasons they would cut costs and use a static main menu screen; STUPID AND INCONSISTENT!!  All 4 should match.  They really dropped the ball with their season 4 package in that it was reported that many packages contained duplicate discs!!  One fellow had to exchange his 6 times until he found a package that had a disc 1 in it!!  Fortunately my copy had no such issues.  However I had to exchange it one time due to a severelly damaged disc that I hadnt even touched.

  Overall a great package, a great show.  The extras that are there are good but missing tons of stuff.  The packaging is less than I would want, but go buy this anyway.  If you are careful with the discs, you shouldnt have any problem.",1166227200,28,3613,4.327354260089686
2645513,5,B000HWZ4BG,"Ok, Let's get the review right here.  DONT BUY THIS SET!!! at least not while it is priced at $180 dollars.  Right now, Dec. 2006 - Amazon offers each season seperately for $29.99 except the 4th which is $41.99.  All together about $132.

  I think that it is about right at $40/season because it is a very enjoyable show.  I had been waiting since Smallville came out to see this one again and have been waiting for the DVD's.  I remember waiting ever week for the next episode when it was on TV.  Season 1 was my favorite and season 4 got a little too corny but all in all the whole series was great.  I loved Terri as Lois.  I hate the Lois of Smallville (no chemistry).  I think Terri Hatcher and Dean Cain had great chemistry. This has a lot of fun in it compared to Smallville

  I'm giving the stars based on the content not the price.  Perhaps in time, they will wize up and offer it at a lower price, at least the same price as the other seasons, so you can't base the review totally on price as that may change.  Being realistic the show is maybe a 4 1/2. but I gave it 5 because of the low stars currently.  If you look at the reviews on each season seperately, you will see that others agree.  Currently the amazon ratings are 5 stars for season 1 with 262 reviews, 4 1/2 for season 2,3 and 4.",1165017600,14,1305,4.107142857142857
2645514,1,B000HWZ4BG,"Sure, the retail price for the four CDs together is $240 so $180 sounds like a good value. Except that Amazon is selling the first three CDs at $30 apiece and the fourth at $41 which only adds up to $131. Why in the world would someone pay an extra $50 just to buy all four at once?

The CDs themselves are great - no problem there. I just think someone in the Amazon marketing division went a little wonky with this pricing and no one has caught it.

Seriously - save yourself some dough. Until the price for all four CDs drops below the cost of buying them separately this is NO bargain.",1163894400,18,589,4.157894736842105

2645725,1,B000HWZ4BG,"Okay first there is serious problem with play back.

3 sets all with the same play back problem.

film  burn marks, or pilaxtion ranging from large to very small barely noticeable  amounts(where parts of the picture will be  missing)

This is a very popular item
so  Warner brothers studios should just  remaster it to blu ray any way's

second, packaging is horrible, stacking 6  dvd's on top of each other.
means  scratching of the  disks.
 they often come loose during shipping which means 9/10 you will receive a damaged  product or scratched  disks..

3rd the shipping method doesn't have enough bubble wrap to  keep the disks  from popping out of the case.
and often comes all four  seasons stacked together which  causes the disk to come loose in the cases.
 which again damages the dvd.
..
so 1 star for the product itself.

as  for  based on a 90's show rating 4 star's",1437350400,5,878,4.588235294117647

However, the manufacturer chose to stack the disks on top of each other over one spindle per dvd case.
This led to several disks dislodging during shipment and sliding around with some minor scratches.
Cheap, cheap, especially since they claim this is almost $300 retail (reduced of course to under $80.

Amazon shipping was perfect. I think it was a combination of the manufacturer's cheap packaging and the shipping agent's style of handling (?) products.

2645902,4,B000HWZ4BG,"Own four seasons of Lois & Clark in one collection (all 87 episodes* from 1993 to 1997). Overall, the picture and audio quality are good but remastered episodes would be great in a future release. Some special features, such as commentaries, interviews and documentaries are available for each season although more could have been added to explain what was planned for Season 5 before the untimely cancellation of the series. There remain some loose ends story-wise that would make for an interesting future documentary (like many great TV series that ended before their time). While I loved the chemistry between Hatcher and Cain for the entire run, I felt the first two seasons were the best because after Clark let the cat out of the bag at the end of season 2 the writing fizzled out somewhat. The tension of Clark's secret identity while pursuing Lois made for great viewing. However, I would have loved to see the show continue and if they hadn't moved the timeslot we probably would have gotten another season or two.

2645903,5,B000HWZ4BG,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime.
 One of my favorites is Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. I missed this show the first time around because on the night its pilot was aired, I watched a more highly-publicized pilot. I was hooked after watching the reruns once, then again and again. Then, when the DVDs came out I went out and bought them and watched all four seasons several more times.
This show features brilliant color schemes reminiscent of the original color comics. Teri Hatcher, brilliant, scheming, but sometimes bumbling, is delectable as the best Lois Lane ever. Dean Cain is a strong, yet sensitive Clark Kent/Superman. Kents parents are credible characters, as are Lane Smith as Perry White and Justin Whalen as Jimmy Olson.
The bad guys are familiar and diabolic. The story lines are intense.
This show truly reflects the high-spirited optimism of the old comic books, as opposed to the new Superman and Batman movies, which are so dark you can hardly see them without a flashlight. In my opinion this show should have endured fourteen seasons instead of four.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10.

2646005,2,B000HWZ4BG,"I loved the series and the DVD's I received are great, but the key words here are ""recieved"".  I ordered the entire series and only received seasons 1-3.  I got reimbursed for less than the 4th season was worth and had to order the 4th season separately.  Unfortunately, by the time you figured in shipping and the additional cost of the 4th season, it would have been cheaper to order the entire series from someone else.  Order with care from Amazon providers is all I can say.",1355616000,2,479,4.471264367816092

2646010,5,B000HWZ4BG,"It is difficult to understand how the Superman saga
has lasted so long.  But it most certainly has and
this run of dozens of 45 minute episodes does entertain.
The casting and production was superb.  You can watch
Lois Lane and Clark Kent drifting into romance and
then into marriage.  Yes, she does work out Clark's
secret identity, but it takes quite a while.  My wife
and I are both delighted with it.  Recommended!",1344643200,,418,4.594594594594595
2646011,4,B000HWZ4BG,"Since the production of ""Lois and Clark"" in the mid-90's many forget how far computer generated graphics have come and how almost every TV uses them seamlessly. Watching the show again it was amazing to see how well the producers did with the FX on TV's notoriously low budgets. Hey, it's Superman, the FX have to be done right.
  Something I had forgotten was how well Teri Hatcher did as Lois Lane and watching how her Lois and Clark came together.
  The discs look and sound great on my 60"" home theater system. I highly recommend the series, especially the H.G. Wells episodes, for anyone looking to spend some quality time being entertained.",1341360000,,646,4.6902654867256635
2646012,5,B000HWZ4BG,The item arrived on time with all of the dvds there. All of them worked properly and weren't damaged. I loved the series and I am glad that I found them for a decent price for all four seasons on dvd.,1333238400,,200,3.902439024390244

2646014,5,B000HWZ4BG,I got the whole series for 50bucks!!!!!!This series is awesome Dean Cain and Terri Hatcher fine behind made and awesome duo for this series. the Dvd boxes are amazing it features a full menu on it that details every episode. the viewing quailty is amazing for it being a 1990's series on dvd.there are some mistakes but its no big deal. i saw many companies on amazon selling this for 140-160 bucks but this is the best deal ever.,1327276800,,430,4.455696202531645
2646035,5,B000HWZ4BG,"I loved this show; to me, Superman was always supposed to be that perfect good hearted person and in this show he was. Dean Cain was fantastic, you could truly see the good in his eyes. I tried to get into Smallville but until the end of the show didn't really care for it; I had a hard time buying Tom Welling as a good person his eyes were cold and vain most of the time. Maybe that was the intent of the creators to make him more human. To me Clark Kent was supposed to be very modest and even though he was Superman was not supposed to think he was one. This show accomplished that.  Teri Hatcher made a great Lois Lane also; all the characters on the show were great. I loved them all.",1313107200,,690,4.036496350364963
2646036,4,B000HWZ4BG,"This was probably my first exposure to Superman as a kid, so I'm biased. I bought the box set cuz it was only $84 for 4 seasons, averaging $21 per season. Considering most shows run for $50 per season, I just had to jump on the deal. Looking at what it currently costs ($240), I'm glad I took it. To be honest, I wouldn't have bought this if it cost anything over $100, but it's good to have a piece of my childhood.",1290384000,,416,4.024096385542169
2646037,5,B000HWZ4BG,"I ordered the complete DVD set of all four seasons of Lois & Clark. I hadn't watched the series for quite a few years, so I was thrilled to have them all together. The episodes are great, a mixture of comedy, action, and romance. The chemistry between Dean Cain (Clark) and Teri Hatcher (Lois) is amazing. The only thing that I didn't have such good luck with was that some of the episodes on the DVDs would freeze or be kind of ""static-y"", so I don't know if that was just with the particular ones I ordered or if that's a universal thing. Other than that, I definitely recommend buying the series.",1262304000,,599,4.357142857142857
2646038,5,B000HWZ4BG,"I purchased this because I remember watching this show as a younger kid and making sure I tuned in every time it was on. I even enjoyed re-watching it now that I'm older. Although a bit more cheesy, I found myself finishing a season in just a few days because I didn't want to turn it off.

I love Dean Cain as Superman and Teri Hatcher was great as Lois.",1246924800,3,355,4.071428571428571
2646039,4,B000HWZ4BG,"A great television show the whole family can enjoy. I grew up watching this show and was thrilled to see it on DVD but not the price. My patience paid off this past week when BEST BUY lowered the price dramatically.

In fact you can buy ALL 4 seasons for UNDER $72 (With MA Tax 5%) and I also took advantage of a free shipping offer. The price is half of Amazon and still over $30 cheaper than other merchants selling it brand new. So save your money and enjoy some great nostalgia.

I would recommend this item to any Superman fans.",1245110400,,533,4.215686274509804

2646041,5,B000HWZ4BG,"These are great action and love stories. Some episodes seem a little far fetched, almost corny, but its origin is a comic book after all.
