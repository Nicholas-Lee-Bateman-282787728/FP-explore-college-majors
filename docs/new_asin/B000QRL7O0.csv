8197180,5,B000QRL7O0,"I am an American living in Canada and this series was the perfect way to introduce American History and values to my Canadian/American daughter. We were so sorry when it went off the air (way before Amazon was an everyday word). We kept fond memories of the show- her first fish was named Henri- but soon forgot its name until an Internet friend mentioned it. Eureka! She is 13 and we have bought it, but at the much lower price elsewhere on Amazon. (less than $50?). If you have kids this is the perfect way to inspire a love of History and country. For God, For Country and For Liberty Kids! ;) p.s. and it is never a boring preachy sort of show; they keep it interesting, hence the name ""kids"".",1331424000,,697,4.32824427480916
8197181,5,B000QRL7O0,"This series is one of the few programs  PBS hasn't preformed a historical revision on. I have been amazed by Liberty's Kids historical accuracy as well as its ability to mesmerize my 5th grade public school students year after year. They clamor for more when the series is done, and disappointed when they find out that there are no more episodes. Students have stated that ""this is really cool"", and shouts of ""I love history!"", have resounded in my classroom. I always show the series  preceded by Walt Disney's Excellent DVD,  Johnny Tremain and the Sons of Liberty (completed when Walt Disney had control of content and went to great expense to research the history of the theme for accuracy BEFORE he created a historical movie like this one, an unashamed plug for Johnny Tremain).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Tremain/dp/B00005JM6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Tremain</a>.

  Liberty's Kids does a good job of demonstrating the conflicting feelings colonists had deciding whether to remain loyal to Britain or the new Patriotic movement, and how 2/3 of the continental population finally decided to choose LIBERTY, Freedom, and the American Way. The episode of The Boston Tea Party helps citizens understand the past as well as the current climate permeating our country.  Well Done!",1271635200,,1348,5.578431372549019

The complete series, but at a much better price!",1224201600,,250,12.88888888888889
8197183,5,B000QRL7O0,"I've loved this show since I first saw it back in early 2003.  During AP US History, this show actually helped incite curiosity and understanding for the complex period that is the American Revolution.  It's also the series that made me curious into looking into American History deeper, and reading up on the finer details of America's birth.

The timeline, which features events from the Boston Massacre to the ratification for the US Constitution, is actually quite accurate -- they merely paint into the story the fictional characters of James (the teenage American-patriot), Sarah (the unsure British-loyalist), and Henri (the younger French-sidekick) alongside the historical Founding Fathers.

That said, this is the 6-disc DVD available from the PBS store for teachers.  A ridiculous price yes, but it won't be for long.  Shout Factory will be releasing DiC's complete series on DVD once again this fall, October 14th to be exact, and the price will be signifigantly cheaper, in the more familiar range of about $59.99!!

So, yes be sure to buy this series, it's great fun for the whole family and you'll actually learn loads from it . . . just be sure to get the better priced one. :)",1214179200,9,1193,4.935
8197184,5,B000QRL7O0,"As an 18 year old kid I've seen first hand how apathetic kids are about history. I, on the other hand, love the subject, especially American history, and am in no way embarrased to watch this show (it's a great show). However, if rockyourworld could just lower the price of the set by about $550 then it would actually be within my reach to buy it. Just thought I'd suggest it.",1202601600,3,377,4.323943661971831
8197185,5,B000QRL7O0,"This is one of the best ways to introduce American History to children. My son found this series a few months ago and he liked it so much, we've had to DVR it and see every episode in order. Additionally, speaking as a middle school history teacher, this series is a very accurate portrayal of the events, so I have begun recording the series for my students and they LOVE IT!!",1197590400,4,377,4.323943661971831
8197186,5,B000QRL7O0,Truly an exciting as well as educational experience for all-my 14 year old enjoyed it just as much as my 7-year old. It was hard for me to take my eyes away too!,1182038400,,161,3.909090909090909
