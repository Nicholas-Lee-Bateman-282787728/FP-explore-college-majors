7986806,4,B00008T40L,"A classic piece of ""Goon Show""-style insanity.  Especially interesting because the bumbling detective played by Sellers seems a clear forerunner to Inspector Clouseau, down to the trench coat and hat (though without the French accent here).  Also watch for (or rather listen for) what I'm pretty sure is Sellers doing the narration in the beginning in a very funny American accent.

One warning - the video quality is not very good, which I don't think is the fault of the transfer but probably the state of the original film by the time it was put on tape.  Bright areas in particular seem to be often washed out in white.  Not too much of a problem, really, though there is one scene where Sellers' character is communicating with a silent film actor by writing on a piece of paper and holding it up and it's very hard to make out what he's written.",1215043200,2,851,4.572368421052632
