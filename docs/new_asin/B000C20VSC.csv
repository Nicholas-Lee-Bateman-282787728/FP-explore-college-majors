8095309,5,B000C20VSC,When I was young I loved the Berenstain Bears now my kids read their books and watch their movies! They teach great lessons and it's wholesome watching for the whole family!,1387238400,,173,4.612903225806452
8095310,2,B000C20VSC,"This video has some really good episodes, though we like a couple of other DVD's better.  Probably is partly due to the condition of the video when we received it.  We ordered a used video which isn't the first time, however, this one came in a case with the center holder broken and the disk was sliding around in the case.  When we opened it, there was a couple of major scratches on the disk and we couldn't view the last 3 episodes.  A piece of tape on the center of the disk would have held it in place during shipment.  Too bad, love those bears!",1343692800,,552,4.169811320754717
8095311,4,B000C20VSC,"My daughter is 6 and loves Berenstain Bears.  The stories are cute and don't ""hit her over the head"" with the moral of the story, but she gets it.  Love the characters and it is nice to see that the shows our oldest watched are still around for our youngest.",1325721600,,258,4.14
8095312,5,B000C20VSC,"My grandson of 15 months loves this series from the early 2000.  The actors are upbeat and engaging with happy giggles dispersed throughout the wonderful lessons learned.  I don't know if he's learned any lessons at his age, but maybe subconciously it will sink in.  He will not ride in the car without screaming for the Berenstain Bears dvds.  I have the whole series with these same actors.  The older versions are more subdued and he doesn't stay with it as he does with this group of actors.  There is a catchy song and a happy upbeat nature to this group.  I've tried Elmo dvds, but he actually prefers the Berenstain bears.  It's strange, but he loves them!",1267056000,3,663,4.559322033898305
8095313,5,B000C20VSC,"Just as I remember when I was a kid, the Berenstain Bears are great movies with great messages. Love the short story way it's told so kids don't get bored with one long story.",1265760000,2,175,4.176470588235294
