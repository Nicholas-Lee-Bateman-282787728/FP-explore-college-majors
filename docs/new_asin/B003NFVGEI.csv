4157672,3,B003NFVGEI,"i didn't get the correct movie instead 0f john deer action 2 i got John deer earth moving action,...sneaky or simple error was still a good movie",1361145600,,145,4.407407407407407
4157673,3,B003NFVGEI,"We have the first John Deere Earth Mover Action dvd and my 3 year old absolutely loves it. It has great songs and interesting animation. I expected the 2nd Earth Mover Action dvd to be similar, but it is more of documentary, not as animated. Instead of the animated trucks and figures they have Charlie the dog counting and doing tricks. I gave this 3 stars because my 3 year old will watch this one, but he fast forwards through the dog scenes and the boring parts and ends up watching the backhoes and the theme song.",1359676800,,519,4.360824742268041
4157674,5,B003NFVGEI,My son literally watches the part 1 to this series a few times a day so when I saw the part 2 we had to have it. My son is very energetic but these John Deere Earth Mover Action DVD's will hold his attention. He just loves Construction vehicles and justvwatchesvin amazement. The songs are very catchy and not annoying. They'll can purchase the CD's with the music from the DVD's. Highly recommend this if you have fans of Tractors or Construction vehicles.,1356566400,2,457,4.518072289156627

They have both always had an avid interest in construction machinery, but this DVD introduces forestry machines, which they have never seen before.  And it is their favorite part!
