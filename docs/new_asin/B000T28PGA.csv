It was from this material that the syndicated Benny Hill Shows which ran in the U.S. were compiled. If you purchase this set, you will have the complete, original & unedited source of all the Benny Hill shows - including lots of bits and pieces that never made it across the pond.
This ""megaset"" is also a terrific bargain. Buying the volumes individually would cost you over $100 more! I recommend it highly for Benny fans.",1198540800,70,503,4.6

2893598,3,B000T28PGA,"Benny Hill was originally named Alfie Hill, and when he went into show business he took the name of Jack Benny because he used the old-time vaudeville humor in his show.

So what was his claim to fame?  Benny Hill's show had slapstick, verbal jokes...but mostly a lot of sexual humor.  Indeed, every woman I talked to didn't like the show, despite Benny Hill's claim that ""the women retained their dignity while the men looked like idiots"".

Looking over the show overall, Benny Hill was a talented performer, and he could be quite clever and hilarious at times.  But he could be bad as well, some of his humor being dated, or funny only to Britons.  Worst of all, he repeated himself an awful lot, evidently reusing many of the same jokes each season.  Benny Hill was funny when you watched one episode at a time, but he's not someone you can watch for hours.",1407110400,2,860,4.509677419354839

2893613,5,B000T28PGA,"The late great English comedian, Benny Hill, is arguably one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived. He wrote, scripted, composed and directed the comedy gags and songs which kept generations of TV viewers laughing for 20 years.  The snazzy theme music, funny gags, song performances, and raunchly scantily clad women have kept us entertained on the TV screen.  I remember, as a kid, always looking forward to the late night broadcast of the Benny Hill Show.  This DVD set is like an anthology of the Benny Hill Show, showcasing complete episodes of the show from beginning to the end.  It's like taking a walk down memory lane, reliving all those funny and laughing moments again.

2893626,5,B000T28PGA,"Benny Hill was definitely the King of British Comedy of his time and without question, must have inspired the Monty Python group.  His self-deprecating and impish style can be compared to no one else.  Some people might consider him sexist, but he was actually pointing fun at the male of the species who first goes after the woman, but ends up being very unhappily chased by her, instead.  The films present a wonderful time trip to an era of wide lapels, wide ties, bell bottom trousers, short mini skirts and long boots on a bevy of lovely young ladies.

2893632,5,B000T28PGA,This is a great set with superior editing and formating.  The quality is far better than I remember it in the 70's.  Every episode and disc is superb and Hill's style of comedy is in a class by itsself.  Definitely a must for any true fan.,1252800000,,239,4.1521739130434785

2893634,3,B000T28PGA,"The set when you buy all the boxes is missing the Australian episode which is rather famous.  Frankly, the box set is as close as you are going to get to a complete set and would deserve ***** stars but the packaging and title is clearly misleading.

Growing up watching Benny Hill in the late 70's and early 80's when he became real big in the US, I had forgotten how clever his comedy was.  Some of his skits might be considered sexist or racist stereotyping, but you know, it's just darn funny stuff.  I've only seen a little bit of the 'extras', but they seem very insightful into the life of this comedic genius.  Benny's timing and delivery of jokes is something to be studied by all aspiring comedic actors.  This set is a must for anyone into comedy shows or British humor!",1242086400,,631,4.358974358974359

2893638,3,B000T28PGA,"Benny Hill is a master of the bawdy, burlesque gag: ""Oye, ya don't get many of those to a pound!"" His mocking innocence and mastery of the double entendre (as the Pythons would say: ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink"") make this collection of Benny's shows a must have for anyone who appreciates Hill's contribution to the development of humor in Britain and around the world.

The special features reveal an interesting person behind the clown mask. His ""Biography"" episode provides an insight into the life of a person dedicated to his craft at the cost of all else.",1236729600,11,559,4.762886597938144
2893639,4,B000T28PGA,"This DVD set is a dream come true and a must have! Benny Hill is non stop laughs.  Benny takes satire, relevant topics, and cultural themes of his era and combines it with sexual humor. This set covers his career and evolution of his comedy. To anyone who does not know who Benny Hill is, I would say he is a mix of Johnny Carson, Richard Prior, Jim Carey, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Jerry Seinfeld. Benny Hill is the Sean Connery of comedy, others who came after him are good, but there will always be one true original.",1232150400,2,530,4.353535353535354

2893641,5,B000T28PGA,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my stepfather. The first DVD was playing in the living room about 14 seconds after the wrapping was torn off. So many of the sketches are timeless and universally funny. We sat around for about an hour while laughing like crazy.

What's great about the Benny Hill DVD set is that it's all about remembering and appreciating the comedy sketches of legend. Leave any concerns of 1080p and 7.1 surround sound at the door and just enjoy the show.

Some other notes:
There seem to be two sets of Benny Hill DVD's on Amazon. This is the one that hasn't been sterilized to some ridiculous post Janet Jackson Superbowl level of boring.

There are a couple sketches that will not make any sense because they're making jokes about stuff specific to English pop-culture of the time. Thankfully the DVD is sectioned off per skit so you can just skip it.",1230508800,10,882,4.569620253164557

2893643,5,B000T28PGA,"A staple of late night TV in the 70s and 80s, these uncut Thames TV TBHS episodes are a treasure.  You won't completely appreciate Benny without watching how he produced the show from start to finish, unlike the chopped half-hours syndicated here.

It's a shame that, after making Britain laugh for 2 decades, and at the pinnacle of his popularity in the USA, some Thames TV weasels in suits canceled the show after caving in to feminist groups that perhaps shouted louder to advertisers than the audience laughed.  This probably helped to steal Benny's talent from us forever too prematurely.

If you know Benny's humour, he, or one of his none-too-attractive male co-stars, almost always ended up as the butt of the joke, while the women almost always won.  Once you stop rolling on the floor laughing, read his bittersweet biography by Margaret Forwood (out of print, but available on the Internet used).  Benny simply lived for his show and for entertaining us.",1219276800,3,965,4.889570552147239
2893644,5,B000T28PGA,I have finished about half. I had never seen the originals. Best taken in small doses. I get DVDs mostly for the commentaries and this had an excellent life of Benny(Alfred). Sad. Insights into corporate management etc.  Some slight activity in the upper corners occasionally but that may be the machine I am using and have seen them on others DVDs. However not exactly family fare by current US standards.,1215561600,2,406,4.8
2893645,5,B000T28PGA,"I have fond memories of this show from my childhood, so when I saw this box set I had to grab it.  And - what can I say?  The Benny Hill Show is funny stuff.  His songs are clever, and who can forget the trademark chase sequences to the tune of ""Yakety Sax""?

Some have said that Hill's humor is sexist - however, it is not demeaning to women at all.  Nearly every time Benny himself, in the form of the ""dirty old man,"" randy doctor, et cetera, is the butt of the joke.

The video quality is not the best, and in fact some episodes are in black and white.  I'm sure this is because of the quality of the original masters.  In any case, this set is quite watchable.  Also, note that it includes the complete run of shows he did for Thames TV, which are the ones that were repackaged for overseas markets, but not the preceding BBC shows.",1210809600,25,837,4.117283950617284

If you've watched all the U.S. material originally shown on PBS, then you've probably seen the bulk of this but still it's nice to have in one package. It's fairly well indexed so you can find specific sketches when needed.

Special features are spread across disks. They are nice to see at least once and help clear up some of what happened when during the whole show's run.",1208649600,3,595,4.6571428571428575

Be warned that the audio/video quality is rather poor since the masters was on video and not on film. The retouching you can do is somehow limited !

There is no other audio tracks except the original (English UK). There is no subtitle either in case you ask. But anyway, a lot of sketches are speechless. So ;

Even if the audio track is limited to the original,
Even if there is no subtitle of whatever language,
Even if the video quality is poor.

It is THE complete collection and most important uncut. There are bonus and extras and they are ok, it is just not important to me since I buy the boxset for the tv episodes.",1208131200,4,676,4.2578125

8207554,5,B000T28PGA,In the late 1970's I was introduced to Benny Hill in the US when he became popular here. And if I remember I thought he was funny. But probably like a lot of my early interests I didn't entirely understand them. But 2017 his name popped up again. I just didn't seem to care for him since the early 1980's and thought he wasn't funny at all.  Well this dvd box set is a revelation to now my middle age years where I understand at least 80 LOL percent of what's going on in the shows but some I find funny as hell and completely innovated and ahead of his time. There's just a lot in here that have caught me off guard in terms of what he would do next I would be amazed. People have put him down for all kinds of reasons but really humor these days for a most part I find sickening and not funny.
