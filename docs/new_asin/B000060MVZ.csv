It might okay if you don't actually think about it. Poor acting. Falls out of the framing device too early.",1408233600,,240,4.333333333333333

Trapped as a full time caretaker, Sara considers leaving Jim until she discovers a million dollar life insurance policy.",1391472000,,358,5.280701754385965

1682020,4,B000060MVZ,"I've always been a fan of Erika Eleniak since her Playboy and Baywatch days. I think overall,her best movie is Chasers with Tom Berenger. This movie isn't bad. It's got a complex plot and an ending that maybe Hitchcock would have dreamed up sooner or later. In fact i gave it 4 stars for the twist at the end.

Erika sadly shows no 'flesh' in this flick but like i said,it's a pretty decent story.",1131494400,14,397,4.293333333333333
1682021,3,B000060MVZ,"Not a bad film, good story and a thick plot.
Not sure what to make of Erika in this film. She seem a little bored and couldn't be bothered with it!!!
Rent it first and then buy if you like it",1063152000,7,191,3.682926829268293
1682022,2,B000060MVZ,Well the most important issue is that Erika Eleniak never takes her clothes off during the whole movie.  That was quite a let down.,1035331200,31,131,4.458333333333333

7957543,1,B000060MVZ,"Very, very poorly made movie. Didn't like anything about it - the plot was tiring, the end was pretty much predictable. Unrelated scenes and unconvincing characters. Would strongly recommend you to skip that one if your time worth anything to you.",1429142400,,247,5.048780487804878
7957544,4,B000060MVZ,"If there is a moral to this story, it's ""read the fine print"".  The plot is fine.  The acting is fine.  But what make the movie enjoyable to watch is the fine actresses on the cast.

The story begins when the younger sister, Amber, receives a call telling her that Sara had died.  She returns home to find her dysfunctional mother grieving.  We learn that the mother doesn't work and depend solely on her daughters for support.  Sara left that life of poverty but Amber stayed behind to take care of the mother.  So this serves as the setup story, something akin to a frame story.  The story within the story begins when Amber finds her sister's diary.  As she reads through Sara's diary, it becomes apparent that things were not as they seemed in her sister's life.  The girls grew up in poverty.  Sara used her beauty to land a man with plenty of money.

Shortly after Sara's marriage to Jim, his disabled daughter moves in with them.  Sara basically stays at home all day, taking care of the disabled Nicki.  Jim starts treating her with disrespect.  Meanwhile, a lawyer friend of Jim's starts to seduce the lonely Sara.  The two work out a plan to arrange an accident for Jim to cash in on his life insurance policy.  After the accident, they meet with his agent and learn that there is a ""second-to-die"" clause in the policy.  Meaning that for the policy to pay, Sara also has to die.  The beneficiary would be Nicki.  There is also a requirement in Jim's will that Sara gets the house, but only if Nicki stays with her.  Needless to say, things did not go as planned. That's the fine print in the policy.

Meanwhile, at the present, Amber's life becomes steadily intolerable.  The mother, no longer able to rely on a regular support check from Sara, becomes even more bitter towards Amber.  Amber's boyfriend leaves her for New York.  We learn that Amber works as a waitress in a bar.  Amber continues to read the diary, unable to put it down.

In the story within the story, Sara's life becomes even more complicated when a nosy detective starts nosing around and asking questions.  Detective Grady is an old man, well past retirement age.  Under pressure from his captain to close the case and to retire, Grady sets out to learn what happened to Jim Bratchett.  A veteran of the department, he has known Sara Morgan since her high school years.

In any case, there is no need to state here just how beautiful Erika Eleniak (Sara) is.  I would say that Kimberly Rowe (Amber) is just as beautiful.  Both were terrific.  It really is too bad that we have not seen much of Kimberly Rowe lately.  Colleen Camp plays Cynthia, Sara's nosy neighbor.  And Brooke Davis plays the invalid, Nicki.  Veteran actor Paul Winfield plays Grady and John Wesley Shipp is Jim Bratchett.",1424908800,,2774,4.563008130081301
