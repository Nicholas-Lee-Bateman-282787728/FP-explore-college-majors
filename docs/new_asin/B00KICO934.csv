8659223,5,B00KICO934,"LaGuardia Airport, LGA, the first major airport within the boroughs of New York City, was opened and dedicated on October 15, 1939. It was constructed with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration of the Roosevelt administration. Initially it served land based aircraft and the Pan Am clippers which landed on the adjacent water and used the Marine Air Terminal, which remains standing today. LaGuardia Airport has languished from lack of infrastructure improvement for many years now. A new control tower replacing the 1962 tower was finally constructed and became operational on October 9, 2010. But, terminals, runways, taxiways, and other vitals sorely needed attention. The passenger terminals themselves were the most outdated structures. And considering the daily operations at this number three New York City airport the situation was even more unsatisfactory. Construction has now commenced under a plan that was announced on July 27, 2015 for an estimated 4 to 5.5 billion dollar in cost complete rehabilitation and new construction of the passenger terminal facilities which will also increase the number of gates available for the airlines. The new terminal will be moved 600 feet closer to the Grand Central Parkway, a highway which fronts and parallels the airport and thus will greatly add air side space for gate facilities and taxiways resulting in more than two additional miles of taxiways. Aircraft will be able to taxi under new overhead walkways from the main terminal to various gates. Tarmac space will also be greatly expanded. New multi-story car parks will be built consolidating existing ones and making more efficient use of the space available. No immediate extension of the two runways is planned. However, the winter operations as detailed by this video will not be greatly affected. Winter weather in New York City can be very cold, rainy, icy, and snowy with all of the difficulties that these conditions cause for aircraft operation. This video can be viewed as timely as these winter operations will remain much the same.",1479168000,,2068,5.2507552870090635
8659224,5,B00KICO934,"Lets start with some footage shot inside the terminals looking out the window to the tarmac.  Watch some deicing going on that makes the planes kinda dirty.  Planes parking and movement on ground. people talking and bells ringing and toss in some coughing sounds and kids and babies.  We will see a Spirit airplane with ugly paint job.  The engine startups are cool.  I wish you could turn on sub titles and see the names and types of the airplane or something like that.
Other key features are lots and lots and lots and lots of take off and landings from separate areas around LGA.  Often with muddled ATC comm.  I like it.  Car horns, highway and runway traffic and jets roaring in your ears.  I especially love the snow footage and watching the planes disappear into the white out sky.
Lots of unique livery's such as NYFD painted jet blue plane (painted red)  and sports team logos.  Trump 757 too!
four hours of amazing LGA action.  Awesome.  My only wish was perhaps 30 - 40 minutes of an airport terminal, grounds tour and perhaps interviews with key staff.  Airport manager and or airport employees.  Just know the winter aircrafts are the focus here and don't expect to see anything else but jets!  Thanks Just planes I love this addition to my collection :)  I will watch this often or just leave it on in background for ambiance while I sleep or do things at home.  One last thing my kitty cat is captivated by this video and watch's the whole movie from her couch.  its calming for animals too.",1408060800,,1507,4.514814814814815
