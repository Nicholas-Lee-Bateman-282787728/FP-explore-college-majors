3883384,4,B002A5KXIC,"The high And The Mighty,Airport were good movies. this one is kind of iffy. the story lines of the passengers were stinkie but,the movie is saved by outstanding performances by the principal actors. The collision scene was P.U.! and the landing used miniatures that fooled no one.",1363824000,,280,4.9787234042553195
3883385,4,B002A5KXIC,"One of the many wannabes that the success of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY left in its wake. A Navy jet with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Troy Donahue heads east while an airline piloted by Dana Andrews carrying 62 passengers flies west and their meeting is inevitable. It lacks the tight structure of William Wellman's MIGHTY as well as the fully developed characters. Most of the minor characters are telegraphed to us via voice overs so that we're not attached to them enough to really care about their fate. The large cast includes Rhonda Fleming, Anne Francis, Keenan Wynn, John Kerr, Joe Mantell, Frieda Inescourt and Jean Willes.

The Warners Archives MOD DVD is an adequate anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1318032000,,710,4.867768595041323
3883386,4,B002A5KXIC,"The Crowded Sky is a great old fashioned fun and melodramatic movie with perhaps cardboard characters and a dash of predictability, but always entertaining.
The very title itself suggests where the movie might be heading. As Efrem Zimbalist explains early on in the film planes flying in the air need paths to follow in order to avoid collisions with other planes.
This movie, along with ""Zero Hour"" and perhaps the ""High and the Mighty"", provided comedic fodder many years later for the Zucker Brothers when they made ""Airplane"" (aka ""Flying High"" here in Australia)
The film delves into individual passengers' lives for a lot of the early part of the film before the inevitable mid-air collision. Dana Andrews seems to pop up a lot in movies as a pilot of a plane. He always portrays interesting though flawed characters.
Yes, Dana Andrews, as the pilot of a passenger plane collides head on with a smaller plane piloted by Efram Zimbalist with deadly results.
(They did such a good job of it they were asked to repeat their roles 15 years later in the movie ""Airport 75"", this time with Efram flying the passenger plane and Dana in the small aircraft. As Oscar Wild might have put it - to have one mid-air collision could seem like an accident, to have two seems like carelessness!)

The movie keeps the viewer  engaged for the entire ride and takes you back to a simpler time when going to the flicks was the definitive pasttime for millions of people.",1309824000,11,1456,4.705882352941177
3883387,5,B002A5KXIC,"I first saw this turkey in 1960, and it was hokie then. I was at that time a fighter pilot and an airline pilot as well, so saw this thing as a technical bomb. I was interested in the airplanes, as the Navy jet was a TV-2, better known by the USAF nomenclature T-33, or ""T-Bird"" as it was known by those of us who flew it. It was then and for several years afterward the basic jet trainer for the United States Air Force, and several other NATO air forces around the world. Some of the film was pretty good, especially most of the T-Bird shots, taken from ""real life."" But, the crowning insult was the ""collision"" between the DC-7 and the T-Bird. Even by 1960 standards, it was AWFUL.
As to the rest of the movie, the soap-opera stories were dreadful, and merely ""fill"" for the climactic and deeply disappointing mid-air collision, which was an obviously poorly staged bumping of two model airplanes. The special effects department got an ""F"" on that one for sure.
I watched the movie again the other night on one of the cable movie channels, and must admit I watched it all the way through, reveling in nostalgia for those bygone days, with the convertible Rhonda drove while maintaining perfect hairdo and skin tight skirt and blouse. No one ever looked as perfectly turned out in real life as Rhonda and Anne did in this movie.
The flick was a real bomb then and now, but I admit to loving watching it with all of its crappy dialogue and worse-than-wooden acting by John Kerr and Troy Donahue. All the characters were cardboard cutouts, but the trip back in time was well worth the couple of hours of time, and it has a certain historical value in its depiction of cars, airplanes, and fashion of the time. Those were the Not-So-Good-Old-Days.
I gave it 5 stars for its nostalgia value, but clinically, it was a one star at best...",1288742400,12,1834,4.477611940298507
3883388,5,B002A5KXIC,"Drama, suspense, and humor tossed together in an early airplane disaster film that still satisfies 50 years after its release.  Yes, some special effects are cheap (it is a boarderline B film, afterall), but Anne Francis has never looked better!  Plus, if you're a fan of the film Airplane!, you'll catch some of the references to The Crowded Sky.  Buy this film and enjoy the flight!",1273449600,18,384,4.787878787878788
3883389,4,B002A5KXIC,"I never heard or seen before this movie but I was wondering about John Kerr (""South Pacific"") and Troy Donahue (""A Summer Place"".

The format is original aspect ratio 1.85:1. I miss on this DVD (and on the the others of WB's Archive Collection) subtitles but well.

The picture quality could be a little bit better but is OK. The sound is just in mono only.

The movie is a sort of Pre-""Airport"" film.

Trivia

While Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Troy Donahue are talking in the airport coffee shop, the music playing in the background is ""Theme from A Summer Place"" by Percy Faith and His Orchestra, taken from a movie in which Donahue starred: A Summer Place (1959).

In this film, _Efrem Zimbalist Jr._ plays a military jet pilot who crashes his plane into the commercial DC-6 piloted by Dana Andrews. About a decade and a half later, Andrews would return the favor as his character's private plane crashed into Zimbalist's commercial jet in Airport 1975 (1974).",1270944000,8,959,4.678571428571429
3883390,5,B002A5KXIC,"I brought the The crowded sky because Troy Donahue starred in this Movie. His part is small and personally l feel he does not appear in that many scenes compared to some of the other actors featured. His performance does somewhat appear wooden, though his scenes are small and not very deep,can not ask for more. Though i will say this, his very cute.( who cares if he can not act.)  The crowded sky is in brillant technicolour, quality of the dvd is very good. Filmed in 1960,its the story of two airplanes a naval jet 8255 and Trans states 17 commercial airliner on a collison course with both pliots unaware of the danger ahead. Through out the two flights we relive the pliots and passengers lives, their guilty secrets, dreams and ambitions. I do agree with other reviews that the acting is very wooden and and very little emotionals surface within the characters. This is not a movie with a lot of depth, but its more of a soap opera. I personally enjoyed it and its a great escapsim. The movie starrs Dana Andrew,Rhonda fleming,Troy donahue and many more. All the actors featured give a good peformance.",1259107200,4,1110,4.606060606060606
3883391,5,B002A5KXIC,"This is a wonderful nostalgia piece as there are so many stars from the past who we miss today.  The two brightest roles were that handled by the always beautiful and talented Rhonda Fleming and the lovely and lively Anne Frances.  Considering that this was made when only prop engines took us from coast to coast, it would mean the sky is more crowded now than ever before.  A very well done film with many subplots, but not one to see just before you take a flight.",1255478400,5,467,4.344827586206897
3883392,3,B002A5KXIC,"When you have great actors like, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. Anne Francis, Rhonda Fleming, and Dana Andrews you think you are going to have a great movie. Well, not in this one. Yes all of the above and others did a very good job as far as the acting goes. The problem with this movie is the plot. When I saw the ad for the movie I thought I was going to see an action packed movie. Not so. Most of the movie is full of people reliving events within their lives. The action is in the last few minutes of the movie and even it is lame. The acting is good the plot is just dull. As much as I liked the actors the movie is not one I would have paid money to watch. This is one very dull movie if you are looking for action. If you like watching a movie with many people reliving events within their lives with a few moments of action and the action is not much to see then you might enjoy this one. If the events the actors were reliving were interesting that would help, but not even that is something you will find in this movie.",1433462400,3,1021,3.9853658536585366

3883394,3,B002A5KXIC,"I hate to see an inferior movie made from a book that is not only much better but very different. Don't be put off Hank Searls' novel by the same name, by the generally mediocre ratings, with which I agree, of this old warhorse of a movie. Dana Andrews is a splendid actor, but even he didn't make it any more than ""okay.""",1427846400,,322,4.126984126984127

8358938,5,B002A5KXIC,"Inadvertently hilarious film that was intended to be serious drama. It failed that but  might have been plausible in its' time.

8358939,1,B002A5KXIC,"I'm a big fan of old movies and I'm a pilot so I'm a big fan of old aviation movies. Some, while dated, age fairly well. The first Airport movie comes to mind, or A Guy Named Joe with Spencer Tracy, later remade by Spielberg as Always. One of my all time favorites is Fate is the Hunter with Glenn Ford, much different from the novel of the same name but still a great movie. Unfortunately this movie hasn't aged well at all, or maybe it was never very good to begin with...

The Crowded Sky is also taken from a novel published in 1960, a pretty good novel actually. As is often the case the movie bears little resemblance to the book beyond the title. But that's not what makes this movie a don't see. What does is that it's just a complete cheese fest from beginning to end. It has very little to do with airplanes or flying; pretty much the entire plot deals with the various characters and their dysfunctional lives, the only purpose the airplanes serve is to tie them all together. I think this had to have been the movie the creators of Airplane had I mind when they made that movie.

Everyone in this story has issues, some large, some small, and they spend a substantial amount of screen time gazing into the near distance while we listen to what they're thinking. At first it's kind of creepy but it quickly becomes funny, and not in a good way. The accident that brings them all together happens in the last few minutes of the film and seems almost like an afterthought, as if they said, oh yeah, it's supposed to be about an airplane accident, I guess we have to have one!

And judging by the special effects used to depict the accident not only was it an afterthought, it was also the smallest item on their budget. I know it's an old movie but some of these scenes look like they were filmed by a couple of grade school kids in their backyard with some of their model airplanes and some matches. The previously mentioned Fate is the Hunter is also a 60's movie and it's effects are light years better.

The sky in this movie is crowded all right, but not with airplanes, it's crowded with angst ridden pilots, passengers and flight attendants who spend much too much time staring off into space and thinking depressing thoughts. If you're looking for a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends and tear to pieces in your own private Mystery Science Theatre then this should be your first choice! Otherwise avoid it all together.",1499299200,,2446,4.404867256637168
