5681744,5,B00BY8D9UU,"If you enjoy the oldies, especially the comedies, you will like this movie, Clifton Webb was a very good actor, but was best in comedic roles. This is a fine example of his talent.",1380153600,,180,4.323529411764706
5681745,5,B00BY8D9UU,"Love this movie about a more simple time when you didn't know what was going on when someone owned a company and made business trips every other month to the other branch. One little thing such as someone ready to get married and
pa needs to come home and the cat is let out of the bag! Webb is always right and the world is wrong in this great story of families and their problems. A ""must see""!",1376784000,4,396,4.089743589743589
5681746,5,B00BY8D9UU,I have always liked this move and was happy to get it on DVD. The DVD arrived as described. one more word is required for me to submit this.,1374624000,,140,3.8620689655172415
5681747,5,B00BY8D9UU,"Typical of Clifton Webb roles modesty was plus in character only if you had reason to be modest, and within this context, he built the family business and his families. (The plural is no error.) Things began to go awry when he made an unexpected visit to one of his families when a daughter wanted to get married, and at the same time, the end product of the evolutionary process produced a human with a striking resemblance to the chief of police. The latter put the sheriff on his trail with a warrant, and Mr. Pennypacker his father ended up incarcerated in his stead. All of these combined to turn orderly lives into utter chaos, but to borrow from an old adage, Mr. Pennypacker came out smelling like a rose.

5681748,4,B00BY8D9UU,"In Pennsylvania at the turn of the 20th century, a businessman (Clifton Webb) has successfully kept his two marriages and two families (with a total of 17 children) separate and a secret from each other. But when his Philadelphia son (Ray Stricklyn) unexpectedly visits the Harrisburg family looking for his father, the secret comes out and threatens to prevent the marriage of his daughter (Jill St. John) to the minister's (Larry Gates) son (Ron Ely, TV's TARZAN). Based on the play by Liam O'Brien, this wasn't quite the wholesome CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN knock off I was expecting. Although in the end it espouses traditional societal family values, it's a look at a so called unconventional ""free thinker"" and non-conformist who gets hoisted on his own petard with some laugh out loud moments. Webb, as expected, is able to deliver a quip with a razor like delivery but Dorothy McGuire as the first wife proves a feisty opponent. Directed by Henry Levin (JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH). With Charles Coburn (as Webb's father although he's only 12 years older), Dorothy Stickney, David Nelson (TV's OZZIE AND HARRIET), Larry Gates, Richard Deacon, Doro Merande and Joan Freeman.

The Fox MOD DVDr is a decent wide screen (2.35) transfer although not anamorphic.",1367625600,17,1266,4.971698113207547
5681749,4,B00BY8D9UU,"For some reason, Clifton Webb was an actor Fox thought of first for movies involving fathers with big families. Maybe the success of SITTING PRETTY in 1948 led to him being given roles in which he could react comically with children. (MR SCOUTMASTER is another example where the kids were not his own). Knowing what we now know of Mr Webb's lifestyle, casting him as a father was clearly ""casting against type"", but then again so was casting Rock Hudson as a romantic lead. THE REMARKABLE MR PENNYPACKER was based on a Broadway play which in turn was based on a fictionalized biography of a member of a famous family of Pennsylvania which could boast a Civil War hero and a Governor. There is historical evidence of the Pennypacker who became a bigamist (a more common practise of yesteryear than we would like to think), but how much of this story is factual is hard to say. It is interesting that such a subject matter could be viewed as an ideal story for family entertainment, but '50's movies could present unsavoury subject matter in such a way that the sexual issues involved went right over the heads of many in the audience, especially children.
  The play ran on Broadway from Dec '53 to July '54 and starred Burgess Meredith (a very different personality to Clifton Webb, who no doubt tailored the role to his persona) and Martha Scott, a warm, sensitive actress not unlike Dorothy McGuire, who essayed the role on screen. With a total of 17 children, the CinemaScope screen came in handy for this colourful,almost Disney-style period comedy. I am happy to announce that the Fox Made-on -Demand disc presents the full 2:35 CinemaScope ratio. (It is regrettable that so many 'Scope films have been released panned-and-scanned by this company, the ""Father studio"" of CinemaScope. Zanuck must be spinning in his grave....) It is Letterboxed, not a 16:9 anamorphic transfer (which would look better), but with the  lamentable approach by the Fox Archives people to Wide Screen films, we should be grateful for small mercies! (The best way to view this movie on a Wide Screen TV is to set the Aspect of the TV to 'Zoom')
  Charles Coburn- one of the busiest character actors in Hollywood's golden days- turns in another fine performance as Grandpa Pennypacker. Amongst the young cast are Jill St John, Ron Ely (who would soon take on the mantle of Tarzan on TV in the '60's) and David Nelson, who had a brief film career after+ during the run of the Ozzie and Harriet show. (Primarily at Fox, PEYTON PLACE is probably his best movie.) The score is by the talented Leigh Harline (who wrote the Oscar-winning score to PINNOCHIO amongst many others) and the impressive cinematography is by Milton Krasner, who shot many great CinemaScope movies at Fox.
  No award-winning classic, but an entertaining show with a more than capable cast made towards the end of Hollywood's peak era. Good clean fun (if you can gloss over the twisted marital issues on display!)",1367452800,11,2962,4.784735812133072
5681750,1,B00BY8D9UU,"This is a wonderful movie. Clifton Webb, as always, his usual terrific self. However, this movie was filmed in CinemaScope and Fox is releasing this in the pan & Scan version. Shame on you Fox. We are tired of being short-changed in this day and age of wide screen TVs. Warning - Do Not Buy these Pan & Scan DVDs.",1365638400,45,313,4.233333333333333
5681751,5,B00BY8D9UU,"As reported over the past couple of weeks, this film is part of a 25 film release by Fox Cinema Archives MOD series (which includes Sitting Pretty, starring Clifton Webb & Maureen O'Hara and is the first Mr. Belvadere film). ""The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker"" (1959), is published by 20th Century-Fox, color, on the DVD-R format, and set for release on 04-16-2013. The SRP is $19.98 but should be reduced in price moderately at Amazon (at least for a short time). I've ordered this already along with Jack Benny's ""Meanest Man In The World"", also a part of this release wave from the Fox ""MOD"" program, which should provide many good laughs (B&W,57min., circa 1940's, also includes Eddy Anderson as well). However, the comedy gem of this group has to be ""Sitting Pretty"", the first Mr. Beladere film and I can't hardly wait to pre-order this title from Amazon as soon as they post a order listing (better sooner than later)asap...please ???  All three of these titles are worth buying for your enjoyment & pleasure.
Have Fun :) :) :)

My wife and I watched it together and got more and more disturbed as it progressed.  We didn't find it funny or entertaining at all. In fact, I threw it in the garbage as soon as it was over. The lead character (Webb) is a bigamist with two sets of children in different towns, neither knowing about the other until he is finally caught. He very smugly and matter-of-factly tries to justify his hurtful behavior by saying he was lonely, but he couldn't go to a bar or participate in other forms of sordid entertainment.  No, instead he meets, dates and marries another woman and then has more children by her, but that's okay, as long as he's not out doing things that his first wife might disapprove.",1480982400,,849,4.464516129032258
