905804,5,6304681038,"Tired of the same Horror movies all the time? This one was so much fun! I love zombie movies and this one has like the plot and action of every zombie movie ever in it! I was very happy with it. The acting could be better, but this film is never dull and moves very fast. Great dialogue too! ""Dad you've been holding that gun for two days - shoot a zombie!""  ""I can't, I left the shells in the car!""
Get this gory movie and prepare to be grossed out. It has one of the best scenes ever in a zombie movie where a guy is ripped in half like in Day Of The Dead, and this one looks intense! Some people don't get that this movie is suppose to be fun and campy and gross! I love it!",981849600,2,677,3.835714285714286
905805,5,6304681038,"Zombie Bloodbath is the best zombie films ever made. (In my opinion). I love everything about it. It has a great story, good actors/actreses and most of all ... awesome gore effects! For instance: A guy gets ripped in  half and eaten, a chick gets her face ripped off and her eyes pulled out, a  dude gets his intrails pulled through his butt and he barfs the rest of  them out and a women gets her guts eaten by hungry zombies. Todd Sheets is  awesome... he even makes a cameo aperance in the film! Great camera work  (Todd has WICKED camera work in his films). I think more people should  appriciate low budget shot on video Horror films.. especially this one! In  my opinion, shot on video Horror is the best Horror today. Who wants to  watch big budget teen slasher flicks made by Wes Craven and  starring people from Dawson's Creek and Party Of Five. Todd keeps it real  and he will never sell out on us ""TRUE"" Horror fans. Keep up the  good work Todd, your awesome!",927158400,4,971,4.368715083798882
905806,1,6304681038,"Or better still: don't. If there was an ""Amateur Hour: make your own horror film - entries to be received next week"" contest I am sure it would be humanly impossible someone would come up with something as lousy  as this product. It seems to have been made by some juvenile who borrowed  his fathers handycam for a few hours (without ever having seen such a  device) to tape some incoherent mumblings with fellow students and a few  neighbours and edited later on his own crummy teenage video equipment - but  in his exitement forgot (or didn't know) that something like a story, plot,  script, tension, climax and all that was needed to make a film. I LOVE bad  horror movies - but this is totally beyond the rediculous. The 'actors' are  the most unconvincing nitwits without any character, the music is horrible  and doesn't add anything to the movie, the make-up effects consist of some  black mascara for the zombie faces and bio products being poured over  someones head to simulate their skin melting. The zombies eating inner  bodyparts are clearly just taking bits from a pile of meat products that  are laid on top of someone. The quality is poor video copy material, the  editing is the worst imaginable, lighting is absent. This is a total waste  of time and money. And this is written down by someone who thinks Ed Wood's  PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is actually a very good movie! So what if you think  that is a bad one..........",921715200,,1440,4.584313725490196
7875412,4,6304681038,"As of this time, the DVD of this is out of print. I should've bought the DVD before because the price on the disc is going up. There's no originality here. This is just simply a fun, amateurish gorefest that is just made to entertain. It's shot on VHS, and the numerous gore effects are indeed cheap but also fun. There's nothing fancy with the zombie makeup because the budget wouldn't allow, and there's no nudity. Aside from the crowd that likes really cheap VHS made retro gore stuff, it won't have much of an audience beyond that. The only purpose of it is just to deliver a fast pace with loads of amateur gore. You just turn your brain off and watch. Todd Sheets was a pretty good director for fans of these extremely easy to follow VHS gore flicks. The entire trilogy should get a Blu-ray release because this stuff is just fun. When I find it at a decent price, I'll have to get the DVD trilogy with the other sequels in the series because I'm stuck with the VHS tape of this that I bought. As I said, it's lots of fun but won't have much of an audience beyond that VHS made gore crowd.",1464220800,,1095,4.244019138755981
7875413,4,6304681038,"Todd Sheets creates a gore filled feature that will prove an entertaining watch. The pace is fast, there is little wait for the blood to spill. The shot on video quality shows limitations but Todd Sheets is imaginative in his blocking and scene framing and avoids the ""stand and shoot"" syndrome that brings doldrums.
 The acting is what would be expected from a low budget project but I don't think any of us expect ""MacBeth"".On the negative, some of the flesh eating scenes are drawn out and perhaps could have been shortened. The music is good, consistent and appropriately helps the pace of the vid. Grab the video, a few buddies and some beer and prepare for a few good yuks...",1091664000,,681,4.628099173553719
7875414,5,6304681038,"This movie was so scary. I mean the plot is just so amazing. Like there is a chemical spill or something in this building, BUT the zombies were actually there before the chemical spill actually happened. When one of the scientists was having the reaction from the spill, he is killed by zombies. ABOUT 30 MIN OF THIS MOVIE IS ZOMBIES EATING THEIR VICTOMS. I really loved the effect of the spray bottle thgey used to squirt blood onto the people dieing, that made it so realistic, i almost called the police and told them that zombies actually exist. Well now, the acting is just so amazing. One family consists of a Hippy Homosexual, a son who has the biggest head in the world, a sister who is the apitity of loser, and the mother who is ugly and fat, and doesnt know what is going on throughout the entire film. Now the big head kid meats this other guy in a movie rentle place and they suddenly decide that they want to make a movie using a camera that is so old. This family consists of a lame kid who uses karate to kill the zombies. He like kicks them and stuff. He is so strong he could take on the WORLD!! The dad is an ex-veteran who runs around with a double barrel shotgun the entire movie and doesnt fire a single round becuase he left the bullets in him car. The families meet and decide in order to try to stay hidden from the zombies, they DONT ride in there car. So its 8 people running and crying in a bunch. WHAT STEALTH!! When the hippie homosexual dies,(gets eaten for about 10 min) he is used as a total of 10 zombies. He is dressed differently but you are easily able to tell it is him becuase of his stupid long red hair. Wow this movie was impressive. I almost killed myself because i thought that zombies were going to break through my windows and kill me. Such a terrrible way of dieing. People eating you. BUT THE SPRAY BOTTLE DOES IT. If i ever come across a spray bottle again, i will just die, because it would remind me of the terrible water it sprayed on its victoms. Wow does this movie have a surprising ending. WOW. i cant tell you it, becuase i don't want to ruin the moment of glory at the end. this movie is amazing, especially the acting. The fat kid is a brave man. He like closed a door once, WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO. OMG!!!. well rent this, omg no, BUY THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON OR SOMETHING. wow you won't be disappointed.",1087948800,2,2361,4.237250554323725
7875415,3,6304681038,"A nucleur meltdown in Kansas City results in people turning into zombies forcing surviving residents to run, hide, and kick some zombie butt.
Todd Sheets' breakthrough effort gets a lot of flack for its lack of script and rough look, but I honestly think that this is one of the funnest movies out there.  Now all of the reviewers who thought of this movie as trash were of course right, and if you don't care for plenty of gore and a sensless plot, don't even waste your money on this gore classic. But if this is your thing as far as movies go, or if you just want a good party tape, go for this one. Good for a few laughs and a grossout or two.
If you're looking for better scripted fare, but still want gore to go along with it, I recommend buying one of Todd Sheets later films like Violent New Breed or the Shivers.
P.S - Watch for the gang fight choreography in this one, it has some of the most ""spontaneous"" stuntwork that I've ever seen.",1036108800,,947,4.232044198895028
7875416,2,6304681038,"I'm a die hard zombie fan so I had to see this movie and it was  pretty goofy but still fun to watch for zombie/gore fans.  My main problem with the movie was this:  No suspense.  Part of this is due to the weak acting (not responding with terror to terrifying situations so hard to believe) but also because of things like groups of zombies just popping up from behind fences like they were playing hid and go seek, looking like they're trying to hold back smiles.  The horror of a decaying body lumbering slowly through the moonlight groaning is far more errie and menacing.  Also, the music at times just made it too spoofy (unless that's what they were going for then bravo) but cheesy metal tunes just kills the tension and sends the movie into goof mode.  I think 50% more tension could have been added with the right music (slower, creepier, like what Goblin did for ""Suspiria"").
  I'm still going to see Zombie Bloodbath 2 & 3.  I'm sure the gore factor will be high and kudus for that Todd Sheets, but hopfully more suspense will be added.  My two stars are for effort and gore.  Not worthy but do-able.",1025222400,2,1112,4.4236453201970445
7875417,4,6304681038,"This is a pretty good movie.
Of course the budget for this movie was next to nothing, but you have to look past that.
The gore was pretty good and pletiful.
The acting was, of course,  horrible, but most horror movie don't win awards for acting.
This is not a must see, but if you like Zombie movies go ahead a buy it.
It is a rare movie so at least you will have it for your collection.",1016064000,,387,3.9615384615384617
7875418,3,6304681038,"I never heard of this movie until I stumbled on amazon. But I do
love zombie movies. This movie had it's moments, the acting was bad, but what do you get with B-movie actors. There was a lot of eating, which if you ask me, they could of let up on. That part just dragged on to much. But if you like zombie movie for the gore (like me) you will love this ... movie.",1014768000,,364,3.8666666666666667

When reading that, read it very slow, and without any feeling what so ever! There is alot of Gore and Guts, but it's really fake looking that you laugh instead of being freaked out! Just don't waste you'r money on this stupid so-called zombie flick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1014422400,,378,4.8307692307692305

After watching the tape, I came back to this page to stare again at these reviews - this time with all the revulsion and horror that this movie portends to portray. I have a tape of a family BQ with more shock value and drama. Not one single moment of this film is ""campy"" or enjoyable. However, I know someone who made a movie not long ago called ""Attack of the Zombie Lettuce Growers."" It is a masterpiece! And you can buy it right here...",996451200,,492,4.301075268817204
