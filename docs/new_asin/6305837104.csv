Sorry, Charlie.  It takes a  little more than mere speechifying.  And if that wasn't bad enough, he is  so busy working on the SIGNIFICANCE of the story that he forgets little  things like character, plot, and even comedy.  This is one of the least  funny films ever made.  The attempts at black humor remain attempts, as  none of them ever gets off the ground.

It's great because it's so different from Charlie Chaplin's other work. It's not a very serious movie but it has it's moments, even though it's suppose to be loosely based on a real french serial killer named Henri Dsir Landru. Martha Ray is also amazing in this film. She plays one of his nagging wives that he only married for money. All in all it's a excellent movie, made way ahead of it's time and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a true Charles Chaplin fan and/or classic movie collector. :-)",1411257600,,654,4.458333333333333
1082355,3,6305837104,"Story goes that Orson Welles originally planned on directing Charlie Chaplin in this film, eyeing the famed silent film star as the perfect fit for the title character.  He was right.  In my eyes, this is not only one of Chaplins greatest screen performances but possibly one of the greatest male performances of all time.  Story ends with Chaplin requesting Welles give up the project and let him direct it himself, since he had never acted under anyone elses direction before.  Wrong move.  For me, Monsieur Verdoux, which a good film, could have been great under the direction of a man (or woman) better suited to the material; and Welles was such a director.  I can only imagine the greatness that could have come from Welles direction, and it saddens me to know that well never see that.

This isn't to say that Monsieur Verdoux is a bad film, because it isnt, but it is missing something key.

Chaplin was a remarkable director.  The way that he was able to convey so much without the use of dialog is insanely creative, and the way that he played with soft textures, creating such languid emotions that created a soulfully intimate nature to his films was truly sincere and impactful.  This quality shines brightest during a moment in this film where Verdoux is contemplating killing off a young girl, right out of prison.  They are sitting at a small dining room table and Verdoux is waiting for her to drink some poison.  As they talk to each other and the tension rises (she lifts the glass, she puts it down, he eyes her glass, he starts to panic, he decides he doesnt want her to drink it) the scene begins to form this beautifully intimate chemistry that brings us into Verdouxs mindset.  We begin to really see this man.

Sadly, Chaplins skills as a director don't always shine in the film as a whole, because despite the films black comedy overtones, Chaplin wasn't very adept at creating the black aspects.  The film, tonally, winds up feeling somewhat flat because Chaplin didn't know how to really flesh out the intensity needed to make this story sing on the screen.  This is a conundrum for me, because as an actor he seemed to understand that mix of comedy/intensity rather well, exceptionally well actually.  His facial expressions and inward demeanor sell this man completely, but the film around him winds up feeling rather stale in comparison.  I found myself completely uninterested in the actual story, but continually glued to Chaplins performance.

I seriously weep inside for what could have been had Chaplin allowed Welles to direct him here.

The story is an interesting one in concept.  The film is a semi-fictionalized telling of a real life murderer of women.  With names changed (hilariously causing controversy when a real life bank employee who happened to have the same name as the fictional one used in the film), Monsieur Verdoux tells the story of Henri Verdoux, a bank employee who comes up with an unorthodox way of providing for his family.  He seeks out rich women, marries them, and then murders them for their money.  Conceptually, this has so much promise, and some of it is tapped here, but mostly the story itself, which should be front and center, becomes somewhat lost in the process and we are left with a series of events that don't always feel cohesively connected, and a lot of backstory that is just completely disregarded.  We get no real sense of Verdoux actual home life, his real family or his complete intentions.  Instead, we are left in the moment of certain aspects of the film, and while some of those work VERY well (like the aforementioned dinner scene), I cant help but feel let down by the lack of real plot development here.  The story almost felt like an afterthought, or like a mere prop for Chaplin to use to bolster his performance.  While I often site performances as a reason to see a film, because acting has always been my primary cinematic love, I have to express disappointment that this particular performance isn't matched by the actual film, since the films promise was so strong.",1410134400,2,4065,4.735795454545454

1082357,5,6305837104,"It is the greatest film of Chaplin, one in which he does not play a character who will at once win the sympathies of his audience. Just the contrary. He plays a serial killer, well, a lady-killer to be more precise. The humour is black enough for times that have just witnessed, the second world war, which ended with the mass killing of civilian populations by nuclear weapons. The very same nation that deployed these weapons, drove out Chaplin as an immoral communist sympathizer. One of our greatest artists takes on a civilization that wanted to destroy him and much else that was invaluable. His speech in the court is a remarkable document in the history of ethics, in some ways comparable to Socrates' famous last speech.
The Criterion Collection deserves to be congratulated for its 2K restoration and for its excellent selection of extras that include one of the finest pieces of writing on cinema by Andr Bazin on Monsieur Verdoux.",1405123200,,942,4.820987654320987
1082358,2,6305837104,"I think film's finest critic is the late James Agee, because of the quality of his prose, the intensity of his intelligent searching for meaning, his mental and emotional expansiveness.  His review of ""Verdoux"" (or ""reviews"", more properly; he took up three successive columns in The Nation before he felt he'd covered things adequately) illustrates what I do and don't look for in a critic; the first I've indicated, but what I don't seek out is advice on what films to watch. However brilliant and sensitive a writer may be AS a writer, his or her tastes, reactions and judgments are not mine; it's more efficient to ask an acquaintance whose preferences are known to me what he thought of this or that movie, and act according to whether I know his taste to be reliable or abysmal. But even if his enthusiasm for a movie probably means I'll like it as well, that doesn't mean he could write an intelligible line illuminating his reaction in a way that would be meaningful to someone who doesn't know him (which is what critics DO), or come up with contextual insights, surprising and fresh clarifications, etc.

With Agee, there is also the fact that he reviewed films in the 1940's; mostly, I've either already seen them on TCM or for whatever reason have chosen not to, and only rarely will (re)-reading a review of his make me search out one I've missed. His analysis of ""Verdoux"" is one example of why this is. The film was critically slammed and ignored by the public upon its initial release. Agee's review(s) were mainly a refutation of the criticisms by those he felt didn't understand a great work of art. I read his words before seeing the film, and was staggered by the drive of his effort, the painstaking detail of his arguments, the passion and urgency of his message, which was, in the end, a hopeless one: essentially, he was trying to logically prove to people that they actually liked and admired a movie they had already concluded (by viewing it) was neither likeable or admirable. How many times have you tried doing that with a friend who didn't ""get"" a movie you loved? How often has it worked?

At this point I'm not going to try to convince anyone who worships this cinematic failure that they are wrong to do so. The passage of time has (inevitably) caused opinion of it to undergo a radical revision, as time reliably does--after enough years pass, the films of Adam Sandler will probably be held up as a Golden Period and he a genius underappreciated by obtuse contemporaries. I will only say that as I read Agee's words, I found myself fascinated by HIM, while simultaneously experiencing the sagging feeling that the critics he was refuting--none of whom, I'm sure, had a tenth of his talent or perception--were probably, in this case, simply right. And when I finally broke down and watched ""Verdoux"" I saw that they were. As they said, the best part was the Martha Raye section, most of the acting was just bad, the philosophizing was achingly simplistic and empty of any revelatory insight, the production values are cheesy and cheapish, and there is virtually no humor (or even courage--we never SEE Verdoux kill anyone, we only see him try and fail--the actual murders are only referred to, and in a way seem imaginary).

But this won't stop anyone from seeing the film who wants to; and I'm not even suggesting anyone shouldn't. I will suggest getting a copy of ""Agee on Film"" and reading his criticism before or after (or better yet, both) seeing it. Partly because in defending ""Verdoux"" he essentially reconstructs it, and the movie he imagines is better than the one you'll see.",1397174400,4,3620,4.705047318611987

1082360,5,6305837104,"Chaplin's films might have been the catalyst that got me so interested in film history, and, to me, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (along with his other talkie ""The Great Dictator"") is a film that can be watched ad infinitum. Chaplin was brave enough to transition from the silent picture to the sound movie, and in doing so he undoubtedly began to understand the shift that was occurring in the cinema's translation of politics and ideas. (To me, this is the kind of picture that moves those of who us who want to discuss movies as film; lesser critics tend to discuss movies as movies.) Undoubtedly Chaplin began to understand, too, the new demands of the cinematic idiom, and, by all critical standards, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" could have succeeded just as well had it been a stage production. Although Chaplin flirts with innovations in voice over narration, camera angles to heighten mood and tension, and pacing that juxtaposes well with the musical flavorings, there is still the frustrating reminder that he has yet to fully understand how to exploit the language of sound movies. Nonetheless, I would never debate his genius, as few have had such experience in laboring in the medium of cinema, be it short films, features, or industrial efforts (Chaplin was a work-a-holic, and a terrific producer). I, however, list ""Monsieur Verdoux"" amongst my favorite films--it is leisurely paced, suspenseful, very well written, competently acted (by all, c'mon), and truly dangerous and dark in its subject matter. This is the most moving of Chaplin's films and, rather than spoil it for you with content and thematic analysis, I would recommend just watching the film. It's a tonic for much of what we have pouring into the movie theaters in the present day! If you are interested in the ethical questions posed by the Verdoux character, and want to understand Chaplin's personality change as both actor and director, then I must point you towards Neil Sinyard's tremendous book ""Classic Movie Comedians"", a great work that explains the depth behind the older comedies and how character actors like Chaplin took humorous material to a new level of performance.
The Criterion disc is an immaculate and wonderful presentation. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, a wonderful cinema critic, has contributed an insightful essay about the film and it is included proper in the booklet. The picture and sound transfer is absolutely wonderful. This is the treatment that Chaplin's film deserves. The documentary footage included on the extra is also wonderful, analyzing the political effect that Chaplin's movie had upon the film watching community at large, particularly in America. They had doubts about the sentiments of Chaplin, and the paranoia begins to show--absolutely chilling. Overall, one of the most moving, engrossing, and memorable of Chaplin's experiments, preserved here in a great DVD (and/or) BluRay package. A+",1392854400,5,2893,5.197002141327623

1082362,5,6305837104,"2013 sees the Criterion Collection release Charlie Chaplins Monsieur Verodux (1947). With this film, Chaplins sentimental Tramp was unquestionably dead, and in its place was an elegant black satire about a mass murderer. Critics and the public alike vilified Chaplin for this shift, to the point of picketing theaters, booing him at the Broadway Theater premiere, and eventual forcing the films withdrawal from the American market. James Agee, Kenneth Anger, and Bosley Crowther were among scant few notables who went against the tide and sang the films praises, declaring it a masterpiece. Later revivals have seen contemporary critics belatedly joining the films original champions. Today, Dennis Schwartz writes, Monsieur Verdoux remains an unusually provocative satirical black comedy thats subversive and gives one a greater sense of Chaplins political breadth from his previous work. This reappraisal is not surprising: Verdouxs dark, sardonic humor is attuned to the modern mindset.

While Monsieur Verdoux does not compare to Chaplins most assured silent work, it is his most successful sound film (although that may not be saying much). The idea of Chaplin playing a Bluebeard type came from Orson Welles. Predictably, Welles suggested himself as director and, even more predictably, nothing came of it. Chaplin decided to pursue the idea solo, embarking on a screenplay. He offered Welles a story idea credit, and much to Chaplins chagrin, Welles accepted.

In retrospect, Monsieur Verdoux might be seen as an antidote to Chaplins next feature, the excessively saccharine Limelight (1952). The initial critical and commercial failure of Verdoux was comparable to the situation with Harry Langdons bleak Threes A Crowd (1927), after which Langdon reportedly tried to rebound with the populist-minded Heart Trouble (1928) (since that film was not distributed and is now lost, it is impossible to assess whether or not Langdons effort for a comeback would have been successful). Chaplin attempted to rebound from the commercial failure Verdoux with Limelight. Although Limelight proved to be a commercial success, critical reception was mixed. In her infamous review the critic Pauline Kael referred to it as Slimelight and, according to a Chaplin biographer, Pablo Picasso walked out on the film, finding it to be nauseatingly sentimental. The two films which followed Limelight were critical and commercial failures. To its credit, Verdoux does not overdose from Chaplins heart-on-sleeve sentiment.

Monsieur Verdoux is based on the life of serial killer Henry Desire Landru, aka The Bluebeard of Paris, who was convicted and executed for the murder of eleven women in 1922.  The film opens with Verdouxs voice-over narration from his tombstone, immediately indicating that what is about to unfold is far from the dance of the dinner rolls.

Verdoux is a banker who has lost his job during an economic crisis. At home he has an  invalid wife and young son. In his late fifties, Verdoux knows his prospects for employment are slim and he resorts to marrying and murdering wealthy women to provide for his family. The Tramp faced the perils of Capitalism in Modern Times (1936), but here his response is an all-out blitz.

Chaplins Verdoux is an artful murderer. His is an aesthetic approach to killing, related to but opposite of The Great Dictators Hynkel. He only really comes to life when he is engaged in the art of murder. Some of the physical comedy falls flat (Verdoux tumbling out of a window). Chaplin cannot resist mocking, then milking, the bourgeoisie heartstrings in the scenes of a paralyzed Mrs. and son at home in the lonely Spanish villa.

The best stroke here is Chaplins casting of Martha Raye as Annabella, the one wife he simply cannot kill. Chaplin always knew the value of a great female foil and he has one in the thankfully low-brow comedic antics of Rae, who contrasts beautifully with Chaplins self-praodying, effete elitism. Even in a film about a killer of women, Chaplin, commendably, does not succumb to a patriarchal ethos. Verdouxs numerous attempts to kill Annabella prove unsuccessful and she proves as valuable to him as Jack Oakies Napaloni was to Chaplins Hynkel in The Great Dictator (1940). Verdouxs final attempt on Rayes life is an extended and somewhat clumsily executed spoof of  Theodore Dreisers novel An American Tragedy.

Chaplin provides a second strong female counterpart in Marilyn Nashs The Girl who reads Schopenhauer and laments Verdouxs loss of cynicism. Nash calls to mind elements found in Chaplins previous leading ladies (Paulette Goddards Gamin from Modern Times, most specially) and she prefigures Claire Blooms Thereza in Limelight.

Naturally, Chaplin will not forgo painting his societal misfit with a degree of sympathetic coloring and he does this, as typical in his late works, with an extended anti-war speech that also tackles the dog-eat-dog tenets of Capitalist America. On his way to the gallows, Verdoux gets in one last, brief anti-organized religion quip. Thankfully, the cold-blooded killer Verdoux is not as long-winded as The Great Dictators Barber or Limelights Calvero. Chaplin, as expected, is best in his pantomime moments. 1947 Audiences expected laughter from Chaplin. They didn't get much of it from this morality play. Still, despite its flaws, Monsieur Verdoux has withstood the test of time better than any of Chaplins sound work. However, and not surprisingly, his best silent work somehow seems more contemporary.

The Criterion Edition includes a making of the film documentary, an audio interview with co-star Nash, three theatrical trailers, and essays.

1082392,5,6305837104,"A Comedy Of Murders. Based on an idea by Orson Welles, for which he was paid $5,000. Wow. The opening scene presages Sunset Boulevard (released in 1950), with its from the grave speech opener, and there are times when Chaplin talks directly to the camera (was that a first?). Lucky Roses, to be so close to the holders lips. Crazy fishing wife  there are crazy bursts of slapstick comedy, intermixed with great cinematography, gorgeous acting, sinister comedy, and philosophizing. Too much commotion, too many questions (Did Verdoux kill his own wife and son? What became of all of his wives? What was he living on?). I lost my sandwich. A slice of bread with two pieces of meat. Chaplin thought that Monsieur Verdoux was his most brilliant film. Inspired by Henri Desiree Landru, who killed 10 wives, two dogs, and a teenage son of one of his wives, as well as Thomas Wainright, another wife kliler.. One murder makes a villain, millions a hero. Numbers sanctify. The shooting of this film was faster and more trouble-free than any of his his previous films, wartime rationing meant no wasting film stock. For the first time, Chaplin shot with a completed working script, a shooting schedule, and scene drawings. He also grew a real mustache for the first time. had to face down hostile journalists at the press conference. A strange love story that hurts.
The bonus features are quite skimpy, and we get no interview with surviving cast survivors; in fact, the film and the extras all fit on one disc, compared to other Chaplin Collection films, which go onto two discs (as a newer film, wouldnt there be more stuff available?). Marilyn Nash, who played The Girl (shes never named), was still alive in 2003 when this set was released, although she sadly died in 2011, having only made one other film. Claude Chabrol, the director of a film called Landru, which is about the French serial killer that Monsieur Verdoux was based on, has great scene commentary in the film; he died in 2010 at age 80 (both have the same alliterative initials  CC). Notes that in this film Chaplin truly abandons and moves beyond the silent film style, whereas the previous film The Great Dictator melded silent and talkie. Chabrol had made a film about Landru, who he notes was not a philosopher; Landru was a weirdo! This is an atheistic film, but the priest is not mocked, rather checkmated and met on equal terms. Ah, Father, what can I do for you? The documentary shows long scenes from the film, unlike other such documentaries  is this because theres less to say about Monsieur Verdoux, compared to the others, or because more show don't tell is required? Chabrol proves a passionate and interested interviewee, he picks scenes apart masterfully, even short ones like Chaplins descent of the stairs after a night spent murdering one of his wives. We learn that Chaplin filmed the difficult closing shot first (although were never told that its a difficult film  how can it be, when we know what he went through to get the right closing shots for City Lights? But hey  thats, like his opinion, man) The film also includes film posters, like all the rest of the DVDs do, but this one is different in that each of the posters includes a radio promo clip (whether they're connected or not  we hear American clips, whether the accompanying poster is from the US, Czechoslovakia, Japan or the US). Of course, the text can be very corny:

- The most controversial movie of all time!
- A bold comedy that inclues drama, pathos, and even slapstick!
- Youll scream yourself to death!
- The strangest character of the century!
- The most unusual character ever presented on the screen!
- It is something you have never before seen on the screen. In Monsieur Verdoux there is a peculiar intensity of drama and a more peculiar hysteria of laughter and a strange love story that hurts. With all of its strangeness, there is a pathos and beauty that will haunt you until motion pictures are no longer made.

Charlie Chaplin, the British comedian known for winning legions of fans through his character, ""The Tramp"" and one of the most important figures in cinema history.

While Charlie Chaplin will forever be a legend known for wonderful film such as ""City Lights"", ""The Gold Rush"", ""Modern Times"" and ""The Great Dictator"" to name a few.  His life reads like a rags-to-riches story as a child born into poverty and hardship and would become a performer at a young age and eventually become scouted by the film industry and making his first appearance in film in 1914 for Keystone Studios.

The actor would eventually move on to do work for studios such as Essanay, Mutual and First National corporations and would become one of the most successful men in the world by 1918.  And in 1919, in order to gain complete control of his films, Chaplin along with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith would create the American film studio known as United Artist.

And as Charlie Chaplin would survive the transition from silent to talkie in the 1930s. It's the 1940s that would prove to be detrimental for Charlie Chaplin.  It began with an actress named Joan Barry accusing Chaplin that she was pregnant with his baby.  Because Chaplin has had several divorces, media portrayed him as a womanizer.

While working on his latest film ""Monsieur Verdoux"", because he would not renounce his British citizenship and was speaking favorably to open a Second Front to help the Soviets and support Soviet-American friendship groups.  Because he socialized with Hanns Eisler and Bertolt Brecht and also attended functions of Soviet diplomats in the U.S., he was accused of being communist and branded a threat to national security. Federal authorities would use the Joan Barry case to bring up Chaplin on four indictments which include interfering with Barry's arrest and violating the Mann Act for transportation of women across state lines for sexual purposes.

While Chaplin was acquitted, unfortunately, because of the negative publicity, the federal government successfully achieved what they wanted, to hurt Chaplin's career.

More negative publicity would affect Charlie Chaplin when he married his 18-year-old protegee Oona O'Neill (Chaplin was 54 at the time), the daughter of Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Eugene O'Neill and writer Agnes Boulton.  And because he would not consent to her marriage to Chaplin, despite their close relationship, O'Neill ended his relationship with his daughter.

And while Chaplin was happy to be married to Oona and continued to work on his new film ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (which he started in 1942), a film which came from an idea from Orson Welles about a  bluebeard/French serial killer named Henri Landru.  While Chaplin tried to sway American sentiment that he was not a communist and even had a major publicist try to promote his new film and also to prepare audiences for a non-Tramp role, unfortunately, his reputation was already tarnished.

He was booed at the premiere, people wanted to boycott his film and Charlie Chaplin who was known to earn $5 million for his films, would only make $300,000+ in the box office and became a commercial flop.  But in other countries, the film was a success.

But the damage was done and Chaplin's American career would never be the same ever again.  By his next film ""Limelight"", when he went to screen the film in London, while returning back home with his family, the Attorney General revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit. But because Chaplin and his films were warmly received, he would make Switzerland his new home.

While the film was not looked at positively back in the 1940s, as decades have past, many would recognize ""Monsieur Verdoux"" as Charlie Chaplin's first major talkie film that was a true masterpiece.  Even in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography, he wrote ""Monsieur Verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made"".

And now, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD by The Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""Monsieur Verdoux"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio). The film features wonderful contrast and is well-detailed. Whites and grays are well-contrast, black levels are also much better.  I saw no damage or major flickering, banding, if anything, the film looks magnificent on Blu-ray!

According to the Criterion Collection, this high-definition digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original 35 mm camera negative at L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image System's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise reduction and jitter.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Monsieur Verdoux"" is presented in English LPCM 1.0. Dialogue is clear and subtitles are easy to read. I detected no pops, crackles or terrible hiss during my viewing of the film.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remaster at 24-bit from a sound negative.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

EXTRAS:

""Monsieur Verdoux - The Criterion Collection #652"" comes with an 38-page booklet with the following essays: ""Sympathy for the Devil"" by Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, the article that Charlie Chaplin wrote for the ""Continental Daily Mail"" titled ""My New Film"" and Andre Bazin's ""The Myth of Monsieur Verdoux"" from Bazin's film ""What is Cinema? Vol II"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's hard to use the word sympathetic when it comes to a character that is a mass murderer.  Nor should one sympathize for one that is amoral for the crimes they have committed.

But what Charlie Chaplin was able to create was a character that is intelligent, witty but its the idea in his head that what he has done is miniscule to what countries have done in war.  Where one man kills, he is a murder.  When a nation kills, they are seen as not.

This is an interesting juxtaposition from Chaplin's last film ""The Great Dictator"" in which the threat of Hitler was scaring the masses, Chaplin used his famous personality to preach for a kinder world where people rise above their hate, greed and brutality.

But by 1947, he had been branded guilty by the mass media and U.S. government for his political beliefs and because of his personal life.  Two years before ""Monsieur Verdoux"" was released in theaters, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II and while images of the devastation was suppressed by American media at the time, because Chaplin was a person who traveled the world and had conversations with many of the affluent people in business and also military, he had a chance to know about war, the effects of war and was tired of war.

But as he seeked to form a working bond between American and Soviets, it would backfire on him as he would be branded a communist.  Anyone who dare side with him, would also be branded a communist and unfortunately, many people in the entertainment industry were automatically judged to be communist but Chaplin would be remembered not just as a silent film star icon but also an actor persecuted by the U.S. Govt. and never allowed to come home until 1972, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered Chaplin an Honorary Award and would be Chaplin's first time in the U.S. after 20-years since his re-entry to the U.S. was revoked.  And a standing ovation that would last 12-minutes, the longest in Academy's history.  Chaplin would also be awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975.

So, as we look back at ""Monsieur Verdoux"" and many see this film as a masterpiece, you can't help but feel a bittersweet attitude towards the film.  Primarily because how poorly the film was received because of his treatment by the U.S. government but also the large amount of negative press that he received.

Chaplin tried his best to defend the film.  A film that cost him two million dollars and took seven years to make.  But it was his drive to tell a story about how a poor French clerk who lost his job due to the Depression looked at wooing wealthy women, marrying them and murdering them as a way to support the wife and child that he does love.  In his mind, that contemporary civilization is making mass murderers of us all.

While the film is a comedy, Chaplin knew the state of how things were in America and the world at the time.  After a major World War, these were serious times in which he felt he could use his personality for good and at 58, there was no need for the tramp as he could not play the popular character all his life.  But it was his opportunity to create pity for all humanity as he would say, ""in the drastic circumstances of present-day living"".

Charlie Chaplin in ""Monsieur Verdoux"" is wonderful.  His ability to play a character that is calm, collected but able to pursue multiple women by using his charm and trying to find anyway he can to get their money.

Meanwhile, as much as he has been able to travel and marry or have relationships with many married women in his life, some he manages to kill, some he doesn't (because he doesn't know how to get them to give him access to the money), we are introduced to another character, a girl (portrayed by Marilyn Nash) who has been released from prison and receives inspiration from the one man who tries to help her and most of all, listen to her...Monsieur Verdoux.  Her character has become an important and pivotal character towards the end of the film but it's the planning of the characters in the film that make ""Monsieur Verdoux"" a fascinating film and at times a comedy.

Most of the comedy is derived from the scenes featuring comedian Martha Raye as Annabella Bonheur, a wisecracking, blunt and yet wealthy woman with a laugh of a hyena.  But in addition to Bonheur, we have appearances by William Frawley (best known as Fred Mertz in the sitcom ""I Love Lucy"") and Fritz Leiber, Sr.

But the work and performance of Charlie Chaplin is incredible.  If anyone was able to get away from his well-known ""Tramp"" role, we as audiences of today, recognize that Chaplin was successful.  Unfortunately, because of the release of the film during his worse time of his personal life, the film would not receive the recognition then, as it does now.

So, we go back to the question of whether a film about an amoral mass murderer should be regarded as wonderful cinema, especially among the many masterpieces in his oeuvre.  I have to say yes.  We  sympathize with Verdoux, but we know that as much as his amoral perspective is only justifiable to him but not to the masses, it's because Verdoux was a man who knew he did wrong but he was the product of society and that he will not be the only one with that mindset.

But as a society who believes one man who kills any is a murder, what of a country that kills many more for the sake of war or business.  Is he any different?

As for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release, the film delivers the most beautiful version of this film to date.  The special features are also important in introducing people to what Charlie Chaplin was enduring in his personal life and his career at the time but also featuring interviews with people who knew him.

Overall, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" is another magnificent Charlie Chaplin Blu-ray release but is also a film that is deserving of its recognition as a true Charlie Chaplin cinematic masterpiece. Highly recommended!",1364601600,9,12804,4.9148837209302325

Ambiguous about the ultimate fate of these true loves, this film continues Chaplin's judgemental rush toward the financial, emotional, and societal murder of innocents as clearly deliniated within his pre-execution rant for the audience. "" If you kill one person you are a murderer, if you kill many, you are a hero"" (sic). Assisting in his own capture to confront his life's choice, Chaplin, perhaps more than in any other of his projects allows us to delve into his mind and explore his thoughts concerning societal ills and contradictions. Not since his expressive eloquence at the end of ""The Great Dictator"" have we been able to see so clearly into the mind of this enigmatic, singular genius whose footsteps we still pitter patter after all of these years. Blu ray will certainly enhance the experience, but it is from the story told and the lessons presented where this film's strengths lie. The ""tramp"" in this film has forgone his cane and derby and wallowed into the depths of one whose life has lost all meaning within an increasingly and sistine spinning globe.

1082413,3,6305837104,"<strong>Monsieur Verdoux</strong> (Charles Chaplin, 1947)

<em>Monsieur Verdoux</em>, which sprang from a falling-out Chaplin had with Orson Welles (more on that in a few), was Chaplin's favorite of his films. It was his first in seven years, the longest period to date between Chaplin films (and the second-longest ever), it landed him one of his surprisingly few Oscar nominations (for Best Original Screenplay; he lost to Sidney Sheldon, of all people, for <em>The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer</em>, and the three other films nominated that year you've never even heard of), etc. For all that, it was a monumental flop at the box office, the post-WW2 equivalent of <em>Heaven's Gate</em>. Like that film, <em>Monsieur Verdoux</em> is a good deal better than you may have heard it is. On the other hand, don't go into it expecting another <em>Modern Times</em>, or for that matter another <em>Heaven's Gate</em> (a movie every critic <em>outside</em> the US finally seems to have given its due as one of the great American movies).

The plot of the film is based loosely on the life of Henri D&eacute;sir&eacute; Landru, the Bluebeard Killer (the first of, to date, four movies based on Landru's life), who started off scamming wealthy widows he met through the lonelyhearts pages, then progressed to marrying them, getting their wills changed, and bumping them off. Before his four-year spree ended, Landru had killed eleven widows. As we open, Henri Verdoux (Chaplin), a banker who'd been laid off from his job thanks to the economic crash, has just killed one of his victims, tossed her body in the incinerator, and then gone back to happily trimming his rose bushes, avoiding stepping on a caterpillar on the way back to the house. A lovely man indeed. Once her fortune is collected (and subsequently invested; Verdoux plans to support his legitimate family through the stock market), Verdoux puts the house on the market, and we see how he interacts with other human beings. (He's not as nice to them as he is to caterpillars.) The movie is concerned with Verdoux's cycle of marrying-and-murdering, naturally, and he gets himself hitched to some real shrews for comic relief, but the real meat of the story comes when Verdoux meets the nameless woman (as so many of his female leads are) known in the credits only as The Girl (Marilyn Nash, in one of only two of her big-screen roles, the other in a forgettable sci-fi film), whom he lures back to his Paris apartment in order to experiment with a new poison he's concocting, only to let her go. (This becomes important later, for reasons that are spoilerific, but lead to a great deal of the movie's comedy.)

It's not a bad film by any means, and if you're a Chaplin fan you'll enjoy it a great deal simply because it's Chaplin (and, according to Robert Lewis, the Chaplin film over which he had the most control: he not only directed, starred, produced, casted, and composed, but supervised every other aspect, from costume design to ""crawl[ing] around on the floor with a knfe, scraping up bits of old chewing gum stuck to the floor""). But the story behind the Welles/Chaplin rivalry that birthed the film in its present form is in many ways more interesting than the movie itself. Welles originally wrote the script and approached Chaplin with it; Welles was to direct, Chaplin to star. Now remember, this was still the forties, when everything Orson Welles touched turned to gold; he'd just come off <em>Kane</em> and <em>The Magnificent Ambersons</em>, and what Orson wanted, Orson got. Except Chaplin, that is. After reconsidering, Chaplin is reported to have told Welles that ""no one else has ever directed me, and I'm not going to change that now"". We do know that Chaplin bought the script from Welles (who would later say he parted with it because it was ""one of my minor works"", which may well have been sour grapes) for five thousand bucks, rewrote some of it, and made it into <em>Monsieur Verdoux</em>. How different would this movie have been had Welles directed it? There's no way we can ever get an answer to that question, of course, but Welles was capable of getting such greatness out of even our most iconic actors (Charlton Heston in <em>Touch of Evil</em>, Edward G. Robinson in <em>The Stranger</em>, and Anthony Perkins in <em>The Trial</em> are only three obvious examples) that one can only salivate while imagining what he would have done with someone as brilliant as Chaplin.

As with most black comedies, note that some of the laughs are bound to sound more like uncomfortable chuckles, especially in the first half; the second is more reminiscent of the little tramp and his slapstick days (the chase scene in the dance-hall could have been filmed in 1920, save the sound). But in the end, it's still Charlie Chaplin, and you'll still like it. ***",1310947200,,4837,4.909535452322738
1082414,4,6305837104,"""One murder makes a villain; millions, a hero. Numbers sanctify, my good fellow"".

Chaplin pulled few punches in his most cynical film, Verdoux. He abandoned his early poor scamp/tramp image and became the dashing villain, no doubt to the chagrin of many old fans. Chaplin basically mocks capitalism and its attendant greed here, and does so quite well. He himself called this his favorite picture.

There are indeed plenty of sardonic laughs here, and Chaplin is all too perfect as Verdoux. But I got rather tired of it about half way through; perhaps that's my issue and not the film's. When almost no character in the film is very sympathetic, however, it's hard for me to keep too focused. The redemption seems to come when he decides not to poison the young lady he just met on the street after her touching speech about life's little joys; after that it's mostly mild slapstick until his final speech in court about society and governments as the greatest murderers.

There are some hidden little comic gems here, my favorite of which was the passing introduction of a man at the wedding; he looks just like Freud and is called Monsieur Contrepere (""against father""). It's breezed right by with zero sign of it even being a joke; Chaplin's faith in the intelligence of his viewers was always high. He's also to be commended for taking on the phoniness of killing for country in 1947, when America and England were still all aglow from Defeating Evil in WWII. That all killers are evil to some degree was hardly a message anyone wanted to hear then, and still now, in fact. Those truths give Verdoux a certain shine of unpopular honesty that serves it well as times goes by.

It struck me watching this that Chaplin's career has been mirrored to some extent by Woody Allen's. Early light comedies give way to darker themes as the decades pass, and both fell in love with and married a teenager when they were in their fifties, to great public censure. This prompted each to make a few scathing black comedies about the phoniness of society. Somehow I think that, like Chaplin, Allen will be assessed as a national treasure as he nears death, and once gone will be seen as a true genius of cinema. In that light, Verdoux is Chaplin's Lies And Misdemeanors: not very popular at the time but later seen as a real cult classic, with thematic fangs and claws sharp and accurate in both.

This dvd has a fine transfer and a few decent extras, including a nice little doc on the movie and Chaplin, and many posters and trailers. The scenes of Paris are clearly mostly backlot stuff, but look good in the crisp black and white here, with plenty of black depth.

I liked Verdoux and it's certainly a well-shot and written film, but truthfully I doubt that I'll want to see it again. The laughs are too few and the darkness too deep. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have seen it and would recommend it to any fan of Chaplin for another side of his genius, and to anyone who enjoys a truly black comedy.",1280793600,2,2990,4.589887640449438
1082415,5,6305837104,"The brilliant Charlie Chaplin only made five sound movies (well, five with sync sound), but 3 of them are masterpieces, 1 is a good movie, and one is awful (his final film, A Countess from Hong Kong).  This one is the most fascinating, sinister, and acidic of the lot.  In fact, it's Chaplin's darkest film, a stinging satire of capitalism and war.  When it first appeared, most were shocked that the little tramp would play a murderer who killed to support his wife and children, who he really loved (the character is based on the infamous/famous Bluebeard).  Chaplin's performance here is so good that you wish he had played more sound roles.  His voice is quite commanding, and he commands the screen just like in his silent classics.

There are many great scenes here.  My favorite one (and the most poignant one) is when Verdoux takes in a destitute woman.  He plans on testing a new poison on her, but he is truly moved by her story, so he spares her life.  It's quite a remarkable, moving scene, one of the best Chaplin has ever done.  The dialogue, direction, and look of the film makes this one of Chaplin's most complex, artistic, and underrated films.  It is a dark comedy made in an era that didn't appreciate dark comedies as much as they are today.

1082416,5,6305837104,"I expected to be somewhat bored, or at least lulled into a trance, viewing this black-and-white ""talkie"" from an aging Charlie Chaplin. However, this film slowly drew me in, until I was thoroughly engrossed by ""The End"".
 A comedy of wit and foible, married to one of the greatest moral questions ever put forth to the human race and its' overlords, with a snap and pazzaz far ahead of its' time; Chaplin's work here is trully a two-fold story.
 Those wishing to see a young Chaplin cut capers will be disappointed, but Charlie shows here that he is indeed a multi-faceted comedian, capable of bearing up under the duelling pressures of having to work outside of the ""Little Tramp"" persona, and in a ""talkie"".
 We see ol' Chas., clad in upper-crust Parisian panache, bilk his way through the disenchanted aftermath created after being deposed from his thirty year stint as a bank teller.
 (Bluebeard: A fairy tale charcter from the Charles Perrault collection. The character is a monstrous villian who marries seven women in turn and warns them not to look behind a certain door of his castle. Inside the room are the corpses of his former wives. Bluebeard kills six wives for their disobedience before one passes the test.)
 We see him poison a bitter old broad with cool indifference, then fall victim to the guiles of a smart-mouthed, middle-aged, New Yawkish dame, played to comedic genius by Martha Raye, who roars through her scenes with typical flair and petulance. ( Their scenes together are some of the film's most overtly humorous, as Verdoux struggles like hek to bump off the feisty broad.)
 We are allowed to see Verdoux's real family scenario, a young boy and his invalid mother, who is confined to a chair; but not really long enough to make any emotional bonds to these characters. Chaplin undoubtedly did not want viewers to be preoccupied with Verdoux's sorrow, as to take away from his larger points on the topic of governmentally controlled and instigated mass murder.
 ""I devoted my existence to you, o benevolent oversee-ers of Business and State, and you turned me out. I follwed your example, by surviving and profiting from the grim misfortunes of others, and now, you wish for my blood. I stand guilty, ready and willing to pay. Will you also pay?""
 And of course the answer is always, ""No. F*** no!"" A message for deaf minds, and ears that cannot hear.
 I highly recommend, thoroughly enjoyable family fun. Would recommend for your next visit with that elderly neighbor or shut-in, who will remember Chaplin from their youth, and smile, with the pale, transfixed, murky eyes of glue at the tube, for a couple blessed hours of companionship.
 As the film philosophizes, ""We need love when we are young, companionship as we grow old."" Perhaps.

""Monsieur Verdoux"" managed to shock the American middle class, but not in the way its maker had intended... The public connected the distasteful message of this ""crazy"" film with vague memories of scandals in Chaplin's personal life and his supposed left-wing leanings...

The screen's greatest actor, its most important creative figure, the most famous man in its history, known to more of his contemporaries than even the central figures of the great religions, Chaplin for the first time tasted defeat and failure...

""Limelight,"" which appeared five years later, was booked into only 3,000 theaters instead of the 12,000 which in earlier days had always been eager for any Chaplin film...

1082437,5,6305837104,"It's hard to believe this film once had such an awful reputation and was considered extremely politically dangerous.  Times have really changed for the better since 1947.  This is Chaplin's first full dialogue film, even though 'The Great Dictator' was his first sound film.  As is pointed out in the documentary, that film seems to go back and forth between dialogue scenes and silent scenes.  This film was the first film he wrote expressly as a dialogue film, with much less of the pantomimic scenes hearkening back to his earlier work.  It's also just as funny and brilliant as his earlier masterpieces.

We know right from the opening shot of the film what the fate of Henri Verdoux was, since we see a grave bearing his name and the years he lived.  The film that follows tells us the story of just how and why he got there.  Monsieur Verdoux is a bluebeard (an old-fashioned slang word for a man who marries and then murders one woman after another), something he never foresaw himself as.  For much of his adult life he worked as a successful bank clerk, but then came the world Depression, and he lost his job.  Society didn't seem to have any other use for him, at least not anything that would enable him to make as much money as he needed to support his young son Peter and his disabled wife Mona.  I suppose this story was considered controversial in its day because Monsieur Verdoux is portrayed as sympathetic, charming, and intelligent, with understandable reasons for what he's doing.  He's not shown as a cold-blooded killer who murders these women for their money for the fun of it or because he's a sadistic monster.  He does what he feels he has to do because there is no other way.  And as we see, he isn't incapable of having a change of heart, such as when the young woman he was going to use as his test subject for the new poison he mixed reveals that she is in much the same situation as he is.  He decides to spare her and help her.  There are also the hilarious scenes in which he's trying and failing to murder Annabella, which are among the film's highlights and illustrative of why the subtitle is 'A Comedy of Murders.'  The ending scene of the film (which was the first scene Chaplin shot, wanting to get the hardest part out of the way first), an attack on a system that rewards mass murderers and capitalist robber-barons but condemns people who are driven to murder because that very system cheats them, instead of celebrating them as they do people who go to war, almost made me change my mind about supporting the death penalty.  Since I share many of Chaplin's political views, I didn't find this film to be overly preachy or like the comedy were ruined by working in a moral and political message as well.  I felt it was seamlessly worked in instead of totally dominating the story, and besides, the reason so many people in 1947 hated this film was because it challenged what they believed and held as absolute truth, and that offended them.  Instead of listening to a different viewpoint with an open mind, they chose to boycott and trash this film instead.",1132185600,7,3100,4.5413669064748206
1082438,5,6305837104,"Outrageously funny in parts, and heartbreakingly poignant in others, Charlie Chaplin's MONSIEUR VERDOUX is a masterpiece from a master artist. It is also Chaplin's most controversial film and was a notable flop at the American box-office. Often called ""ahead of its time,"" it might more accurately be described as ""coming at the wrong time,"" given the hostility that received it in a paranoid and red-baiting postwar America. Chaplin himself, however, described MONSIEUR VERDOUX as ""the cleverest and most brilliant"" film of his career. I concur.

Subtitled ""A Comedy of Murders,"" this wry satire features Chaplin as Henri Verdoux, a cynical Paris bank employee who loses his job during the Great Depression. Faced with supporting his beloved invalid wife and the young son he adores, Verdoux effortlessly slips into a new career; faking a job that requires travel, he courts and marries rich widows in other cities and then murders them for their money. Verdoux remains fastidious and dispassionate in his new career, describing himself simply as ""small businessman in murder.""

The widows that are preyed upon are universally depicted as harpies and shrews and Chaplin clearly wanted the audience to sympathize, if not identify, with his Verdoux character. Verdoux is also not without compassion. When he meets a young convict (Marilyn Nash) on whom he wishes to test his latest poison, he is moved by her story, which parallels his own, and he becomes her benefactor instead. On the comedic side, Martha Raye is hilarious as the obstreperous, obnoxious lottery winner Annabella Bonheur, Verdoux's latest wife and potentially his next victim. Yet, she proves impossible to kill while remaining amusingly oblivious to Verdoux's various attempts at her life.

In the end, MONSIEUR VERDOUX becomes a ""message movie,"" Charlie Chaplin's personal indictment of a world that has lost its innocence where there is a decreasing value placed on human life in the wake of two world wars and in the face of the ominous cold war looming on the horizon. The ending is, perhaps, that part of MONSIEUR VERDOUX that most inflamed Chaplin's critics and brought out the ugliest manifestations of American zealotry. Although the film was certainly created to be subversive and as preachy and even patronizing as it gets in parts, the harsh indictments of this film seem hardly justified today. I believe MONSIEUR VERDOUX to be one of the crowning achievements of Charlie Chaplin's career.

In fact, it's a strain on the eyes! The additional star is given only for the extras -- especially the excellent ""Chaplin Today"" documentary. This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together.",1120003200,6,386,5.046875
1082440,4,6305837104,"I have always enjoyed the silent movie career of Charlie Chaplin.  He may still be the greatest actor in the history of American cinema.  His later ""sound"" movies were few and far between owing, I understood, to his political and artistic beliefs.  Many have suggested that ""Monsieur Verdoux"" is the best of his ""sound"" films.  I haven't seen them all so I can't attest to that but I can say that this is a very good movie.

""Monsieur Verdoux"" the story of a (then) modern-day Bluebeard.  It is a movie in a genre that is known as ""black comedy"".  Sometimes black comedy works well (""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"") and some times it just too overdone (""The War of the Roses"" and ""Neighbors"").  In the case of ""Monsieur Verdoux"" it is well done but the movies suceeds as well as it does by changing directions.  There is a point in which Verdoux actually develops a heart and conscience no matter how briefly.  That expression comes back to him in irony after his other world begins falling apart.  It is those scenes in the movie that touched me the most.  As we returned back to the black comedy I began to lose interest and the movie seemed to hasten to its' end.

""Monsieur Verdoux"" is actually a pretty good love story although the message is often obscured by all of Verdoux's nefarious hijinks.  It is a movie that tells us that love and kindness still hold the key to a bright tommorrow.  Discard these personal qualities and life is merely a house of cards.  Embrace them and they will lead you to life's happy ending.  I guess the whole movie was needed to tell the story so effectively so I'll quit complaining about too much Bluebeard and not enough Little Tramp.",1118534400,5,1688,4.5364238410596025

Verdoux is a moral fable placed just after the stock-market crash with vivid notations about the rise of the fascism and bitter reflections . He is a clerk bank who turns in murderer for one goal .

To my mind this one of the four immortal aces of Charlot with the other three works the Gold Rush , Modern times and Lights of the City ;

For many cult movies lovers this is the winner .

A must all the way!",1103068800,,540,4.018691588785047
1082442,5,6305837104,"Many people seem to have a hard time stomaching this movie, I think in large part because, despite all possible warning to the contrary, people go see this movie with the idea that it will be like Chaplin's earlier movies, with him playing a character that either symbolizes human virtue or directly espouses Chaplin's views.  These people are sorely dissapointed, because Chaplin's character, Monsieur Verdoux, is neither virtuous, nor does he express Chaplin's personal ideology.  In fact, sometimes people come out of this still holding the point of view that this is just a regular Chaplin movie and are disgusted with Chaplin's apparently murderous tendencies!

  The basic plot has been oulined here many, many times, and I don't think anything can be gained from going over it again; I will simply provide my views on what the characters mean so that those who watch this movie for the first time can at least go into it without drastic misconceptions.  Verdoux is a French bank clerk layed off as a result of the depression, he sees no alternative but to marry women, obtain their assets, and murder them, in order to support his family.  He loves his family (son and invalid wife) dearly, but despite this is cynical about the world, viewing it as a hostile place where one has to be hostile in return to survive in it.  NOTE: Chaplin is NOT Verdoux (although they have some similarities: more on this later), at least, Verdoux is not Chaplin's vision of an ideal human being.  In fact, Chaplin's ideal, which in earlier films took the form of the Tramp, is most nearly expressed by a female ex-con that Verdoux runs into.  I forget exactly what she says, but one essential point is that a little kindness can make the world a wonderful place.  Her optimistic world view is at direct odds with Verdoux's cynicism, and in fact Verdoux tells her that her optimism is corrupting his philosophy.  There is much else that I could say about the themes of Monsieur Verdoux, but it is better if you simply see the movie, which I highly recommend.

  Looking at the film in a fair and balanced way, however, it does have flaws.  The only one of real importance to me is that Chaplin makes the character of Verdoux too sympathetic, especially at the end, with his statement to the court, which comes off, at least partly, as an excuse for his atrocities, rather than as purely an indictment of the hypocritical, inhuman world he lives in.  My view of Verdoux is that he is a product of the mechanized, impersonal, ungrateful world so briliantly satirized in Modern Times, as inevitable as the Sun rising in the East, and not that he is a wise person (not that his statements at the end are what I would call wise, but they contain elements of wisdom that invite one to place trust in what Verdoux says).  Perhaps at least part of this half-sympathetic portrayal is that Verdoux's disillusionment, his lashing out at a world that has turned his back on him, were traits that Chaplin at this stage in his career deeply identified with, and perhaps he couldn't help but put a little of himself into Verdoux.  At any rate, these minor quibbles are no reason, I think, to deny the film the status of a classic masterpiece.",1092268800,6,3216,4.680284191829485
1082443,5,6305837104,"We hadn't seen Charlie Chaplin in the shoes of the Little Tramp since 1940's The Great Dictator, nor would we again. With the advent of talkies in the late twenties, he went through some difficult changes as modes of production and expectations among audiences grew more and more sophisticated; he said that movies needed sound as much as Beethoven's symphonies needed words, and not surprisingly, his output diminished. But when he did decide to make a movie every other three or four years, such as City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), or his masterpiece, The Great Dictator, they garnered for him terrific financial and critical rewards. Monsieur Verdoux was a flop. By the time it had come out in 1947, Chaplin had been accused in a paternity suit, suspected of being a Communist sympathizer, and in about six years he would leave the country almost for good. It is against this background of increasing paranoia and the beginnings of the Cold War that he shot his darkest comedy.

 It begins with a shot of a tombstone inscribed ""Monsieur Verdoux 1880-1937,"" and Verdoux (Chaplin) tells us through voice-over how he, a French bank clerk, lost his job during the Great Depression and how this forced him to turn to more nefarious methods of supporting his family. Under a variety of aliases, he romances lonely women of means, persuades them to convey their assets to him, and then murders them. There's Thelma, who's already been dispatched by means unknown and whose house Verdoux is putting up for sale; the pompous Madame Grosnay (Isobel Elsom), who initially resists Verdoux's over-enthusiasm, then eventually succumbs to his insistence; the near-harpy Lydia (Margaret Hoffman); and the crass, hate-her-so-much-you-love-her Annabella (Martha Raye). Savor the slap-stick in the rowboat scene where Verdoux repeatedly tries slipping the rope attached to an anchor around Anabella's neck, even tripping and covering his own face with a chlorophorm-soaked kerchief that was meant for her.

 Observe how brilliant Chaplin is at winning us over, right from the first time we see him mundanely pruning his rose garden. He is charming, smart, and his sole reason for becoming a Bluebeard is out of necessity, to support his wheelchair-bound wife and young son. The women he chooses for his prey are all quite abominable, save for one - the Girl, who is never named in the picture. She's just out of prison and without means when Verdoux takes her in and feeds her, and is about to poison her (to end her suffering) when he learns about her diseased invalid husband. Her experiences mirror his own and he can't bring himself to do it.

Overall, it is a grim film. Though it provokes laughter throughout a darkness pervades. Robert Edwards wrote that ""...it's almost as if Chaplin were aware of the negative reception that the film would have, because he carefully links the killings of one man with the mass murder that is war, a recent memory when the film was released in 1947."" Indeed, what a troubling line it must have been for audiences to swallow when Chaplin says in the end ""One murder makes a villain; millions a hero. Numbers sanctify.""  Watch this forgotten, extraordinarily relevant Chaplin classic as soon as you can.",1091836800,3,3235,4.981481481481482
1082444,5,6305837104,"If the willingness to take risks is the mark of a great artist -- and I believe it is -- then Monsieur Verdoux is one of Charles Chaplin's greatest films.  And amidst all the controversy stirred by his portrayal of a serial wife killer, it's easy to forget that it's also a hilarious black comedy with plenty of sharp lines that would have succeeded even without its sociological message.

Chaplin's ability as an actor is pushed to a new level on this film through his portrayal of a morally ambiguous, unscrupulous ex-bank clerk who has no qualms about putting a body into an incinerator in his backyard.  While much has been said about this film's break with Chaplin's Little Tramp character, careful examination reveals that Henri Verdoux is just a logical, and daring, advancement in the character:  The more devilish, sometimes sadistic sides of the Little Tramp taken to their inevitable conclusion, where comic mischief crosses over the line to villainy.  And it's highly compelling, the perfect foil to Chaplin's most heartwarming films (eg. City Lights and Modern Times), allowing Chaplin to express an insidiousness hitherto unexplored.  Martha Raye nearly steals the show as the airheaded, supernaturally unkillable Mme. Bonheur (the name itself means ""happiness""), and Marilyn Nash is winning as the Belgian derelict who inspires a spark of compassion in Verdoux.  The conclusion of this character relationship is one of Chaplin's most complex writing feats:  Imagine the ending of City Lights twisted into a dark, steely, uncompromising version of itself.

There are certain moments when the film does threaten to fall into self-involvement -- in his later years, Chaplin did let his ego take ahold of his work -- but in the case of Monsieur Verdoux, he uses this larger-than-life persona so well, and it fits the character so snugly, that the ego becomes an advantage and adds to the depth of the character.  And the script has none of the self-conscious mix of silent film and talkies that plagued The Great Dictator; Chaplin had grown quite well into dialogue writing, allowing him to formulate moments of murderous irony that are cuttingly funny.  (""Don't pull the cat's tail..."")  I have no problems with the ending speeches in this film as I did with the final speech of The Great Dictator:  In the context of this story, they fit in quite well.  Verdoux at the end is a man who has given up all hope, and he seems to mock his own fate and character while unmercifully unveiling his anger at the world.  The speeches are not meant to be taken for face value, and I find them thought-provoking and fascinating rather than moralistic or self-important.

I first saw this film at Symphony Space in New York City and the audience was laughing so hard it was in tears.  With modern audiences generally less inclined to judge a film by its ""moral standing"" (Kill Bill, anyone?), Monsieur Verdoux can be seen for what it is:  A hilarious, complex sociological examination which identifies social ills while at the same time taking part in it.  In that, it is unique in the Chaplin canon and deserves to rank among his most important films.

A quick note about this DVD edition:  For some reason, the bonus materials for this film are far less numerous than on the other DVDs in this series -- hence the single-disc package and lower price.  By the standards of this series of reissues, the DVD materials are really quite scant -- a useful yet brief half-hour documentary featuring good insight from director Claude Chabrol, a trailer, some storyboards.  The picture and sound are of good quality, however, and the film is one to own.  Highly recommended.",1084492800,45,3667,4.8964401294498385

Monsieur Verdoux is driven to commit murder as he feels determined to provide the best possible life style for his family.  However, Monsieur Verdoux is lost in his determination as it clouds his moral decision making, which he recognizes.  Monsieur Verdoux is the darkest of Charles Chaplin's films, and as in his other films it offers a social message.  This ominous message becomes apparent from the beginning of the film as Monsieur Verdoux's gravestone is depicted in the initial shot with Chaplin's voiceover that embarks on how he ended up here.  Chaplin's direction offers both tragedy and comedy which in the end leaves the audience with a charming, yet disturbing cinematic experience.",1080691200,2,908,5.108108108108108

While his performance is adequate and the scenes with Martha Raye are memorably hilarious, the good moments are mostly surrounded by strained, forgettable, downright unfunny moments. While the message of the film is admirable and sincere, Chaplin gives in to his unsubtle tendancy to beat it to death.
Nevertheless, this Chaplin curio is given a terrific presentation on this new Warner Brothers DVD, which is several notches ahead from the original Image Entertainment DVD. It's very sharp and the black and white image is crisp without many imperfections.

The DVD, released by Image Entertainment, is pretty good. The picture quality is a bit scratchy and grainy, but is better than previous video incarnations. The sound is a bit harsh.

However, the supporting cast ranges from excellent (Martha Raye) to amateurish (Marilyn Nash) while the final minutes get bogged down in endless talk.

1082472,4,6305837104,"That was the campain in the 40's, when the public didn't want to accept this film. After a few weeks of running, it was abandoned in all cinema's.  The people expected a Little Tramp, instead, they got a Bigamist Lady  Killer. En mass they decided to boo the film and stay away.
 However,  this is not what Monsieur Verdoux deserves. In every scene you see  Chaplin's quick brain, keen eye and swift feet at work. Some of the love  scenes are absolutely hilarious, even in this day. Martha Raye (the wife  who refuses to me murdered) is a scream. The film is intended as a parody  on Society prior to WWII; if you watch it with this in mind you'll be able  to enjoy it tremendously.
 Before Chaplin decided to make this film, he  had just gone through one of the most turbulant periods in his life. His  divorse with Paulette, being harrased by a neurotic former love, meeting  Oona and soon to be banned from the States, accused of being a Communist  had taken it toll. Chaplin fought back in the only way he knew how: by  making a comedy to tackle the present cruel (at least to him) society.
