6432789,5,B00KIZYDCI,This is a sumptuous and elegant terrific movie with Tyrone Power at his most dashing with two beautiful ladies. The New Orleans scenes are very picturesque and the story moves with all the excitement of the good old days at the movies. This is a gorgeous Technicolor print on DVD and the Universal Vault Series is far superior to the Fox Cinema Archives. Fox should take lessons. Overall - highly recommended.,1402444800,24,409,4.774647887323944
6432790,5,B00KIZYDCI,"In Mississippi Gambler, Tyrone plays Mark Fallon, a wantabee gambler on the Mississippi. New to New Orleans and the Mississippi river, Mark Fallon (Tyrone Power) meets and falls in love with a stuck up New Orleans aristocrat's daughter (Piper Laurie) and her brother who's not much better. He partners up with John McIntire and gambles up and down the Mississippi and the love for her and the brother's attitude set up the tempo of this movie. A great movie that finally made its way to DVD.",1402444800,6,491,4.72093023255814
6432791,4,B00KIZYDCI,The Mississippi Gambler from director Rudolph Mate and debonair actorTyrone Power is finally released as a MOD DVD by Universal. The picture is not totally restored but the Technicolor print is saturated and vibrant. If you are fan Tyrone Power grab a copy and enjoy. You won't be disappointed!!.,1402099200,17,296,5.061224489795919
6432792,5,B00KIZYDCI,"This was Tyrone Power's first freelance picture after he left 20th Century Fox in 1952 and it's a very good one. Universal International pulled out all the stops with two very attractive leading ladies {Piper Laurie, Julie Adams}, an excellent supporting cast including - John McIntire, Paul Cavanagh, Robert Warwick and a young Guy Williams {a pre TV} ""Zorro and Professor John Robinson from ""Lost in Space"", lavish costume and set design and a screenplay taylored to Ty Power's screen personna.

Ty plays ""Mark Fallon"" a newcomer to New Orleans from New York with the ambition to become a big time gambler BUT with a twist - he'll deal honest cards, won't stoop to cheating and expose {if necessary}  card sharpers that he ""ferrets out' while playing his cards ""fair and square"" !  His ultimate ambition is to open a high class gambling casino with all kinds of  high stakes games, gourmet dining  - a establishment that will cater to men and ladies to gamble, drink, dance and flirt - a 1853 version of a 2018 Las Vegas Casino !!

Along the way he meets a tempestous beauty Angelique Durraud {Piper Laurie} who is a rich, spoiled attention seeking flirt playing off various men {Ty included} off against each other with relish but she will ultimately go one step too far with  disastrous results. BUT STILL it's love at first sight and they eye one another, spar and spark thru-out the movie. The film includes plenty of fighting, fencing, pistol duels, gambling, a pulsating voodoo dance, not one but two love triangle's to sort out with Ty saving a young beauty [Julie Adams} from ruin after her brother commits suicide from losing all their money to him at the card table. She becomes a friend and is mentored by Mark and Polly and falls in love with Mark and lord knows she looks as good as Piper but she is a ""good women"" and Ty loves the high strung, difficult, beauty Angelique - not the placid beauty.

John McIntire {Polly} as the old gambling hand who partners with Mark's ambitions is excellent {as usual} but the real acting surprise is Paul Cavanaugh nicely underplaying his role as Angelique's doting father who understands her passions only too well - in his youth he was a wild and feckless dandy until marriage tamed him. Piper Laurie {aged 21} looks sensational in her period gowns and gives a nice performance as the hotblooded, hot tempered southern belle. Ty Power is smooth, cool, extraordinarily handsome and perfectly underplays his role as the gambler who is equally adept at loving, fencing and fighting.  Ty 's portrayal of a man of ""hot blood and cold brain"" is perfectly realized. Director Rudolph Mate' competently moves the film along and being a first rate cinematographer - ensured that the film was scrumpciously photographed in glorious Technicolor.

This is a really nice film, not a classic but it is a rousing and well mounted period melodrama with nice performances all around and I give it between a 4 1/2 and a 5 star rating - Recommended",1401667200,28,2982,4.750483558994198

6432814,5,B00KIZYDCI,"I have looked for this movie for many years.  As shown, it is part of the Universal Vault Series.  The movie is crisp and clear with vivid colors and good sound.  Tyrone Power was great as the gambler who is determined to succeed as an honest gambler in his own casino.  Most of the action takes place in New Orleans.  This guarantees lots of women in ball gowns, men in tophats and tails.  Of course the is plenty of fighting, double dealing and skullduggery.  The movie has two actress that love Power in Piper Laurie and Julia Adams.  Throw in the recognizable character actors of the day and you have a great little piece of entertainment.  Will the bad guys get Tyrone's fortune?  Who will betray him?  Which woman does he end up with?  Watch the show and be entertained.",1436918400,2,776,4.464285714285714
6432815,4,B00KIZYDCI,"Some trivia here: Tyrone Power met Anita Ekberg on the set of this film and began a long affair with her.  He had a share of profits of Mississippi Gambler, which was a big hit, and it made him over a million dollars.

Power was no dummy - he wasn't crazy about being known as a dashing, romantic swashbuckler, but he also knew how his public wanted to see him.  And they wanted to see him in this. As Mark Fallon, he's an elegant, handsome gambler in love with the beautiful Piper Laurie, who can't admit her own feelings; Julia Adams, the sister of a man who lost to him at cards, is crazy for him.

The ravages of the heart disease that killed him had not yet shown up physically and while the prettiness of his youth is gone, the rugged, exceptional handsomeness remains.  Filmed in color with beautiful costumes, Mississippi Gambler is a treat for the eyes. As if a film starring Tyrone Power could be anything else.",1435708800,,921,4.394117647058824

6432827,4,B00KIZYDCI,"One of the few films he made away from 20th Century Fox, Mississippi Gambler is the story of a down-on-his-luck man who turns his fortunes around by finding his way to a riverboat and becoming a high stakes card sharp. Tyrone Power fans will enjoy having this rarely seen film n their collection.

The Universal Vault series is just like the 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives series - it's just the movie. No chapters, no commentaries, no extras of any type - just the movie.",1415318400,4,474,4.576470588235294

6432833,5,B00KIZYDCI,"One of the best romantic movies of all.  Tyrone Power, a most underestimated actor, plays the hero not in a swashbuckling way.  It is well produced with a lovely, realistic background .",1412294400,,185,4.75
6432834,5,B00KIZYDCI,"A real gem and an excellent period piece too. Good quality picture and sound. This is a movie that never got it's real due. A classic in every sense. Nicely filmed in color with scenes on the Miss. River and in old New Orleans, with lavish sets and wardrobe, romance, dueling, and some excellent sword play as well.

Tyrone Power and Piper Laurie at their best, with an excellent supporting cast; a young, beautiful Julia Adams (some may recognize her from a recurring support role on Murder She Wrote ), the always solid John McIntire and a short appearance by Guy Williams among a slue of other familiar character actors and supporting cast. A slice of an era not often seen in the movies, especially in vivid color. Well worth it!",1412121600,4,733,4.595419847328245
