3822516,1,B001VH7AHM,"This is so poorly done.  There are endless, trite imitations of formatting that we have all seen in documentaries:  the time frame montages, here done poorly; the ""in-talk"" between film crew members (Stay OUT of it.); very limited film and photos of the persons involved, used over and over ad nauseum, and more.  Too much for me to want to discuss.  The music was truly egregious, most often inappropriate, and including an woeful little piece of misery sung (and most likely composed) by the film's writer, director, and narrator, Davey Porter.  Wretched music, wretchedly sung and accompanied by a plink-plink piano.  Lord have mercy.  There were no music credits, but  his voice is unmistakable.
The only affecting parts were the interviews with friends of the family, who managed to bring some life to the Boles family members, but these constitute only a tiny portion of what is presented.
There is also a god-awful ""recreation"" of the murders, completely ridiculous, which is nevertheless clipped from through the whole film.  The ""actors"" are duly credited at the end.
Mr. Porter also managed to interview a former cop-turned-author of a book claiming to have solved the Black Dahlia Murder, whose name I will not state here because I find him a ridiculous gas-bag and will deny him any publicity from this corner.  He sits smugly with a copy of his book displayed prominently behind him, offering stale commentary (which any fan of ""Criminal Intent"" could have provided) attempting to masquerade his vapid musings as significant insights.  He has no knowledge whatsoever of this crime.
Most of the film is a slip-shod, rambling summary of what is known about the murders, which is not a great deal.  In the end, the noose is placed fairly firmly around the neck of a particular person, long-deceased, an action I consider unforgiveable,  particularly in view of the evidence presented in this ""half-fast"" film.
If you are into good documentaries, as I am, this thing is barely watchable.  I did hang in there, but there was no payoff.  Save your shekels, guys.",1403481600,5,2069,4.973837209302325
3822517,5,B001VH7AHM,"This documentary was well done, and provides an in depth look at this terrible crime. It shows alot of rare photos and examines the crime in detail, as well as taking a close look at the possible motives for the senseless murders. I own this documentary on DVD, and am happy to refer people to it.",1366329600,5,297,4.321428571428571
3822518,4,B001VH7AHM,"I had only learned of this incident this passed Thanksgiving and being that I lived so close to this house and didn't know about what had happened, I wanted to see it.  The director did a good job putting all the information together that he found and it's a sad tragedy that happened to this family.  There are few things that instantly popped into my mind though (some questions that were not asked), but it's hard to go back after all these years and try to fit all the pieces together.  Although greed does seem to be the reason based on this documentary, there are other things that may have played a factor in what happened, too!  Just my thoughts!",1355702400,5,654,4.425
3822519,5,B001VH7AHM,I thought this was very good considering how many years have gone by with so little evidence.  You think you know who the murderer (s) might be till the end.  Leaves one with many questions still and possibilities of who the murderer is.  This case should def be revisited by cold case detectives.  With all the new forensic technology they might be able to solve it.  This family deserves justice.,1243641600,8,398,4.628571428571429
3822520,1,B001VH7AHM,"Unfortunately ""Real Crime"" enthusiast buy just ONE too many DVD's in their quest for entertaining investigative documentaries and they happen upon a low budget disaster such as this.

The DVD cover ""teaser"" which asks, ""Who killed this Family?"" should have been enough of a warning of why this crime missed media attention, and should have been passed over by anyone making a serious and professional true crime documentary.  Your answer halfway through this feature will undoubtably be.......""WHO CARES!!!""

Inotherwords..........don't waste your money on this terribly produced, horribly narrated, and completely inaffective film about nothing!",1242086400,3,646,5.851063829787234
8346393,5,B001VH7AHM,I live in Crestline California. I have seen this cabin where the murders were  committed. The makers of this film did a fantastic job analyzing all the details and coming up with one of the original witnesses who changed what he told the police when the crimes were committed The makers of the film have finally put the real truth to these murders.,1494374400,,348,4.523809523809524
8346394,5,B001VH7AHM,"Fast, really happy with seller. Since we live around the corner from where the murders happened, it was interesting to watch. Sad, sad story.",1484006400,,141,4.916666666666667
8346395,3,B001VH7AHM,"This was a good show, I recommend it if you like murder mysteries.",1466380800,,66,4.153846153846154
8346396,2,B001VH7AHM,"Interesting crime....HORRIBLY MADE DOCUMENTARY...Ugh!! Awful narration and tone for a story describing four brutal murders; music not only completely inappropriate, but just plain grating; absolutely irresponsible in relation to time spent on research and presentation of facts...I have an idea -- why don't you try interviewing some of the detectives or other authorities who were actually assigned to the case when it happened???! -- that might be worthwhile wouldn't you think?",1455321600,,480,5.774647887323944

8346398,5,B001VH7AHM,"Very well done documentary. I would like to see more doc's from this film maker, very through and well researched.",1428451200,,114,4.75
8346399,1,B001VH7AHM,"The production quality is the poorest I have seen on Amazon in the past three years.  An example.  A where are they now section starts by showing one of the older couples, without identifying them.  The limited text says something like, ""they currently live in...""  The screen held image for a good 30 seconds.  Then a single person is shown and identified.  That image is gone after 5 seconds.  Another image, this one lasting 2-3 seconds, and then another, also 2-3 seconds.  Why would you not want to spent a half hour in Final Cut or whatever, making the images uniform and with the same timing?  Did the film maker think, ""oh, who is going to care anyway.""  An unbelievable scene had the director driving an SUV with a woman being interviewed sitting in the back seat.  Instead of asking questions, the director is telling her the things he has uncovered.

I mean, come on.",1424736000,2,878,4.593548387096774
8346400,2,B001VH7AHM,"outrageous condemnation, judgment of a dead man based on emotional assumptions and not forensic science. I hope the documentarian has learned more since the release of this, albeit well-done film.",1422662400,2,196,5.566666666666666
8346401,2,B001VH7AHM,"Unsolved murders are always intriguing and disturbing, but this was a very obvious amateur documentary. It wasn't very well made, but the details of the case are nonetheless absorbing.",1413763200,,184,5.379310344827586
8346402,5,B001VH7AHM,I think this is very interesting. Mr. Porter did what seems to be a great deal of research.  Much of it must have taken a great deal of time. The story line was easy to follow and kept me interested. Thanks for the time and care you took to bring this story to light.,1404432000,,267,3.9444444444444446
