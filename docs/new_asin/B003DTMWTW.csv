8427304,2,B003DTMWTW,"As a Kosovo Albanian woman living in the United States I was very excited to see a movie that was discussing my home country and the current situation there. I wanted my husband, who is not Kosovo Albanian, to see it and get better insight on where a came from and what my countrymen were still going through. Unfortunately, the movie was a complete disappointment. While it does portray the grave situation in Kosova, 7 years after the war, the flow of the story is very confusing as it comes and goes from one story to another only to return to the first story without finishing the one prior. Also, the translation was not good, with a lot of words misspelled, a lot of sections not even translated, just a very poor translation job, which was a problem since my husband does not speak Albanian. This movie was very confusing and does not do the current or the past situation in Kosova justice. Therefore,  do not recommend it.",1309132800,2,930,4.535714285714286
