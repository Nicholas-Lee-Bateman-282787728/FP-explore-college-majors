8749147,5,B01B2PVM5S,"Really enjoyed this.  Lots of small ""invisible jiu jitsu"" pointers from Alliance legend Paulo Sergio that I've never seen on a beginner DVD that make all the difference for mastering the fundamentals.  One warning -- this is in French (Sergio is based out of Paris) and is dubbed in English, which is a little different from most BJJ instructionals.",1516492800,,349,4.898305084745763
8749148,5,B01B2PVM5S,"Paulo's instructional DVD set is awesome! It was also a plus that Paulo trained under my instructor Romero Jacare Cavalcanti with Alliance BJJ.
These DVDs allow me to review the exact step by step lessons that I actually perform in the Academy.
Being slightly ADD these lessons keep me in the game and really help me grasp the complexity of BJJ.

Great Buy!",1504742400,,357,4.666666666666667
8749149,4,B01B2PVM5S,"Pros: Excellent instruction, gives numerous angles, provides good instruction on points of invisible jits,
Cons: wish one wore a blue gi and the other a white one because of somewhat low lighting, voice over is in a franaphone accent
Would recommend it",1502928000,,252,5.023809523809524
