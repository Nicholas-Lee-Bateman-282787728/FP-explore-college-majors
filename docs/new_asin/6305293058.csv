7886910,5,6305293058,"Charlie Chaplin's progession as artist was very gradual, as it took thought & reflection on his part to create lasting film works such as the ones at Essanay. His early masterpieces at Essanay, Mutual & First National took the basic forms of slapstick, situation & sentiment, and refined screen comedy into an artform that soon became his classic feature films. But let's back up; this collection is about his days at Essanay.
""The Tramp"" may be his first brush with pathos. Infatuated with a lovely country girl, this is first about The Tramp's escapades working on the farm, then getting his loyalties tested when other tramps want to steal her & her father's money. The film ends with heartbreak as The Tramp discovers the girl already has a beau. The short closes with an iconic shot of The Tramp shuffling down the road to his next adventure. ""By The Sea"" demonstrates Chaplin's talent for taking the most threadbare idea--mischief on the seashore--and expand it into a string of comic encounters & misunderstandings. Pretty much an amusing but ""minor"" Chaplin tale. ""Work"" is exactly what the title implies. Chaplin & company spend the short coping with mean, fussy bosses & perilous physical work. ""A Woman"" actually has Chaplin dealing with more than one woman; even Chaplin himself deceives the males in moments of drag. ""The Bank"" might be the best offering as the short opens with a ""things are not what they seem"" gag of Chaplin opening a bank vault with authority..only to get his mop & pail (he's a janitor, of course). The short even delves into some suspense when The Tramp must fend off robbers. The final short, ""His Regeneration"", isn't really a Chaplin short--The Tramp makes a brief cameo (hence the opening title card's declaration of ""assisted by Charlie Chaplin""). Instead, it's a melodrama about two thieves, one of which decides to reform at the end.
Yet another fascinating glimpse into early Chaplin. I'm anxiously awaiting Volume 3!",1350950400,2,1961,4.945454545454545
7886911,4,6305293058,"I love Charles S. Chaplin. In the sixties, TV sets were not so common as they are today and the only way for me to see films then was to be invited to go to the movies or to attend the weekly movie of the school's cine-club. Fortunately, our teacher had a good taste and I had the luck to discover Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon, Charles Chaplin and many others during this period. OK ! It was Nostalgy time and it's over.
The overall quality of Madacy's CHAPLIN #2 shows a little improvement in comparison with the #1 that was one of the worst DVDs I have seen in the streets. Not that Madacy has suddenly decided to clean the copies but because I suppose that the available copies were simply in a better shape. It's always under-average quality but let's rejoice anyway ! Furthermore, the music is rather agreeable this time. At last, the program presented here is very interesting and cannot be compared with the three shorts presented in the first volume.
CHARLIE'S RECREATION (1914) allows us to see Chaplin before the tramp disguise and creation that will make a star from him. But it's WORK (1915) that, alone, justifies the US$ 7 you will have to pay for the DVD. One of the first masterpieces of the genius.
A DVD for the archeologists ones.",1055808000,4,1249,4.506607929515418
7886912,5,6305293058,"First of all, I am reviewing the Image dvd of Chaplin's Essanay Comedies, Vol. 02. The Madacy product that this review might appear on is grossly inferior to this edition, and is to be shunned with all your might.
We have here five Chaplin films and a guest appearance. The guest appearance is forgettable, as is the rest of the movie that the appearance is in. Two of these films are Chaplin treading water, ""By the Sea"" and ""A Woman"". ""A Woman"" is only important for trivial reasons, because Chaplin makes his last appearance in drag, with astonishing results.
The other films, though, are key to the Chaplin legacy. ""Work"" is his most political statement yet, with it's condemnation of bosses and managers via Charlie's boss, who sits in the back of a cart while Charlie draws it forwardthrough streets and up impossible hills. This film is so ridiculous that you wonder how on earth it came together to fit so well.
""The Bank"" is important in that we have a truly sad ending, with Charlie's unrequited love rejected twice, and reasons for his hopes to get up twice too.
""The Tramp"" is Charlie's most important Essanay film, the one that establishes his tramp as a character with depth. This film is more than a collection of gags, it's a story, and the ending is a shock. Chaplin would later learn how to engender his audience's sympathies before the end of the film, but in this film, we cannot help but feel sorry for the tramp, as he walks out of the picture in one of his most famous scenes ever.
These films were painstakingly restored by David Sheperd's ""Film Preservation Associates"" after a ten-year search for footage. What we have is the most complete versions of the Chaplin Essanay films possible, something that hasn't been seen in almost 80 years. This means, however, that sometimes the scene in a film will change dramatically, from a clear, good print to a worse, grainy, and scratchy print, and back again. But we must put up with such defects if we expect to enjoy these films at all, for the alternative is to see prints which, while consistent, are missing somtimes 20% of the footage originally in the film
The scores are well done, and the video compression is excellent.
And now for the rant, hinted at above...
It is possible to see these same films in a much cheaper edition from Madacy or Koch video, or numerous other companies. Don't do it. These companies have taken poor quality sources, sometimes cutting out a fifth of the frame, added lousy soundtracks, and thrown their product out in nice looking packaging for low prices. This product is unsatisfactory, though, as it is difficult to watch, and really doesn't show Chaplin in a good light. Do search out dvds made by the Image company, or tapes made by Kino, becuase these companies have the restorations that are worth watching. You will be glad you did!",1016064000,38,2846,4.682634730538922
7886913,5,6305293058,"I am only a teenager and like most boys my age I love toilet humor.
So when my Social Studies teacher said we will be watching some Charlie Chaplin videos I was a little closed minded like everyone else.
The video we watched was Work, and just after about 5 minites of watching I was a Chaplin fan. The gags in the short little flim are ever bit as fun and funny as the day they were released. Some of my classmates just fell asleep, because they're too closed minded, but I would still recomened this stuff to any person young and old. He will give an ear to ear grin on the front of your melon. Chaplin rules.",1015372800,16,611,4.142857142857143
7886914,5,6305293058,"This is the long awaited  ""restored"" version of Charlie Chaplin's Essanay comedies.  Unfortunately when I say ""restored,"" I mean to the best quality possible; Chaplin himself had the original negatives incinerated when he moved from California to Europe in the early 1950's.  He was unable to have all of his work shipped over seas.  This was the case for both the Essanay films and the Mutual Films.  The First National films as well as his feature films were the ones that he kept. When they restored the Essanay and the Mutual films, they tried to find the earliest prints in the best condition that were still available.  This means that some films or parts of films will be in better condition than others.  In the case of the Mutual films alternate takes were used in the film restoration process (a Chaplin employee had kept footage that was supposed to be thrown away).  Even though extra footage doesn't exist for the Essanay comedies, the ""Chaplin's Essanay Comedies Vol. 1, 2, and 3"" on DVD (manufactured through Image Entertainment) are probably the highest quality that you will ever see for these films. They were restored through David Shepard's company ""Film Preservation Associates,"" who restored the Chaplin Mutual films (available on DVD from Image Entertainment in three volumes) several years ago. Also, they created new musical scores by Robert Israel and Eric James which fit the tone of each of the films in the collection.  It's amazing that these films still survive in as good a condition as they are in.
For the films themselves, this is classic comedy at its finest.  Both ""The Tramp"" and ""A Burlesque on `Carmen' "" are among my favorite Chaplin films.  But, all of these films still  maintain their entertainment value even after 86 years.  You won't be able to sit through one without laughing at the predicaments that Charlie gets himself into and then gets himself out of.",993600000,20,1905,4.87888198757764
