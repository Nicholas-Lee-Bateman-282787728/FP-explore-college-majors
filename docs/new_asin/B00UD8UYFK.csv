8705451,5,B00UD8UYFK,"For those who have a rowing machine, this is good. The pace is smooth and quickish and keeps you moving. Rowing along the beach seemed a little strange at first but it works well. There is also footage of waves coming into the beach that are great and really make you feel like you are there. The scenery is beautiful and there is scattered footage of the local people and their boats. I would recommend this as a way to add some fun to your rowing routine.",1467504000,,457,4.264367816091954
8705452,5,B00UD8UYFK,"My wife and I just used the Tribord masks in Belize and Majahaul and we loved them. Just as advertised, no leaks, no fogging, and incredible clear wide view. I dove to 12' a few times and had no trouble. We are experienced snorkelers and have tried scuba but this is all I will use from now on!",1460937600,,294,4.086206896551724
8705453,5,B00UD8UYFK,"Brilliant blue skies, pristine sand and endless waves of beautiful turquoise ocean, it just doesn't get any better than that.  There are the three twenty minute walks that all of the Virtual Walks DVDs offer.  Each walk offers different beach scenes some are tranquil, others have the occasional tourist or fishing village.  There are palm trees and other vegetation to look at during your brisk walk on the beach.

This is a HD DVD that offers high resolution with excellent clarity and bright color.  Each walk can be looped individually or as a group for an extended workout.  The sound is realistic and relaxing.  I enjoy my morning walk with my Gazelle (exercise machine)much more with this DVD.  I highly recommend these Virtual Walks DVDs.  I own several of them and love them all.  If you really want to set the mood try adding an ocean scented candle to the exercise room...",1434758400,3,883,4.75
8705454,4,B00UD8UYFK,"Definitely more for a treadmill stroll than a spin session, but scenery is lovely and kept me pedaling.  Audio is sounds of the waves rolling in and receding and scenery changes enough to keep me interested enough to want to see what's up ahead.",1433203200,,245,4.568181818181818
8705455,4,B00UD8UYFK,Good DVD and shot in HD with good stabilization. There are more people on the beaches than shown in the Virtual Walks Paradise and Tropical Beach DVD's. Personally I prefer the lonely sand walks in those than seen in this Thailand Beaches. I would recommend you download the 1080P MP4's of these 3 walks available on Vimeo. Looks MUCH better in true 1080P on a 720/1080 TV (using usb stick) than getting the DVD with Standard Definition 480P on the DVD even if your player/TV has upscaling. No comparison.,1432339200,,505,4.685393258426966
8705456,5,B00UD8UYFK,"This DVD is perfect for someone who is looking for blue sky and endless beaches. Here you can enjoy the sun while running on the beach. You can run closely to the water and you can see the sparkling blue sea. There are palm trees blowing in the wind, but also other green vegetation can be seen, forming a magnificent contrast with the sea. From time to time you can encounter a few fishermen with their boats and occasionally there are a few tourists on the beach. The natural sounds of the waves accompany you while jogging, this makes the workout more realistic. I really enjoyed the DVD, working out is perfect with it, especially since I have no opportunity to briefly go to a beach or for a walk. You simply insert the DVD into your player and you can start your workout and you immediately have a holiday mood. Definitely recommendable.",1431561600,2,843,4.516339869281046
8705457,5,B00UD8UYFK,"Surprisingly, these 3 x 20 min walks are quite different.  The beaches are all absolutely beautiful, and the turquois colour of the water is just a dream!  You hear nothing but the sound of the ocean and small waves lapping the shore.  You even walk through the water in some instances and one can hear the water splashing underfoot. The landscape is somewhat different in each walk and you find total solitude in one, and a few suprises in the others, like a tiny fishing village with its unusally decorated boats.  Rockeries, fallen palm trees and a few sun-worshipers lying on the sand.  There is also the ocassional stop to admire the stunning views.  The pace is that of a brisk walk and Walk 2 has a faster pace, that would suit someone wanting a light jog.  The camera stabilisation is great!  You can watch a trailer of these walks on the producers website www.worldnaturevideo.com where you can also buy the digital download version for each walk instead of the DVD.  I use my Apple TV with the digital downloads from this company and they work very well with it. Stunning HD quality!",1429747200,7,1093,4.6217616580310885
