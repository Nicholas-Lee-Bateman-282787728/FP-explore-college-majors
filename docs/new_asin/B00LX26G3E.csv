8668666,1,B00LX26G3E,Cover would make you think Bruce Lee is on all 9 movies.  THAT IS NOT THE CASE!  This is a pack of b movies from back in the day.  You will not get the kung fu you are thinking when you hear Bruce Lee.  You will get confuse on how bad the acting is and how people were paid good money to do these crap-hole-movies.,1486252800,,314,3.7846153846153845
