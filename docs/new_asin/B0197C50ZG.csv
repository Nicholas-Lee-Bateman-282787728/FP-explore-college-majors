7565079,1,B0197C50ZG,"STORY VERY POORLY WRITTEN, ACTORS NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT! CHOATIC BEGINNING, DIDN'T GET ANY FURTHER THAN THAT. A WASTE OF MY MONEY.",1459209600,,134,4.869565217391305
7565080,4,B0197C50ZG,Difficult subject matter  portrayed well by actors,1458259200,,50,6.142857142857143
7565081,5,B0197C50ZG,"This is a deeply moving film. The cast does an incredible job and obviously invests themselves fully. The dedication to their characters shines in every scene. This film should have been more widely publicized. So many films are special effects and similar plot lines, but Bad Hurt opens the vault of authentic storytelling to bring back what has been missing in Hollywood for so long. Great job.",1457827200,2,396,4.925373134328358
7565082,5,B0197C50ZG,"Great acting, real life drama, not a ""happy"" film, but a must see.",1457481600,,66,4.153846153846154
7565083,5,B0197C50ZG,"If ever a mother had her hands full, it's Karen Allen's ""Elaine"" in ""Bad Hurt."" As I've heard other people mention, the acting in this film is especially fine - so much so, that parts of the movie almost seem like a documentary. There is a lot to take in and to take away from ""Bad Hurt"" and I recommend it for everyone ages 18 and over. Without giving away any details, the ending brings things together nicely (well, as nicely as you could, given the story!) and you have high hopes for everyone.",1457395200,,498,4.308510638297872

7565087,5,B0197C50ZG,The entire film was a tearful joy.,1456185600,,34,4.0
8744310,1,B0197C50ZG,"Over acted. Depressing. Characters are  neurotic and annoying.
I believe this is supposed to be a realistic portrayal of life. If that is the case these people need psychiatric evaluation and some
serious life skill counselling.
So bad could not watch it to the end.",1532476800,,266,4.911111111111111
8744311,5,B0197C50ZG,"I know these people in my own life, and at least some of their unremitting pain. I don't know if I'd still be standing if I experienced any more of the sadness and trouble they do, and yet the story rings true. An incredible ensemble cast is the likely explanation for the sheer empathic force of this film: every time I tried to single out one actor -- father, mother, two sons, daughter, supporting characters even -- for highest praise, I realized that each was pulling out all the stops on his or her performance, and yet all were pulling together.",1510444800,,552,4.475247524752476
8744312,5,B0197C50ZG,One hell of a great movie.  Get it!!,1469923200,,36,3.5
8744313,3,B0197C50ZG,Acting was very good. Story way too depressing. I'd take a pass,1468454400,,63,4.333333333333333
8744314,4,B0197C50ZG,"I enjoyed this film; nicely written and acted.  Families are difficult topics to watch as dysfunctions often can hit close to home.  But real life, nonetheless, and powerful dynamics in trying to get through it all.",1467676800,,215,4.944444444444445
8744315,4,B0197C50ZG,"a sad and yet inspirational story about a family's love for one another, and how that love makes all things bearable Highly recommended, but still quite sad.",1466640000,,157,4.851851851851852
8744316,4,B0197C50ZG,"This is a very sad movie.  It is well done, well filmed, and very realistic.  The performances were very moving and realistic.  Theo Rossi is great in a character different from his Sons of Anarchy role.  Karen Allen is luminescent in a mother's grief and love.

It is a serious drama which moves at a gradual pace.  At the climax I realized there were still 30 mins left.  30 mins that were even more sad.  And then you are left with a smile on your face at the end.",1466208000,,467,4.168539325842697
