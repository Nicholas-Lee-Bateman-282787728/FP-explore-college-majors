1641794,5,B00005OSLH,"He's the man. Steve Harvey can rightfully call himself one of today's kings of comedy. The man has a quick mind and he can take us back to those memories of what we came through. Though, at the time, we didn't thing it was so funny. But, looking back, we made it so we can laugh.",1202256000,2,279,4.0
1641795,5,B00005OSLH,"This was Steve Harvey at his finest.  He touched on topics from Church, to the difference between the races, Tiger Woods, and family issues.  He even gave a diagram of how to make one whole good man.  I couldn't stop laughing.  This movie is well worth buying and having in your collection, you will want to watch it any of those days when you need a good laugh.",1154995200,3,362,4.279411764705882
1641796,3,B00005OSLH,"The One Man show was entertainng throughout, but it did not make me roll around with laughter. Steve Harvey is a funny man and can be quite theatrical at times. He repeated a lot of the jokes he had done on Def Jam, although he did change them a bit. His Def Jam performances were more convincing.

On the whole I would rate this above average, but only just.",1133481600,,359,4.202898550724638

1641798,5,B00005OSLH,i love anything with steve harvey. he is just so silly evrything he does is funny from his jokes to those faces he makes. if you're not familiar with steve then you should definately check this out.,1077926400,6,198,4.378378378378378
1641799,3,B00005OSLH,"Harvey gave a much better performance in this show than in Original Kings. I didn't think he was that funny but his performance gave me a few chuckles, no bellyache but a few chuckles nonetheless. What impressed me about this DVD was that there are two performances, both of which were good. His jokes on various famous crimes and the African jungle were nuff funny. All in all a good DVD to have to perk you up on a dull weekday evening. Oh and I definitely rate it better than Cedric's Starting Line-up 1.",1076976000,3,507,4.404255319148936
1641800,5,B00005OSLH,"This is the long-awaited DVD release of Harvey's HBO stand-up special from 1999, taped in Augusta, GA.  It contains what may be Harvey's finest, strongest hour of material.  Funny from joke one to the very end.  He discusses going to church, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson (briefly, thank goodness), the difference between firing a white worker and firing a black worker, and how women can build themselves the perfect man.  Best of all, Harvey comes across as a very decent, intelligent, compassionate person.  The language is occasionally raw, but never gratuitously so.
Also included on this DVD is his 30-minute Stand-Up segment from HBO's archives, and it is also genuinely funny throughout.",1017532800,46,691,5.1891891891891895
