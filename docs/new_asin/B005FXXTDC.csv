4686648,5,B005FXXTDC,"When I saw that the dubbed was being released soon, I almost fainted! I LOVE HETALIA! I can't choose just one favorite, I LOVE THEM ALL! I got my Best Friend hooked on this show, and now she's dying to see this too! If you want to see the trailer (in English dub) Then go to FUNimation's website. They have the trailer, and the summary for the movie, so that the title ACTUALLY makes sense. I also found a different website that has a better price, but IDK what their shipping is... But I don't care! I never buy anime movies or shows, because I normally just watch them for free online, but I WILL BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE HETALIA IS EPICALLY HILARIOUS!!! I can't wait for this movie, and I can't wait for the dubbing of Hetalia World Powers! I'm also looking forward to seeing some new countries in this movie. My friend pointed out that Mexico is missing, but I think that Hetalia is awesome anyways. (but seriously, where's Ireland? I'd love to hear that accent!) HETALIA FOREVER~!

PASTAAAAA~! <3",1319155200,4,999,4.489010989010989
4686649,5,B005FXXTDC,"I pre-ordered this at the beginning of September. I was fortunate to attend the premiere at AWA in early October and cannot wait for this movie to show up at my doorstep!
It's such a great movie and I want to re-watch it! >_<",1318809600,2,225,4.136363636363637
4686650,5,B005FXXTDC,"Thank ya Jesus!  It's almost here!  I've been dying to get this since I watched some of it on youtube awhile ago.  If words can only describe how awesome this anime is---!  Since I watched it in the Japanese audio, I want the American ver.(or UK ver.) to hurry up so I can hear everyone's accents(Prussia's awesomeness pawns all)!  From what I've watched from Hetalia: Paint it, White, apparently the countries are having an issue with some threat called---uh---Nopora's?(If I've spelled it wrong, I'm sorry) that Japan explained that is a white monster with no nose, no face or any facial features.  And the nations/countries are supposed to do something before all of them are turned into no-faced-white-globs of======whatever?

I already preordered this and can't wait until it comes out!  This will be yet another awesome Hetalia piece for Hetalia fans out there!
All hail Russia-san!  And Iggy!",1314921600,28,899,5.02027027027027
4686651,5,B005FXXTDC,"Watching these old toon's really takes me back! I remember running home after school to watch these. Man! there is nothing like these shows any more. Some of the stuff they came up with as far as the cars were just the coolest! My fav was Rhino. These cartoons are a rare mix of good story telling + good artwork that is just gone today. The stuff that they come out with now is just garbage and poorly produced retreads that is just sad. My only gripe is there are no captions or subtitles on any of the shout! factory dvds, G.I. Joe & Transformers at least. Being almost deaf I really need them to follow the stories. Even without the captions, they are worth the money just to get caught up in them one more time. It's really cool that shout! factory is bringing these old shows back, I just hope they can get ""Centurions"" some time soon.",1312848000,2,841,4.29559748427673
4686652,5,B005FXXTDC,"I saw the sub of this and saw a part of it dubbed at Otakon 2011. ""Hilarious"" is the word that comes to mind instantly.
This is a must get for anyone who loves the Hetalia series!",1312848000,37,179,3.864864864864865
4686653,5,B005FXXTDC,"Of course, you're probably already a fan if you're looking here.  But if you aren't let me tell you - Hetalia is a great anime.  The stereotypes are outlandishly fun and all of the characters are endearing.  Take the time to watch a few episodes and you'll be hooked on its awesomeness.",1366848000,,286,4.461538461538462
4686654,5,B005FXXTDC,"This was the original movie for the series Hetalia and me and my friends love it! We recommend it to ANYONE who has watched the original series, but if you haven't seen the original series and this is new to you, it has a lot of jokes that may not be suitable to ALL viewers. You have been warned. Other than that, great movie!!",1365811200,,328,4.140625
4686655,4,B005FXXTDC,"I love the Hetalia series very much, and I love this movie a lot. My package arrived and I'm so happy that I can finally say that I own it. In terms of the product, the box that the DVD case is stored in is crushed a bit but the DVD itself plays just fine.

I made sure right away that the languages were correct, and they are. It was important to me that the DVD had both English and Japanese as an option, because as a personal preference, I like to watch it in Japanese with subs, but if I want to watch it with friends, we can watch it in English.

So, aside from the crushed box, I'm happy with my product.",1365724800,,611,3.9193548387096775
4686656,5,B005FXXTDC,"If you are fan of Hetalia you are gonna love this movie, very authentic, well packed,
i gave to my daughter and she love it, i would recommend to my friends and to any one else.",1363651200,,177,3.9444444444444446
4686657,5,B005FXXTDC,Bought this as a Birthday gift for our daughter and she loved it! It also came in quicker them we thought in great shape.,1363564800,,121,4.083333333333333
4686658,5,B005FXXTDC,sis loves it gave it to her for Christmas no problem playing them and it is all good and a,1363305600,,90,3.55
4686659,5,B005FXXTDC,This movie is a must-have for the Hetalia fan. And the cool green bandana is a total BONUS!! My 13 year old daughter wanted this movie really badly. She had only seen some of it in the past and liked what she saw so she wanted MORE!  She could not have been more thrilled with the whole movie. Great purchase!,1360108800,,309,4.15
4686660,5,B005FXXTDC,Great Movie! I loved every minute! I need to see more of these amazing characters! I wear the scarf all the time!,1358726400,,113,4.181818181818182
4686661,4,B005FXXTDC,"If you enjoy Politically Incorrect humor, you might find any of the Hetalia amusing. Although some might find some character comments; such as Germany asking Italy (English Dub) ""Do you WANT me to gas you!"" to be stretching the intentional offensiveness envelope beyond the pale. Having done some world travel myself, I found the series and movie does a good job of presenting national stereotypes as those from other countries see them, i.e. not just a Japanese-centric author's view. Even the English dubbed voice-overs stay true to the original's intention. An added bonus is the fact that you might even learn something historically or culturally you never heard before; Such as the existance of Sealand, proposed ""Marriage"" (mergers) of France and England, and other trivia.

One downside I found in the movie is the Director's excessive use of ""callbacks"" or ""flashbacks"" replaying sometimes only slightly altered scenes from seasons one and two. Fortunately we are saved from both the constant title/credit interruptions that made the 5 minute episodes of the series difficult to follow, if not outright annoying, and the redundancy of scenes played as trailers then immediately replayed in the following episode. Most notably ""America's Storage Closet""

As for entertainment value for one's dollar. IMHO some of the Hetalia offers seem to be overpriced. In particular the ""Collector's Edition"" movie. There was no way in Hell I was willing to pay $999 for the collector's edition of this movie just to get ""Prussia's Bandana"" (Handkerchief). Which struck me as odd once I recieved my purchase; as I found a thin handkerchief had arrived along with the DVD inside the art box..I suggest potential buyers be wary of some high-priced anime releases sold online offering ""Collector's Editions"".",1358208000,,1798,5.2613240418118465
4686662,5,B005FXXTDC,This movie is amazing!  It sucks at times that they repeat some jokes from the previous seasons but the new jokes and especially the outtakes are worth the money!,1357776000,,162,4.586206896551724
4686663,5,B005FXXTDC,"Our 12-year old daughter loves Hetalia, and she has learned many historical facts watching it.  It's great being about to combine learning and fun!",1356566400,,147,5.125
4686664,5,B005FXXTDC,"Got here earlier than I expected, and the product is amazing! No disappointments here! Consider me a satisfied customer, yup!",1355788800,,125,5.3
4686665,4,B005FXXTDC,Received in timely manner. Was just as described.  My granddaughter asked for this for Christmas so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  Know she will love it.,1355184000,,156,4.344827586206897
4686666,5,B005FXXTDC,Love this show so much! So glad to actually just own the movie now so I can watch whenever I want! Quick shippment too!,1354924800,,119,4.0
4686667,4,B005FXXTDC,"So first off, there is a lot of recycled material in this movie. At first I thought it was cool that they did that but then it seemed to bug me. Also there wasn't a lot of screen time for the characters that weren't axis or ally powers. I really wanted more Romano and Greece. Other than that, the movie was deliciously fun. I was so happy to see the characters back and having fun! As always, I'm sure Hetalia lovers would adore this! I also wanted to mention that the bandana is adorable as well!",1350777600,,498,4.197916666666667
4686668,5,B005FXXTDC,"Hetalia, Paint it White- One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and the commentary was pure gold. It was shipped much more quickly than I expected, the bandana that comes with it is really cute, and the artwork on the disk and cover is good quality. As for the movie itself, it is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never stop laughing. I have watched it 4 times and I am still catching new jokes!

The dub and sub are included on the disk, so you get twice the jokes for your money. The dub made the jokes even less politically correct and added accents, so it is not watered down. If you are a parent considering buying this for your teen, I would say about 15+ would be a good age for this movie. My father doesn't even like the show and he laughed at it. Trust me, s/he has heard MUCH worse out of school. It is very light-hearted, funny, and as stereotypical as ever before! Get it before they run out of Limited Editions, I love this bandana!",1347062400,,975,4.1861702127659575
4686669,5,B005FXXTDC,"This is one of the funniest most sit-back-and-relax anime movies I have ever watched!  It's probably because it has very enjoyable and likeable characters in it that I even bothered to sit down and watch this movie.

I won't tell the whole plotline, but more like the basis of it without spoiling the ending.

There are these aliens that turn people into one of them and walk around with light thingies on their antennas, they also paint the world white in which it is boring and depressing!

It's up to the Axis Powers Japan, Italy and Germany to team up with the Allies America, Russia, England, China and France to stop the aliens from destroying the world that we live in, and making it out to be very boring!

After being attacked, they all had enough and struggle to come up with new ways to take these new enemies on!

Also appearing in this would be China's panda, Italy's cat and Poland's pony!",1344211200,,903,4.50920245398773
4686670,3,B005FXXTDC,"This movie certainly is classic Hetalia, however, as you would expect, this movie was trying to give Hetalia a plot which just doesn't match Hetalia's style. It also threw in some strange clips from the series for no reason confusing the movie flow, which worked with the series, but threw off the movie. Over all it was entertaining, but not really worth the time. The series itself is a lot better.",1343001600,,400,4.647887323943662
4686671,5,B005FXXTDC,"Even more hilarious moments from all your favorite countries. Some repeats from the anime, but only some of the best so it doesn't bother at all. Overall amazing, and a must have.",1342828800,,179,4.625

4686673,5,B005FXXTDC,"I loved the movie. Any Hetalia fan needs to watch this. Fun, hetalianess, and insane weird talking aliens. No one can pass this up. Also, the limited edition has a green bandana. Oh, and the outtakes are awesome, plus the commentary was good, for anyone who watches the extras like I do.",1336780800,,287,4.538461538461538
4686674,5,B005FXXTDC,I have an important question I hope can be answered : is this in English or Japanese I need to know before I buy it. Or I can send it back right???,1333929600,,147,3.625
4686675,5,B005FXXTDC,"If you've watched or read the series this is a must buy!!! Had me rolling around laughing! (I love these guys!) If you've never seen or read anything about Hetalia previously then this could be a little hard to follow. It's done in the ""jumpy"" style of the episodes (it hopes around from main issue to different sub-issues).

The movie came with a little handkerchief which is adorable and I've found a use for it! (For my bento box :D)

Movie has English and Japanese audio (subtitles as well), I personally have not watched it in English (I like listening to the Japanese so I can pick up a word or phrase :D). Sound was great and the subtitles were easy to read.

As Prussia would say, it was awesome :D!",1331164800,,707,4.3816793893129775
4686676,4,B005FXXTDC,"I ordered this movie back in December, and i was so thrilled when i got it!

the only issue that i had with it was the package it came in. It came in just an envelope, which caused my case to get a bit squished, but it wasn't such a big deal.

It came with the bandana, as promised, though the only thing wrong with it was a few loose strings, but i don't think everyone else's would be like that.

Overall, i have to say it was a pretty good product and i watch Hetalia all the time. All i have to say is, Hetalia lovers, if you haven't seen this, YOU MUST WATCH IT!! <3",1330560000,,571,3.8632478632478633
4686677,5,B005FXXTDC,Hetalia movie Paint it White it's just full with epicness so you should get a copy!! It comes with a Hetalia bandana with all the characters chibis. It's really worth it.,1329264000,,170,4.516129032258065
4686678,5,B005FXXTDC,"As a fan of anime I would have to say this is a hilarious take on Earth's history. Yes I said history but with many hilarious references (especially Doctor Who and Film students would enjoy this). As I watched this movie however, it had several highlighted scenes from the first and second seasons (which I have already seen) but at least it was good to see those scenes again because it hilarious the first time. I would definitely recommend this to Doctor Who fans (see if you can catch the reference) and Film Students (Try to find the reference too).",1328313600,,554,4.55
4686679,4,B005FXXTDC,"When the Hetalia movie was first announced in Japan, I went crazy. It was impossible to find anything on the movie online except short summaries of the movie. People weren't giving the plot away or what happened in the movie, and it made me excited because she couldn't wait for the movie to come out. She watched it in Japanese and it was very good.

Then it came out on English. Beside my DVD having a problem where it won't play the single scene with Prussia, Ukraine and Belarus and skipping straight to the first attack the Axis and Allied had on the aliens, there was no problems with the movie overall.

The English dub was funnier than the Japanese dub, but I didn't like some of the dialogue changes. I admit I was more annoyed that the English dub threw in more France/England moments that were unnecessary. I admit as a America/England shipper I only got the movie for that one scene that everyone kept talking about online, but other than that, there really much else.

This movie has the only action scene in the actual series. Something you will never get out of a five minute episode. That was probably the best scene in the entire movie. That and Grampa Rome.

And of course the outtakes are the best. You can tell the voice actors had fun with this especially Germany's VA. XD

Overall a fun movie to watch with your Hetalia friends, but expect non-Hetalia fans to be confused especially if you skip through the 30-40 minutes of episodes from the first two seasons.

And of course, I love my bandana~",1328140800,,1517,4.518248175182482
4686680,5,B005FXXTDC,"Definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Just don't let your children watch it and make sure they are far away from the house if you watch the bloopers. I've watched it three times over and each time it gets even better, enjoy!",1327276800,,242,4.282608695652174
4686681,3,B005FXXTDC,"I want to say up front that I purchased this DVD and don't regret it at all--I'm glad to have it as part of my collection.  That said, I wanted to make other potential purchasers aware that this is not 80 minutes of completely new material.  It's roughly 30-40 minutes of new material interspersed with many, many clips from the first two seasons of Hetalia.  The clips are used to explain various tensions between the countries and provide background information for their various motivations, which would be fine if the viewer is unfamiliar with Hetalia, but feels like a waste of time--I can't imagine anyone watching this movie who isn't already a fan of the show/manga.  (And these days, with the bounty of information available on the internet, one has no excuse to be completely ignorant of the course of the show.)  If I had known that this was the case, I would have waited until the price came down to a more reasonable level; $30 USD is a lot of money for a single disc, especially when it feels as though I was charged $1 USD per new minute of material.  The plot is entertaining, but I really wish there had been more of it.",1326931200,,1137,4.495145631067961
4686682,4,B005FXXTDC,"The movie was awesome, loved every minute of it and I didn't care that my younger siblings were in the room watching it with me!

Although I want to say I was a tad disappointed with the bandana! D: Is it supposed to look all washed out and old??? Because I can barely see the characters faces at all, just make out their expressions. )';",1326758400,,338,4.2
4686686,5,B005FXXTDC,"Hysterical! If History isn't your thing, you may find yourself lovin' every minute of of after this movie~

A MUST-HAVE for the Hetalia Fans. The bandanna is super cute too! <3",1326672000,,176,4.67741935483871

4686688,5,B005FXXTDC,"Great movie,nice voice acting, only watch if you are a Hetalia fan, otherwise you will not understand the plot or enjoy the story.",1325721600,,130,4.695652173913044
4686689,5,B005FXXTDC,"(My daughter is writing this review)

My mom got this movie for me for Christmas, and I was really happy on getting it. I watched it for the first time a few nights ago, and the movie itself is great! The only thing that was unexpected was the ""flashbacks"" which were spread throughout the film, which were basically clips from the past season. Still, the whole thing was very enjoyable and funny to watch!

When I looked into the extras, it makes you aware (if not even more) of Hetalia's TV-MA rating. Nothing bad is shown, but a good chunk of the voice actors outtakes have strong language, along with the commentary. The language used was somewhat unexpected, but if shown to mature audiences like its intended to be, its suitable and somewhat humorous.

All in all, this DVD is a must buy for anyone who has an interest in the anime. But, if you are planning on watching the extras included on the DVD, it's okay as long as you or anyone watching it is alright with hearing some strong language that may not be suitable for young children!",1325462400,,1044,4.484210526315789
4686690,5,B005FXXTDC,i loved this movie it was really good but it showed sences from the other seasons.this movie woukd be great for people who love hetalia,1325462400,,135,4.44
4686691,3,B005FXXTDC,"I am a huge fan of Hetalia and have watched this movie subed forever ago, the voice acting is good, but does it need to padded with clips from Axis Powers: Hetalia? It is a good movie, but anyone who is watching this movie will have already seen these clips many times, such as Germany going off to fight Russia and Italy freaking out. Or England visiting Japan and hanging out with the Kappa and onion oni. These clips have nothing to do with the Paint it White Story line, and are simply there to pad the movie out. So maybe they are good of you are showing this film to someone who has never seen Hetalia.

But that's not to say i disliked it. I know not everyone likes the dub, but i found it good. Not quite as good as it was in Axis powers season two but decent. It earns points for the Doctor Who reference and i almost died at America's line near the end.

America: ""I'm happy to see you hands, we are going to have so much fun!""",1325289600,14,937,4.086956521739131
4686692,3,B005FXXTDC,"I love Hetalia and have the limited edition dvds released by funimation for seasons 1 and 2, which is why I had to have the movie. Unfortunately I was less than dazzled. You still get a fun little bandanna but considering this is the MOVIE its odd there is only one disk. Once you watch the film you understand why, you get maybe 40 minutes or more of new stuff but old skits from the series are inserted throughout. A real let down to those who are familiar with the series and were looking forward to a lot of new material. I don't regret adding it to my collection and this would be a great introduction to beginner fans but the film on a whole is not too great.",1325116800,,665,4.162790697674419
4686693,5,B005FXXTDC,"I've waited two years for this!!! When it came out in dub, I immediately bought it and it came in two days later. The movie is packed with awesome and funniness and topped with MORE AWESOME. So funny..... *Goes to watch it again*",1324771200,,229,4.348837209302325
4686694,5,B005FXXTDC,This is an awesome movie! I love the bloopers and everything. I hate how they put HRE and chibitalia in it though. I HATE HRE... He is such a stalker... Anyway BUY this movie! It's amazing! You'll get many laughs from it guaranteed.,1324684800,,232,4.4186046511627906
4686695,5,B005FXXTDC,"The movie was AWESOME!!! It was so worth the money!! The time I had to wait from the announcement that it was coming soon to it's release? No, not wprth it. They show too many clips from the show mingled in segments amongst the actual movie footage. That bummed me out. I ordered the limited edition and got the Pictonian Bulb Green Bandana with it. You can barely see the Hetalia characters on it as they look so faded, compared to the first leaked pictures of the bandana on Amazon.com a few months back, but all in all, the movie was great, every country featured in Hetalia to date in the US was given screen time, including the newly debued Iceland and his puffin. The movie has a fast-paced stoeyline just like the show and features all the comedy and entertainment you expect to see out of Hetalia. :3",1324425600,,808,4.429530201342282
4686696,5,B005FXXTDC,"I ordered this movie from Amazon and received it a day earlier than the estimated delivery date. I'd already seen this movie in its original Japanese form and was nervous as to the quality of the dub. However, my expectations were far surpassed. I found it even funnier in English. It's a must-buy for all English-speaking Hetalia fans!",1324339200,7,336,4.810344827586207
4686697,5,B005FXXTDC,"Ok, if you like random stuff happening with adorable bishies that is mostly comedy, than Hetalia is the one for you! All the characters are well voiced in the English dub and provide good and convincing accents that don't sound awful! This movie not only shows the main plot that actually doesn't stray, but it also includes funny scenes from the episodes that were favorites among the director's, in Japan, choices to fill the 80-something time slot! If you plan on getting this movie you totally should! I got as an early Christmas for myself and it was well worth it!!! (Personally my favorite character is Canada even though he doesn't get a lot of screentime. Also I love Japan, Russia, and Italy)!",1323561600,,703,4.723577235772358
4686698,5,B005FXXTDC,"As for the actual movie:
There's both the Japanese and English versions so have no fear! The short and cute and funny and jumpy and random Hetalia is great but it's nice to see an actual plot. If you were on of those people who stopped watching Hetalia mainly because there was no plot then this is for you. It was nice to see a full length Hetalia episode.

Extra, Extra, read all about it:
What I really liked about the CD was the extras. They have a historical references part where they tell you about... the historical references of Hetalia! So if you were confused about some parts of Hetalia, don't worry, it explains but prepare to do some reading. The outtakes and commentary were just hilarious! I was a little disappointed that Italy's voice actor wasn't able to be in the commentary but that's okay. I loved hearing the opinions of the voice actors of Hetalia. I couldn't stop laughing at the outtakes though (even though I watched it... several... or maybe more... times...yeah you get the point). There's also Prussia's song, Mein Gott!! It's one of my favorite songs from Hetalia. There's more but I can't remember them off the top of my head.

Limited vs. Regular Edition:
The green bandanna the limited edition comes with is so adorable. The characters are all chibi and in a circle! There really is no difference between the limited edition version of the movie except you get a bandanna. I'm not sure if it was any different for the season CDs but here, I didn't see any (feel free to point them out of you saw any). Well there was that limited addition sticker that they put on the corner but nothing else. So if you don't really want the bandanna I would advise you to just buy the regular version (but it's only ~2$ more)!

Packaging:
My only complaint was the packaging. They used that yellow envelope with bubble wrap inside. This would have been okay but it creased my cover. Since the CD case cover was a bit larger than the actual CD case (since that's where they put the bandana) the cover creased in. I'd like to see my stuff in mint condition especially since I pre ordered it and anticipated for it for several months. There was no real damage done to the CD itself but it just disappointed me a little that the cover was damaged.

The empty space:
I find it to be silly to leave such a large space for the bandanna though. They should have just left it outside of the cover. It looks ridiculous with an empty space in it. Those who haven't purchased the item probably don't know what I mean but it was a stupid idea to leave a big space for a bandanna. It seems like there was supposed to be another CD in there or something. Well, some people really wouldn't care for a minor crease but as a fan, it bothers me a bit (major understatement). Don't let this discourage you from buying this though! I was probably just unlucky.

Blessings:
I hope your package gets to you safely if you intend to buy it.
That's it. Hopes this helps.",1323475200,2,2962,4.4375

That got really really annoying after a while. Its like ""i've already seen those! why are u re-showing them?"" I would find myself fast fowarding thru those parts...i wanted to see the movie...not old episodes. If i could i could rate it a 4.5 because of that, but everything else was really great! I really liked the movie itself!! Epic is what describes it!!!",1323302400,,590,4.472222222222222
4686700,4,B005FXXTDC,"I LOVE Heatlia, so this purchase was a no brainer for me. But if you're still a Hetalia virgin, then I wouldn't recommend you start here. For Hetalia fans, the limited edition comes with a cute green bandana (a lot like the blue one in the previous series limited edition box). There are also some nice extras - a ten minute interview with the voices of Italy, Germany, and Japan, as well as the director during the Japanese film premier. You also get a Funimation commentary track and outtakes as well as some informative historical notes and the movie's textless closing.

According to the director, 20 minutes of the film are skits that are taken from the TV series and re-inserted into the film at random intervals. They're cute skits, but I would have rather seen new material. I'm pretty sure they had to use recycled sequences from the TV show because the movie's plot is paper thin and they needed to increase its length.

Plot. Ah the plot. If you're looking for a plot, then you'll be disappointed. This movie's strength is its characters. If you're a fan of Germany, Russia, America, England, France, China, Japan, and Italy, then you'll be happy. They're the focus of the film and they do their usual, cute, funny, endearing Hetalia things. If you're a fan of characters like Austria, Hungary, Spain, Norway, Switzerland, etc. - then you might be disappointed. They only make brief cameo appearances.

As far as packaging, I was disappointed with the limited edition release. I was hoping for a chip board box, like you get with other Funimation Limited Edition releases. Instead, the movie is packaged in a flimsy cardboard box. Sure you get the bandana, but I would have rather gotten a sturdy art box.

It was fun to see Hetalia back in action and Funimation packed in some great extras. Recommended to fellow Hetalia fans.",1322179200,2,1838,4.752351097178684

4686702,4,B005FXXTDC,"I love Hetalia and was very excited to see this was coming out, but boy, they recycled a lot of season 1 & 2 into this movie.  Russia's dive from the airplane, the ""France wants to marry England"" thing, England visits Japan, America talks through a pile of burgers...augh, there was just too much recycled. Other than the main characters, the other characters (Prussia, Romano, the Baltic trio, Ukraine, Belarus and Spain) got very limited screen time (I think the longest of those was the Baltics and they got about 10 seconds total).  And my final complaint is that without Grandpa Rome the world would once again be doomed!  Can't they come up with a plot where the actual current countries manage to save the day?

That said, it was great to see all the boys again, although France and England both seemed to be wearing bizarre girly jumpsuits.  I just wanted some more Prussia and Romano...sigh...",1321920000,5,902,4.719745222929936

8470837,5,B005FXXTDC,"Hetalia is severely misunderstood and I have to say this movie lacks importance except for it will give you a great laugh every now and then. First time viewers can skip unless they feel an attachment to the episode series. Some of the English jokes made no sense so Japanese Dub to make it feel more like an anime and with better flowing dialogue.

But both Dubs have a plus.",1399075200,,376,4.371428571428571

8470841,5,B005FXXTDC,"This movie was amazing! I really love how both the Axis and Allied Forces worked together, it was so cute! This was perfect for my birthday party! Me and my five friends (myself and two others being hardcore Hetalia fans) watched it at midnight! It includes some of the really funny scenes from the actual show, and it kinda was hard to follow at first, but it still was hilarious, adorable and even sad at the very end (but it was happy again thanks to a certain adorable Italian, so yay! don't worry, I won't spoil it!). I knew the whole ending song, haha. Wa~ Wa~ World!

To get to the point; TOTALLY AWESOME MOVIE (awesomer than Prussia!) and GREAT for both the new hetalia fans and the hardcore fangirls (and fanboys, I guess) such as myself. And the bandanna that comes with it? C.U.T.E! BUY THIS MOVIE! I WILL NOT REGRET IT!",1369958400,,831,4.431372549019608
