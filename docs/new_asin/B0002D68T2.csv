8026475,4,B0002D68T2,"This is Volume 1 of a 5 Volume series of videos titled ""Advanced Self-Defense Shooting.""

The video starts by listing 10 Gun Safety rules to observe while handling a gun.

Lenny Magill is the interviewer and camera man.  Bill Wilson says that the typical gun fight now days most often takes place within 7 yards or less in low light conditions and increasingly involves more than one assailant.  With this in mind, Bill Wilson identifies skills beyond basic target shooting that the gun owner should practice to achieve in order deal with the conditions under which most gun fights occur.  A gun owner who wants to defend himself under these conditions must train to be able to shoot in rapid sequence at more than one moving targets less than 7 yards away, while being on the move in low light.

In this video, Bill Wilson demonstrates how to keep the gun sights on target and shoot while moving towards cover and how to properly use cover to maximize one's chances to survive while engaged in a gun fight.

Lenny Magill mentions the International Defensive Pistol Association a  group that has member shooting ranges and clubs around the country devoted to  serious pistol self-defense applications.  You can find them at WWW.IDPA.COM
