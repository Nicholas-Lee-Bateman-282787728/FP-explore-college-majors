8235536,3,B000ZJ2ZMC,"According to IMDB Season 3 has 36 Episodes, but this is listed as 3 discs, what's wrong with this picture",1388016000,,105,4.3
8235537,4,B000ZJ2ZMC,"Re: TROPICAL HEAT: SWEATING BULLETS - ""Smut and Nothin' But"" (Final Episode) - there are playback difficulties with this episode - when you go to the ""select episode"" menu the pointer is unable to ""lock"" onto this episode - it skips right past it!  However, there are two ways to watch this episode - play back (or cue forward) the PREVIOUS EPISODE - and after the credits roll, and the disc returns to Menu and automatically ""locks"" onto ""Smut and Nothin' But"" - select this episode and it will play.  Also, if you play back this disc in your computer - the computer IS able to find this episode on the ""select episode"" menu.",1386720000,,626,4.482456140350878
8235538,5,B000ZJ2ZMC,"What can you say? Tropical location, a blue jeep, a guy with his shirt half open all the time, some cheesy sets and lines, and you have the perfect '90's Crimetime After Primetime show.",1373241600,,185,4.470588235294118
8235539,4,B000ZJ2ZMC,"The star of this show has described it as a ""B"" version of ""Magnum P.I."", but I find it most enjoyable. Some of the plots are a bit far fetched, but the humor is solid throughout. My 13 year old granddaughter absolutely adores the show!!!",1369872000,,238,4.311111111111111
8235540,4,B000ZJ2ZMC,"Beautiful actors, catchy music, a little dirty but not too bad. Arrived on time, everything worked, no defects noticed. Not for kids",1361750400,,132,5.045454545454546
8235541,2,B000ZJ2ZMC,"If you're a Clint Walker fan - on IMdB, it was listed that Clint's
episode, ""The Last of the Magnificent"" (how appropriate for him) was
supposed to be on Season 3, episode 13. Well, it isn't. It's appar-
ently on Season 2 (but I'm still waiting for my exchange).",1257206400,2,262,4.36734693877551
8235542,4,B000ZJ2ZMC,"I realize that a lot of people think this show is a little hard to grasp, but I found it refreshing. It is a little dated, but shows a lot about the 80's and is always filmed in beautiful locations. Pretty funny and usually a good plot without being too serious.",1233446400,,262,4.1568627450980395
