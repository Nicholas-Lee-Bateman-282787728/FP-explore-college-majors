8489952,5,B005ZTNTEA,Ken Davis proves he is still funny with a mix of old material and some new material. His delivery is great and his interaction with his audience is wonderful. We own every one of his DVD's and we pray he will be able to do more.,1483401600,,228,3.9782608695652173
8489953,3,B005ZTNTEA,"Love Ken Davis!  We wish the DVD description was more clear, though - these were almost the same jokes as on other DVDs.  Ken is always great entertainment, though, so this will make a nice gift to someone who hasn't seen him before.",1483056000,,233,4.395348837209302
