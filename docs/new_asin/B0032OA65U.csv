8387615,5,B0032OA65U,This is the ONLY video you will EVER learn Tai Chi from because it has a reverse view (ie. filmed from the back and NOT from the front which is backwards.) Do not hesitate and waste your money on ANY other Tai Chi video because you will never learn from it unless you view the video in front of a mirror. This is the Yang style short form and long form taught by a master. BUY IT NOW!,1384905600,,384,3.9358974358974357
8387616,4,B0032OA65U,"This is a great beginner method for T'ai Chi. I bought it for my public library, but it is having such great use, I haven't had a chance to actually watch it myself! This was a nice package deal including both the beginner and intermediate level DVD's in the set.",1267488000,2,263,4.28
