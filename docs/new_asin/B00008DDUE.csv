7981608,5,B00008DDUE,"This movie is a gem and available on Prime! This movie was created in 1965 to discuss the topics of sexuality and love in the Italian society. One could rush to conclude that the movie is old; amazingly the movie is very relevant today. Sure, we now accept sex equality, divorce, extra-marital affairs, same sex marriages, etc. But what is profound about this movie is the discusison about conformism, Why do we inherit ideas (passively) and fail to challenge them. Why are these beliefs an integral part of our identify? Why can't we challenge taboo topics? It is apparently that for the most part we are unable to shed away some fundamental views on sex. Society changes and adopts new views when the old generation die.

7981610,4,B00008DDUE,"In the mood for love? Follow Pier Paolo Pasolini's venture into cineme verite. Italy, North and South, bourgeoisie and worker, young and old, Pasolini hears the voice of Italy in its confused, archaic, outmoded, sexist, unquestioned beliefs about sexuality. Discussion with the reigning intellegentsia are tellingly juxtaposed to these meetings. 'Do the interviews represent the true Italy?' Pasolini asks Moravia. 'Yes and no,' is the response. There is still a part of the Italian consciousness that does not speak of sexuality, yet what is revealed during the interviews is a largely uninformed populace, beholding sexuality as almost sacrosanct. Concluding with the images of a marriage and its blessing is a hopeful promise for a more conscious future. This exploration remains relevant and undated.",1280707200,,804,5.544715447154472
7981611,5,B00008DDUE,"this is a fine documentary from pier paolo pasolini.. Pier Paolo confronts average italians on the streets to find out just how modern they are.. The results are interesting... Especially in a time like the 60's to see just how shocked and conservative people were is very interesting.. Those who speak up in this movie are almost unanimously against equality, feminisim, and any outside form of sexuality.. Pasolini shows a confused Italy and an italy unwilling to confront taboos.. I would strongly recommend this documentary which is probably even more relevant today in a time when freedom of speech and expression is becoming such a big issue once again...",1172361600,,661,5.073394495412844
7981612,4,B00008DDUE,"Pasolini's Love Meetings is an interesting and humorous look at sexual ideas and taboos in early 1960's Italy. Through a series of interviews with members of the general public in various cities in Italy, Pasolini creates a pastiche (and gets a wide variety of responses) about such topics as divorce, homosexuality, prostitution, and equality. It's fairly interesting and entertaining, until the very end when Pasolini makes his ""conclusion,"" essentially stating his own political beliefs, some of which are opposed to the information he's gathered in his film.
My major complaints about the disc are the transfer and the subtitles. The subtitles are all-white and are burned in (not optional). The subtitles might not have been such a problem if the film hadn't been in black-and-white and very washed out, making it impossible to read them in various places in the film. The print itself is scratched, but watchable.
I'd recommend this film for Pasolini completists and people studying the history of the documentary - it serves as an interesting precursor to I Am Curious - Yellow. As it's unlikely that Love Meetings will get a better edition any time soon, (at least in Region 1), if you're interested, check it out.",1052956800,12,1222,5.08457711442786
