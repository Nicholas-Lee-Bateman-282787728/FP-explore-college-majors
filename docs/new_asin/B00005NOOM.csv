1636823,4,B00005NOOM,"The movie consists mainly of a plainly filmed series of interviews with various unsuitable men:who respond to a personals ad placed by a Taipei optometrist looking for a potential husband.  Rene Liu is an incredible actress whose subtle facial expressions and eye movements convey a rich picture of her inner processing as you watch her trying to make sense of these various idiosyncratic men. A former professor of hers  a Buddhist with a wife and child  interjects his philosophical advice from time to time.  These scenes are interspersed with the doctor's lengthy, very personal phone calls to a person unknown to the audience until the final moments of the film.

The first time I watched the movie, I thought it a boring B-grade production.  But interestingly, it became fascinating the second time around when segments of the narrative that formerly seemed loose and somewhat aimless were suddenly integrated and meaningful.  I then understood why the screenplay won awards.  This film is a winner if you are willing to meet it half-way.",1428019200,,1044,5.064327485380117

1636826,5,B00005NOOM,"I read the other 6 reviews, and each had a different take on the movie, each thought they had the movie mostly figured out; I didn't think they did, so I am writing a review also.

First I suppose when a film speaks in so many ways to so many people, you can definitely say it has layers. Layers like a person has in their personality. At first you meet someone, and you get shown the public face. Then with a little more intimacy, you hear some of what they really think and feel. This movie is like discovering a person...but not just the heroine...but ourselves in the heroine.

Not all aspects of ourselves, just like when a person really starts talking to us, it is usually about ""an issue"" that will not lay down on it's own inside our minds and so we bring it out to others. This movie though touted as a comedy, was about loss.

Deep pain, so intense that one screams before one even knows what has happened. Like being bumped by a shark in water, and not even knowing what has happened...were you bumped...were you bit...and it will be a long time until you really know how much damage the shark did to you...through the surgeries, the pain, the scars, the handicap you are left with.  This story is an emotional shark bite and most of the story, right up until the end is the heroine trying to figure out what happened to her.

Unlike the other reviewers, I am going to ""sort of"" spill the beans in revealing that this is not a comedy of jerks that you meet while dating, but much more...because often when a person has a horrible problem, they don't turn to people anymore but to movies. They look for a movie that can perhaps explain their personal pain to them, because they are confused, numb, and don't know what happened or how it happened. So when they look for a movie, they look for key words that says this film might ""understand"" them.

What we see in the heroine is a person that says what she is doing is to ""find a husband"" (this is a double entendre-hint) Then we think that she is lonely, or socially inept, or something is wrong with her personally that makes her unable to ""find"" anyone....though what we see is a bunch of others that have enough wrong with them that they are also alone, they are decoys and reflections of the problem.

What many that reviewed the piece did not see, was that there was something wrong with her, the heroine. True she was beautiful, young, well educated, successful...but she had something wrong with her, eating her up, killing her. She had been wounded so badly, like a shark bite that she was ""fighting for her life"" fighting to find stability again.

Like many of us do when we are hit in our lives with something so horrible and shattering to us that we can't understand how it could happen, how everything we believed in was not true. At that point, is life life...or is it death?

This was a brilliant way to come at a problem that few words or discussions are out there talking about. Worth watching, well acted, the photography and scenery are as depressing as the film is in it's black comedy...BUT that is good, because you are to be watching for the real message, and should not be too much distracted by the world.",1421107200,,3189,4.409863945578231
1636827,4,B00005NOOM,This was funny all the way through and the ending was tragic and sad...a great movie.,1418515200,,85,4.375
1636828,5,B00005NOOM,"This is a chick flick that is one of those that will also appeal to guys, it is that well made. The story is very simple: an optometrist, who has had an affair with a married man, decides to put an ad in the paper because she is looking for a husband. However, she still loves her former lover and calls him up at night and leaves long messages in his answering machine. But he never returns her calls.

If you're a veteran of the dating jungle, some of these characters that she keeps meeting may seem familiar (and will elicit either a chuckle or sneer from you) and it doesn't matter one bit that the film is made in Taiwan, it has universal appeal and will resonate with almost anyone in any culture. And this makes me wonder: why wasn't this film at least nominated for the Academy Awards Foreign Category? Ah, of course, Hollywood.",1311897600,,837,4.365384615384615
1636829,4,B00005NOOM,"I played the personals a lot in in my own life and I found a woman I will share the rest of our lives that way.  I expected this film to be  the usual light comedy about the personals with a happy romantic ending.

  However, this movie is about so much more than that.  This movie is about loneliness, separation, the lack of love and the fear it brings into our personal life.  This movie is about how in the modern alienated society we are separated in little cubicles blind to each other, screaming for love inside, mute, proper, and cold on the outside.

  What comes through best in the many inappropriate people our heroine meets is not their silliness or inappropriateness, but the pain in their wanting. What comes through is how in observing their complete unconcern for our heroine, who she is, what she wants, what she enjoys, our heroine feels numbed, frozen deserted in a desert of boredom.  They are cut off from real love, real affection, and real inimacy, just as we believe our heroine is also desperately cut off from her feelings and needs, having left her job, spending her time meeting countless men from the ads in a tea house.

  Even the one man who is a friend of hers, not a lover, a married doctor with a child, opens up to her that he is not really who she thinks he is in the most intimate of ways.

  All along we know our heroine has a sickness in the heart that we don't exactly know about that she reveals in telephone messages she leaves every morning, for whom we don't know, and why she gets no returns we learn at the end.

  In a way, the process here is like mourning, getting the hubris of loneliness, the sadness of so many useless men out of her system to highlight the pain and separation our heroine and the rest of us face hen we seek love.

  There is more that unfolds that  I can tell.  We must leave you to see this movie.

The acting here is super, especially if you like good character acting. I found  one of the most touching of her suitors to be the school teacher in his 50s maybe because I am a college teacher in my fifties. He doesn't know what to say, is so unused to a social occaision that he brings his own soda to the tea house, and proposes marriage without asking a word from our heroine.  Even after she tells him how inappropriate this is, without even mentioning he is 20 years older than she is, he wants he to make arrangements to meet his parents in th South of China. The pain on his face, the insistent sincerity, the way you feel all of him is engaged, even though he is completely lost, really hit me.

  He says all of that, but you can tell by his face how desperately he wants that, how crazily he wants her love, how empty his life has been of affection.

  After writing this review, I think I better see this movie again tonight.",1121126400,5,2811,4.27134724857685
1636830,5,B00005NOOM,"God, I love this movie!  At last, a Taiwanese film with heart and depth, and complexity to really sink one's teeth into beneath a simple and unassuming premise.

Du Jiazheng (""Rene"" Liu Joying) is a thirty-something woman, an attractive and successful ophthalmologist, who advertises in the newspaper, looking for a husband.  We go with her (under the assumed name of ""Miss Wu"") on a series of dates with a hilarious assortment of bizarre characters.  It would be hard to pick a single standout suitor, but my favorite line has to be ""Besides drinking, you must have other hobbies?""  Well, it turns out he does, but I'm sure Du wishes she hadn't asked.  It is a joy to watch Liu's face as she reacts to her dates' revelations and ploys with bemused and intelligent aplomb.

In between these disastrous meetings, Du makes phone calls in which she recounts them to an answering machine, or writes in a diary.  She also runs into a teacher she had had in college, Professor Luo, vigorous and charismatic  in red turban-like hat and pants, black suspenders and a white T-shirt.  She unburdens herself, and receives sage advice and comfort, a scene that is presented in brief interludes between the dates.

Initially, it seems that ""The Personals"" is going to be a whimsical comedy about modern dating in Taipei, not much different from typical Hollywood cinema-by-numbers.  But gradually we gather something darker is happening in Du's life, a hint here and there in her conversation with the prospects, then in the phone messages and journal entries, as it becomes apparent they're addressed to an estranged lover.

On my first run through this film, it was the weird dates that dominated, with their inventive oddness and humor.  But as soon as it was over, I was compelled to rewind and start again, and this time I found myself paying attention to what had before seemed interstitial material, even fast forwarding through the dates that earlier been the focus.

I won't give away the resolution, except to say that it caught me by surprise on several levels.  But beyond the overt ending, and feeding off it, the film ultimately seems to be about how with unthinking cruelty we use others' love, loneliness and desperation to assuage our own.

The cinematography is not in-your-face, but is subtly creative.  The dates are filmed from a variety of angles which adds visual interest to the otherwise straight talking faces, and many scenes seem to take a cue from the Japanese director Ozu, with his careful framing.  One in particular -- when Du tells the answering machine ""I feel like a voyeur [listening to her suitors bare their lives]"", the camera is peering in at her, voyeuristically, through a window.

This film won't be for everyone.  If you need explosions and car chases to keep your interest, if a movie about relations has to involve thrashing naked bodies or shouting and screaming, if suspense for you is only generated by dark shapes springing from the shadows ... well, give it a pass.  But if you like quirky indie flicks that explore emotions and relationships, that put script and acting above special effects and fancy camera work, go ahead and take a chance.  Although this film may haunt you, unlike a bad blind date it can only stalk you in your mind.  No ""Fatal Attraction"" scenarios, the worst is that you'll be forced to buy a copy.

Production notes:  The subtitles are easily readable, even on the VHS copy I viewed.  Crisp white in a good font, with a thin black halo, they stand out against any background yet are not obtrusive.  The music was well chosen to the mood, including what I assume is a Chinese cover of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"".  Unfortunately, none of the characters except Du are specifically credited (though the translation of the credits is sparse); I would be curious to know who played Professor Luo, for one.",1093478400,4,3862,4.8090909090909095
7947726,5,B00005NOOM,"Sweet little movie. Mmeditative, slow, and without much of a plot...cause really nothing actiony happens. But wow, i was really touched. Art is so healing.",1521849600,,155,5.24
7947727,3,B00005NOOM,"This movie is in Mandarin from Taiwan.  This story is about a female eye doctor who decided to post a personal ad in the newspaper in search of a husband.  She gets many calls and meets every person at a cafe/restaurant.  If this movie was a short film, it would be great as the best part of this film is in the last 20 minutes.  This movie is way too long and spent way too much time with so many interviews that it got so boring.  There were moments of weirdness and humor in the interviews that made some parts interesting.  However, half way into the movie, I almost gave up watching it because it got ridiculous having to live through her interviews when I'm not looking for a husband.  My recommendation is watch the first half hour of the movie to understand where the movie is going, then skip the middle portion and watch the last half hour of the movie.  What's interesting is that each day, this woman calls someone to leave a voicemail on someone's phone each night when she returns home to report what she went through on that day.  Her reports get dreary as her days progresses.  Eventually she gives up her pursuit of her ideal husband, and that's when the story gets interesting.  This movie is about adultery, but you won't know this until near the end of the movie.",1517702400,,1283,4.3940677966101696
7947728,5,B00005NOOM,Quirky movie but I gave 5 stars because of Rene Liu.  I am happy to own a copy of this DVD so I can watch it anytime,1487203200,,116,3.2962962962962963
7947729,3,B00005NOOM,"A menagerie of strange people fill this fruitless search for love.  The culture's emptiness is curious enough and the depictions seem pretty lifelike, though the cumulative strangeness is a little hard to believe.  The attractive young female Chinese doctor giving up her practice to search for a husband (the core of this film) seems almost incredibly outside the norms of Chinese culture",1478304000,,389,5.258064516129032
7947730,5,B00005NOOM,"Absolutely loved this movie!  It explores the many facets of love - looking for it, loving, and losing. Excellent on all levels and moving performances! A+ (beemo - 6/16)",1465430400,,170,4.862068965517241
7947731,5,B00005NOOM,This was  a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I thought the actress did a great job as the poor girl looking to meet a future mate. The different guys she had to deal with certainly kept me entertained as she tried to stay on track with her questions about their life. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys foreign movies. You will not be disappointed.,1463788800,,365,4.53030303030303
7947732,5,B00005NOOM,Warning! This is NOT some silly little romantic comedy diatribe. This is a deep dive into a troubled womans soul so complete that you will feel every bit of her anguish and more disturbingly it may wake up the sad despair hidden away in your own heart.  This film is so very good but you may not want to go where it will surely take you.,1458345600,,337,4.106060606060606

7947734,3,B00005NOOM,"I really, really wanted to get into this film, but after a dozen start-stops, the documentary style kept putting me off. It's pretty boring fare until the final scene. The parts involving the professor is sort of interesting but any older person could have told her what he did.

Interesting premise and the female lead is very talented (although her hairstyle makes her look like a boy).

Could have watched a WWII documentary instead...

Enjoy!",1451692800,,446,4.92
