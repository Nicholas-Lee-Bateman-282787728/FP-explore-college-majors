8093186,5,B000BVL0A2,"This is an amazing film about forgiveness, regret and starting over.

The story follows an Italian prof. who one day sees a woman, who participated in a terrorist attack against him, back out on the street.  He follows her and learns that she is in a pre-release program where she leaves the prison each day to work and re-integrate into society.  He is suffering from dangerous after-effects from the attack ten years earlier and he is unable to accept that she is about to re-start her life.

She has also changed, and we see a woman who has grown, but remains all to human in her recognition that the foolish choices of her youth are going to haunt her all her life.

It is not a simple movie or one with easy answers, but it makes you think about the choices we all make and the consequences we live with.",1135900800,,809,4.366666666666666
