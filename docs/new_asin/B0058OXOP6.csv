8462151,4,B0058OXOP6,"What holds the movie together is the kids, story around them. What lingers on after the movie is Stanley's spirit and attitude towards life.

Something is still wanting in story-line. The solution shown is that abusive Mr. Verma leaves the school. But what about the equally abusive and insensitive science teacher, does she continues killing creative spirit of children? And why the new History teacher is introduced in the middle of the movie, but doesn't really play any part? Should one detest Mr. Verma as an outright villain, or he himself is victim of some circumstances, who in spite of being a glutton, doesn't bring any food?",1448582400,,635,4.934579439252336

8462153,4,B0058OXOP6,"Not every Indian movie has to have gorgeous dancing sequences. And of course, not every Indian film is about romance and action. Amole Gupte's charming little film ""Stanley Ka Dabba"" has no dancing, but still manages to entertain us with a vivid and spirited portrayal of life in an all-boys school in Mumbai, where our protagonist 10-year-old boy Stanley (Partho Gupte, son of the director) studies.

Staley is a natural-born storyteller, popular among the students, but there is one thing he doesn't have: a tiffin box (""dabba"") or a lunchbox. Stanley has nothing to eat during the lunchtime, so his friends offer to share their lunch with him. But the school's gluttonous Hindi teacher (played by director Amole Gupte), who forces the children to ""share"" the tiffin with him, doesn't like it, telling Stanley to bring his own dabba.

In spite of the light-hearted tone of the film, ""Stanley Ka Dabba"" addresses an important social issue, as seen in the film's final chapter, where we learn a few thiings about Stanley's family. The storyline may be too simple for this kind of serious topic, but Amole Gupte's unpretentious and honest film works because of the credible descriptions of children that is often so sweet.

Probably this is a type of film that is hard to sell to international audiences. If you have a chance to see it - especially when you are interested in non-English movies featuring non-professional child actors - give it a try.",1375142400,,1450,4.910204081632653
