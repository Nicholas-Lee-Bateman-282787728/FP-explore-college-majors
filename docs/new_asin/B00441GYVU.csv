4258954,5,B00441GYVU,"I called Keith Emerson this 34 years ago, & my feelings have not changed. This DVD is fantastic!!! I love the band he has put together & I think Mark Bonilla is a much better fit than Dave Kilmister back in '03. You get a mix of songs here, songs from the KEB cd from 08 & your ELP & ELPOWELL favorites. The performance of Tarkus alone is worth the price of this DVD. The whole band plays this perfect & Bonillas vocals are as good to a Greg Lake as your gonna get. At 66 & having dealt with severe hand troubles, Keith proves he is still a huge force in the musical world. I would recommend this DVD to not only ELP fans, but to those who enjoy great musicianship. Keep em coming Keith!!!!!!!",1290211200,,693,4.102941176470588
4258955,5,B00441GYVU,"I was actually in awe of the quality and performance of this video! Makes me want to see this band live. I would love to see ELP with Bonilla tour. I doubt it will happen but, if i had a choice between ELP today and this band I might opt for this one. The music is fresh and clean and Keith really shines. I love the extended MOOG solos.  Mark's guitar work is stellar and compliments Keith so much that it sounds like it was always there.  Wish there was a CD version of this!",1290211200,3,477,4.010526315789473
4258956,5,B00441GYVU,"This DVD is great! Marc Bonilla brings a real sense of class as a guitarist into the equation. His vocals are, dare I say ""better"" than Greg Lakes? (The last few times I saw ELP I though Lake was just lame. Emerson and Palmer were kicking ass but Lake was not!) Bonilla's guitar sound is excellent too, although I would love it to have been 10% louder. It is perfectly in context though, so no complaints. With the addition of a guitarist I find myself making comparisons to the guitarist Carl Palmer has been using over the years. Although Palmer's guitarist is incredible as well, Bonilla has him beat in the sound department. Palmer's guitarist sound is just harsh and ""grating"".

 The camera work is great here too...plenty of good angles on Keith. No, MTV style machine-gun editing here as it is a very solid production job. Sound is VERY good, some good 5.1 moments too. Song selection is excellent. The new material is just as strong as the classics.

The drummer is technically incredible. His playing is just spectacular. He is a tad lacking in stage presence as he has the look of a city bus driver on his face when he's playing :) The DVD is so good it's almost easier to pick on things which otherwise would be unfair. Great player though! The bass player is also very good but he barely moves. Perhaps the expectation of showmanship in every player is too much to ask for. Great musicians though!!!

I would love to see Keith keep Bonilla and get one of these young double-bass playing metal drummers in to give this music even more edge.  I love ELP but I have to say this is almost more vital at this point in time. Lake was great during the Crimson and early ELP days, but now he just seems to have lost the hunger.

 This DVD is a real treat for Emerson and Bonilla fans. Thank you so much for making this available. It makes ELP ""live at Montreux"" look ridiculous. What a great DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *By the way..Hope you are recovering well from your recent medical scare Keith! Thanks to you Mr Bonilla for your great contributions..a real class performance.",1290211200,5,2078,4.554959785522788
4258957,5,B00441GYVU,"This might be the best concert DVD to date! Amazing audio, camera work, musicianship, song arrangements. Hopefully we will see a Blu-ray version. Enjoy......",1289952000,9,157,5.583333333333333
4258968,5,B00441GYVU,"Finally we have an excellent recording from Keith Emerson on dvd. Yes the show from ELP at Montreux was good , even very good on blu-ray with that awesome sound. But this is so much better , with the addition of Marc Bonilla , the ELP-tunes receive a special treatement. This concert shows why Keith is still the master of the keyboards. Now , where is the blu-ray version ?",1335830400,,374,4.357142857142857
4258969,3,B00441GYVU,"This is not the greatest concert, but not bad for the price. Keith Emerson is super and I enjoyed the songs that he had the majority.  Mark Bonilla is unimpressive to me.  I think he had too much influence on stage figuring it was the Keith Emerson Band.  Would have preferred he stayed in the background as the bassist and drummer and shaved.",1312848000,,343,4.412698412698413
4258970,2,B00441GYVU,"I'm glad Keith is still working in spite of his current physical maladies with his hands.  Bonilla provides a good foil to Emerson's return to the stage without his ELP bandmates.  But the live gig in Hungary, available as a bonus DVD with the Keith Emerson Band CD, is so much better.  The Hungary rhythm section (bass and drums) was fresh and edgy. The Moscow rhythm section is not.  I wouldn't really recommend this DVD: many of the works--most notably, Lucky Man and Tarkus--were marred by all that ""heavy metal jamming"" at the end.  Also, I recall how cheesy Emerson's workstation pianos sounded this time around...

Nice to have an official live version of ""Touch and Go."" The Finale from the recent album is pretty thrilling, if not a little chaotic...",1309478400,,759,4.755725190839694
4258971,5,B00441GYVU,"I love this line-up (much prefer it to the first incarnation with Dave Kilminster) and it's wonderful to see the new material performed live.  This concert is an energetic performance, you can tell the band are enjoying themselves, and it has its poignant moments, as well, like Miles Away and their interpretation of Lucky Man, which Marc Bonilla sings very well.  It's a superior performance to the Paks Hungary set included on the Keith Emerson Band deluxe CD/DVD package, which does not include any new material.

But one of the most fun things about it is the camera angles -- lots of overhead shots of Keith's keyboard playing, not just the typical shots from the side.  As a keyboardist, I thoroughly enjoy watching just what exactly he is playing and how.

And the photo gallery is quite entertaining, as well.",1306886400,5,818,4.814285714285714
4258972,2,B00441GYVU,"Bought it after reading positive reviews. Great dissapointment. It just doesn't sound like ELP. I admire Marc Bonilla for trying hard and playing ELP music, but sorry, his voice is no match to Gregg's (even now days, with what's left of Gregg's voice). And even more of the same with his guitar playing stile. Basist is o'k but makes the music sound too hard and monotonous for ELP. I don't see anything this guys doing better then original ELP unlike others say. Sound and picture quality is o'k. Bonus material isn't helpful unless somebody enjoys watching naked (Keith's?)ass. I wouldn't recommend this DVD. Buy ELP Live in Montreux instead, it's so much better.
P.S. Front photo shows famous church in Petersburg. They couldn't find any nice shot in Moscow?",1300492800,,761,4.906976744186046
4258973,5,B00441GYVU,"This is a fantastic live performance of the Keith Emerson Band. I'm really glad I picked it up. Emerson can still play, though not quite has amazingly fast as he did in his heyday. Amazon has the CD running time of 70 minutes, but the DVD is actually much longer. Nearly 2 hours. Emerson can still play and really seemed to be enjoying himself, interacting with the audiance. Marc Bonilla's guitar work adds to the ELP classics, giving those selection a slightly different vibe. Many of the ELP songs have been extended. Lucky Man runs more than 10 minutes, while Tarkus clocks in at a lenghty 36 minutes. Tarkus, as an example, has several places in the middle that are different and yet intriguing, including a nice drum solo. More improvisational playing. Emerson's newer and less well known pieces typically run 1-2 minutes long. I am very pleased with this purchase.",1295827200,17,871,4.774834437086093
4258974,5,B00441GYVU,"I have been a long time fan of ELP, although there have been many historical DVD releases of their performances that are satisfying, none have been of good quality except  perhaps Live at Montreaux.

The band with Marc Bonila shines and fills the gap for an entusiastic performance of the group. Keith has made full use of the moog.  Iwas surprosed with the lucky man as Greg Lake's vocals are always in my head, but Marc's guitar rendition and keiths moog are outstanding.  This is also the hreatest Tarkus performance on DVD.  I hope there will be a DVD release from the Keith Emerson/Greg Lake tour last year. I was fortunate to catch this at the Nokia in NYC.

I hope Keith puts more out perhaos a DVD of the Reunion at the hIgh Voltage Festival.  Til then BUY THIS DVD AND LISTEN OFTEN",1295395200,5,790,4.444444444444445
4258975,5,B00441GYVU,"Keith put together a very unique group of musicians to update ELP to a modern rendition.  This DVD has all your favorites plus a few new pieces for those that do not like tour groups of old music out there.  If that's your style think of it this way - when was the last time you saw Keith Emerson live?  Marc Bonilla does a very credible Lake voice with his rendition of the ELP catalogue.  That's really not the most important contribution he makes to the band though.  It's his guitar playing.  You say there wasn't a whole lot of guitar in ELP?  Exactly.  Imagine ELP music reorchestrated for  guitar and you'll get why this is Keith Emerson Band featuring Marc Bonilla.  There is one drawback to scoring in a guitar part, it does tend to weaken the basslines.  On the important piece like Karn Evil 9, the bass is right where it is supposed to be.  In other areas, you do hear a lot of Roger Glover style mono bass lines.  Over all, it's still worth a 5.  Crank it to 11 though.

4258976,5,B00441GYVU,"Amazing shots and great quality. Anyone who wants to see the genius of a true innovator in music and, the pioneer of prog rock and electronics in music needs this dvd. not much else to be said. Talent beyond words. The rest of the band is also very talented. Amazing people and capturing excellent reviews for 45 years- Keith Emerson. Ted Canty",1293321600,6,344,4.564516129032258
4258977,5,B00441GYVU,"Excellent performance of all the band members specially Keith, even if you haven't heard of ELP, you will enjoy it!",1293235200,4,115,4.8
4258988,5,B00441GYVU,I have been an ELP fan for many years and particularly a Keith Emerson fan since I also play keyboards. He has always fascinated me with his style and arrangements. This DVD blew me away upon my first viewing. I have been watching it over and over. This band and the set compilation will not disappoint ELP fans. The band brings new life to the familiar favorites and forges on with newer selections. The video and sound are well executed. This DVD is worth every penny! For all guitarists out there..check out Marc Bonilla...he is an awesome compliment to Keith and his vocal integrity is strong! This DVD belongs in any serious music collection!,1292630400,3,647,4.684210526315789
4258989,5,B00441GYVU,"Rarely does music reach climax; Emerson does ... over and over
The master; miles and miles on that right hand, bled dry,  orchestra at the fingertips, master of sound.
Too many perfect performances
This is so good...
Pinnacle of the live concert.",1292457600,5,246,4.857142857142857
4258990,5,B00441GYVU,"I was a huge fan of ELP back in their heyday and have been, frankly, rather disappointed in many of the trio's efforts (or lack thereof) since that time. In many of their subsequent incarnations, there always seemed to be something missing. In Keith Emerson's case, I think he found that missing ingredient in the musical and performing talents of Marc Bonilla, along with fellow band mates Travis Davis and Tony Pia. As a quartet, they really bring a powerful, clear, and importantly ""fresh"" take on ELP's classic material. Marc Bonilla's guitar work blends seamlessly with mood of the music--it really adds a richness to the sound. Even more extraordinary is how well Emerson and Bonilla's new material comes across. Their new music is tastefully blended with the original ELP material and adds creative freshness to the performance. I really liked all of the tracks, but if pressed, I'd have to say ""Lucky Man"" and ""The Barbarian"" were standouts. By the way, ""Lucky Man"" hits an emotional depth that will really-really surprise you. Instrumental pieces like Keith's ""Piano Concerto"" and ""Tarkus will leave long-time fans of his plastered with a sustained grin of satisfaction on their faces--very cool stuff indeed. Of the newer material, I think the two-part composition ""Miles Away"" will grow on you will repeated listenings.

In summary, this ""IS"" the performance long-time ELP fans have been waiting for! Finally, an energetic, clear, powerful, and emotionally satisfying concert captured on DVD. It is a performance newcomers to progressive music should embrace as well. No doubt about it, 5-Stars!",1292025600,6,1606,5.176923076923077
4258991,5,B00441GYVU,"This is one of the finest live DVD's of a band that I have seen or heard in a long time!!!!! The 5.1 mix in excellent, the band is tight, very tight and well rehearsed.  I absolutely enjoyed the reworkings of some of the standard flag bearing tunes, particularly Lucky Man.  Keith and Marc added a whole new dimension to the song, that well, re-energized it.  The concert was captured in hi-def and I have to say the camera angles were spot on for showing the talents of Msr. Emerson, Bonilla, Davis and Pia, and they fullfill their work very well as the ""anchors"" to Keith soaring solos and Marc's ripping guitar.  From the opening we all come to expect, that familiar MOOG sample that announces Karn Evil, I was not let down.  The hair on my arms stood up once Marc hit that first ""Welcome back my friends"" lyric.  Keith's dalliances on his piano concerto stay true to the original, albeit with an added dimension brought on by the band.  Same for Bitches Crystal, again Bonilla's vocals are outstanding. I got to say though, that I found this piece a little too ""speeded up"" as if the band got launched from a jet, but man, they cooked, and Emerson's locked in left hand is incredible in 5.1!  I also tip my hat to complexities so well executed on the new pieces from the Keith Emerson Band album.  Miles away, Crusader's Cross, Marche Train and Finale.  But HEY! It does not stop there.  Keith's and Marc's re-working of Barbarian brings it back to life and could easily hold up to anything being put out by any band at this time.  It just ROCKS!  And as if this were not enough, we get a momentous version of Tarkus that hit all the right notes, up to the balls to the wall soloing on Aquatarkus,  with Emerson hitting everything instrument he could get his hands on, the Moog, the ribbon controller, the Korg Triton, the Hammond, the Oasys, something to see...And let's round that out with a huge, incredibly tight version of Nutrocker, in which it seems that Emerson plays 16 notes to every note payed by the Bass player.  All in all, the best 13 bucks I ever laid down for a DVD concert of this quality and impact.  I really, really,really dug it.",1291766400,7,2155,4.44529262086514
4258992,5,B00441GYVU,"Didn't you always want ELP to sound a little more like King Crimsom....c'mon, in your heart of hearts? I mean the original KC stuff. Here it is.  This is phenomenal.  Wish this show would come to U.S.  Kind of sounds like Crimson in places but not quite as dark...which is a good thing.....but still rip-roaring.

When I say like King Crimson, I don't mean an inferior copy.  More like, what if KC progressed and even got a little better.

This is way better than ELP",1291161600,3,467,4.435294117647059
4258993,5,B00441GYVU,"Listen, if like me, you have been a big fan of Keith and ELP this DVD is a must. Just recieved my copy from Amazon and reviewed it with my wife and WOW!

It is the best recording of Keith live ever made and his band is unbelieveable. Marc and the rest of the group can easy keep up with Keith. Cutting vocals by Marc! Production and mix are first rate but in this eara of digital multitrack video and audio recording and post production the mix is more album-like than live. And what better audience to record it in front of as they kept silent through each song until the end. Not an American crowd at all as we would be going bonkers at such a show.

Get it and crank it up.
Enjoy!",1290384000,2,683,4.051851851851852
4258994,5,B00441GYVU,"The delay on the release of this gem had me worried that my expectations would be too high for this performance when it finally came out.  They weren't.  I haven't seen musicianship of this caliber since Jean-Luc Ponty and Pat Metheny!  The concert is stunning, from start to finish.  It never lets up.  Keith Emerson is simply a keyboard legend. He continues to wow his fans, even with a disabled right hand  ( and that left is unbelieveable! ).  Marc Bonilla is the perfect complement to Keith...his vocal and guitar work have literally reinvented the classic ELP tracks of this show, yet still remain respectful and faithful to the original recordings by Emerson, Lake & Palmer.  I was initially disappointed, upon seeing that Pete Riley had been replaced by Tony Pia on drums...then I put this disc on.  Emerson has always surrounded himself with monster drummers  ( Joe Travers '98; Pete Riley '02-'06; Gregg Bissonette on Keith's new album ), and Mr. Pia is no exception.  I actually felt just a bit vindicated when Pia dropped a stick toward the end of his solo!  Speaking of mistakes...in this day and age of 'fixing' off-pitch vocals or off-tempo drums with Auto-Tune and Pro-Tools, I find it very refreshing that the couple of minor 'clams' during this concert were left intact.  It's an honesty that virtually no other band will allow on a ""live"" album.  These guys are so good, and the music so incredibly complex, that you can easily forgive the odd bum note or mistake.  My hat's off to Emerson in this regard.
Last but not least...if ANY player of Keith Emerson's caliber could be excused for conveying a superior attitude, it would be Mr. Emerson himself.  Not the case here. Emerson comes across with a surprising humility, in introducing these songs as well as acknowledging the enthusiastic applause.  The man simply looks so happy to be playing, and touring with such great support players.  This one's a rarity, folks.",1290384000,3,1939,4.824242424242424
4258995,5,B00441GYVU,"Man what a surprise when I watched this video! Emerson's band is extremely tight. The tracks off the new album were done to perfection.

4258996,5,B00441GYVU,"Yes, finally we have a DVD that truly represents the talent and power of Mr. Emerson. This is without a doubt the best video and audio representation in his and ELP's catalogue. The surround effects and bass response are the best I ever heard in a concert video. The band is great and the new music from Keith's latest cd is played excellent. You have to give Marc Bonilla much credit here for he being a great versatile musician has given Emerson a music challenge he hasn't had since ELP formed in 1970. If you have a surround sound system wait untill you hear the Moog!!! My only complaint is why not put the whole concert on the disk, oh well maybe on the Blu ray.",1290297600,12,668,4.309523809523809
8415564,4,B00441GYVU,"This one is bitter-sweet.  Don't compare this to the early days of ELP.  Just enjoy the music.  The musicianship is very good and the sound/j vision also good.  It is somewhat sad to see the reduced mobility of Mr. Emerson's hand due to its surgery years ago.  You can sometimes see the frustration on his face.  That being said, he still has much to smile about and appears to be having a good time.  The other guys are too.  I enjoy this one much more than the reunion High Voltage concert which was difficult to watch.",1518652800,,521,4.354166666666667

8415567,3,B00441GYVU,"Keith Emerson is terrific. However, I give this only 3 stars, since Marc Bonilla is not a good fit. Bonilla is too much of a ""shredder"" guitarist, which is unsuitable for Keith Emerson's style. Bonilla also does a terrible job singing songs originally performed by Greg Lake. It's too bad that Dave Kilminster could not have been in Keith Emerson Band for this, since his guitar style suited Emerson much better.",1483315200,,412,4.816901408450704

It's some really good retakes on the old ELP songs with enough variation and weaving of new and old tunes and themes to make it truly interesting. Marc Bonilla seem to restrain his tendencies to sound like a lounge lizard and does  a good job of covering the lyrics. Yeah, the drummer is good, but not Carl Palmer.

Even so, this is the best music purchase I've made in a log time. Essential for the ELP/Emerson fan.",1398211200,,591,4.221238938053097
8415573,5,B00441GYVU,"Give to the 60 years old Keith Emerson, some young arms, let him play his keyboards like he can and you will have a great evening of ELP music with new songs from his Kieth Emerson Band, which are quiet good and fits very well with the ELP's material. The role play by Marc Bonilla on guitar and vocals give a heavier sound to the usual ELP's sound. The songs of ELP have been re-arranged and that is quiet refreshing, the songs have more speed and more power with Bonilla's guitar work.

The set list doesn't have any dull moments, even ""Lucky Man"" is rocking!. And what a way to finish the concert with a 30 minutes of ""Tarkus"", that contains some improvisations. The sound is clear and powerful in 5.1 surround, a lot better than the ELP 40th anniversary DVD.",1363737600,,762,4.404255319148936
