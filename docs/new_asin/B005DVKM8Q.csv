8467692,5,B005DVKM8Q,"Wonderful footage of Anno Sensei, a direct student of Osensei, and his American students and now prominent teachers in their own right - Mary Heiny Sensei, Linda Holiday Sensei and Jack Wada Sensei.  There is concurrent translation and nice variation of real time and slow motion movement.  I use this dvd extensively in teaching at my dojo.
