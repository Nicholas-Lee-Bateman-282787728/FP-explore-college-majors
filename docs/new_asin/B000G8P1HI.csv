The three people in the original film were supposedly introduced in this film.  However, the short doctor performing the autopsy in the original film was assisted by a tall nurse and close examination of the original will clearly show her feminin movements along with the outline of her breasts through the contamination suit. Nowhere in this BS video was a women even hinted at let alone a tall large brested one.
This video is an attempt to either make more money or to keep the powers that be from creating an accident for Ray Santalli.

This movie is a perfect example of government propaganda and misdirection. Obviously the powers that be did not want the original movie to go public so this video should be called damage control 101.

Don't waste your money unless you enjoy seeing three clowns ad libing a story which they obviously had nothing to do with.",1332806400,,990,4.710982658959537
