5043871,5,B006ZUMMLE,Great collection,1416528000,,16,7.5
5043872,4,B006ZUMMLE,"These five dark action flicks based on contemporary comic book series are presented on five Blu-ray discs that fit into a compact case. The low-priced, high-value package offers superb picture and sound. There is no booklet, and two of the features (""The Punisher"" and ""Sin City"") don't come with any special features, but the remaining three (""The Crow,"" ""The Spirit,"" and """"Kick-Ass"") are chock-full of bonuses: making-of and behind-the-scenes featurettes, galleries of art and effects, deleted and extended scenes, commentaries by directors and profiles of writers, and more. Since the box is of Canadian issue, you can turn on French and English subtitles.

All of the films are well-made and star-studded, and only one -- ""The Spirit,"" with it's leaden dialog and wooden acting -- failed to please me, despite the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlet Johansson. (About this film, Roger Ebert famously cracked, ""To call the characters cardboard is an insult to useful packing material."") That popular and critical failure aside, this collection makes a satisfying purchase for those who like their movies moody, gritty, bloody, and kinetic.

My favorite is ""The Crow,"" a deadly serious film in which the title character is a ghost; ironically, lead actor Brandon Lee, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, lost his life in an on-set accident during production. Second is the monochromatic ""Sin City,"" a highly stylized picture written, directed, and produced by Frank Miller after his own comic book series; Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Jessica Alba play standout roles. Third is the over-the-top ""Kick-Ass,"" a phantasmagorical, garishly hued, blackly comedic explosion of violence starring Aaron Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Nicholas Cage. Finally, there is ""The Punisher,"" a tale of remorseless revenge with a strong cast that includes Thomas Jane and John Travolta.",1411257600,11,1897,5.3624161073825505
