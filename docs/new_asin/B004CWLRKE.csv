8423740,5,B004CWLRKE,"Franklin is my in my top three DVD series.  Teaches great lessons.  Real situations kids will face.  Kids learn there are good consequences for good choices and negative consequences for bad choices.  A favorite DVD for my preschooler and 2nd grader.  This DVD is a great deal and has 15 episodes.

8423741,5,B004CWLRKE,This DVD and 2 others are in a box set that costs about the same as this 1 DVD on its own.  I definitely recommend getting the box set instead.  On this video are about 15 Franklin episodes (not just 3).  They are the classic Franklin episodes.  I love that every episode has a great lesson.  Franklin is one of my kids favorites!,1344902400,,330,4.174603174603175
