7851945,5,6303585388,"Reba McEntire is extraordinary in this show that includes 12 songs, lots of costume changes, a couple of comedy skits, and an example of polished showmanship.
 Performed in 1994 in the vast Omaha Civic Center, this petite woman with the thousand volt personality shows she has beauty, brains, and enormous talent.
 The song list:
 1 : ""Respect"" ~ Reba opens the show with Aretha's classic, with power and pizazz in a white sparkling mini dress.
 2: ""They Asked About You"" ~
 3: ""Is There Life Out There"" ~ Reba changes into jeans and a shirt, and does this as a theater piece.
 4: ""The Greatest Man I Never Knew"" ~ a touching song about a father.
 5: ""Walk On"" ~ this ends with a full gospel chorus; a hand clapping, foot stomping good time.
 6: ""9 to 5"" ~
 7: ""For My Broken Heart"" ~ Reba changes into a long blue jeweled dress for this lovely song, with smoke clouds on the stage.
 The show cuts away for a funny ""I Love Lucy"" skit.
 8: ""Why Haven't I Heard from You"" ~ one of the very best numbers in the show. Reba is stunning and sultry in a blue mini dress, dancing and singing.
 9: ""Does He Love You"" ~ this is a terrific duet with one of her vocalists, Linda Davis.
 10: ""Take it Back"" ~ another costume change (green pants and silvery top) and here she sings and dances with six male dancers.
 11: ""Till You Love Me"" ~ a gorgeous ballad, with the prettiest dress of all, a long sequined pink gown that makes Reba look like a princess.
 12: ""Fancy"" ~ a truly great song, and my favorite of the show; and yes, yet another costume change (a spectacular red mini dress) for a blockbuster ending.

 Reba's musicians are outstanding:
 Joe McGlohon-sax and guitar /Andre Reiss and Kent Wells-guitars / Charlie Anderson-bass / Scotty Hawkins-drums / Paul Hollowell-piano / Terry Crisp-steel guitar / Douglas Sisemore Jr.-keyboard / Melissa Coleman, Linda Davis, Regina Leigh Plyer-vocals.
 One would enjoy this concert even if one didn't care for the music. Reba exudes warmth and charm as she chats with her adoring audience, and gives them what they came for...the voice, the musicianship, the humanity, and lots of razzle-dazzle. Total running time is 1 hour.",1082332800,9,2163,4.571428571428571
7851946,5,6303585388,"When you hear Reba sing on an album, you can hear the emotion in her voice. There is nothing like her, the way she brings a song to life. On tour though, her songs come to life. Visually you receieve another perspective on the song. This is a showcase of Reba's excellent talent as a singer/entertainer. A must have.",973123200,3,316,4.372881355932203
7851947,5,6303585388,I highly recommend this to anyone. She shows why she puts on the best concert of anyone in music.,943920000,2,97,4.157894736842105
7851948,4,6303585388,Reba is a joy to listen to and even better to watch.  You feel the electricity of her live performance.  If your VCR is connected to some decent sound equipment you'll experience the thrill of what her live shows  must be like.,912816000,,227,4.357142857142857
