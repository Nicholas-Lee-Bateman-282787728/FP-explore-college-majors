2671698,1,B000JJ4W6A,"This movie was so terrible I didn't stay until the end.  It was about missionaries breaking the rules.  The moral message was poor.  I don't think that any missionary has ever killed himself.  The Best Two Years was a much better movie about missionaries.

After seeing the first God's Army and then this, I sure hope no more are made.",1164240000,7,335,4.516666666666667
2671729,5,B000JJ4W6A,This movie reminds us of the reason for Christmas and the blessing of forgiveness. LDS Theme but good for anyone.,1361836800,,113,4.7
2671730,5,B000JJ4W6A,"This movie really hit me, it was emotional, gripping, awe inspiring, and just a great movie.  I am still running it through my head 24 hrs after watching it.  So far Dutcher has never disappointed me.",1333843200,,200,4.527777777777778
2671731,5,B000JJ4W6A,"I thought this movie was well worth the time to watch.  I think it accurately portrayed the problems some missionaries encounter.  It was well acted, well scripted.",1299542400,,164,5.037037037037037
2671732,1,B000JJ4W6A,"C'mon out and say it... This is an LDS propaganda film gone bad. A rough concept with a spark of promise that croaked under pressure. Cookie-cutter characters with easily-predictable [formula] situations. If the LDS people hate this movie, good. It's the first thing we've ever agreed upon. So, why did the producers hide the LDS affiliation? It reeks of covert manipulation, but golly, wow, in the end it's a harmless, and benign effort and nothing more unfortunate than a waste of several hundred cd's and cd-jackets. Maybe I'll hand my copy to the door-knocking Jehovah's Witnesses, and tell them how much better my cd is than a crummy pamphlet like theirs... nah-nah...",1299024000,,673,5.017857142857143
2671733,5,B000JJ4W6A,"Why do Mormons hate this film? Because it shows the ugly secret they don't want the world to know and that is their missionaries are not perfect. One missionary in this film does the most unforgivable thing and that is have sex while on a mission. Most members would have you believe, and to be honest, want to believe these things never happen. But they have and they do. The problem is that these guys are human too. Some mess up, it just a fact of life. What is interesting is how Dutcher went outside what would be the normal LDS reaction and decided to show how wonderful grace in these situations can be. But understand while a lot of grace is shown in this film(because I believe it is how Dutcher would like to see Mormonism change to this direction) in real life this kid would have been treated like dirt and even kicked out of the LDS church. I know because my brother was. You can tell Dutcher was exploring his beliefs here concerning grace and forgiveness as shortly after release he left the LDS church. The members left him also hating this film with a passion(just read some of the reviews from LDS members here). As far as I'm concerned the LDS church was the biggest loser this time. They lost one of the very few intelligent filmmakers they had. To Mainstream Christians(of which I count myself among that number) give it a try if for no other reason then to see a Mormon explore how powerful the grace of Jesus really is. To those wondering how I may know so much about Mormonism, I was born and raised in the LDS church and left at the age of 33 when I became Born Again.",1271462400,,1593,4.348993288590604
2671734,1,B000JJ4W6A,"This movie is a just a lame excuse that the producers had because they had no other ideas for a movie.  I am LDS and think this is ridiculous!!! I would NOT consider this movie as a family friendly. I feel duped by the name of the movie. I am offended that the producer is LDS....REALLY????? Are you sure????  The following ideas had to be the thoughts going through his mind when he wanted to do a movie:

'Hmmm...I want to do an LDS movie and show that LDS people are normal too, but I have no ideas. Uhhhhhh....duhhhhhhh....Oh, I know, lets do a movie on the worst things ever that a person can do!! Yeah! Let's do a movie that has murder, suicide,  oh yeah... and missionaries disregarding mission rules and having an affair with a porno girl next door!  We won't show any sex, but we'll talk about it and show lots of gang violence, and blood everywhere!!  What a great, feel good movie!  Everyone will  show this to all their friends and impressionable age children  to let them know that everyone makes bad mistakes and its all ok. Heck, everyone acts like this!'

Some ""God's Army"" HA!

How stupid does Richard Dutcher think his audience is? PLLLEASE!  My intelligence is insulted.  Does he really think this is an attempt at going main stream? Rarely would a non-LDS person watch this movie, why would they? I'm LDS and I'm insulted and feel misrepresented. Shame on you, Richard, for trying to market this as LDS.  Give us a break!!!!!!! I hope you have another job lined up. Maybe flipping burgers somewhere, that seems more on your I.Q. and talent level.",1259712000,2,1566,4.526690391459074
2671735,5,B000JJ4W6A,"I'm a big movie buff, and this is hands-down my all-time favorite religious movie. This is an interfaith story about intersecting lives and the healing power of Jesus Christ. Achieves a realism in its acting and dialogue that is all too rare in this genre of film, which is known for sappy melodrama and unrelatable characters. States of Grace examines the harsh realities of the world in a tasteful but uncompromising way; by doing so, it reveals the power and essence of Christianity, and provides insight into why so many believe in Christ (it's not the ignorance that some outside of Christianity might suppose). Also shies away from harsh judgements, displaying a profound understanding of the relationship between justice and mercy. Finally, States of Grace is a cautionary tale about pride and ignoring grace. While I'd knock off a half star for some pacing issues in the middle, by and large this is a powerhouse film. I am a Latter-Day Saint, but my friends of other faiths all love this movie.",1254096000,,1003,4.871345029239766
2671736,5,B000JJ4W6A,"Kinda scary for kids, but a great movie! Loved the suspense, action and surprises. More violence than expected, but worthwhile way to spend an evening and open up discussions with teens and adults.",1252540800,,197,5.0
2671737,4,B000JJ4W6A,"I get the idea the filmaker is showing for a different audience than just Mormans or other true believers. The two missionaries could have been a template for Moonies, Jehohahs Witnesses even Baptists-- high intensity Christian movement with full time missionaries in contact with the public.
Does he play loose with some of the rules to convey the story? Maybe so and for me it works.

Morman Missionaries are just a vehicle for the movie to revolve around because we got Penticostals, Lutherns and a few others hanging on the edges like so many threads on a scrappy robe.

We also get violence with blood, LOTS, bullets, knives, guns, buts its all in context; no gratuitous sex scenes however, though it is applied in a directly vague way, so there is something for almost everyone

What scriptual reading I hear is presented dull and stale so the story is not preaching Pacific Garden Mission ""Unshacked"" but more about telling a human drama revealing even GOD is hard pressed to overcome the forces of human nature.

The stories tell, in their winding way, there is always the light at the end of a tunnel, land at the finish of the long sea voyage, a green and blue planet in the vast darkness of space... HOPE.

Additionally, those unfamiliar with the Morman Missionary community, this is a delightful voyeurs' peek behind the door that says ""EMPLOYEES ONLY."" Its revealed these guys are complex people with thoughts and feelings uniquely their own and not brainwashed products of religious doctrine.

I'd give it 5 stars for acting, the situation, warm and fuzzies but take away one for the CSI moment that just did not happen which would have otherwise placed a certain guy in a lot of trouble(glaring plot hole).

The commentary on the rules: those who follow them, those with enough sense to bend them and those that go ""oops,"" apply globally.",1187568000,,1853,4.789968652037618
2671738,1,B000JJ4W6A,"The cover of the DVD says that it is a contemporary ""Christian"" drama. First, this is no Christian drama because a Christian drama focuses on Jesus Christ and not on Mormon missionaries. It is definitely Mormon propaganda because it starts off by having one of the main characters explain that present day Mormons do not practice polygamy anymore. The Mormon faith sanctioned the practice in the past. In fact, Joseph Smith - the so called ""Mormon phrophet"" and LDS founder had several wives. It also shows the main character flashing ""The Book of Mormon."" He says, ""its like the Bible."" Many biblical scholars would disagree to that claim. The Book of Mormon teaches that the Mormon God (Elohim) was once man - a created being and has several goddess wives. In contrast, the Judeo-Christian God ""Jehovah"" or ""Yahweh"" was the beginning and has no creator. He doesn't have any wives. Second, anything that glorifies the good works of man as oppose to salvation through Christ alone is not from Christ. Although, the film has some truths in it, e.g. salvation through Christ, I would not hinge my faith on mixed messages as a previous review said. God does not send out mixed signals. His word in the Bible is clear. Isaiah says that ""all our righteous acts are like filthy rags."" A real Christian drama would NEVER feature bikini clad women and have men oggling them even if they call themselves ""missionaries."" The Bible says that ""Any man who looks at a woman lustfully, has committed adultery in his heart."" Moreover, the book of Mormon teaches that Jesus Christ and Satan are brothers - both of whom are sons of Elohim; that all Mormons will become like God; that Jesus married Mary, Martha and Mary Magdalene (polygamy) and; that Elohim had sex with Mary to conceive Jesus; and that Joseph Smith was the direct descendant of Jesus from one of his marriages. I don't think any Christian faith would espouse these principles. Most importantly, the clear evidence of the Holy Bible's power is in its power to change lives. I've seen drug addicts, homosexuals, criminals, really evil people turn to Christ and leave their lifestyles behind. They come out changed people after hearing Biblical truth. I have a lot of LDS friends. I consider them good people. A lot of them are upper class, white and privileged people. Very different from the drug addicts, etc. I have met. They look prestine from the outside. But, I have yet to see a real change in their lives after reading the Book of Mormon. I can see that the emphasis is good works - the outside. Not what Jesus really looks at - the heart. If you want a genuine Christian drama you'd be better off watching ""The Passion of the Christ,"" ""End of the Spear"" or ""Facing the Giants."" These films give glory to the one who deserves all the glory - JESUS CHRIST, not the ""good works"" of Joseph Smith or 2 dorks on white shirts with black nameplates who do not know what they are talking about.",1183939200,,2943,4.683397683397684
2671749,5,B000JJ4W6A,"States of Grace is a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly.

It is exactly the film my family needed to see at the time that we saw it. An utterly believable, perfectly directed and wonderfully acted inspirational film about sin, repentance, loss, faith and redemption.

Being LDS, especially a returned missionary, may help one to get all of the nuance, but I believe that this is a film that should be uplifting to anyone who doesn't just absolutely hate Mormons.

My favorite line from the movie... You don't have to die for your sins... someone already did that for you"".

Finally this is a great Christmas tale... but you don't get that until the end.

If you are in the mood for an inspirational tale, this is a movie for you! Just be sure to pay attention!",1181347200,11,767,4.528985507246377
2671750,5,B000JJ4W6A,"This story to two young missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who encounter and interact with a homeless Pentecostal preacher, a wounded gang-banger, a struggling actress, and, of course, their own frailties.  There is no church propaganda here.  In fact, there is some telling in-house social commentary going on here that applies well to any religious tradition.

There are powerful scenes and situations throughout the presentation.  Temptation can be subtle, and it's grip gradual.  Likewise, personal redemption sometimes just requires a little openness--and seeing the big picture, instead of the immediate policy limitations (do we let the sick homeless guy sleep over or not?)

In the end, what pushes me to the five-star mark is the producer's daring.  His characters are real, flawed, and yet marked with God's image.  Wrong choices are made, and problems do not neatly resolve.  Yet, humanity, compassion, and sincere faith do result in miracles.

Neither my wife, nor I, are LDS.  Nevertheless, we found our own Christian faith affirmed by States of Grace.  Two thumbs up, as the pros say!",1174089600,27,1129,5.211111111111111
2671751,4,B000JJ4W6A,"A number of people have mentioned in various ways that this movie sends a mixture of messages out.  One really blaring one is shouted out by a street preacher at the end: ""You gotta fight the devil! You gotta FIGHT!""  And that's what happens in ""States of Grace.""  It leaves some holes in the perfect fabric, and it doesn't show people doing what they should be doing very much.  In fact, those moments or threads of ""righteousness"" (as subject to the audience's interpretation--not to say I don't have my own bias as a religious person) are the rays of light shining through some very dark storm clouds.  Evil things happen all the time, and some of the good things come to naught--such as when the gang-banger-turned-Mormon-convert Carl sees the light at the last moment when he is about to put a bullet (the Monday after his baptism) into the forehead of a rival gang member.  What's so bad about that, you ask?  Carl's pal, who is thoroughly unconverted, is still mad, and he happens to have his own gun.  Carl hears one shot behind him, and he turns around to see his two friends standing over the now dead body of the gangster whose life he has just spared.

A missionary gets sent home for an interesting reason: what is perfectly normal in the eyes of almost everyone around him (namely, a man sleeping with a woman he's not married to) is in his standards--and his church's--a grave sin.  Who's right?  Dutcher is careful not to say, but the girl, who honestly cares about the missionary, tries to see things the way he sees them, and she's willing to believe that the situation (she doesn't even know there is a situation at first) is as serious as he believes it is.  Interestingly, though, amidst these and other tragedies, some vital threads of good are preserved.  Carl throws his gun into the surf and bids his gang life goodbye, the missionary and the actress both realize that their lives (which are now both damaged) can still be fixed, and everyone shares what can only be called a ""Holy Moment"" where all the sins, misdeeds and tragedies are laid aside in a common realization: none of us is perfect, and the only way we can ever hope to get there is together.  So while the movie doesn't entertain the way much modern cinema does, I suspect that most people will find it worth their while.",1173916800,5,2310,4.561743341404358
2671752,5,B000JJ4W6A,"I agree with many of the other comments/reviews that have been written on this movie. I found a mix of emotions as I was watching this movie. (and perhaps that's what the director was after?) I agree with many of the comments about the need for a repentance and taking steps to change before the 'sinner' receives forgiveness, but I also see the reality of life and how we are ALL sinners and acknowledge that it is God who is, and will be, the judge in the end.

Was I bothered by the ending of the movie, and everyone being all forgiving without the 'sinner(s)' taking steps toward true repentence? I guess I could be if I chose to be, but as stated above I'm not the judge and won't be in the end. We don't know the feelings, hearts, and desires of all the people around us. I would recomend to anyone that was offended or bothered over this movie to read ""Believing Christ"" and ""Following Christ"" by Stephen Robinson.

In the end this IS a fictional tale with actors in a simulated, but seeming very true, creation of the realities of life. Whatever your oppinions when it's all said and done. This movie is a 5-star film worth seeing at least once.",1167696000,4,1153,4.383177570093458
2671753,5,B000JJ4W6A,"I am not Mormon, but I would have to say I have never felt closer to Mormonism, and Christ's message of love, redemption, and hope, than after viewing States of Grace.  I feel it is one of the finest films of any type I have ever seen.

States of Grace movingly depicts the power of God's healing love, mercy, and redemptive grace that comes after a fall and repentance. I think that Richard Dutcher's portrayal of 'real', imperfect  Mormon missionaries in both States of Grace and God's Army makes it easier for outsiders such as myself to open their hearts and minds to them.

To me, States of Grace shows the heart of Mormonism and the heart of Christianity. Actually, it offers a look inside the heart of any sincere spiritual seeker struggling towards greater goodness.",1166400000,12,774,4.669117647058823
2671754,4,B000JJ4W6A,"The best of it's genre, States of Grace is Dutcher's best work to date.

He creates realistic dialogue, the acting was all top-notch.  It's message of redemption is universal, not just for the mormons.

Sadly the only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the last 5 minutes.  It stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the movie.  Jarringly.  Just turn the movie off 5 minutes early.  Please, chapter skip to the credits.  You'll thank me.

Some may complain about missionaries beaking the rules, but, hey, live in the real world.  Missionaries beak the rules all the time.  The movie is about forgiveness, if no one sins then this was all rather pointless.",1165449600,5,659,4.643478260869565
2671755,3,B000JJ4W6A,"This is mostly a very good movie that deals meaningfully with redemption and the varying states of grace we find ourselves in, and with the need to help each other more than judge each other.  It follows two LDS missionaries and the people they meet, as they struggle with life and with their pasts, and as they try to build better futures.  It isn't a religious tract as one reviewer seems to demand (perhaps he can find himself a black and white filmstrip somewhere in a church library).

Up until the end, I was liking this movie considerably, although the truly bizarre mixed messages at the end put the kibosh on that.  Then my wife pointed out that I should have been concerned earlier on by another glaring flaw.  Here are the two problems.  [SPOILERS APPROACHING]  First, one missionary fornicates with a woman living in the apartment next door.  In the broader American culture, that would be no big deal at all.  In LDS missionary culture, where standards are very strict and clear, it is an extremely grave sin.  It means the end of the mission, and automatic excommunication from the church.  The personal results are devastating.  But at the end of the movie the missionary and woman are having a Kumbaya moment by a nativity scene, with the mission president, missionary's mother, and fellow missionaries present.  That would never, ever happen in real life.  It's unthinkable, and it's offensive to most Mormons to even imagine that someone having done that would be holding their dearie as they blithely stare off into the sunset with the people the missionary has betrayed and dishonored all around him.  Why Dutcher would put it in beggars the imagination.  If the point is that we should be instantly forgiving of anything, without a repentance process, then he's so for off the doctrinal mark for his target audience that he's going to leave them wondering if he has a pinwheel for a moral compass.  I myself will take the last scene of Brigham City over this, any day.  Second (but earlier in the film), a gang banger turns his life around and leaves the hood behind, but then his little brother gets himself killed while trying to be a gangsta.  Big brother rounds up his violent homies, riles them up, and they go hunting the killers.  Just as big brother is about to take revenge, he realizes he's better than that, and walks away.  Whereupon his friend goes ahead and kills the killer.  Then big brother goes to a baptism and everyone in his new circle is happy; what just happened is apparently not worth a second thought.  As my wife pointed out, that's just wrong.  Where's the accountability for what he just did?  Legally, it's felony murder at best (if not out and out murder under an accomplice liability theory).  You don't get to be involved in a felony during which someone is killed, and not be liable for murder.  The more I think about it, that whole part of the movie is wierd.  I don't like thinking about what Dutcher's point is here; it seems a lot closer to Babylon than Zion, more like the standardless and all accepting mindlessness of modern pop culture/liberalism/Godless theology than the beliefs most viewers hold dear.

Could have been a great movie, especially with Dutcher making it.  Should have been a great movie, especially in comparison to the drivel coming out of Halestorm's LDS-oriented ""comedy"" factory.  Wasn't a great movie.",1165276800,19,3387,4.758147512864494
2671756,5,B000JJ4W6A,"Though many will see this film as a product of the LDS culture, such a perception minimizes its artistry.  Richard Dutcher is credited as beginning Mormon-themed movies, but _States of Grace_ transcends the genre he himself created.  This is a universal movie about empathy, compassion, repentence, forgiveness, humanity, and redemption.  It is unquestionably the best film Dutcher has made, and rises far above any other film which might be classified as ""Mormon.""  Its audience should not be limited to those most familiar with Mormon missionaries.  The missonaries could be Catholic priests or Evangelical ministers and the movie would still succeed. It is a beautiful depiction of the growing pains we humans must experience if we are to mature in our sense and expression of moral and social responsibility.",1164412800,24,812,5.3125

The performances remind us once again that Dutcher is a real filmmaker, not a Mollywood hack; and the story is beyond moving.  At the risk of making it sound like a moralistic film (it's not), I have to say  that States of Grace is also deeply spiritually edifying.",1164412800,13,404,4.811594202898551
2671758,5,B000JJ4W6A,"(The title was the review comment Jeff Shannon from the Seattle Times gave.)

States of Grace is a remarkable piece of art from the director of Brigham City and God's Army. Director, Richard Dutcher beautifully depicts the conversion of two LDS missionaries. Though it is the story of two LDS missionaries it is a moving film for any Christian, from any religion. The acting and the script is strong. The filming and cinematography are powerful. This movie breaks the boundaries of cheesy-poke-fun LDS films that have previously been released. It portrays real situations and struggles, and thus real feelings and emotions. Not a sugar coated, all is well in Zion film. A very moving spiritual film! States of Grace shows the true power of life-changing faith even through adversity. Wonderful film, definitely favorite faith based film!
