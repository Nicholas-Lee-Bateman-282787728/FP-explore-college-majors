8206521,4,B000SRH2GA,"I tried out the Lazy Lizards purple mat in my therapeutic OMazing Kids yoga group at the JD McCarty Center for Children with Developmental Disabilities. Since I only had one of the mats and a group of 4 young boys, I used the mat as a special surprise towards the end of the group. Each child got to take turns getting on the mat, pointing to one of the pose pics and then we all did that pose. This worked GREAT for this group of young boys who had varying disabilities, communication challenges & some behavior issues. The mat provided a way for them to communicate a choice without the risk of yoga cards being damaged (if you work with kids with special needs or behavior challenges you have probably experienced the loss of precious yoga cards). One of the young boys was having a particularly rough day and using the Lazy Lizards mat was the best part of the class for him. He giggled & smiled as we all became ""frogs"" after he pointed to that pic on the mat.

*I like that the mat is eco-friendly, closed cell construction, has rounded corners & is thick enough to provide a little extra cushion.
*I like that the pics on the mat are large and that there are only 12 poses on the mat. When a couple of the young boys in our class were unable to make a choice out of a field of 12, I gave them a choice of 2 poses that were next to each other on the mat.
*It's nice to be able to turn the mat over to a plain solid side for kids who might be overwhelmed by the visual stimulation of all the pose pics. Or those who might take it literally that they can only do those poses or do those poses in that order on the mat (you will be able to relate to this if you work with kids with Autism Spectrum Disorders or other special needs).
*I liked the playful nature of the DVD and that it showed a realistic depiction of what a yoga class for young kids looks like. Kids were allowed to participate & enjoy the class at their level. While the DVD is marketed for ages 3+, based on my experience I would suggest that it would be most appealing to young kids (ages 3-7). My favorite parts of the DVD were the seed-to-flower & making a slice of pizza sequences.

Other thoughts: While the music in the background of the DVD was usually pleasant, at times it made it difficult to hear the yoga instructor. This also could be overstimulating or make it difficult for kids with Sensory Processing Disorder, Autism, Central Auditory Processing problems or other special needs. Two of the poses may be a little confusing to kids who some experience with yoga: tree (is really more like mountain with arms lifted) & flamingo (is what tree pose traditionally looks like).

8206522,2,B000SRH2GA,I bought this for my son and I to do yoga together.  It was overly simplistic and didn't hold either of our attention.  I would get a regular yoga DVD instead.,1293840000,,159,4.096774193548387

8206526,2,B000SRH2GA,"I bought this DVD for my 2-year old.  I was really surprised that my 2-yr old loved it.  She ask for it everyday, mind you she only does the first half of this DVD.

My only complaint is - Each new position aren't equally timed.  Some poses are too long while others are done too fast. Its not really well organized.

If you are looking for a well quality, professionally done yoga DVD, this isn't for you.  This DVD is more like a small production that anyone can make. Its not really worth the price that I purchased it for ($17.95 + shipping).  The video isn't editted well.

However, my little one really loves it, so I guess it all worked out.",1245196800,4,648,4.254098360655738
