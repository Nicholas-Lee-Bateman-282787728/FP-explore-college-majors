8114622,2,B000EVE92A,"This film is purely ludicrous and should only interest horror fans because of its obscurity.

A balding gypsy woman is arrested for kidnapping a child and, for reasons beyond my comprehension, she jumps out the window to her death.  Evidently to avenge her mother, the gypsy's witch daughter curses the daughter of the police commissioner.  She gives the girl a figurine and a necklace which seem to allow the ghost of the dead gypsy to enter her body.

There's a dumb levitation scene which seems to serve no purpose other than to confirm to the audience that, yes, she is indeed possessed.  The possessed little girl acts out the maligned misdeeds of the gypsy by sacrificing an infant, speaking obscenities, unconvincingly twisting her torso 360 degrees, loving Lucifer, engaging in a lot of telekinetic nonsense around the house, strangling people, a random castration, mimicking people's voices, baby snatching, holding evil gypsy witch meetings.

It's all rather melodramatic and boring.  Very boring.  The story doesn't seem to have any aim as we watch the possessed girl carry out one sin after another.  In the end a priest burns a crucifix on her forehead and she falls impaled on a big cross.  Nobody wins, especially not the viewers.

IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  If you like random and obscure horror movies then I'd suggest The Nesting (1981), The Outing (1987), Deadly Blessing (1981) and The Sentinel (1977).

8114623,5,B000EVE92A,"This Spanish film was made by the usually competent Armando De Ossorio creator of the BLIND DEAD series. It's cheap and ugly with some of the funniest dubbing I've ever heard. The effects are terrible and there's almost no blood and gore. Still it's worth a look just to see how low a possessed child will go. This witchy brat even stoops to infanticide and cannibalism (off screen, unfortunately). What she does to the boyfriend of her governess has to be seen to be believed. If the actress who portrays little possessed Susan looks familiar then you've probably seen  WHO CAN KILL A CHILD?, another Spanish horror flick made around the same time. She's the kid who beats an old man to death with his own cane in that film. This is a must-see for fans of 70's Spanish horror. I've seen both VHS versions of this. Get THE POSSESSED. It has a better source print than the version released as DEMON-WITCH CHILD (which is somewhat faded and reddish). There is also also a made-for-television movie called THE POSSESSED so don't confuse it with that one.",1282089600,,1051,4.650537634408602
