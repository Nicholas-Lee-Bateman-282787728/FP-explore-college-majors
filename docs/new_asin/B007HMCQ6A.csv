8516740,3,B007HMCQ6A,"Watered down PG cheese barbarian movie. No blood, gore, or no nudity. This is as about as clean cut as a Disney movie and rip off story of the Conan movies. I enjoyed the other 3 films in this franchise more (Iron Warrior, Blademaster, Quest for the Mighty Sword). This one basically tells how Ator became Ator in a rushed uncreative way. He finds some blond chick and for some reason a Bear cub follows them around even though they never acknowledge the bears presence. The final battle with the Giant Spider is as about as scary as a Sesame Street character as you can see the strings of the puppeteer moving the spiders legs. Utter B movie cheese, I like B movies, but this one is mediocre beyond belief and has low entertainment factor.",1425427200,,740,4.488888888888889

8516742,4,B007HMCQ6A,"Ator, like Conan, is the more serious of the barbarian movies from the 80s.  However, the editing and the acting will make you laugh and entertained from beginning to end.  While Ator doesn't hang glide or meet tribesmen wearing sunglasses like he does in Cave Dwellers, he does shadow fight himself and go against a spider puppet.",1403395200,,331,4.7894736842105265
8516743,3,B007HMCQ6A,"This Italian barbarian film is one in a long line of films starring Miles O'Keeffe starring as Ator. All this is very harmless fun that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Way better than those TWILIGHT films because it's more entertaining. Brief scenes of nudity may make it unfit for pre-teens, even though it is rated PG.",1390867200,3,325,4.620689655172414

8516745,4,B007HMCQ6A,"Bad hair and hairy clothes are the highlights of this epic madness.  Ator the Fighting Eagle is stunningly incompetent on every level except for the baby bear that managed to steal the film, supplying the most realistic performance of the bunch.  The half-baked plot involves a prophecy of a man who will save the people from the tyrannical rule of a very big spider.  When this savior is killed, the prophecy changes course and becomes a prophecy about the son of the man who would be their savior.  (It's always nice to have an escape clause.)  This son is born with a tattoo (which might have garnered him a cover on a tabloid), and instantly becomes an adult in a hippy commune.  He learns a hard lesson straight off when he marries his sister who isn't his sister and learns how tough it in to fight with flowers in your hair.  From that point on, we learn that this supposed hero is easily duped and more easily captured by women.  I couldn't help but think this is the guy who's supposed to save the world!  If not for a shiny shield, all would be lost.
Yes, this movie is just plain awful.  But it also has a certain charm; I never fail to laugh every time I watch it.  I was more than thrilled when it was released on DVD.
So, yes, it's going into my collection (because you can never have too many lousy movies that make you laugh.  In fact, I think there's a rule about that somewhere.  Like not wearing white after Labor Day).",1345939200,,1438,4.340823970037453
8516746,3,B007HMCQ6A,"1982's ""Conan the Barbarian"" was a mega-hit in North America and abroad and thus it was none too surprising that a number of filmmakers, from the low budget end of the line, pumped out many a similar effort in the early '80s, all attempting to cash in on even a fraction of its box office.

The Italians were especially quick off the mark in this way, as they produced several pictures in the ""Conan"" ilk before the year even drew to a close!  One such film is ""Ator: the Fighting Eagle"" (1982), which was directed by the late Joe D'Amato (although he is identified in the closing credits under the pseudonym ""David Hills"" -- rarely did any American distributor want to let the cat out of the bag that what you are seeing is not an authentic American-made product, although the often shoddy dubbing jobs usually give it away).  D'Amato's name will already be familiar to serious fans of low budget exploitation films, as he is known for ""Anthropophagus,"" ""Beyond the Darkness,"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Endgame-1985-VHS/dp/B00004CIUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Endgame (1985) [VHS</a>], among others.

Miles O'Keefe (""Tarzan, the Ape Man"") stars as the title character, whose formerly peaceful village is disrupted and ultimately slaughtered when, on his wedding day, a band of marauding bandits from the Temple of the Spider God plunder and ransack and level the place, taking his bride to be captive.  Edmund Purdom (of ""Pieces"" and ""2019: After the Fall of New York"" fame, and barely recognizable here) also appears as the mystic overlord who teaches Ator the ways of the warrior and introduces him to a nifty magic sword.  The rest of the movie is about Ator's quest to avenge his people's death and to rescue his lover from the clutches of a giant mechanical spider (of which you can actually see the thin wires that are propping it up at one point -- oops!)

This movie is not without a certain charm.  Budget constraints show in nearly every frame and the corny dubbed medieval dialogue is inspired, not to mention there is a cute bear cub that accompanies Ator throughout the picture.

My main reason for buying this DVD, though, is that it also features one Sabrina Siani, who co-stars as Roon, a scantily clad female rogue who sides with Ator in their journey to the Spider's temple.  So singularly gorgeous is this woman that the back of the DVD even includes a quote from legendary drive-in critic Joe Bob Briggs, who notes, ""Bo Derek naked is nothing compared to Sabrina Siani.""  Agreed wholeheartedly!

Therein, though, lies my main qualm with the movie.  It's just a little too tame for me.  I guess I am spoiled by the non-stop nudity in such sword & sorcery sleazefests that would follow like ""Deathstalker"" and ""Barbarian Queen.""  Given the PG rating of ""Ator"" on the other hand, exploitation lovers looking to savor a little T & A here are sure to be disappointed.

As for the DVD itself, the always reliable Scorpion Releasing presents a new widescreen transfer that is better than the previous 2003 Legacy Entertainment full screen edition (and with the original movie poster for the cover to boot), but I think there is only so much salvaging you can do to a 30-year-old no budget film that probably didn't even look that sharp to begin with.  This means that things still look rather grainy and worn down throughout, but not too bad as to be distracting.  Also, the optional intro and outro by Katarina in Katarina's ""Kat Scratch Cinema"" theater is amusing.  Sadly, there is no featurette or really any other bonus materials to be found here, other than some trailers for other Scorpion DVD titles.

While this film is ultimately a little too tame and lightweight for my tastes, it has garnered a cult following of its own over the years, not to mention they would go on to make three sequels!  If you like sword & sorcery films and low budget Italian cinema trash from the early '80s in general (as I do), you could do a whole lot worse than this one.

[FINAL SIDENOTE: Those wishing to see more (and I do mean MORE) of Sabrina Siani should check out Franco Prosperi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invincible-Barbarian-The-1983/dp/B000Z16G1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invincible Barbarian, The (1983)</a>.  It is another Italian ""Conan"" clone but Sabrina serves to bare all in it, if you know what I mean.  As of June 2012, there are now DVDs being offered for the first time on Amazon of that as well as 1984's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2020-Texas-Gladiators/dp/B000MGHAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2020 Texas Gladiators</a>, a post-apocalyptic effort also directed by D'Amato and where Sabrina also reveals her hidden assets.  Both come highly recommended to fellow trash conoisseurs specializing in the low end of the line (see my reviews elsewhere on Amazon).]",1340755200,17,4939,5.174623115577889
