8456968,1,B0054RX2P4,"RIP Terry Gordy
I'm a fan of Pro Wrestling Shoot Interviews but, this is just down right horrible
RF Video had no business putting this footage out and trying to sell it as a 5 Star shoot interview
This was at the wrong time in Gordy's life to even try do this type of sit down interview
He was put through  the mill and you can just tell he's blown-out

Avoid this it's a terrible way to remember a true legend in Pro Wrestling",1450224000,,428,4.083333333333333
8456969,1,B0054RX2P4,"Terrible.  The only thing Gordy says is ""sure was"", ""um hum"", and ""it was all good"".  Like watching an interview with the dude from Sling Blade.",1425340800,,144,4.5
8456970,4,B0054RX2P4,"I've been trying to find out when exactly this was recorded by RF, although going by their own comments it appears to have been not long prior to Gordy's death. The passing of the Fabulous Freebird was indeed a wrestling tragedy, all too common in this business. Although the man had certainly abused his body with alcohol and painkillers thru the years, Gordy lived quite differently than his image suggested.
  A proud father (his son has wrestled in WWE as 'Slam Master J'), ""Bam Bam"" stayed out of trouble on the outside of the ring. While this may not seem like any sort of accomplishment, I'd think when you have a 300 lb wrestler chasing Vicodins with shots of Jack Daniels, the likelihood of finding him in some category of crime blotter would be high.
  This shoot video covers all of Terry Gordy's professional career, which had basically just ended. All fans of the man and/or the Freebirds know that he was one of the most underrated wrestlers in history, at least by American fans. Promoters and other wrestlers of course knew of his prodigous talent; fortunately, so did the fans in Japan. Those fans, as well as promoter Giant Baba, helped to turn Gordy into a verifiable legend in that country.
  My only caveat with this shoot is the same as with many shoots-the interviewers aren't always as prepared as they should be. Although far better than the horrendous interview with the great Lance Russell, I'd like to see interviewers who are at least as familiar with their subject as I am.",1338249600,4,1503,4.695817490494297
