8619856,3,B00G047A44,I really just needed the 20 minute workout without the explanation. This does not have that DVD. This set of DVDs is for beginners as she explains in detail how o perform the moves. I wound up ordering just the 1 DVD that I needed.,1502841600,,231,4.155555555555556

8619858,4,B00G047A44,"I started doing the Winsor Pilates basic workout after having my first child one year ago.  It was easy to do in the house while she was napping since getting to the club was not the easiest thing to do.  I have been very active in the past and had even run a half marathon right before becoming pregnant.  I am slimmer now then I was pre-baby and weigh 10 pounds less.  Two months of training for the half marathon didn't even help me lose inches like Winsor Pilates has.  I have lost 2-3 inches in my waist as well as 3-4 inches in my hips.  I couldn't believe it!  I have been doing the 20 minute workout 3-4 times a week as well as walking a few times a week when I can get to the club or when weather permits.  If you're thinking of trying Winsor Pilates, please do.  It's easy on the body and effective.  It helped me get my pre-baby body back...I highly recommend it for new moms.",1078704000,,887,4.104651162790698
8619859,4,B00G047A44,"I started doing Winsor Pilates about 3 weeks ago.  After doing the Basic Steps tape a couple of times, I started the 20-Minute workout 3 times a week.  At first I didn't see any results but then I kicked in some proper eating habits and am now starting to see some results.  I do no cardio at the moment.  The workouts are fun and finish before you know it.  The 20-Minute Workout never feels like 20 minutes when you're done and the same for the 1-Hour workout.  You get so into doing them, watching your breathing and paying attention to your powerhouse that the time flys by.  Only little thing I've noticed is that I get a bit sore in my upper back between my shoulders blades and often feel that I should stretch before and after.  Otherwise I love it!!!",1046044800,,759,4.333333333333333
