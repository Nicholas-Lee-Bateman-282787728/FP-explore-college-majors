4657597,5,B005DCJ2TU,The PJ's: The 3rd and final season is just greatly excellent and funny. Eddie Murphy who created the TV Series did a excellent job as the voice-over of Thurgoode Stubbs who is cheif superentent of the Hilton Jacobs Projects. Get ready to laugh out loud and take a trip down to 1999-2001 as we like myself got funky with all of our favorite Characters. Cool TV Series that ended way to soon. Enjoy yall.,1317600000,4,402,4.445945945945946

 HOWEVER, call me anal but I find it to be a major inconvenience that they neglected to place the episodes from each season in the order that they originally aired like they do with every other show.
  Perhaps they didn't find it necessary for some reason but I really found it to be a very inconvenient choice for real fans like me.",1395619200,,534,4.165048543689321

4657705,5,B005DCJ2TU,"Greetings all! I'm taking just a wee bit of your time to review this product. I watched this when it was running on network television. It was funny then & funny now. It's taken a long time to get this for purchase. I actually have tried for years. The only difference from the tv show, is the end credits where there is no theme musice playing as the episodes go off. That's all. The discs are very crisp & clear. The whole series is what I purchases because it is a classic & very funny. It's part of Eddie Murphy's better layers. Some of his raturally ""raw"" comedic genius. At least to me any way. This series depicts the goings ons & goings ins of the ""hood"" or projects as it is. Though it boasts exaggerations of circumstances surrounding minorites & fiscal handicap, it speaks high octave volumes of what happens in governmental properties intended for the indigent. The lifestyle in this environment mimics the residents as an indigenous people. The pjs shows a laughable tolerance for the less fortunate.  It entertains & sheds light on the daily struggles of housing developments & the abundant neglect throughout the system. I would thoroughly recommend this product because it'll grab your attention & keep u laughing. Please don't hesitate to give it a try.",1348876800,2,1270,4.7207207207207205
