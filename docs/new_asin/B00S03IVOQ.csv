8696696,3,B00S03IVOQ,"The story was great. We need to see more positive stories like this.  The acting was off as some of the scenes were drawn out longer with unnecessary jokes, there were some audio issues. With more practice I believe we can a five star review but the fact they did it & No violence or drugs were involved is a big salute to the director & cast.",1503187200,,343,4.119402985074627

8696700,1,B00S03IVOQ,"Louis (William Anderson) gets fired from his job as ???? because he is losing money for the company. Now that he is unemployed women throw themselves at him. His girlfriend Selene (Shaquita Blanks) throws him out and he goes to LA where he takes acting lessons and gets his picture taken as a broody young man without a shirt but with a bongo drum. He comes back and now the film is about Brian (Jarrett Glover) and Trina (Tia Pratcher). He is cooking Sunday dinner using his grandma's stolen recipe claiming he can make a meal better than the store bought stuff they serve at a restaurant. Louis and Selene go from major characters to minor characters.

It seemed like they wanted to do two movies, but didn't have the money, so they they made one confusing film. The film was low budget. the sound wasn't good as the indoor sound had an echo. The acting was bad and the lessons didn't help. The dialogue was bad and what was that white face pantomime guy?

Guide: No nudity or F-bombs. Minor sex scene.",1426896000,,1004,4.48087431693989
