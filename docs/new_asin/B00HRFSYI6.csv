8634789,2,B00HRFSYI6,"I recently watched this movie called Getting That Girl and really loved it. The lead star was also Gia Mantegna. I liked her a lot in Getting That Girl, but not so much in California Scheming. I guess it wasn't that her acting ability was bad in California Scheming, it was probably just the story and dialogue she had to work with. I don't want know more what to say, I try to really see the film's intent but this was just too far off with things like the seagull mask.",1398470400,,471,4.186813186813187
8634790,3,B00HRFSYI6,"Chloe (Gia Mantegna) lives in a divided Malibu home. Dad is in NY with a new family. Mom lives in a world of wannabe stardom playing small roles, being an absentee mom, sleeping with producers. Chloe is indeed scheming, flirty, manipulative, uses everyone, has deep anger management issues, and appears to be psychotic. She destroys the lives of the people she touches. Her idols are Charles Manson and porn star Sasha Grey. She wants to be both...i.e. look for the similarities to make sense of the production.

New girl Hillary (Rachel Seiferth) is very vulnerable following the death of her mother. Jason (Spencer Daniels) and Nick (Rachel Seiferth) get to hang out with pretty girls so they tolerate Chloe's erratic behavior.

The film had potential, except it didn't go anywhere, except that end thing which wasn't well done. I imagine this film is a statement on the effect negative role models have on troubled individuals in society, yet it would have been nice to have been tad more entertaining.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, No nudity.  2 1/2 stars",1391212800,3,1065,4.932960893854749
8634791,2,B00HRFSYI6,"""California Scheming"" (2014 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Chloe Vandersteen (played by Gia Mantegna), a teenager in Malibu, and her equally bored friends. As the movie opens, Chloe find a wounded seagull on the beach. Two teenage guys, Jason and Nick, happen to walk by and they help Chloe to take care of the bird. The three of them strike up a quick friendship and are hanging out more and more. Later on, another girl, Hillary, who just moved there from Boston and is still grieving over her mom's death, befriends the three. Meanwhile we get to see Chloe starting to manipulate her friends. But is everything to be taken at face value? Or are we being set up by the script for a major plot twist? And why will the term 'creepy crawling' become a familiar one? At this point we are a good 30 minutes into the movie and to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: first, this is the directing debut of long-time producer Marco Weber. He also wrote and edited the movie. Second, the movie takes forever to get mildly interesting towards the last half four. There is literally nothing happening In the first hour that is of any interest, other than the vague character building, I suppose. Yet even there, we do not understand what makes Chloe tick, or why she does what she does. Third, I get it that this movie wants to be the next ""Cruel Intentions"" but I have to tell you that compared to this, ""Cruel Intentions"" is an instant classic and a standard bearer. Fourth, what is with this movie's poster (a naked Gia Mantegna)? Just so you know: there is no nudity in the film, none. I think it is a shameless attempt to lure the uninformed viewer into thinking this movie is something which it isn't. Fifth, the photography in the movie is eye-candy (all filmed on location in Malibu). Last but not least, there are some great indie and surf songs playing in the movie. I was eager to check out what those songs were, but imagine my surprise when in the end credits the songs are not even listed!

""California Scheming"" opened this weekend on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. I had a private showing at the matinee screening where I saw this at today, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. I cannot imagine that this movie will play more than 1 week in the theater. But eve if it did, I honestly cannot recommend this movie. ""California Scheming"" is wildly uneven, with no clear direction for most of the movie and a script that is frighteningly void of good ideas and content. VIEWER BEWARE!",1391212800,14,2563,4.521551724137931
