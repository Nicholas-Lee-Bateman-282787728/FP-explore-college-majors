8313579,1,B001JQTSFW,"College kids go on a road trip to a place they shouldn't have in this dire little mess of a film. Struggling to think of anything redeeming about this and other than the opening scene of topless sunbathing, I'm coming up with a blank. And that's being generous. Horrid robotic acting and a threadbare plot both could've been forgiven if the film were fun. It's not.",1516060800,,365,4.545454545454546

8313581,1,B001JQTSFW,Watch it if you dare but if you like a porno type movie with no sex combined with the MTV style of camera work you might like this one if you are dead drunk. Not even so bad it is good but just plain bad.,1343952000,,204,3.5555555555555554
8313582,1,B001JQTSFW,"this movie, like many other movies, has more ambition than talent behind it.  i have a feeling that this movie will be laughably enjoyable just as movies like _karate cop_, _parole violators_, _undefeatable_ & _the desert warrior_ are today... you can find the trailer to this movie & the others online... you'll see what i mean.

it's sort of like joking about some terrible tragedy too soon after it happened, give it time & you can see the humor in how horrible the movie is.",1249084800,,478,4.6117647058823525
8313583,3,B001JQTSFW,"Director Richard Perrin's, The Dead Don't Scream is an independently produced film that serves up a hefty helping of mayhem and gore, as a group of eight friends out for some fun at a lake during spring break, find themselves running for their lives in Grapevine, Texas.  The lake is an attraction for the affluent college aged crowd, and a source for an organized group that is interested in stealing luxury cars, and abducting the owners as well.  Victims are targeted, incapacitated with a stun rod, and hauled off.  Their vehicles are towed away to a chop shop.

The group of friends all become victims, and find themselves in a large room with a large group of young people, similarly dressed in swimwear.  The group doesn't stay in captivity long, and upon bursting loose, they find themselves in an industrial facility, with security personnel that have no qualms about shooting on sight, or slitting some throats.  It's a deadly game of run and hide for the victims, who are hunted by a staff that seems to regard slaughter as a routine part of the workday.  In back of it all, is a crotchety codger with a particular sense of humor named Uncle Buddy, the leader of a diversified family run business with a very hard and bloody bottom line.

This film kind of sweeps you along, in part because after a parade of characters, you don't quite know where to focus your attention.  You may still be disoriented, when the group is abruptly running for their lives, and total chaos breaks loose.  Not a lot makes sense, but it's really not meant to, the point is to see people getting massacred.  This may be a low budget feature, but the special effects are done rather well, with throat slitting, and shotgun blasts to the head and body being the highlights.

There are elements of humor, but they are mostly associated with weird assortment of characters involved in the business, and members of the local police force.  To Uncle Buddy and his employees, the victims are literally just meat for the slaughter.  Some of the victims do such dumb and unrealistic things, that it makes it hard to root for them.  The cast appears to be made up of newcomers (including members of director Perrin's family), and the lack of experience is evident.  The star of the movie is Taylor Chadwell as Callie, with Trey Caldwell as Tyler perhaps running second.  Charles Martin is Uncle Buddy, and Rick Allen Rhodes is the local sheriff.

Not to be taken too seriously, The Dead Don't Scream is a mixture of swimwear clad victims, violence, campy humor, carnage, subpar acting, and annoying dialog.  The editing of the final reveal is quite nicely done.  Low budget and unpolished it may be, but the sick twisted adventure does provide some shocks, thrills, and a few laughs.  Annoyingly, the DVD has no chapter stops!  There are a few bonus features, including a behind the scenes featurette, trailer, and music video.  The trailer is too long and reveals too much.  More like two and a half stars, but worth at least a rental, if massacres are of interest.",1244592000,,3046,4.703773584905661
8313584,1,B001JQTSFW,"I haven't seen the movie.  But, there are OBVIOUSLY phoney reviews here.  It is ashame people do that.",1244073600,,102,4.611111111111111
8313585,1,B001JQTSFW,"I have seen this movie and it's pretty terrible. In fact, it's not even worth putting a lot of effort into commenting on besides the fact the reviews on here are so obviously fake. I'm guessing they are either people involved in making the film or people the producer told to go ""pump up the hype"" on the web. It's this kind of behavior that really hurts indie film makers because they are intentionally setting traps for unsuspecting moviegoers and it makes people give up on buying films they've never heard of. Shameful, absolutely shameful. Perhaps someone will post an honest review because there really isn't much to say about this one. It's ultra low budget, shot on video with little redeeming qualities.",1234828800,,712,4.796747967479675

8313587,5,B001JQTSFW,"Not only am I glad I purchased this film, but I gave several copies to families and friends.  It has none of the stereotypes and cliches in the average horror movie.  Plots and subplots abound with several surprises.  I would highly recommend The Dead Don't Scream to all that want a good horror flick without being disappointed.  The music is first rate and adds to the excitement of the scenes.  The acting, writing, and directing is very impressive.  The Dead Don't Scream is destined to become a horror classic.",1232236800,,515,4.730337078651686
8313588,5,B001JQTSFW,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Everything you expect from a bloody horror film, but with the added bonus of humor and great filming.  It's twice as much fun to watch with a group of friends.",1231113600,,189,4.371428571428571
