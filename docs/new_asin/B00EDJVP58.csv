8678643,4,B00EDJVP58,"At the beginning of Jan Nemec's career in the 1960s in Czechoslovakia, he established a term called ""pure film"", he strived to find his own language for film. In his films he uses little to no dialogue, music, as well as flashes of photographs, and periods of no visuals. As a result of these techniques, he placed an intense emphasis on the interaction between physical sensation and mental states in all of his films. This technique is showcased in Code Name: Ruby. It is not what most would call a traditional film with a distinct beginning, middle, and end; this film takes concentration and imagination.

As a very thought evoking film, Code Name: Ruby encourages the viewer to think about and realize how important the past is and how it always affects one's responsibility and freedom. Nemec displays this revelation through the various clips of historic footage that are flashed throughout the narrative. It is an interesting film to watch to get a taste of not only Jan Nemec films, but also of films of the Czech Republic.",1376956800,2,1032,4.797752808988764
