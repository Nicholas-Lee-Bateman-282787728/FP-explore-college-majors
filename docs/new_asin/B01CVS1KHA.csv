This is a fantastic series that barely dives into a light novel series called Hakushaku to Yousei which is 33 novels in total. The anime series itself covers 3 of the novels from the series, 4 for Volume 1, 3 for the next, and the final is 4 episodes. Its an enchanting adventurous tale set in Victorian England. It dives into some of the mythos of Fairy lore from England which makes the series a lot of fun. The biggest highlight for me in this series Lydia and Edgars relationship which is the focal point of the series and has gradually developed over time. The anime barely gets into this (seeing how it only covers 3 of the novels.) however it handles the limited time well and allows the viewer to enjoy watching their relationship grow. The characters themselves engaging and enjoyable, Lydia is an intelligent young woman with a big heart and a refreshing if somewhat naive perspective on life she is matched with Edgar who has a flirty personality that actually hides a deeper hidden self and more mature perspective life. Together they really contrast well.  This anime covers some of the best moments from their first encounter and beyond. Its a well done series despite only being 12 episodes. I really enjoyed watching it.

Regarding the product itself, the quality of the transfer to digital is perfect. It looks so clear and bright never have I seen this series so well presented on DVD. The digital transfer captures the scenes all really well. And the audio sounds great.

On another note Id like to let everyone know that unlike another reviewer I had no problems with the first and second disk they played all the episodes perfectly.

For any english speaker that cant entirely understand japanese theres really fantastic subs. Ones in the past Ive seen pale in comparison. They make sure to sub everything even the background conversation. You can tell they put a lot of effort into it. With these really well done subs its not hard to understand all thats going on.

Sadly there is no English dub Ive always wished they did one but this is an older series so its pretty late to see that done since the series came out 2008. Maybe one day, regardless I really love all the japanese voice actors in this series they do a fantastic job particularly Lydia and Edgar especially.

As for bonus features there isn't much. They did include the clean version of the opening and closings without any text. Those are really nice in themselves. I didn't expect much in bonus features since this is a Japanese anime and it was merely subbed in English. Not to mention the show is from 2008 so its not too much of a surprise its lacking in bonus features. Regardless I purchased this for the episodes themselves so it doesnt really bother me it's still a great set.

I encourage any one who loves Victorian, fantasy, adventure or just a good sweet romance to watch this. Its a really lovely series.",1531526400,,3046,4.617375231053605

8754297,2,B01CVS1KHA,"It's a very good series I really loved it, but disk 1 would not play episodes 3-4. I got a replacement and it has the exact same defect, so it is a copying/manufacturing error. Also there is a very limited DVD menu it is bare-bones; you can select English subtitles yes or no and play the episodes and that is it. You can't even jump to s particular scene from the menu. I'm hoping there will be some corrected re-prints soon!",1465948800,11,426,4.271604938271605
