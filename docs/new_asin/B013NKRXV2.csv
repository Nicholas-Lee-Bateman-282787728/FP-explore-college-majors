1. The workouts are fantastic. Its a great blend of strength and cardio!
2. The nutrition guide includes 2 different meal plans. 1 is with meat and 1 is a VEGAN MEAL PLAN :)
Highly recommend this to anyone!",1492732800,3,241,4.148936170212766
8728231,5,B013NKRXV2,"I have now gone through all the workouts and can say the supersets are awesome. I would say this is not for beginners, she does not provide a lot of instructions, so you pretty much have to know what you are doing.. but with that being said, I was bored with my current weight supersets and needed ideas, and this was perfect.. after 3 weeks I definitely saw some changes. I am not following the diet, so I can't speak for that.
My only suggestion for future versions would be to get the rep counts right, adding an ab segment, and something for calves.",1487808000,2,553,4.326923076923077
8728232,2,B013NKRXV2,"Ingrid talks way too much during the work out. There is a clock countdown on each workout on the bottom of the screen anf about three minutes of that is spent watching her drink water and resting as opposed to actually working-out.
I started week 3 today. I follow the workouts and food plan and the first week I lost 2lbs so I was very motivated going into week 2, but today I realized that I gained 5lbs. How is that possible if I'm supposed to be toning up???
I have had 3 bowel movements in 2 weeks because this food plan makes me constipated. I have no idea how anyone can succeed with this plan. It's sad that it cost so much money and I gained weight. Silver lining: some of the receipes are good. But you'll get tired of eating brocolli, chicken, and sweet potatoes EVERY single day.",1480291200,,791,4.28
