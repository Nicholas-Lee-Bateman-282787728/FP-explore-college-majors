973591,1,6305150729,"When I found this movie, I was excited.  I've been a serious fan of Poul Anderson's work since I started reading.  ""The High Crusade"" has always been one of my favorite books by Anderson and I have long thought  that it would make an excellent movie.  I still think it would make an  excellent movie.  Unfortunately, this is not it.
I was completely  surprised by the direction taken by the screen play and direction of this  movie.  Or maybe shocked would be a better word.  It had simply never  occurred to me that Anderson's book would be interpreted as a comedy.  Certainly, there is humor in the novel, but it is basically a story of high  adventure with some very serious elements balancing the humor.  There is  none of that in the movie.  Brown (the screen writer) and Knoesel &  Neuhauser (the directors) extracted elements from the book and used them as  a skeleton on which to build a second rate ""Monty Python and the Holy  Grail.""
This movie was almost painful for me to watch because I  could see enough of the novel on the screen to know that a good movie could  have been made from ""The High Crusade.""  The SFX, though a little  cheezy by current standards, are still acceptable.  The cast was adequate,  though some of the parts would have been cast differently if this were not  a comedy, I'm sure.  Certainly, John Rys-Davies makes an excellent Brother  Parvis and he is one of the few redeeming factors of this film.  And the  few scenes taken from the novel were almost watchable.  But the overall  tone and direction were not even remotely true to the novel.  Frankly, even  fans of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" will be disappointed  because it's just not that funny.
If you have never read the book, then  you may find this movie mildly amusing.  If you are a fan of this classic  science fiction novel, then I recommend steering clear of this movie.  It  will taint your good memories of the book forever.",915753600,5,1934,4.524781341107872
973661,2,6305150729,"I was disappointed that this was not an adaption of the very funny Poul Anderson book. Other that a credit to him and the fact that the story involves knights and aliens, there is scant relationship between the book and the movie.
This movie is more akin to Benny Hill than Monty Python. Very low brow and broad.
That said, the movie was mildly amusing. Not worth buying unless you find it in a cut-out bin.",1041811200,5,407,4.368421052631579
973662,1,6305150729,"I gave it a try because I loved the book and because one of the actors was in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films.  My gosh!  What trash.  Not funny.  Terrible acting.  Terrible screenplay.  Obviously, a fair amount of energy was put into the sets, but the special effects were comparable to Plan 9.  Don't do it.  No matter how much you loved the book, I warn you, you will regret the experience.",1033689600,3,401,4.324324324324325
973663,4,6305150729,"I just bought this DVD a few weeks ago, the price was right and I quite liked the novella. I agree with the others, its not like the book, but quite frankly, the book wasn't this funny. Its British camp humour, with a lot of stock character actors turning up in strange places, and the narration is excellent.
If you wanted this to be the movie of the book, don't watch it. If you just want an unpretentious laugh, with some clever dialoge, see it.",1031097600,6,448,4.2823529411764705
973664,1,6305150729,"Sorry, but this is a dismal movie. It starts badly when the credit blurb on the packaging says Paul, not Poul Anderson. Not only is it completely unlike the book but the attempted humour almost entirely misses the mark. The human characters are portrayed as complete imbeciles and the aliens are not much better. I accept that compromises have to be made when adapting novels to screen, but why bother with the license in the first place if you are simply going to use the title and ignore the plot?",999734400,8,499,4.555555555555555
973665,5,6305150729,i thought this movie was very funny if you didn't you need to loosen up and stop being such a hardass.  let it out have fun and laugh.  by the way about thoose book people.  get over it its a movie not a book forget everything you read.,988761600,,236,3.875
973666,2,6305150729,"THE OLDER I GET, THE MORE I DREAD THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS BEING TURNED INTO A MOVIE. ""RAISE THE TITANIC"" WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OR ANYTHING WITH THE NAME ""TARZAN"" ON IT. OH, I KNOW, NO DIRECTOR CAN EVER MAKE, NO ACTOR CAN EVER PORTRAY, OUR LITERARY HEROES THE WAY WE IMAGINE THEM, BUT COME ON, NOW! THIS IS THE STORY OF A HUGE SUPER-TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY WHO COMPLETELY UNDERESTIMATES A PRIMITIVE, BACKWATER SOCIETY AND GETS THEIR BUTTS KICKED IN THE PROCESS. IMPOSSIBLE? ASK THE VIETNAMESE. THEY DID IT TO US IN ALMOST THE SAME WAY. ANYHOW, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GREAT MOVIE WITH A MODEST BUDGET AND NO MORE SPECIAL EFFECTS THAN IT HAS. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF IT?PLEASE..PLEASE..PLEASE KEEP THESE BUTCHERS AWAY FROM ""A PRINCESS OF MARS"". LEAVE SOME THINGS SACRED!",983491200,4,811,4.638888888888889
973667,3,6305150729,"Before 'Independence Day' and before 'Godzilla' the Emerich brothers produced 'High Crusade'.  Sort of 'Spaced Invaders' meets 'Holy Grail'.  It's fun, it shows what talented people can do with a good cast and limited  funds, and it's proof that the Emerich brothers don't have quite the touch  for deadpan comedy that The Pythons do.  Then again, who does?  It has a  high giggle factor, and that's the main point.
No, the special effects do  not rival 'Phantom Menace', but they're entirely adequate for this film.  (Quite good, actually.)  No, the acting isn't Oscar quality, but it plays  just fine here.  (John Rhys Davis has done more serious parts, but he does  very nicely as Brother Parvis.)  The cinematography isn't as dynamic as  'Matrix' but it's excellent in its own right.  Buy 'High Crusade' for what  it is - a fun film to while away an hour and a half.
My copy goes on my  'view it again, Phred' shelf near 'Spaced Invaders' and across from  'Godzilla' for those times when I need a laugh.  If you like silly comedy,  try this incarnation of 'High Crusade'.  If you want a dead serious  treatment of this wonderful Poul Anderson novel, start writing letters to  George Lucas.",962236800,4,1193,4.735294117647059
973668,1,6305150729,"I had high hopes for this movie when I first learnt that someone was going to make a film version of Poul Anderson's classic novel, but somewhere along the way the producers decided to make this as a comedy movie instead  of a straight action adventure story. Stupid beyond belief, the powers that  be missed the chance to turn a great action story into a great action  movie. Dumb. What should have been a stirring space epic with bold knights  in armour, treachery and villainous aliens becomes a tedious - and  cringingly bad at times - waste of time. One day, perhaps, someone will  have the guts to make a proper film version of Anderson's great book.",952819200,11,656,4.564102564102564
973669,3,6305150729,"This is a cute little movie if you like anglophilic SiFi movies. To combine a subject like the crusades with an alien invasion theme is quite unique and leads to some interesting happenings. While the acting will  never win awards and the plot is somewhat simple, it is the little things  in this movie that can warm you to it.  For instance, where else can you  see proof of the English long bow's superiority over common blasters or  watch the extreme frustration of a captured small alien trying to explain  to these English medievels that the Earth travels round the sun and not the  other way around, or the comical heath problems of the alien base  commander. Well, its not perfect but you can always chuckle your way back  to Star Trek or Star Wars if you need to.  By the way, when is Amazon going  to put spell check on these things!",944611200,3,842,4.437908496732026

7884039,1,6305150729,"I am very forgiving of bad movies...so if I say it's unusually bad, you can take that rating to the bank. The movie is one big horrendously bad attempt at Monty Python routines, and I really like Monty Python...I own 4 of their Flying Circus albums. Hey I've watched Disney's Three Musketeers, and Starship Troopers after having read the books, and while being disappointed in their adaptions, I can at least say, they were entertaining and recommend them as fun movies to others. Spending any money on this movie is a waste of time.",1442188800,,533,4.680851063829787

7884041,3,6305150729,"It's not a bad movie. It's not a good movie either. It's in between. It's a little bit fun at times, somewhere atmosphere appears to be right. The movie is silly, but it's not stupid. Actors were all right. Special effects were okay. I did not hate it, nor enjoyed it. it's in between. It's okay to watch.",1395705600,,305,4.275862068965517
7884042,2,6305150729,"Poor Johnathon Rhys Davies must have been hard up to sign on the dotted line for this old tosh.

First up the premise is supposedly from a Poul Anderson film however from other reviewers it seems that vastly more than the normal liberties have been taken in converting a book to a film. We all know compromises need to be made in the format transfer and middle aged fanboys like nothing more than to whine about it. But it would seem that rather than a straight adventure story the makers went for a comedy angle. Now there is nothing wrong with that - if it was funny.

And that is the crux of the matter. The attempts at humour here are so desultory. There is little cleverness and while there are some attempts at physical slapstick it mostly falls flat. There are times when little things going on do provide the glimmer of a smirk - the executioners torturing each other to pass the time is one such point and the chastity belt schtick is another. But the main problem is that in the vast majority of cases the movie just fails utterly to 'bring the funny'.

Some of the actors try to inject some energy into their performance but with this script and the idiom of the movie in general they can't achieve much and to tell the truth you don't even get the sense that they were enjoying making the film in any way. Overall this is a spectacularly unfunny film that screams of poverty, a film that quite blatantly didn't need to be made and of (for the most part) phoned in efforts all round.",1359676800,,1494,4.366906474820144
7884043,3,6305150729,"This film has a good premise and excellent material to work from, but does not avail itself of it. This is a passable movie that could have been great if it had followed the novel more closely. If you are under 15, see the film...if you are older, read the book. It is an excellent work to  read.",1264291200,6,296,4.103448275862069
7884044,1,6305150729,"This was supposed to be a comedy. I think. It`s really hard to tell. It just comes across as being stupid as a modern tv sitcom and
that`s pretty bad.
The original book was nothing to really brag about, but it was far better than this mess. I`m surprised the auther of the orignal
story has not tracked down the people who made this movie and beaten them senseless with a stick. Or maybe he did beat them senseless
just before them filmed this movie.
Save your money, watch something more entertaining, like the grass grow, or the cat sleeping.",1257638400,,544,4.45
7884045,4,6305150729,"I can see that the typical reviewer isn't impressed with the film... That's a pity. I suspect most of the reviewers are not British, and thus aren't ""getting"" the gist of the humour in the film.

Let me say first of all that OF COURSE this film is not high art. It's comedy - and very British at that. Sometimes it's plain silly, but very FUNNY plain silly.

I found the film amusing. There were many moments that had me laughting in that typically ""Oh dear, I shouldn't be laughing"" fashion that any Monty Python fan ends up perfecting. For example, the bit with the horse... the alien's arguments with the priest... the chastity belt... the wedding night... and the orgasmic finger.

If you can simply watch this film on its own merits, and if you enjoy Pythonesque humour, I can't see why you won't find the film providing you with plenty of laughter.

NOTE: I don't see any problem with the dubbing. The version I have is Zone 4, Australian, and of course we tend to get British rather than American versions here. Perhaps that makes a difference.",1132444800,5,1051,4.544973544973545
7884046,1,6305150729,"I've got a dubbed version of this on video quite a few year when it was on T.V. which is absolutely excellent, I live in England and can't get The High Crusade on DVD over here. So I got the U.S. version, all I can say is it's terrible. In the british version, all the aliens were dubbed with hilarious English accents and didn't sound like dodgy Jawa's out of Star Wars.
All I've got to say is, watch the English dubbed version if you get the chance. It's a completely different movie...",1083283200,3,488,4.258064516129032
7884047,1,6305150729,"My father bought this movie thinking it was a historical account of the crusades. Maybe he didn't read the back or see the spaceship flying across the cover. In any case, he cursed me for not notifing him of the film's contents. My father somehow managed to sit through this movie, then disowned it. I have tried several times to sit down and watch this movie to the end with no avail. It's not funny, or scary, nor does it accomplish anything I'm sure the director was trying to accomplish. A funny movie is ""Rikki-Oh,"" ""High Crusade"" is definately not worth your time. Instead try poking small needles under your fingernails. This is a more gratifying experience than the ""High Crusade."" From a historical background, the ""High Crusade"" fails on several levels. First I don't think there was an alien invasion during the crusades. Second, well...I guess only the invation thing is wrong, but trust me it's wrong on so many different levels. The French guy is not funny either. He tries to get with the main character's wife and then I don't know what happens because I usually shut of my dvd player. I have passed along this movie to my friends and family with hilarious results. They watch the movie, the entire movie, hoping it has some redeeming value, but of course, it doesn't. Then they bring me back the DVD and curse me for wasting 90 minutes of their lives. Well, watch at your own risk, and mind your pints and quarts.",1058140800,3,1430,4.6117647058823525
