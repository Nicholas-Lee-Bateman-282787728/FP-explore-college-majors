8137776,5,B000H9MR5U,"I used this video when teaching English classes in high school.  The reason I chose it was that the existing movies were usually generalizations without any research, and, more importantly, they eliminated the complexity of the factors which resulted in the gunfight at the OK Corral.  As a result those movies were created as entertainment; they appealed not only to the Western Mythology that exists to this day but also to the human need for justice because the world for many is either right or wrong, good or bad as are the individuals depicted in those movies.

Currently, there are a number of books written on the same subject.  The one that satisfies my criteria is Jeff Guinn's ""The Last Gunfight.  Mr. Guinn does not simplify; he examines a myriad of factors and how they influenced the event. There were no heroes, only a number of people who were caught in the time, the environment, and their own emotions, goals, and perceptions of the world.  Most acted in their own interests, and, as a result, they all had a direct influence on that event.

""Shoot-out at the OK Corral"" was an excellent film to explain the difference between a fictionalized account of an historical incident and a film which described the events while reflecting as much actual research about the various factors which came into play.

If this film becomes available, I certainly recommend it; I also recommend Guinn's book.",1368748800,,1411,4.85
8137777,1,B000H9MR5U,"I'm so tired of the B.S. Rooseveltist version of Pearl Harbor. If Kimmel had his way, the fleet would have been at sea. If his predecessor had his way, the fleet would have been on the West Coast. Kimmel was denied the long-range reconnaissance aircraft he needed to find the Japanese fleet. He knew where the Japanese would attack from; he tried to hold a fleet exercise at that exact spot, but was called back by Washington. Washington sent the carriers to sea along with the newest fleet ships. If Washington hadn't sent out such a B.S. war warning, the planes wouldn't have been stacked together like cord wood, and the state of readiness would have been much higher. If Washington hadn't declared the North Pacific an open sea, the Japanese fleet wouldn't have been able to sneak in unnoticed. I can go on and on with other points which clearly show that Pearl Harbor was set up so Roosevelt could have his dramatic cause for dragging the U.S. into war. The Battleships destroyed were pretty much useless relics of a past age, but the sacrifice of all those men is unforgivable.",1358726400,,1083,4.645833333333333
8137778,1,B000H9MR5U,"THIS VIDEO ACTUALLY SUCKS.......ITS WORTH .50 cents.  Even though the art on ninjitsu is a true art that works, this video really has nothing to do with ninjitsu. It shows very little about ninjas.",1329436800,,197,4.794117647058823
8137779,4,B000H9MR5U,"This year I showed this DVD after my students watched Witch Hunt. What makes Unsolved History different is its modern take on what happened in Salem. For example, the way a person was hanged was discussed. The hanged ""witches"" were swung instead of allowing them to just drop. By swinging these people, the government gave them a slower and crueler death. They died by suffocation, whereas someone who just drops dies by a broken neck. A coroner showed the x-rays of two people who had been hanged--one had a broken neck and the other didn't. Another example was Giles Corey being pressed to death. Unsolved History brought out a dead pig that was the size of Corey. They then started putting a bunch of weight on th75 e pig, but the pig's ribcage did't break; it only flattened out. Then a stuntman tried to see how much weight he could take and he stopped at about 175--he was starting to have breathing problems. All of this was to speculate whether Giles Corey died from suffocation or was crushed to death. It's likely he suffocated. My students tended to think this was a very good DVD and I believe it was a good companion DVD to Witch Hunt.",1290211200,,1148,4.550724637681159
8137780,4,B000H9MR5U,"There are a few documentaries and docu-dramas that deal with the Salem Witch Trials, and ""Unsolved History: Salem Witch Trials"" is one of the better productions on the topic. The Salem Witch Trails are reconstructed using a variety of tools - examination of archaelogical and forensic evidence, photographs, artifacts of the period, and interviews with selected people based on their expertise on the subject.

Unsolved History basically attempts to not only reconstruct the events of those dark times, but also to posit plausible theories as to why such an event occurred, from tracing anti-witch movements in the 17th century to scientific evidence that mass psychosis could possibly be triggered by a certain mold in the bread consumed at that time, or even encephalitis [a condition where the brain suffers inflammation that may trigger fever,convulsions, and hallucinations]. There are many other theories that are considered - such as the very real social repression at the time which caused undue stress upon the Puritans, and also the most basic of motivations - greed [for another's land, property], and of perceived slights and insults.

There is also coverage on the methods used to extract confessions from the accused witches. All in all, this production will appeal to those who have an interest in the subject and teachers may find it useful in either English or History classes.",1223424000,4,1394,5.21875
8137781,2,B000H9MR5U,"A lot of boys and men love ninjas, so this is a surface-y discussion they might enjoy.
Still, they stopped speaking about real ninjas one-third or one-half way into the work.  They then move on to the question, ""Are SWAT team members the new ninjas?""  Equating the present to the past help viewers who may get bored.  A teacher once asked in a psychology class, ""Are psychologists modern-day shamans?""  There's a popular book equating businessmen of today (purposely gendered) to samurai.  Still, this is a cop out in that we have much SWAT footage and little visual imagery of samurai, so of course the makers take the path of least resistance.
This work is very Western.  Japanese actors may have been used for the cheesy reenactments, but all the interviewees are Western.
This work is just scant.  There's no two ways about it.",1217635200,9,831,4.769230769230769
8137782,3,B000H9MR5U,"If you know the facts behind the fall of the Aztec Empire, than this may be nothing new.  Still, I would say this offers a fresh perspective.  Instead of just speaking to historians, this work includes physicians, archers, computer geeks, and others asking if the Aztecs really could have sacrificed 20,000 in a few days.  The results are surprising.

I don't care for cheesy reenactments and this work has them here.  The narrator says, ""Thousands were in this battle,"" but the viewer just sees 10 guys fighting.  It says sacrifices and fighting were bloody, but there's no gore here.  One Aztec had a hairy chest and indigenous men on this side of the globe were known for being smooth until miscegenation occurred.  This work mitigates the cheesiness with CGI images.  The Spanish destroyed so many Aztec edifices centuries ago, but they are recreated here in an eye-catching way.

There's something I just don't get.  This work and many others say the heart of the Aztec Empire was built ON a lake and then Mexico City was built upon that.  Is Mexico City like Venice in Italy?  How could people hundreds of years ago build huge pyramids ON a lake, rather than NEAR a lake?  The work says Mexico City has 20 million residents.  How could people survive ON a lake?  Was the lake drained?  I just don't understand!",1203724800,,1316,4.701754385964913
