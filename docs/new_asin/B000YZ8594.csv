3036744,5,B000YZ8594,I think this is my favorite season of the Mighty Boosh series and I hope that there will be a 4th season soon! A true Boosh fan just can't get enough Boosh!,1254787200,,156,3.90625
3036745,3,B000YZ8594,"Cruelty and perviness have always been a big part of the Boosh, and part of the success of the first two series lay in their inspired pushing of boundaries. These familiar elements return in the 3rd series, but the treatment this time is disappointingly heavy-handed and commonplace, and the laughs are fewer and further between. What's largely missing here is the unhurried whimsy of earlier episodes like ""Jungle"", ""Hitcher"" and ""Milky Joe"" - it resurfaces in a single episode (""The Strange Tale of the Crack Fox"", featuring one of Fielding's charming cartoon-dreams), but for the most part this 3rd series is hard to watch",1254528000,3,625,5.019230769230769

This is when we started following them and why we first watched the series. We immediately fell in love.  In season 2, they moved to a flat with Naboo (a Shaman) and Bollo (Naboo's Gorilla apprentice.)  And finally in season 3 Vince and Howard are working for Naboo at the Nabootique.

In this 3rd series the guys cant seem to stand each other.  Most of the jokes are repeats or running gags that have been worn out.

3036796,5,B000YZ8594,"Yes, sadly, this is the FINAL season of the Boosh. That surreal British comedy import that Americans love so much. If you haven't seen the show before, I suggest tuning into Cartoon Network's 'Adult Swim' program and trying to catch it there if you're trepidacious about the product (or check YouTube). I personally think it's genius! I must say I'm a big Monty Python and Young Ones fan, so if those are your cup of tea (pardon the pun), BOOSH is for you! Another touchstone might be Flight Of The Conchords, since The Boosh use several musical bits in each show (which are likely to wedge in your unconscious like a golden splinter). The third season has some of the best episodes (IMHO), though that's a mighty hard call. This season takes place in a second hand shop called the Nabootique, where their encounter with the urban Crack Fox (yes, that kind of crack and that kind of fox) is deliriously absurd! Another meeting with The Hitcher (a Cockney psychopath) goes as far into nightmare territory as you're likely to willingly follow The BOOSH, and the Spirit Of Jazz manifests through Vince in the most hilarious way (he's allergic to Jazz y'know) and may surpass The Hitcher for most terrifying character. My top personal top episodes are: Tundra & Ape Of Death (from Season One), The New Sound & Old Gregg (from Season Two), Crack Fox & Spirit Of Jazz (from Season Three). If you have the other seasons, it's a no-brainer to finish the meal with number three. If you own none, I'd suggest picking them up in order, as this world makes a bit more sense when viewed chronologically; at least giving you SOME kind of footing to gauge the antics from. And by the way...I'm nominating this show for most satisfying final episode on TV, as they opted for a feelgood vibe that will have these characters forever bouncing through the universe of your mind in the most pleasant way. Screw the final shock episodes of the 90s...this is how you do it.",1288742400,2,1950,4.638728323699422

3036798,4,B000YZ8594,"Goodbye, Zooniverse. Farewell, life as a band. Hello, Nabootique and life of telekinetic foxes, celebrity-radar and jazz cells.

As expected, the third and final season of ""The Mighty Boosh"" is another head-imploding trip into the world of foppish fashion-obsessed Vince Noir and his sensible jazzy pal Howard Moon. The writers seem to have been running a little dry on the visual bizarrities and surreal plot twists, but it's still blindingly funny and freakish from start to finish.

Howard (Julian Barratt) and Vince (Noel Fielding) are now living the Nabootique, a weird little shop owned by Naboo the mystic and the talking ape Bollo.

While Vince is out, Howard is attacked by the Hitcher, who threatens to kill him with ""eels"" if he doesn't hand over 1,000. His only hope: pretending to prostitute himself to a transvestite, assuming Vince doesn't get distracted. And Vince's punk phase has horrific effects when he bites into a priceless jazz record, and is infected by Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson's jazzy blood -- forcing Howard and a blind jazz expert to pull a ""Fantastic Voyage"" into Vince's body.

Then Vince becomes badly depressed when a copycat starts copying everything about his -- his hair, his clothes, his music, his best buddy, and even the name the Flighty Zeus. Their only hope: crimping! And garbage day becomes unusually dangerous when a malevolent Crack Fox tricks Vince into letting him into the shop, and steals the superpowerful Shaman Juice! Now Howard and Vince must get it back before Naboo is executed.

And on Howard's birthday, Vince manages to convince him to have a birthday party -- only for it to turn into a stew of infidelity, murder, glam clothes, homosexuality, and Spin The Bottle. Finally, Vince has a chance at being the lead singer of a emo-ish postpunk band... if he can stuff his legs into teeny tiny drainpipe pants. And, er, Howard is determined to see an art director.

""The Mighty Boosh"" is your basic average sitcom... on enough acid to fry its colorful little brains and send it flying across the universe on Naboo's magic carpet. This is a universe where the moon regularly says weird and nonsensical things, an extraterrestrial shaman and a talking gorilla drift in and out, and evil Jazz Cells turn out to be even invasively deadly than AIDS.

A couple of the episodes (""Party"" and ""Power of the Crimp"") are a little low on the freaky meter, but the overall season is still swathed in whimsical, filthy weirdness. Lots of strange dialogue (""I don't need him. I've already got a shallow mate who dresses like a... futuristic prostitute""!), toilet humor (naturally), bizarre life-forms (what is that grinning pink tentacled THING?), weird outfits for Vince, and a casual acceptance that anything can and will happen.

Barratt and Fielding are also quite awesome as a sort of surreal Odd Couple -- Barratt is great as a sort of lame-duck aspiring Artiste unaware of his intense uncoolness, while Fielding is deliciously over-the-top as a foppish, androgynous sort who changes his personal style every time it suits him. (Also a bunch of minor roles as Vince cells, the moon, and a pair of shamans). And Michael Fielding remains awesome as the wizard alien Naboo.

""The Mighty Boosh Season 3"" lags a little on the surreality in places, but it's still a brilliant, stunningly freaky little TV show. It's scuffproof, weatherproof, even bulletproof!",1265587200,,3397,4.987632508833922
3036799,4,B000YZ8594,"I love the Mighty Boosh! But the 3rd season was a let-down.  In interviews, Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt said they decided to take the characters Vince and Howard to their extremes, but this was a mistake, because they have lost most of their charm and their spirit of camaraderie. Vince is ready to throw Howard over at any opportunity; they seem to be sick of each other. Production-wise, there's a sense of things being rushed and sloppy.  For example, the recurring villain the Hitcher reappears, but they didn't bother with his prosthetic nose and chin this time, and just slathered on the green make-up.  I actually thought the joke would end up being that it was Vince pretending to be the Hitcher!  Also, the episode the ""The Power of the Crimp"" gets a little meta, with Vince and Howard in a tizzy over imitators who are referred to as ""The Flighty Zeus"" - a probable poke at The Flight of the Conchords, who took the sitcom w/ pop music idea and ran with it.  And with only 6 episodes, you have to wonder if they were struggling with a bit of creative drought.
BUT: the ""worst"" of the Boosh is still better than 99% of available entertainment!!!!
So - the verdict is - if you're not familiar with the Boosh, watch season 1 & 2 first, then this one.  If you start with Season 3, you'll be scratching your head as to what all the fuss is about.",1264291200,7,1356,4.42570281124498
3036800,2,B000YZ8594,"First off I have to say that I LOVED the first two seasons. This show is creative and bizarre while still being charming.
I have never seen the likes of it before.

Unfortunately season three took a major slide. Gone is much the creativity and all of the charm. Now it seems to shoot for a younger demographic with cheaper gags and much more of a mean spirited feel. Sure there are some good things in there but it just isn't worth sitting through most of the episodes for what they offer up. I guess I can't complain that there are only six episodes. More of the same would have made it that much worse.

3271293,5,B000YZ8594,"Yes, sadly, this is the FINAL season of the Boosh. That surreal British comedy import that Americans love so much. If you haven't seen the show before, I suggest tuning into Cartoon Network's 'Adult Swim' program and trying to catch it there if you're trepidacious about the product (or check YouTube). I personally think it's genius! I must say I'm a big Monty Python and Young Ones fan, so if those are your cup of tea (pardon the pun), BOOSH is for you! Another touchstone might be Flight Of The Conchords, since The Boosh use several musical bits in each show (which are likely to wedge in your unconscious like a golden splinter). The third season has some of the best episodes (IMHO), though that's a mighty hard call. This season takes place in a second hand shop called the Nabootique, where their encounter with the urban Crack Fox (yes, that kind of crack and that kind of fox) is deliriously absurd! Another meeting with The Hitcher (a Cockney psychopath) goes as far into nightmare territory as you're likely to willingly follow The BOOSH, and the Spirit Of Jazz manifests through Vince in the most hilarious way (he's allergic to Jazz y'know) and may surpass The Hitcher for most terrifying character. My top personal top episodes are: Tundra & Ape Of Death (from Season One), The New Sound & Old Gregg (from Season Two), Crack Fox & Spirit Of Jazz (from Season Three). If you have the other seasons, it's a no-brainer to finish the meal with number three. If you own none, I'd suggest picking them up in order, as this world makes a bit more sense when viewed chronologically; at least giving you SOME kind of footing to gauge the antics from. And by the way...I'm nominating this show for most satisfying final episode on TV, as they opted for a feelgood vibe that will have these characters forever bouncing through the universe of your mind in the most pleasant way. Screw the final shock episodes of the 90s...this is how you do it.",1288742400,2,1950,4.638728323699422

3271295,4,B000YZ8594,"Goodbye, Zooniverse. Farewell, life as a band. Hello, Nabootique and life of telekinetic foxes, celebrity-radar and jazz cells.

As expected, the third and final season of ""The Mighty Boosh"" is another head-imploding trip into the world of foppish fashion-obsessed Vince Noir and his sensible jazzy pal Howard Moon. The writers seem to have been running a little dry on the visual bizarrities and surreal plot twists, but it's still blindingly funny and freakish from start to finish.

Howard (Julian Barratt) and Vince (Noel Fielding) are now living the Nabootique, a weird little shop owned by Naboo the mystic and the talking ape Bollo.

While Vince is out, Howard is attacked by the Hitcher, who threatens to kill him with ""eels"" if he doesn't hand over 1,000. His only hope: pretending to prostitute himself to a transvestite, assuming Vince doesn't get distracted. And Vince's punk phase has horrific effects when he bites into a priceless jazz record, and is infected by Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson's jazzy blood -- forcing Howard and a blind jazz expert to pull a ""Fantastic Voyage"" into Vince's body.

Then Vince becomes badly depressed when a copycat starts copying everything about his -- his hair, his clothes, his music, his best buddy, and even the name the Flighty Zeus. Their only hope: crimping! And garbage day becomes unusually dangerous when a malevolent Crack Fox tricks Vince into letting him into the shop, and steals the superpowerful Shaman Juice! Now Howard and Vince must get it back before Naboo is executed.

And on Howard's birthday, Vince manages to convince him to have a birthday party -- only for it to turn into a stew of infidelity, murder, glam clothes, homosexuality, and Spin The Bottle. Finally, Vince has a chance at being the lead singer of a emo-ish postpunk band... if he can stuff his legs into teeny tiny drainpipe pants. And, er, Howard is determined to see an art director.

""The Mighty Boosh"" is your basic average sitcom... on enough acid to fry its colorful little brains and send it flying across the universe on Naboo's magic carpet. This is a universe where the moon regularly says weird and nonsensical things, an extraterrestrial shaman and a talking gorilla drift in and out, and evil Jazz Cells turn out to be even invasively deadly than AIDS.

A couple of the episodes (""Party"" and ""Power of the Crimp"") are a little low on the freaky meter, but the overall season is still swathed in whimsical, filthy weirdness. Lots of strange dialogue (""I don't need him. I've already got a shallow mate who dresses like a... futuristic prostitute""!), toilet humor (naturally), bizarre life-forms (what is that grinning pink tentacled THING?), weird outfits for Vince, and a casual acceptance that anything can and will happen.

Barratt and Fielding are also quite awesome as a sort of surreal Odd Couple -- Barratt is great as a sort of lame-duck aspiring Artiste unaware of his intense uncoolness, while Fielding is deliciously over-the-top as a foppish, androgynous sort who changes his personal style every time it suits him. (Also a bunch of minor roles as Vince cells, the moon, and a pair of shamans). And Michael Fielding remains awesome as the wizard alien Naboo.

""The Mighty Boosh Season 3"" lags a little on the surreality in places, but it's still a brilliant, stunningly freaky little TV show. It's scuffproof, weatherproof, even bulletproof!",1265587200,,3397,4.987632508833922
3271296,4,B000YZ8594,"I love the Mighty Boosh! But the 3rd season was a let-down.  In interviews, Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt said they decided to take the characters Vince and Howard to their extremes, but this was a mistake, because they have lost most of their charm and their spirit of camaraderie. Vince is ready to throw Howard over at any opportunity; they seem to be sick of each other. Production-wise, there's a sense of things being rushed and sloppy.  For example, the recurring villain the Hitcher reappears, but they didn't bother with his prosthetic nose and chin this time, and just slathered on the green make-up.  I actually thought the joke would end up being that it was Vince pretending to be the Hitcher!  Also, the episode the ""The Power of the Crimp"" gets a little meta, with Vince and Howard in a tizzy over imitators who are referred to as ""The Flighty Zeus"" - a probable poke at The Flight of the Conchords, who took the sitcom w/ pop music idea and ran with it.  And with only 6 episodes, you have to wonder if they were struggling with a bit of creative drought.
BUT: the ""worst"" of the Boosh is still better than 99% of available entertainment!!!!
So - the verdict is - if you're not familiar with the Boosh, watch season 1 & 2 first, then this one.  If you start with Season 3, you'll be scratching your head as to what all the fuss is about.",1264291200,7,1356,4.42570281124498
3271297,2,B000YZ8594,"First off I have to say that I LOVED the first two seasons. This show is creative and bizarre while still being charming.
I have never seen the likes of it before.

Unfortunately season three took a major slide. Gone is much the creativity and all of the charm. Now it seems to shoot for a younger demographic with cheaper gags and much more of a mean spirited feel. Sure there are some good things in there but it just isn't worth sitting through most of the episodes for what they offer up. I guess I can't complain that there are only six episodes. More of the same would have made it that much worse.
