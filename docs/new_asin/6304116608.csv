superb realization--visual effects, sound, and--for the lack of a better word--screenplay.

7863663,5,6304116608,"Shouldnt a film on art be more than an illustrated narration with background music? Film is after all an art, with a largely untapped potential for scholarly interpretation. With that in mind, the Metropolitan  Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Trust formed in 1987 a joint venture  called the Program for Art on Film. Over the next three years, they  commissioned 28 art experts and filmmakers, working in pairs, to produce 14  innovative films and videos on an encyclopedic range of art subjects,  include funerary portraits from Ancient Rome; Manets painting(s) of the  execution of the Mexican emperor Maximilian; a 16th-century stone garden in  a Zen Buddhist monastery in Kyoto; Giorgiones Tempest; the Trevi Fountain  in Rome; 12th-century Christian cave paintings on the island of Cyprus; 11  tiny drawings of a deluge by Leonardo da Vinci; the Great Mosque of  Cordoba; the neoclassical church of Sainte-Genevive in Paris; anamorphic  peepshows; the Gothic cathedral in Beauvais; Mimbres painted pottery bowls;  a conversation on illumination and reflection with art historian Sir E.H.  Gombrich (filmed in his living room); and a guided tour by the painter  David Hockney of a 17th-century Chinese scroll painting. All of these  fascinating short films, which are as brief as 8 minutes and as long as 46,  are contained in this boxed set of five videos, which also features a  92-page viewers guide. It is a great pleasure to recommend this  collection, as it may very well be the finest, most provocative series  there is on art historical subjects. No serious library of art films should  be without it. (Review from Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 14 No 2, Winter  1998-99)",922579200,2,1686,5.08029197080292
