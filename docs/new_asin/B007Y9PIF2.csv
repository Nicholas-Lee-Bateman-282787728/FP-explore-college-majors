8523147,1,B007Y9PIF2,"Okay a 1 star only because the item pictured is a Malaysian import / bootleg. Has not been released in a box set like this in the US. Also if you really want this set go to E Bay it's $25.00 new.
As far as the story line I have enjoyed it on the official releases. Season 1 was released in English and Japanese languages. Seasons 2 - 4 are Japanese language with English subtitles only.",1465084800,,386,4.092105263157895
8523148,5,B007Y9PIF2,Animation is great original Japanese subtitles so sounds different from the americanised versions of seasons.,1430265600,,109,6.333333333333333
8523149,1,B007Y9PIF2,Obvious Malaysian bootleg. Seasons 1-3 are available on Blu-ray legitimately now or soon.,1430006400,,89,5.923076923076923
8523150,1,B007Y9PIF2,I like the story but not the dvd!!,1419897600,,34,3.375
8523151,1,B007Y9PIF2,"This is a pirated bootleg, DON'T GET BURNED! The quality is likely to be terrible both picture-wise and subtitle wise. The 2nd and 3rd seasons of the series are not yet licensed in North America, and Sentai holds the licenses for seasons 1 and 4. Season 1 is out on DVD from Sentai, and I'm not sure what they're doing with four since they don't have 2 or 3 yet.",1412121600,9,362,4.185714285714286
8523152,3,B007Y9PIF2,"You would expect it to be nice on the inside considering the outer packaging; but alas there are cheap CD nets inside holding the 6 discs. Also the subtitles in English for the 1st season are completely literal, don't always make sense. Also for some unknown reason the main character's name is translated and it adds for a strange experience.",1400889600,6,343,4.733333333333333
8523153,5,B007Y9PIF2,The complete series in one set is a must for any fan and if you haven't seen this and enjoy funny anime with characters you care about try this set. Subtitles not dubbed but most of the time it's better that way in my opinion.,1400198400,4,226,4.044444444444444
