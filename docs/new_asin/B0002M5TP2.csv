2103884,5,B0002M5TP2,"Yes, this is the set we have all been waiting for...the addition of Jetta to the Misfits! We also get a new Hologram, Raya, too. Jetta was the bad Brit we all loved and wanted to emulate. She was Roxy's nemesis and made life miserable for Jem. Who could forget when she paid those hooligans to bust the windows out of Raya's father's greenhouse, thus destroying his planting business! Or how about when she made fun of Roxy & we all learned that our dear Rox was illiterate! Other standouts include the Mardi Gras where a ghost of Shana's slave ancestor haunts the Holograms and the one where Kimber & Stormer form their own band. Can't wait til the next & final set where we get The Stingers!",1090627200,6,693,4.421875

I used to watch this as a kid and now that I have my own child I wanted to share with her the same experiences I have had. Cartoons today just aren't the same. There are some great shows out there thst I approve of, but nothing like this.",1238371200,,445,4.068181818181818
2103929,3,B0002M5TP2,I loved Jem as a young girl and was thrilled to find it on DVD to add to my collection.  I was rather dissappointed that this collection of DVD's(season 3 part 1)skips alot.  Therefore it is hard to enjoy.,1236643200,,205,4.230769230769231
2103930,1,B0002M5TP2,"I have actually purchased the first two dvds in this set, mainly because it stated ""The Complete Series"". Needless to say I was very upset when I saw that it was not and I was missing almost 30 episodes. I was able to complete the series by other means, but I give Rhino a F for not releasing everything when they had the chance. Now I see this Season 3 set which is still not complete. Don't waste your money on this set which is overpriced and not whole.",1235779200,3,456,4.134831460674158
2103931,5,B0002M5TP2,"However if they weren't so greedy with spliting up the final batch of episodes fans would have been able to own the complete final shows of this classic 80's series instead time ran out with the rights to sale the show and now Sony owns the rights I wouldn't hold my breath for further releases to get the rest of the series. I purchased my sets they days they were released for both the First Box Set and this set. It is a let down when fans of the show now have to pay top dollar prices, but even worse for those there at the begining of the releases who were letdown by the corporate greed over releasing the show as quickly as possible. This blame goes to those at Rhino Home Video.",1189036800,3,686,4.165413533834586

2103934,5,B0002M5TP2,"Both Rhino Jem releases are now out of print, and there are no plans to release the last part of season 3. Rhino lost the rights to Jem to Sony Music.  Who knows when we'll get the rest of the show.  Now I may never get to see the Stinger episodes...

If you are looking for more updates on the status of Jem, check out tv shows on dvd dot com.  They don't sell anything, but they get a lot of news regarding television show releases.",1126742400,39,434,4.011627906976744
2103935,5,B0002M5TP2,"....A new generation of little kids are getting to know and like Jem and the Holograms. I have 13 nieces and nephews, and a little girl (who is only 2), that really enjoys listening to the music, watching the colorful outfits(and hair!), and fun stories that are portrayed on Jem. This first half of season 3 is perfect for all audiences. There are stories about friendship, working together: good lessons for kids.

  This is such a treat to be able to watch a ""kids"" video that is actually entertaining to adults too. There is a melodramatic, soap opera appeal to Rio and Jem, and the music brings me back to the era of leg warmers and really big hair. It is a not so guilty pleasure: I stayed up the whole night watching this DVD set when it arrived in the mail.

  If you have children, introduce them to Jem and the Holograms. If you don't, bask in the fun funkiness that was the '80s.",1117497600,8,890,4.363636363636363
2103936,5,B0002M5TP2,"The first two sets are awesome and I would love for the set to be completed.  A few people at the Truly Outrageous message board have e-mailed Rhino regarding the final release and there's good news and bad news.  First the bad news, Rhino said in their response that they no longer have the rights to Jem and the rest of the Sunbow shows.  But here's the good news, Sony now owns the rights and Rhino said that they (Sony) plan to reissue the titles at some point.  Personally, I don't care who owns the rights just as long as the DVD collection is complete.

And another reviewer mentioned that there were some typos in the Jem Bible.  I heard that the Jem Bible was more of Christy Marx's rough draft to show Hasbro when she was approached to develop the show to go with the doll line.  Evidently some things were changed or taken out all together when the show actually started production.  So that's why some of the things in the Jem Bible are a bit different than what we see in the actual show (what's on the DVD extras are just excerpts from the full version which used to be on sale until Sunbow (or Hasbro, I forget which) asked Christy Marx to stop selling copies).",1115078400,21,1176,4.337899543378995
2103937,4,B0002M5TP2,"Okay great they finally released season three majority of these episodes I unfortunately don't remember however. I was disappointed with a few things for exalmple:they started the season with the Talent Search pt 1 #30 and part 2#31 inroducing Jetta (My favorite mizzfit)and Raya instead of starting the season with #27 of which is not even listed on the first half of season 3.the very next episode after the Talent Search is #28 the Scandal of should actually be numbered as #32 since it picks up right after Raya is made the newest member of Jem and the holograms. (2)the numeric order of the episodes are waaay off. unlike in the first two seasons everything was in proper numeric order 1 through 26. But in the first of Season 3 everything is scattered and it can kinda of throw you off especially when Stormer laid down her new terms of how she should be treated by the misfits in episode #34 The Bands Break Up then compared it to the way Pizazz spoke to her in some of the other episodes after that.

  The jem bible update has a few typos on Raya's info, the bible said she is the eldest(age 18) of three sisters but in episode 30 she told the holograms ""I always wanted sisters, I have 3 brothers."" The bible also said she had 4 brother and Enrique was the oldest(age20). YOu will also find that in the episodes she is shown with her family you will find she and her mother are the only females. Or maybe that's just on my Dvd set.

None the less, the animation for episodes #39 Music is Majic, #29 The Presidential Dilemma were not very good in my opinion. And Why did they make Jem's eyes purple just like her eyeshadow when in Season 1 and 2 her eyes were blue. And I definately agree they should put the episode of Jackie Benton on the first half of season 3.

The jumpstart to my memory was refreshing and fun because I hated the fact I couldn't remember a number of the episodes like the Jazz Player and Father's day which is one of my many favorites.",1110758400,4,1967,4.363387978142076
2103958,5,B0002M5TP2,"When I found out that Rhino home videos came out with ANOTHER Jem DVD,I simply had to have it!

With the Holograms recruiting Raya as their new drummer and the Misfits welcoming Jetta in their group,things are bound to get interesting! Some of the best Jem episodes can be found in this DVD. Plus,it includes an exclusive interview with none other than the singing voice of Jem, Britta Phillips! So,GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!

The 'Must Watch' episodes from this DVD:

~The Talent Search - Part 1

~ The Talent Search - Part 2

~ Scandal

~ One Jem Too Many

~ The Bands Break Up

~ The Fan

~Roxy Rumbles

~ Alone Again",1102982400,4,616,4.324561403508772
2103959,5,B0002M5TP2,"Kids today may laugh at the awful animation, corny dialogue and fashions, but the underlying themes and fun of Jem are undeniable. Besides, the music was has always been the biggest selling point for me and this set offers arond 20 new songs from the previous set.  Rhino in all their wisdom have again used the special feature that lets you watch all the musical segments.  What a thrill!  The set is worth it for this feature alone!

As for the other features, we get a few commentaries from the writer and an interview with Jem's singing voice.  These features are ok, but mostly uniformative and unmemorable.  The real reason to get this set is to watch any of the shows whenever you'd like. The trasfer is a bit better this time out, but you'll still see some grain and dirt.  Sound wise, the set is every bit as good as the previous one.  I did notice however that a few episodes are noticably quieter than others.

Few would claim that Jem was the best show ever, but there's no denying it's a lot of fun. How many shows are as much about muisc, fashion and dance as high speed chases, cutting edge technology and social consciousness? That all these disperate elements came together in an even mildly successful show would be a wonder but Jem was not only successful but a phenomonon that has survived the years.  Brin gon more Jem!  I can't wait for Part 2 of Season 3.",1099958400,8,1378,4.450199203187251
2103960,5,B0002M5TP2,"This is one of the best series ever!!!! With the new set comes along new members on both bands,new stories,new songs and above all, better and improved images!!! The drawings are sharp and more appealing.

Two of my favorite episodes are ""the fathers day"" (A good message for kids and parents) and ""Alone Again"" (How many tvshows give you a positive message on how destructive drugs can be?!).

This is a must-have!!! No doubt about it. I can't wait for 3rd season part 2.",1099267200,4,472,4.607142857142857
2103961,5,B0002M5TP2,"I loved Jem & the Holograms when I was a kid.  And, oddly, this is one of the few cartoons I watched as a child that still stands up now that I'm a jaded adult.  :)  The music is still cute and singable, Jem is still as badly dressed as ever, and the Misfits are still evil (and dumb... why haven't they been arrested?).  Also, this is a well put together DVD set.  All the episodes look good and the extra feature where you can just play the songs is nice.  More extras would be nice, but otherwise, it's perfect.  can't wait for Season 3 part 2.",1098662400,7,547,4.05607476635514
2103962,5,B0002M5TP2,"Jem and The Holograms is the best, the very best show of the 80's.  And now is back!  At least, in DVD.  Excelent sound, better than in DVD set 1, the imageis not that sharp, good presentation.  I love using Dolby 5.1, you can almost hear only the instrumental music.  And that's the deal about Jem, great music!!!

  Now, this goes to Sunbow, or the ones in charge of this project:  Thanks!!!  I know there will be a last set, what if you include a DVD with the instrumental music and the videos.

  ""Freedom"" has great sound, do that to ""Now"" and ""This is Farewell"".  They will be great like that, and sales would be better!

  Jem fans, this is a must!",1098144000,3,655,4.237704918032787
2103963,5,B0002M5TP2,"I think this show is so unique and fun to watch.  I love the songs... I think Rhino should release all the songs on a CD now that they've released the show on DVD.  And I mean EVERY song!  This is the season that announced the arrival of two new members to both the Misfits and the Holograms; Jetta and Raya, respectively.  They became two of my favorite characters, even though they weren't original band members. Jetta was so cool!  I loved her accent! And Raya was so sweet and her accent was cool too.  I love how Jem and the Holograms are a multicultural band and The Misfits all appear to be of European descent (in other words, white.)  I kind of think this was done on purpose to show how close-minded the Misfits were and how gracious and accepting the Holograms were.  Anyway, this show is great, and do not hesitate to pick up this DVD! I think my favorite episodes were the Talent Search episodes and the Music is Magic episode.  (It was cool and mysterious.... almost Scooby-Doo like! LOL) Does anyone know when the second part of season 3 is coming out?  I hope it's soon!",1097712000,3,1086,4.385
2103964,5,B0002M5TP2,"I'm not really sure why people are saying KJEM, The Presidential Dilemma and Trick or Techrat were such poorly scripted/animated episodes?. I think each Jem episode was unique in their own way. (That's in my opinion) and personally they are great episodes to watch.

Anyways back to the DVD, I was quite surprised at the way the dvds were packaged?. Though they're fine they might annoy some people. The Menus are very basic and much quicker than the first dvd release. The episode's quality are much better however compared to the first/second series though, though some episodes audio seems quieter and i'd tend to have to switch from 2.0 to 5.1 stereo. If you watch Talent Search Part 2's end credits in 5.1 Stereo its a slower version of the Jem theme which is kinda cool. The DVD Casing was much better than the first season!!!

Though they're only tempting us to wait longer, i don't really mind considering i have over 40 eps anyway! Hopefully when they release the Part 2 they might have a replace disc for Disc 2 Season 1/2 boxset? We'll never know?",1097625600,2,1058,4.652406417112299
2103965,3,B0002M5TP2,"The episodes are as cheesy as expected, but of course great for nostalgic purposes. I'm sure younger kids today would even find them entertaining. But the price? They're charging over $70 CAD for three discs of cartoons? 19 short episodes? That's absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I bought it was because I saved over $25 by pre-ordering it.
The packaging is a tad bit better this time around, although it's disappointing to see that they used the same picture on the front as they did for the last box set. The pictures used inside are just small and sometimes pixelated screenshots from the episodes themselves. Again, there is a lot of Jem artwork out there, why not use it?
The menus are the same boring and tacky menus they used the last time around, and the special features are only okay. An interview with the singing voice of Jem, Britta Philips was kind of neat, but it would  have been better had it not looked like it were shot in a dark closet. Everything about this DVD set seems pretty low budget--aside from the shelf price. If you can find it used or on sale then go for it!",1096156800,6,1096,4.507537688442211
2103966,5,B0002M5TP2,"I have the season 1 & 2 dvd set and recently ordered the season 3 part 1. Watching all the episodes from both dvd sets brung back memories for me. My brother and I grew up on watching ""Jem"" when we were kids coming up in the eighties. Besides Jem being my favorite character of course, I have to say that my second favorite character was Raya, even though it seemed like she was the most overlooked character in the series. The reason why Raya is my second favorite character is because she reminds me so much of myself, of how she was shy and sensitive, and to me she seemed different from the other girls who were members of the holograms. I can't wait for Rhino to come out with the other half of season three on dvd with the episodes with the Stingers.",1095724800,2,756,4.220689655172414
2103967,4,B0002M5TP2,"This is a pretty good cartoon series,and I'm glad it was released onto DVD.However,I do have a few gripes:

""Jazz Has""-the WORST  Jem song ever! This song has NO melody and is just a bunch of noise.

""The Jazz Player""-An episode that really didn't need to be made. All the Holograms did was waste the whole episode trying to get a washed-up jazz band from the 40s back together.

""Alone Again""-I feel that this was made just to have ""Jem"" jump on to the anti-drug band wagon. The story intended to be good and teach a lesson,but it failed by being TOO preachy. If you want a GOOD  anti-drug cartoon,watch ""Cartoon All-stars to the Rescue"",the anti-drug episode of the cartoon ""C.O.p. S"" or the anti-drug episode of ""Pup named Scooby-Doo""-those were handled beautifully without being too preachy.

The other episodes are really terrific,however,and make up for the boring ""Jazz Player"" and carbon-copy ""Alone Again"".",1095638400,2,915,4.909090909090909
2103988,5,B0002M5TP2,"This dvd collection of Jem is great. I have to agree with one of the reviews givin here. I can't understand why they ended this collection with ""Mardi Gras."" It also seems they may have left one episode out:

#46 ""Renesance Woman"" witch features Jem and the Holograms in England with their friend Dance. The holograms face danger and work with Robin hood and his friends to avenge the true prince of Farfax England. -its very odd that they would forget this episode, none the less, this is still a great DVD.

The rest of the episodes will probably be on the next dvd that didn't make it on this one.

#47 ""Out of the Past,""

#48 ""Britrock"" and

#49 ""Journey Through Time""

and will continue with Hollywood Jem and so on...

This is a great buy,and Amazon.com has it at a great price!",1095465600,,784,4.402777777777778
2103989,5,B0002M5TP2,"I am so glad that Rhino has decided to bless us with an issue of this great cartoon on DVD!  After getting seasons 1 and 2 together, I was a bit disappointed that all of season 3 did not come as one package.  Is this Rhino's way of squeezing the most money of Jem's fans?  And...the packaging!  Who paid these folks to draw?  The reason why I gave this 5 stars was not the packaging, or the way in which the episodes are released, but simply because these episodes are GOOD!  Even as an adult, it is easy to get drawn into the plot of the show, and still be able to look back and laugh at the cheesiness of it!  The writing on this season really took off, and I think the introduction of Jetta and Raya really add class to the show.  I am really looking forward to the second half of season 3 when the Stingers show up!  Now, that's when things really get cookin'!  Stay tuned...the best is yet to come!",1095292800,6,903,4.1085714285714285
2103990,5,B0002M5TP2,"Jem was the stand-out cartoon series of the 80's....it had action for boys, romance for girls, and soap opera-esque elements for adults (I was in my teens when the show orginally aired, and my mom would watch it WITH me...I think she was just as into it as I was!).  Flash to the present; the show was slipping slowing into oblivion, with only old, rapidly deteriorating VHS copies to watch, when Rhino finally listened to the desperate pleas of fans, and released Jem on DVD.

  This set covers the first part of what Rhino has deemed ""Season 3"", although I think their count is a bit skewed.  At any rate, with this season, character development really started to shine, and we started learning ""background"" things about our beloved rockers.  The addition of Jetta to The Misfits added a new angle, as Roxy now had someone to compete with as Pizzazz's right-hand cronie.  Aja (who was shamefully under-used in the series) finally garnered a love interest, and he was none other than Stormer's BROTHER.  And, speaking of Stormer, we found out that her real name was Mary Phillips!  It was little details like these that really fleshed out the series, and kept it from being just another half-hour toy commercial like so many OTHER cartoon series of the period.  Even the songs seemed to take a step up in quality.  This season also saw the show tackle more deep subjects, such as illiteracy (Roxy couldn't read), drug abuse, and the after-effects of the death of a parent.  ""Father's Day"" (which shows Kimber's trouble in dealing with her father's death) is a heart-breaking episode, and it just makes you care for the characters (as well as your OWN parents) all the more.

  Bonus features include an interview with one of the story writers, commentary tracks, and an informative interview (at last!) with Britta Phillips, Jem's singing voice. (For a VERY surreal experience, seek out the CD ""Popdropper"", by The Belltower.  Britta was one of their lead singers, and it's eerily like hearing Jem sing REAL rock music.)  The packaging, once again, is nothing to write home about, with the first two DVDs stacked awkwardly on top of each other.  The package art is dreadful (though not as bad as the first set), and I just can't figure why Rhino didn't request access to Hasbro's GREAT artwork from the product line..it would have been a HUGE improvement, and really upped the retro factor.  And, speaking of Hasbro...

  With the DVDs selling very well (and the vintage dolls all over auction sites), Jem nostalgia is at a FEVER pitch!  Most of the girls' toy lines from the 80s (My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake, Rainbow Brite), are once again filling toy aisles across the country. Yet, there is one MAJOR line that's missing.  Barbie has finally been PUSHED off of her throne by other, more creative doll lines, so Hasbro......it's time for the return of the Truly Outrageous Jem.  2005 is her 20th anniversary, so what better time than the present? The line has SO much potential, update her, re-size her, do whatever you have to....just BRING her BACK to us...please?",1095206400,7,3078,4.806083650190114
2103991,5,B0002M5TP2,"Jem has some great episodes and other not so great, but the idea, some animations, some backgrounds episodes makes the series the best of the world. Nowadays, cartoons don't have this wonderfull drawing and these carismatic characters. These cartoons are made with their creator's heart. No doubt. And the songs, background musics, etc... are just excellent. The best euros I have spent ever. ;-)

To Rhino: go on, go on!!!!!!",1095120000,,426,5.085714285714285

2103993,5,B0002M5TP2,"Rhino keeps releasing the hits with the series JEM.  Originally aired in nine minute clips between robotics and big foot and the muscle machines, Jem soon had quite a following.  Boys thought the girls were sexy and the songs cool, girls had a cast of strong female characters to latch onto.  This was a big deal since the 1980's market was gluted with role models for boys with only a few for females (such as the legendary She-RA).

Hopefully Rhino doesn't stop and continues to release all the greats from the past such as  Robotics, Sectars, and Visionaries.

Jem is one of my favourite cartoons. the only thing i didn't like is the art cover of the dvd very cheap made the first one wasn't the best but this one ewwwwwwwwwwww its so ugly. in the past the video covers were so much nicer made but anyway whats more important its that the dvds are coming out jem is the best,1092355200,4,397,3.9135802469135803
2103996,5,B0002M5TP2,"In today's cartoon and real life world, most of the Misfits look tame, but Jetta really was a bad girl. For a pre-adolescent cartoon, this was getting to be pretty heated stuff.

Her arrival effectively dethroned Pizzaz (who really was a spoiled rich girl) and Roxy as the person to stay clear away from. Even the disclosure that she could not read did not soften things up. That storyline remained deliciously juicy.

The only big disappointment in this season was the short-lived band between Kimber and Stormer (who had both felt rejected from their original bands for various reasons)which was never given enough time in the story. Because the two characters looked so comfortable working together, there would have been a great story arc with this 'new' band. At least the adjoining merchandisers could have gotten lots more mileage out of the brand.",1091923200,9,855,4.972027972027972

Although I love all of Jem's epsiodes, I must say the episodes with Raya and Jetta are my favorite.  Keep them coming Rhino.  Jem is finally back.  You must add this DVD to your collection.  I cannot wait for the remaining 20.  I have a feeling Rhino will release them during the Holidays and if so, an excellent gift.",1090800000,5,400,4.3108108108108105

8029107,5,B0002M5TP2,"I used to watch this back in the eighties when I was like five, and I was so glad when it finally came out on dvd. It's such an amazing cartoon. It focuses on a rock band who sings about helping others and showing kindness. They sing to support an orphanage of teenage girls. There is an opposing rock band that they are constantly being thrown against in contests and compared too, and that band is always scheming and plotting to get their way. It shows people that you can win by doing what's right. In a world where cartoons are cussing and violent these days, it is truly a great show. Plus, it supports originality and being yourself, which girls need to hear more of in my opinion.",1391299200,,688,4.341085271317829

8029110,3,B0002M5TP2,"Instead of wasting your money on this item, why not wait a few months and get the entire series on DVD.  The entire set is being released by Hasbro in October.  The wait is finally over.",1311206400,,186,4.138888888888889
8029111,4,B0002M5TP2,"This DVD box sets contain episodes twenty-seven through forty-five of Jem.  Unfortunately, Rhino lost the rights to release Jem on DVD after this volume, so the final set with the remaining twenty episodes was never released.  Of course, this means that once again, episodes featuring The Stingers (a third band introduced right near the end of the series) were not released; these episodes were also never released when Jem episodes were being released on VHS tapes.

This DVD set contains three discs.  The first disc contains seven episodes.  For bonus features, there is commentary on episode twenty-seven (""The Talent Search Part 1"") by series creator Christy Marx and on episode thirty-three (""Father's Day"") by story editor Roger Slifer.  This disc also contains the ""Play Songs"" features, which allows the viewer to see the ""music episodes"" from the episodes as stand-alone pieces.

The second disc contains seven episodes.  For bonus features, there is commentary on episode thirty-four (""Treasure Hunt"") by Christy Marx and the ""Play Songs"" feature.  The third disc contains five episodes.  For bonus features, this disc contains commentary on episode forty-one (""KJEM"") by Christy Marx, interviews with Britta Phillips (the singing voice for Jem) and Roger Slifer, excerpts from the Jem production bible (which is what the writers referred to for character descriptions and other information when writing the scripts for the series), and the ""Play Songs"" feature.

I enjoyed this set, but was very disappointed that in the end, we didn't get a complete release of the series.  However, I would recommend both this set and the DVD set of the first and second season of the series to anyone who enjoys Jem (since this is currently the only way to own any episodes the series on DVD).

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that my husband and I purchased.",1288569600,4,1888,5.0711974110032365
8029112,5,B0002M5TP2,"These DVD sets are Awesome! Worth the price.
Although I think its a shame that sellers are keeping the price so high.
I can see why the producers left out season 3 part 2. With the ""Stingers"".
Its all about the ""Stingers"", really awful.
Its like the antichrist walking in, or the aryan ego takeover, Nordic deception,
or something like that. I find it signifigant. It really means something today.
Big deal. Its ok, Im sure it wasn't the origional crew giving it their all like the first parts. Anway I think this show really has some value. Or its just awesome.
The DVD set is worth having if it means something to you.
Agian, season 3 part 2. Something is going on there, and its signifigant. Its typical though. Very typical, its what happens to things that are too great, some ellusive force, or deception sneaks in in the end tries to take over.
To me, this is what the new age movement represented or tried to achive, but it has met with
forces that have underminded it.
If you don't care about all this crazy stuff I said, forget it.
Its just a great series and nice DVD set worth preserving. Get it before its lost to history.
Still, its sad how the sellers are charging so much.
'adios'.later.",1271894400,,1202,4.4434389140271495
