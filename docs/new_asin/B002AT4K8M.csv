3891538,5,B002AT4K8M,"I have always been a Vin Diesel fan (you guys can snicker if you want, the guy has talent). I originally had contemplated not buying all 4 of theFast and Furious franchise, but I loved 1 and 4 so much I gave in, gad I did. I hadn't seen the first three in a while and they were excellent. I loved all the extras each DVD had, however, I didn't like this discombobulation in the way that the actual DVD's were set up. Some I could scroll through normally (using skip) others were a hassle of fast forwarding. Problematic and annoying yes, but even if I had known ahead of time it would not have kept me from buying them. The best thing was seeing the difference between 1 and 4, both with the characters (how they were portrayed and had aged) and how the story lines played out.

5 star! A++!

Amazon made this an easy purchase always..thanks!",1265846400,,842,4.289308176100629
3891539,2,B002AT4K8M,I was so excited to be able to get this collection for my hushband at a great price.  The first movie was just what you would expect but half way into the second movie it started skipping.  My hushand being the moive buff he is took it out and cleaned the dvd thinking that would take care of the problem.  Sad to say it did not so he asked me to return for exchange.  After checking the return policy I found that they only will take back with a 50% credit.  I have enjoyed shopping with Amazon but will not purchase DVD's from them.  I should have checked the return policy before I made my purchase but since I did not then I am out one movie.,1265846400,29,646,4.047244094488189

3891570,2,B002AT4K8M,"The movies are good, or else I wouldn't have bought them.  The problem is the product itself.  The DVD's come in cheaply made cases that are bent and do not properly hold the DVD and the disks end up tumbling around in the case.  Also, the DVD's don't match the cover.  Example:  in the ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" case was a DVD labeled as such.  But when I put it in, Tokyo Drift was the actual movie on the disk.  The only one that wasn't  mis labeled was Fast and Furious.",1345852800,2,467,4.054945054945055
3891571,1,B002AT4K8M,"I purchased these movies because I loved them!
It was with a surprise that I starting watching the #1 and it was Titled Tokyo Drift, this was, the #3, bad label!
Then I checked on the #3 and to my surprise, it was #1...so, I exchanged the cover...so, for now...wrong covers, wrong labels on Cd...on 2 out of 4 Cd
I watched the real #1, then #2, they were fine, no bugging/freezing, I was very pleased about this...but, it didn't last long...lol
I started watching the #3 and this one, started bugging in the middle of it...very annoying!
I haven't watched the #4, yet
So, I do think, this was a very poorly done copy..nobody checked on the order or on the products...wrong labels, on wrong boxes and wrong labels on Cd also!
Big disappointment!",1333324800,,744,4.518518518518518

The new movie opened in my cinema and i wanted to show the story to my girlfriend, but first i wanted to see the only movie i haven't seen, tokio drift. I started watching the movie and at half of it it stops, tried rewining it but at the very same second it stops. I checked the dvd and the thing was scratched. I just took this thing out of the box and out of that plastic wrap, theres no way that it could got scratch in the process. Very sad",1306713600,,515,3.9615384615384617
