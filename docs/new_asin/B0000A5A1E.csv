7996039,5,B0000A5A1E,"All the TINY PLANET'S BING & BONG stories are wonderful, entertaining, and educational.  There are no spoken ""languages"", so all toddlers on up can enjoy each story and fall in love with the two main characters, easily...not to mention--their parents, too!  The graphics, music, and action are all top-notch.",1153612800,,308,5.26530612244898
7996040,5,B0000A5A1E,I love this series. I was so pleased to find this on DVD. My son watches this all the time and he learns many things. I am looking forward to the next DVD. I would recommend this to any parent who has children of pre-school age.,1151884800,,228,3.9782608695652173
7996041,4,B0000A5A1E,"Tiny Planets is a computer-animated show for the toddler to Kindergarten set starring two cute fuzzy aliens named Bing & Bong.  Another alien, Halley, narrates Bing and Bong through their adventures on each of the six tiny planets they visit (Self, Sound, Light and Color, Nature, Technology, & Stuff) .  The DVD is broken down into 2 episodes featuring several shorter segments (under 10 minutes a piece) based on different problems needing to be solved.  It's a great tool for introducing science, shapes and problem-solving skills to young children. My 3 year old daughters love this series (they've been fans of it on Noggin since they were about 1 1/2 ) and thanks to it have impressed their preschool teacher with the knowledge gained from it.  Kids especially seem to enjoy the eye-candy of the aliens on the tiny planets as well as the silent interaction between Bing and Bong.  The concept of a Sofa/Bed space craft and the theme song are big plusses as well.",1130889600,,968,4.807228915662651
7996042,5,B0000A5A1E,I just love Tiny Planets.  My pre-schooler and I will sit down and watch them over and over again.  She learns constantly.  They are teaching her useful information.  She loves Bong and his crazy ways.  I recommend this to anyone that has pre-school aged children and smaller.,1124064000,3,276,4.787234042553192
7996043,5,B0000A5A1E,Tiny Planets is so adorable! My son who is 23 months old loves this dvd. He loves the music and the two cute aliens named Bing and Bong. In every episode they explore one of the Tiny planets and try to help the other aliens' named Flockers living on those planets. It's really enjoy watching these dvd's with my son!,1123891200,2,316,4.283333333333333
7996044,5,B0000A5A1E,I would highly recommend this very colorful and animated show.  Bing and Bong teach great lessons and my son loves the colors and all the motion.,1123027200,,145,4.576923076923077
7996045,4,B0000A5A1E,"Tiny Planets is a computer animated educational show for very young children.  It features two furry white aliens - thoughtful Bing and playful little Bong - who zip about their universe on a furry white sofa solving little problems on one of 6 tiny planets.  On each planet a diferent range of topics is explored: nature, technology, self, sound, light and color, and ""stuff"" (physics and geometry).  Each episode is fairly short - typically well under 10 minutes, and requires no reading or numerical skills, and so is suitable for toddlers and pre-K kids.  However, I find that older kids will watch with some interest, even though the material is too easy for them.</p>

This DVD features 8 episodes in 2 groups of 4.  At the beginning of each group is a short intro segment, showing Bing and Bong starting their day inside a giant crystal in their home planet, and introducing the narrator, Halley, the only character who talks (if you've the hand drawn ""Maisy"" series,then this approach will be familiar).</p>

The computer animation is well done, and adults will at first enjoy how cleverly it is put together.  That is, until your toddler wants to to watch it for the 400th time.  Mine loves these, and prefers them to most other videos we have.</p>",1071014400,14,1257,4.782407407407407
7996046,4,B0000A5A1E,"The repetitive nature and music of this video are greatly enjoyed by my daughter, she's 27 months old.  She just loves this video.  The video is a compilation of 8 short videos which CBC kids plays on saturday mornings.  They have nice lessons for kids, and Bing and Bong are very cute.  But they are not entirely sweet, they have emotions and deal with them in consructive ways.  They also promote problem solving skills.  Bing and Bong don't actually speak,(there is a narrator) but my daughter enjoys the non verbal sound effects, and seems to really relate to non verbal communication, since of course her vocabulary is growing, she still relies on non verbal communication.
I'd say the one down fall of the video is that it gets annoying for adults, again because it is repetitive.  Still, I enjoy the episode music.",1070755200,,821,4.73943661971831
