8563323,5,B00B6L2GTA,Simply excellent...with period and present day coverage of the exterior and interior of the Tiger...using the last remaining running Tiger 1 in the world (131)...Included is a short history on how the Bovington Tank Museum acquired it along with a couple quick glimpses of a Stug 3 and Kettenkrad both fully restored and running....and an interview (including schematics of the event) with the British tanker credited with destroying Michael Wittmann's Tiger !  A must-have for those interested in the Tiger tank.,1433980800,6,513,5.333333333333333
