7992269,5,B00009PBU2,"This is one of their best slapsticks ever. There's something out of many genres to pick from here, including spoofing the CIA and the Get Smart series. Their impersonation of wealthy Texas cattlemen is a hoot.  It's great how the scripting wrote in little nuances throughout the storyline, such as the agents who don't want their lack of job performance passed onto the boss. The clip where the CIA boss is chatting with an agent whose bugging Castro's private quarters is really clever. Very James Bondish is the bad guy who again, paradies the evil individual out to rule the world.  His side kick is a woman who could be a guy in drag and adds to the humor of this whacky comedy.  If you love the Trinity boys, this is a definite for collectors.",1224547200,,748,4.525925925925926
