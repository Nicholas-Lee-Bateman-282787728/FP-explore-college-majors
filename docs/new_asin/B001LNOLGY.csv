8319198,4,B001LNOLGY,"Probably for older, more mature viewers who aren't only interested in tons of action, violence, or things jumping out of you every few minutes. Still I agree this is an unseen classic, one i'm glad I took a chance on the purchase of.
The previous reviewer is correct that it's very much like a dark Twilight Zone episode.
I grew up in the 1960's seeing old movies from the 1930's to the 50's on TV, so it's not hard for me to view this within that framework.
The thing that makes this film really is the location. Eerie and very quiet. My only critique is that we don't see enough of the internal bunker at all from a distance, only the shadowy corridor in dimly-lit close-ups as the main character walks though them barely able to see more than a few inches in front of his nose. Some larger views of the interior would have helped I believe.
But this has TONS of atmosphere, in a nice quiet, haunting, creepy kind of way. And THAT you don't see much of anymore for sure. The shorter running time (my copy runs about 73 minutes) is just about right. It would be too dragged out if any longer to be honest.
But this certainly is one of those films that certainly doesn't deserve to be as unknown and obscure as it is.",1339891200,,1217,4.2956521739130435
