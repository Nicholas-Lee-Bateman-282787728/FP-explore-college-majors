4254936,5,B00439U2W0,Sometimes words are not enough.  This is one of those times.  The first time I was just mesmerized by sections of this dvd.  It's one of those things I need to watch over and over.  Each time gleaning something new.  It's a keeper.,1359936000,,231,4.27906976744186
4254937,5,B00439U2W0,"I chose this DVD because I have read books by Marion Woodman and learned a great deal from them, and I wanted something to watch with a group of women friends interested in Jungian psychology.  The interviews are both deep and lively,  with riveting stories from her life and insights into her choices, her struggles and her marriage.  The DVD is also quite beautiful visually,  in both the filming and the illustrations.  You don't have to start with any knowledge of or interest in Jung's ideas to enjoy this movie and learn from it.",1354492800,,535,4.648936170212766
4254938,5,B00439U2W0,"Amazon.com said this was a region 1 DVD but it turned out to be All Region.  This was very good news for me as I am based in Region 2.  The DVD arrived on time, well packaged. Thanks",1342051200,,182,3.763157894736842
4254939,5,B00439U2W0,"I'm not sure I can put into words exactly why I loved this DVD so much. I just began reading Marion Woodman's books, and already I'm captivated and in awe of her work.

What makes this film so special is that it makes it clear the greatness of her work is derived from her own life. All of her deepest insights and breakthroughs have derived largely from experiences she's gone through, such as her struggle with anorexia and the cancer that is the subject of her memoir, Bone. Her mind is disciplined through years of study, notably at the Jung Institute in Zurich, and by many years of writing, teaching and doing analysis as a psychoanalyst. But her most enduring subject of study has been herself. She embodies the principles she talks about and writes about.

She's a charming woman, a compelling story-teller and a great mind. The animations and music enhance the emotional impact of what she talks about. Andrew Harvey is a wonderful, compassionate interviewer, and the entire film is intimate, thoughtful, and heartfelt. Scenes of Marion in her study and her garden, conversations between her and her husband Ross, the beautiful settings for the conversations, all add up to an enriching and uplifting film about a remarkable woman.",1335916800,8,1240,4.872037914691943
4254940,5,B00439U2W0,"Well presented, engaging and powerfully informative. This Dvd can give a new perspective;fresh eyes as it were on life and the world. Marion is delightful, truly a woman who knows that she knows.",1326844800,8,195,4.9393939393939394
4254941,4,B00439U2W0,"A moving portrait of Marion Woodman's life and her introduction into the world of psychotherapy and Jungian philosopy. Her artwork and ""heartwork""  explain where she came from and the roads she has traveled.",1324598400,5,207,5.2727272727272725
4254942,3,B00439U2W0,"NOTE: I haven't bought or seen this product. (I had to pick a star, or this wouldn't publish.)

I love Marion Woodman and have read virtually everything she's ever written. But what exactly is this product? What is the format/content? Is this Marion Woodman telling her life story to an interviewer? How long does it run? Someone said ""graphics""... are their animations or something in the background. The product description is singularly uninformative-- amazon: how about beefing that up a bit?

UPDATE: March 26, 2016. Oh. I see someone at Amazon has fixed this. The product is a DVD. Good.",1322784000,,593,4.92
4254943,5,B00439U2W0,This is an incredibly beautiful experience! It certainly warmed my soul. Thank you Marion for showing us how to dance with our souls!!!!!!,1318377600,10,138,5.043478260869565
4254944,5,B00439U2W0,"This is the story of remaining true to oneself, through decades of marriage, through career changes and how a woman remains essentially herself and yet brings a great, wide wisdom into the world. Ms. Woodman's amazing life, career(s) and marriage are tenderly told by a filmmaker besmitten with Marion Woodman's gifts as a teacher, therapist, woman, writer and wife.

I found myself weeping watching her hands gesture what her words were saying about a juncture in her marriage with Ross Woodman. It was so beautiful and so loving and yet, so very intensely intimate with all dimensions of marriage. I cannot think of a cinematic moment more poignant than this one brief window in to that level of intimacy. You will be watching it twice, I promise.

With inspired graphics added to this already perfect film, making it worth a third and fourth viewing, you will not quickly be lending this one out to friends. Ergo, this is a perfect DVD to give your friends as gifts.",1290124800,44,969,4.796407185628743
4254945,5,B00439U2W0,This dvd is an uplifting and inspiring work.  I have followed Marion Woodman for many years and attended one of her workshops. Her work continues to deepen and expand.,1289952000,18,167,4.758620689655173
8414490,5,B00439U2W0,This is a beautifully put together video.  A real meditation that goes beyond the life of this amazing woman.,1506470400,,109,4.7368421052631575
8414491,5,B00439U2W0,My life has been touched to the core by this testimony. Thank you Marion Woodman.,1461283200,,81,4.466666666666667
8414492,5,B00439U2W0,Excellent. HAs taught me so much,1434067200,,32,4.5
8414493,5,B00439U2W0,"Marian Woodman is a treasure. As a young woman in my 20s, I cannot emphasize enough what it has meant for me to have her as a role model of what it means to age into Beauty. Her books walked me down a path which I could not have uncovered on my own.",1430092800,,249,3.7169811320754715
8414494,3,B00439U2W0,"I don't know Marion Woodman but bought this because I know what she is talking about with the death/rebirth.  This video is an interview with her.  It starts out strong in the first minute but fails to keep that level of intrigue.  Her stories are at a mythical and mystical level of interpretation.  Although the stories are interesting, I want to state that everything is left vague; there is no mastery over this domain, no ability to convey what is going on to the viewers.

The interviewer is possibly the worst I've ever experienced.  He tries to put words into Marion's mouth and reinterpret her understanding to match his model he is pushing.  And his ""trance"" words are never explained either.  Most viewers will see this work as mystical; I see it as a failed attempt to convey the deeper truths Marion has realized.",1427587200,,826,4.6875

8414496,5,B00439U2W0,"If you know the work of Marion Woodman, jungian analyst, focused on the conscious feminine, you will love this movie!
One of the best of all of hers.
I watched many, many times.",1401580800,3,177,4.393939393939394
8414497,5,B00439U2W0,"This dvd is exceptional and is a must have for any fan of Marion Woodman. I have watched it several times- the interviews are wonderful, but also the fantastic animation of Faith Hubley is really special. Truly inspiring!",1395964800,2,221,4.842105263157895
8414498,5,B00439U2W0,"Although I'm a Marion's books' reader, seeing and listening to her is a singular delight. The documentary is awesome! The testimonies, the dialogues, the images, everything is full of her own energy of meaning and her personal loving vibration. For me, she has been an example of creative crone, a specially juicy one (using a term from Jean Shinoda Bolen). Life and death, love and hate, light and darkness, all the opposites find a place to fall in love with each other and open our minds do understand and embody the genuine feminine and its power to transform inner and outer world.",1381968000,3,586,4.754901960784314
8414499,5,B00439U2W0,"This is one that I know I will want to watch again and again. I found myself stopping, jotting down her words and then starting the film over and over",1378252800,,150,4.033333333333333
