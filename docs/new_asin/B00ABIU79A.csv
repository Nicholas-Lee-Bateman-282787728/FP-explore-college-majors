8549817,5,B00ABIU79A,"One of the cutest and most imaginative animated TV shows ever! This show airs aslo on the Sprout channel, too. Great show mixed with cute characters, fun filled magical adventures, nice songs, and cool animation, and the blanket comes to life and talks when Chloe and her friends go on the magical adventures and play dress-up. Great show, it never gets old! Far much better then Caillou! It did well for me, I highly recomend this show for young kids!",1429833600,,452,4.6625
8549818,5,B00ABIU79A,Grand kids love Chloe. Now I don't have to restart her every 12 minutes on my DVR. Can just put in DVD for continuous stories.,1397088000,,126,4.08
8549819,5,B00ABIU79A,"This DVD came at the perfect time. With the beautiful weather we've been having in Southern California it almost feels like spring and we have been spending lots of time outdoors. Chloe's Closet: Outdoor Explorer was full of outdoor fun and adventure.

My kids both love to play dress up and use their imaginations to play so they liked Chloe immediately. Every time Chloe dresses up, she goes on a magical adventure. In this DVD there are five episodes and Chloe becomes a Forest Ranger, Gardener and Jungle Explorer.

In my twenties I actually wanted to be a Forest Ranger so I tried to talk Paige into becoming one but she wasn't having it. Her favorite was when Chloe was a gardener. She asked me if we could plant our own flowers so that will be fun to do this spring with her. I love when a DVD makes my kids think about things they never have before and want to experience new things.

Chloe is an adorable and unique character with a fun personality. It encourages imagination and being active which all parents love. Chloe's Closet: Outdoor Explorer is the first we have seen of Chloe but we will definitely be excited to see more from her!",1362700800,,1149,4.514423076923077
8549820,5,B00ABIU79A,"In Chloe's Closet Outdoor Explorer, there are five different stories perfect for the Spring season where Chloe and her friends dress up as a Forest Rangers, Gardeners, Jumgle Explorers, Farmers and more!

An example of one of the stories that you'll find on this particular DVD is one about a little boy who gets frustrated about being so little and not getting to do some of the things the bigger kids are doing. He then in an adventure gets to help out in a big way even though he's little where the older children can't! Other stories the children learn about scarecrows, planting in the garden, and more!

I thought all the stories were really cute and my four year old daughter and two year old son loved Chloe's Closet and have asked to watch not just this DVD again but the others in our collection too! This DVD is great to encourage pretend play, dress up, or actually delving into the real thing! Maybe you''' discover your little one has a green thumb!",1362441600,,963,4.528735632183908
