That said, it's still a fun video, but don't expect Sesame Street-style precision transitions or Electric Company-type literacy teaching. I described it to my 6-year old son as being sort of a midpoint between The Muppet Show and the Electric Company. Slightly educational, but mostly entertaining. I would recommend tracking down actual episodes...where? I don't know.",1267660800,2,422,5.507692307692308
