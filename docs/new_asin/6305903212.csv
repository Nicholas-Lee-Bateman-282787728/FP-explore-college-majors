Watch the old bikes ride again!",984268800,7,217,4.2926829268292686

1091001,5,6305903212,The classic American motorcycle story.  It should be viewed in conjunction with Parts I & II.  Still a great story of why many ride motorcycles.,1385337600,,144,4.72
1091002,5,6305903212,I bought this for a friend who used to race every weekend in the summer.  His doctor advised him not to race any more.  He still enjoys the idea of racing and this movie makes him feel like he is right there.,1362614400,,208,3.9285714285714284
1091003,5,6305903212,"Loved seeing the old pros again, both in old footage, lots of extra footage not shown before and interviews, and now knowing they are still a group of friends.....amazing camaraderie....",1354406400,,186,5.233333333333333

Sunday"", with clips of the original participants there views on the
making of the movie and some out-takes.  Its a great story on what went on and what happened to make the movie possible.  Good stuff!",1351555200,2,268,4.34

1091007,5,6305903212,"FOUND THIS DVD TO BE VERY, VERY INFORMATIVE AND BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF OLD MEMORIES.  DIDN'T MISS A MINUTE OF IT.

WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE TOUCHING BASE WITH SOME OF THE LEGENDS OF THAT ERA SUCH AS RICE, ROMERO, MARKLE.  WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

OVERALL IT WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH.",1141344000,,276,4.25
1091008,4,6305903212,"If you are 46 years old or older and used to Flat Track this movie is awsome.  It's great to see all the detailed racing and how rough those old tracks were.  The interviews are insitefull and take you back to the greatest era of dirt track the 60s and early 70s when flat track was king.  It would have been better to hear Dick Mann, Gene Romero, and Jim Rice interviewed, but maybe they didn't want to. I hated to see it end.",1071446400,,427,4.059523809523809
1091009,4,6305903212,"Henderson in Nevada, you missed the point. ""RE"" is the key word here.  What I hoped and expected; the young crazy kids, grown up and now grandfathers as they hash over old times. They're in their 50's and 60's even.  They all looked terrific; still good pals, which just goes to prove the sport is for real. Malcom Smith and Jim Rice weren't featured and I was looking forward to seeing them. If you weren't around back in '71 to appreciate the original release, or you didn't ride; you probably won't appreciate this. WE were involved and my husband died since then; so it was like going home. Odom, Bugsy, Dave Aldana, Kenny Roberts, Mert Lawwill, Palmgren, Nixon, Gene Romero; if these names don't sound familiar, don't bother.  It's exactly what the title says; ""REVISITED""; IF YOU WEREN'T THERE THE FIRST TIME, YOU CAN'T ""RE"" VISIT anyplace.  I did hope to see some Widow Maker in Utah, how many people have made the top since.  Teeth clenching ""endo's"" that would kill most. I'm happy with it; just too short. Death of one rider; sad,  but can we say ""UNEXPECTED?"" I think not, since when you see some of the accidents left out of the original; you should know why.",989193600,9,1171,4.578947368421052

7897917,5,6305903212,I purchased this video as a gift for my husband. Being an avid On Any Sunday fan it was a necessary purchase so he could have the whole series. This was nicely done and covered all forms of motorcycle racing today. You will not be disappointed.,1425081600,,244,4.326086956521739
7897918,3,6305903212,"maximus  I was hoping to see more of just America's love affair with the motorcycle.  Vietnam, Africa, didn't interest me at all.... What about Sturgis? A million plus people have been visiting the rally every year for nearly 75 years!  Dakar rally?  and how the heck can you not even mention the Baja 1000!!
