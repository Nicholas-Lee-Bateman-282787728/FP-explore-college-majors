8430264,5,B004I8LW2A,My brother gave me this DVD and CD when I was pregnant and I would put the music next to my belly so the baby could hear the beautiful music and spiritual words.  She would always move around when she heard it!  Now that she is born and 2 months old I play the CD and it always calms her down. I can't wait until she is a lttle older to watch the DVD. This DVD is amazing and puts a smile on my face.  It is fun and cheerful. kids and parents will love dancing to the music togther. Great for bonding.,1302307200,,501,3.8446601941747574
8430265,5,B004I8LW2A,"We are a family of picky people.  I (the mom) really try to choose products for my daughter that are positive, eco-friendly, educational, etc.  My friend calls it conscious parenting.  Well, I am good with that title, and I feel this DVD is perfect to have my daughter watch.  So here are my pluses:

The DVD is beautiful.  It has a bunch of stars and hearts and twinklies, and beautiful imagery that matches each song title.  Which by the way, the DVD follows the same songs as the CD that they have out by the same name (which I also highly recommend - got it in the car at all times).

It makes babies and kids smile.  Sounds small, but there is nothing more gratifying than seeing my daughter genuinely love a toy.  What I mean is, she gets gifts and toys and plays with it once and forgets all about it.  But with this, I am not kidding you, she asks to watch this DVD everyday!  And, honestly I don't mind. In fact, I love it.  We are not big fans at all of kids watching television, but this is different.  The positive lyrics and message they are trying to get across, that's what I want to teach my daughter about.  Each chapter is titled something positive - compassion, beauty, love, gratitude, spirit, peace.  11 total.

The songs are wonderful.  Even for us adults.  I find myself humming the songs off the video and CD almost everyday.  My favorites are Blessed, Compassion, and Beauty.

I only have one minus: it would be so great to have this kind of video for adults.  The positive messages and beautiful melodies are like daily affirmations, and how cool would that be for adults to hear everyday.  The Baby in Bliss DVD I'd say is wonderful for the under 6 set. And, as a parent, it is more than entertaining for me.  There are some DVDs my daughter loves that I am glad when they're over because they are boring for me, or annoying.  Baby in Bliss is definitely not boring or annoying for me at all. (Read another plus: great for parents to sit through, too.)

So, I highly recommend this DVD for all you conscious parents out there, as well as parents who wants their babies and kids to learn about love, compassion, gratitude, and all the rest.  And grandparents, awesome gift to give, I think.",1294963200,,2216,4.407407407407407
