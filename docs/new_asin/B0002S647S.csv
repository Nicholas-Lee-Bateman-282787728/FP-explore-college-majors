2116478,4,B0002S647S,I enjoyed Midsomer Murders when it was on TV and enjoyed finding so many more then I knew about.  I suggest anyone who likes this show to get all the volumes.,1203984000,,158,4.096774193548387
2116479,5,B0002S647S,I am a big fan of all the Midsomer Murder series.  I like each and every one that I have.,1202774400,,89,3.45
2116480,5,B0002S647S,As great as the rest cds.  No real hard violence in any part of the series. I do recommend the very highly.,1187913600,,107,3.8636363636363638
2116481,5,B0002S647S,"Earns the same high standard of excellence common in this entire series. Plots are good, complex and have a plethera of murders to keep one riveted. If you think you've picked out the ""who dunnit"",think again. Barnaby will pull the wool over your eyes, as usual! The English countryside back drop throughout this series is very beautiful. You'll never go wrong with any one set from the series. In fact, once bitten, you'll become an addict!",1173916800,4,441,4.815789473684211
2116482,5,B0002S647S,"Delightful imaginary villages (probably mostly filmed in Surrey) are rocked by series of murders always solved by Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby (who never looses his cool)with the help of his assistant Troy who is a terrible driver.  The dialogue is pleasant, the relationship between the main detective and his assistant is that of kindly master and pupil, the detective work is interspersed with clues, so you can (maybe) guess the culprit, and the scenery is delightful.  What more could you want of a detective series?  I also love the eery theme tune.

It has no intellectual pretensions, like a Morse might.  It has no really fast action, like an MI5 has.  It is not complicated like the CSIs. It is not as funny as a Rumpole. It does have some 'ancient history' of characters, like some Agatha Christies. Only drawback: sensitive souls (esp. children) might be a little shocked by some of the gruesome murder scenes - not that you see much of them at all.  All in all, a very civilized detective.

In case you are looking for particular episodes, the episodes in this series are: Tainted Fruit, Ring out your Dead (featuring villages Church Bell Ringing competition), Murder on St Malley's Day (featuring an English private school),Market for Murder (about a lady's reading group), and A Worm in the Bud.",1168300800,10,1315,4.891891891891892
2116483,5,B0002S647S,"After a couple of box sets of CSI, it is so wonderful to be watching Inspector Barnaby deal with murders that involve more ratiocination than chemical reaction.  After peering at corpses in various states of disassembly it is great to see only the occasional shot of stage blood-- although Murder on St. Malley's Day has one truly grusome moment that can cause you to drop your popcorn!

Snobbery and felony keep things going at a ively clip on Barnaby's patch.",1128643200,5,461,4.75
2116484,5,B0002S647S,"Every now and then I do something I regret, and one thing I did recently was to give away all my earlier purchases of the Midsomer Murder sets #1 and #2 on DVD.  True, I had a good cause to support and they sold well, but I ended up repurchasing the earlier sets as well as sets 3 and 4 which we have just finished viewing for the first time. That's how much I enjoy this series it is worth repurchasing and we will watch it more than once.

I've noticed the stories in Set #4 as more violent than I remember Sets #1 or Set #2. However, that could be the type of murder - lots of blood. All these murders are ""hands on"" so to speak, and one episode ""Ring out your Dead"" of Set #4 is a particularly violent tale involving a set of bell ringers (shades of the `Nine Tailors') preparing to compete in a local bell-ringing contest. Have they been done in by the competition? Or, does someone in their own village have a grudge against them? Gemma Jones serves as a local historian who soon sheds light on the mystery.

If you recall the A&E version of `Pride and Prejudice' you will soon recognize one of the book club members in `Market for Murder' as the overbearing Aunt of Mr Darcy (and the justice of the peace who married the lead characters in 'As Time Goes By').

Dectective Barnaby (John Nettles) and Sgt. Troy (Daniel Casey) are likeable policemen who always have something going on in their personal lives that makes its way into the tale, whether it be Barnaby's wife's latest recipe or Troy's latest love interest.

One of the things I like best in addition to the mysteries that often baffle me until the end is the appearance of favorite British character actors.  The other is that all the stories are shot on location in England making the series is eye candy for Anglophiles.",1104192000,31,1789,4.373493975903615
2116485,5,B0002S647S,"Many of you might have watched ""Midsomer Murders"" over the commercial-ridden A&E channel and have joined millions on both sides of the Atlantic in becoming devoted fans. For you, good news. Acorn Media has issued the fourth set that includes five more episodes in a boxed set of 5 DVDs.

 Briefly, the first story ""Tainted Fruit"" is about the death of an old man through the alleged negligence of the young and sexy landlady. ""Ring Out Your Dead"" is a Dorothy Sayers-type tale of bell ringers, but this time about their being killed off. ""Murder on St. Malley's Day"" tells about a sinister elite Club in a strange school. ""Market for Murder"" finds some ladies secretly doing very well on the stock market, too well perhaps. Finally, ""A Worm in the Bud"" centers around a suicide note sent by e-mail after the body has been found.

 I found the first two series just a little less striking, a little more low-key, than those I have raved about in the Wimsey, Poirot and Miss Marple series. I added that ""Midsomer Murders"" seems a recycling of the Inspector Morse series but without that character's idiosyncrasies. But by the third series, I found myself  pretty hooked on the show, and although I find the plots extremely complex, that will make you want to view them at least a second time. But that is the point in owning recordings.

 I should interject here that some television series are rich and enjoyable enough to deserve repeated viewings: Poirot for its humor and period settings, Marple for its characters, Wimsey for all three of those elements, and now ""Midsomer Murders"" for the reasons stated.

 John Nettles plays Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby with a droll sense of humor that is most appealing and most of his ongoing problems in the early episodes stem from his job's keeping him away from his lovely wife (Jane Wymark) and daughter (Laura Howard). His sidekick, Sergeant Troy (Daniel Casey) is simply Barnaby's sidekick but there is a humorous interplay between them.

 And it is very good to see that gorgeous English scenery with its old inns and the like. Oh yes, and very minimal foul language, but some unnecessary nudity of the ""we may do it so we must do it"" variety in the third series adds nothing to the quality of the show. Still I can highly recommend all four series.",1096070400,62,2303,4.7182044887780545

2116491,4,B0002S647S,This is the last of the character Troy who I believe is the perfect opposite of John Nettles character.  These stories are the same type of mystery stories.  They are mysteries so it does take time to figure out the killer.  I probably won't continue the series.,1411430400,,262,4.531914893617022

All five discs worked fine and I had no problem with them. Received the set as promised. I recommend these mysteries, as well as all other Midsomer Murder sets, to anyone that likes a great mystery and doesn't have a lot of sex or blood to space out the story.

2116503,1,B0002S647S,Check your prior purchases of this edition - I too have these episodes in set two - why would Acorn Media issue two different sets with the same segments in them - a real pain in the butt,1378166400,,187,3.9473684210526314

Especially like the ones that include his character wife,along with their charater daughter.... and the episode with the daughter's boyfriend who went with Callie's dectective father on a case at the museum. This character added so much.. Seemed like the perfect match for Callie.",1373500800,,418,5.161764705882353
2116506,5,B0002S647S,The British seem to have a way with mysteries that very few Americans have.  My husband and I are very fond of the Nidsomer Mysteries and the sets are (at least in our pinion) the BEST WAY to get then and have them where we can watch them whenever we wish.,1372636800,,256,4.019607843137255

2116514,5,B0002S647S,I love the stories in this set.  I love seeing the English countryside and listening to their speech.  Sometimes I can't understand some of the actors so I have to rewind and play it again.,1360800000,,189,4.371428571428571
2116515,3,B0002S647S,"This video is a great confidence booster for dancing with veil.  I liked it because unlike other precise veil instruction, Shoshanna lets us know that it is OK to fail the veil or break the mould.  Although not in great depth, she explains how to get out of the mess, but the main message is to just have confidence.
I loved how she had helpers, using different veils and the dvd navigation is great.

Shoshanna comes across as a very beautiful person, but I gave 3 stars because a lot of the moves were the standard ones that are shown on most veil instruction dvds. Though the dvd did incorporate a couple of different moves, I feel this dvd could have been above the everyday stuff and thus to be used as an extra learning technique.
Disappointing that such a unique dancer spent so much time on the standard.

By the way, I found the dvd producer's cheeky girls logo very disturbing so no more stuff from them.",1360540800,,914,4.4226190476190474

2116517,5,B0002S647S,"Ever since I discovered this show by accident on PBS, I've been hooked. This is more of a cozy mystery series. As with the other episodes of this series, this series makes the viewer think about it. You have to watch it in order to guess who the killer is. There are five episodes in this series and every one is worthwhile. in fact, I have no problem in recommending this set to others. this is a worthwhile show to watch; a great set of episodes to add to your collection of British television and/or British mysteries and/or mysteries in general. Overall, a worthwhile purchase, especially if you get a great price.",1358899200,,618,4.526785714285714

I hooked up a new DVD player last night, and had absolutely no problem opening the contents of the DVD.  With my apology, the problem was totally my DVD player, and no problem with the seller.

As to Midsommer Murders itself, I have found the series excellent, and the sites chosen for filming to be delightful.  While the murders are often extreme and horrifying (not shown, but more suggested), the pursuit of the murderer is much more cerebral.",1350691200,,619,4.694444444444445

The information on this DVD is exceptionally well organized, beautifully presented and easy to navigate. I love the way the dancers use many different size and weight veils, so that you can see the differences in the veil movements.  The veil tips are very useful, and at all times Shoshanna comes across as an excellent teacher with a warm personality.
The veil combinations section is very easy to follow, with the dancers again using both 3 and 4 year veils.
Shoshanna's stunning performance in full costume to beautiful Ladino music at the end of this DVD is ""the cherry on the top"".  Buy it!!!",1276646400,2,778,4.656934306569343

We love the gorgeously filmed country side and cottages. The mild-mannered ineptitude of Inspector Barnaby and the cluelessness of the insensitive Sargent Troy result in some witty dialogue.

  It is a great DVD. She covers moves of varying degrees of difficulty, and teaches some of the moves that even my teacher ( of 30 years of dancing), couldn't do.
  Another priceless thing is covering different yards and sizes of veils, and how they move. I realized that a four yard veil is probably best for me, and I have been using the wrong one for years.
  Shoshanna is down to earth, interesting, and a real artist. If you have any interest in the veil this DVD won't dissappoint you.",1239580800,2,745,4.4411764705882355

2116545,5,B0002S647S,"I enjoyed this DVD more than I thought I would.  I do a lot of work with veil and this helped me to break out of a rut.  In addition to teaching me some new moves and concepts, it helped me to look at my veil a little differently and be more creative.  Now when performing, I am a lot more spontaneous and I don't have to rely on go-to moves.

In addition to discussing different fabrics and shapes, Shoshanna and her students demonstrate the moves with different veils and she touches on the different results in her explanations.  The trouble shooting is also extremely helpful and takes some of the stress out of it.

If you work with veil, you should check out this DVD.",1229990400,6,674,4.309523809523809
2116546,5,B0002S647S,"My husband & I are continuing to collect the Midsomer Murder mysteries.  The Best of the Best.  With mostly slop on T.V., this series has kept us watching T.V. & sleuthing. I just hope it continues for seasons to come.",1224201600,,218,4.425
2116547,5,B0002S647S,"Shoshanna offers a wealth of knowledge for dancers of all levels. The Technique section starts off with basic veil manipulations and then moves on to gradually more complex movements. Shoshanna explains everything very well and readily shares her vast knowledge.

Apart from the technique section there are sections on warmup, veil advice, troubleshooting, 2 practice sessions and a lovely performance. I like the fact that Shoshanna and her fellow dancers frequently change veils as this gives you the opportunity to see veils of different textures, shapes and colours in action.

The chaptering on this DVD is excellent; you can skip from one movement to the next (whereas on other veil DVDs you have to fastforward through a chapter to get to a particular movement). It is a well thought of DVD that I can highly recommend to anybody who is serious about learning more about veil work.

Another great DVD by Cheeky Girls Productions!",1221868800,4,936,5.064935064935065
2116548,5,B0002S647S,"The midsomer murder series, is the best! especially for those mystery movie watchers, that want to think and get invovled with the mystery, and not just be a mindless watcher. All the actors are superb, and we love John Nettles.  thank you  jack stamper  9-16-08",1221523200,,262,4.777777777777778
2116549,5,B0002S647S,"In this video, Shoshanna has explained everything well,  using
different analogies to illustrate what she's doing.  To assist her are
two other dancers using  different types and sizes of veils so you can
see how differently each veil behaves. For the more complex moves, the
veil is dropped so you can focus fully on the move itself and see what
you need to do. With each move taught, Shoshanna gives tips and tricks
and talks about timing and moving through space with your veil. She
also touches on which veil she thinks works well with the move she is
teaching.

There is a troubleshooting section in which Shoshanna talks about what
you need to do to prevent and get out of mistakes. She gives advice on
getting comfortable with your veil. And she advises you to actually
practice mess ups and learn when to just let go of the veil.

After the technique section there are 2 combination's using everything you have learned. The music that she has chosen to use is very likable and suited for using a veil. At the end Shoshanna does a lovely performance with her 4 yard veil. The DVD is 1 hour and 20 minutes long.

I feel that this DVD is reasonably priced and that I will enjoy
working with it.",1219881600,20,1199,4.477064220183486
2116550,5,B0002S647S,I really enjoyed watching this DVD.  It was both informative and fun to watch.  Shoshanna has a great personality and was able to demonstate her veil technique without being at all confusing or long winded.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to improve their veil skills.,1219795200,8,296,4.764705882352941
2116551,5,B0002S647S,"Though Shoshanna does teach with a 4-yard veil (and give tips about handling long veils), the information on this DVD can be used with a variety of veils, as demonstrated by her assistants, who follow along using shorter ones, or circular ones.

The DVD is well structured and chaptered. It includes a warm up (with concentration on warming up the shoulders, arms and wrists); a description of veils of different sizes, shapes and materials; four basic moves, nine intermediate ones and three more difficult ones; troubleshooting tips; two combination sequences basically to provide practice with transitions; and group and solo performances. Information is provided about the music she uses.

Shoshanna is very comfortable in front of the camera and gives clear and complete instructions. If you're interested in veil work, you should definitely add this DVD to your collection.",1219536000,14,879,5.316546762589928
