3964521,1,B002PFMXOY,This DVD sucked!!! I know it was recorded off the tv but you could have least had it in HD or if you couldn't get it in HD at least have all of the MJ Memorial not just sections of the tv special.,1255910400,7,196,3.5813953488372094
3964522,1,B002PFMXOY,"Do not be fooled, if you're looking for a professional recording with superior video and audio quality this video is not for you, 'm going to go out on a limb and say this a copy of a television recording, the first clue MSNBC banner across the screen, the second, the label taped to the disk.  I skipped through  the playlist (yes there's a playlist), got as far as the 3rd performance: (1) Jennifer Hudson, the video quality was, at best, mediocre. (2) Usher's image was fuzzy or pixelated, and the video froze in some places and; (3) the picture was so dark I heard Stevie Wonder's voice before I saw him, and when the camera zoomed in, the picture was fuzzy and the audio got choppy, and that's when I gave up and went to my account to process a return.

Had I been home to record it, I would gave gotten a better video/audio quality from my VCR that's over 5 years old at EP speed!  If you're going to sell copies of recording at least make the source material HD and even more importantly, full disclosure - let your customers know what they are getting.

3964524,3,B002PFMXOY,"I was not happy with this video because it wasn't the full memorial from start to finish. It showed various artist from the memorial and their tribute songs and the speeches from Al sharpton, brooke shields,etc.. But the best performance smile by jermaine jackson was not in this video. This is his brother for god sakes and I cant believe he was excluded from this video. I sent the dvd back and I will try to find another in its full length fom beginning to end. I was also disappointed with the quality of some of the songs they were fuzzy, especially mariah carey (I'll be there).",1251849600,23,584,4.4672897196261685
3964525,1,B002PFMXOY,"The picture is terribly rough that you could hardly tell it's Michael Jackson!  Copied DVD,  maybe?  I was surprised that Amazon sells this kind of thing!",1251244800,16,154,4.846153846153846
3964526,1,B002PFMXOY,"Extremely poor I want a refund...poor quality, hardly can make out thier faces and the music doesn't even follow his mouth...looks like someone downloaded it off the internet. The picture on the dvd itself is cheap crappy paper. It won't even play correctly. I am really dissapointed the someone would make this just to profit off of his death. Don't know how they can live with themselves. I don't reccommend anyone else buying this,[...]",1251244800,19,439,4.945945945945946

The product cover and title were misleading. I bought this product believing that it contains Michael Jackson's stage performances. The DVD, however, carries just one live-performance song and rest of the DVD comprises of Michael Jackson's music videos (all of which is already available with me, as part of other MJ Albums, Collections).

The quality of recording is not upto the mark. The packaging does not give it a factory-produced DVD look and feel.",1305936000,,637,6.571428571428571
3964529,2,B002PFMXOY,"Don't purchase if you expect a full version of the Memorial Service.  Really wish I had not erased the taping of the service as this ""professional"" copy did not include the most moving scenes and was clearly taped from television!

Oh, but if the Jackson family would simply agree to the beautiful service being shown again!!!",1283472000,2,326,4.803571428571429
3964530,2,B002PFMXOY,I was expecting the same program that had been televised originally however this edition was more like a jackleg version and not a very good jackleg version at that.,1280361600,,165,4.724137931034483

3964532,1,B002PFMXOY,"As an advent admirer of MJ,I was very disappointed in this bootleg copy of Michael's Memorial. My VCR won't play poor quality bootlegs well. It kept freezing and skipping. Unfortunatly other matters were pressing so I missed the deadline for a return. I will wait until Sony or someone professional release copy of The Memorial to add to my collection. Shame on You.",1277251200,2,366,4.825396825396825
3964533,5,B002PFMXOY,This is the best video but could of use more off the TV set when I watched it but other than that this is great video for the price and for the movie it was just all that if you are a michael jackson fan this is the one to watch it was just great of his death if you didn't see it yet....thanks,1272240000,,294,3.609375
3964534,3,B002PFMXOY,"I was a little disappointed with DVD. The opening choir hymn(Going to See the King) was missing; and I feel that is really unfortunate because it was a really moving segment that contained the arrival of Michael's casket to the event.  Also the video quality wasn't all that great, it is obvious that this is not a professional DVD.",1267315200,7,332,4.627118644067797

3964536,1,B002PFMXOY,"Do NOT purchase this item. It is bootlegged off of the MJ History Videos on DVD. It skips, stays still where I had to push the dvd foward key, played music while a sitting picture was there, without a video. This is BOOTLEGGED.... Horrible. This person needs to get into trouble for promoting piracy.
I was watching for less than two minutes before I noticed it was not quality. Also, the DVD itself had a sticker label on it. Not ligitimate. JUNK.
A few days later, I purchased the actual MJ History Video on DVD at a local record store. Superior and cheaper than this other junk.",1260835200,12,581,4.4392523364485985
3964537,3,B002PFMXOY,I  thought this was nice to help remember Michael's life and legacy. It still makes me cry everytime I watch it..though it was not formatted well. It's amazing the things Michael was able to accomplish in the short time he was with us..though he was not given the praise he so well deserved here on earth. the good lord is making up for it in heaven.. rest in peace Michael.,1260230400,11,374,4.3428571428571425
