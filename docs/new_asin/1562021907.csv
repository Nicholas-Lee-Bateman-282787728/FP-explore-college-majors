183309,5,1562021907,"This is an amazingly real story, so well acted and directed.  The characters are all so natural.  I love this film because it tells a TRUTH about the actual cost of mining.  The location is beautifully photographed here in Canada on the East Coast.  This is a must see for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful and genuine story about life.",1113523200,5,333,4.5
183310,4,1562021907,"Margaret's Museum is an endearing story about a mining community in Nova Scotia as seen through the eyes of a young woman named Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter).  It is a coming of age story at the same time a journey across the various facets of an isolated social landscape.  The town and its people are all owned by the company.  The men spend their lives underground chipping away at coal.  In the midst of all of this people find love and heartbreak and dream of better things.

If you are reading this review you must see Margaret's Museum but be warned that Seville Pictures in Canada exercised the poorest judgment deciding to release this in full screen format and with a passionate sex scene omitted.  These bad decisions are inexcusable and hurt the integrity of this film across the board.  I hope they will reconsider this and rerelease it as it was meant to be viewed.  It baffles me that such things were even considered.  This is a cinematic gem and speaks to issues of cultural preservation, workers rights, poverty and romance.  Intelligently writen and masterfully acted, this haunting tale will stay with you and stand out among other great films.",1108080000,23,1166,4.756218905472637
183311,3,1562021907,"&#65279;Margaret MacNeil is a woman living on Canada's east coast in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia during the turn of the century.  Glace Bay is a coal-mining town, and Margaret knows the horrors of the mines.  Her father and brother were both killed in mining accidents, and her grandfather's lungs are completely ruined by working with coal for years.  From such experiences, Margaret hates the coals mines and vows never to get involved with a man who works with coal.  That is hard to do, when all the town's employment opportunities exist in the mines.
Margaret marries a dishwasher, Neil Curry, and begins her life as a married woman.  Though they are poor, they are also happy.  However, within their first year as a married couple Neil is fried from his job at a Chinese restaurant, and forced to find work in the mines.  Margaret, upset by his new career, leaves her husband--a man who once vowed never to work the mines again.  She eventually forgives him, as he was left with no choice, as Glace Bay had few employment opportunities.  Meanwhile, Margaret's 16 year old brother dropped out of school and got a job in the mines too.
Margaret's life is turned upside down, as her uncle gets arrested for causing a fire in the company store after finally realizing how he has been exploited by his employer for years.  Not long after, a rockslide in the mines kills her brother and husband.  Distracted by the sirens of emergency, she ran to the mine, where she learned of the death to her loved ones.  During this time, her grandfather died in his bed because Margaret was not home to hit his back during cough attacks caused by miner's lung.
The following is unbelievable, as she removes her dead brother's genitalis, husband's fingers and grandfather's lungs.  She then displayed those body parts at her home as a reminder of the horror of the mines.
After being in a mental institution for a couple of years, Margaret is freed.  She comes home and is confronted by her mother, who disowns Margaret and Glace Bay.  Margaret goes to the half-built home that her husband began after they had got engaged.  She turns her home to a museum, to preserve the memory of her family while living in utter isolation.",982454400,18,2208,4.681347150259067
183336,1,1562021907,The story line was fatalistic with too much sexual emphasis in the plot.  The plot direction was pretty predictable except for the extra sick result at the end.  I like the actors - but this was not their best showing.,1379462400,,218,4.425
183337,1,1562021907,"Was very dissapppointed that it arrived to the USA in a British Format which we can't view on our DVD players here. The supplier refused a refund but fortunatley, Amazon stepped in to the rescue!

It's a cult classic which is very difficult to find, so I was quite dissappointed and stil searching for it!",1363737600,,305,4.545454545454546

183339,5,1562021907,"This is the story of a woman who loses the men she loves (her father & her husband) to the coal mines.  Most of the story is nice, but then the end comes with a grisly twist - I won't spoil it for you.  The love story of the husband & wife is really beautiful & haunting.  You really get to know Margaret.  Superbly acted & so well done.  When I saw it had come on DVD I HAD to have it !  It is something that really stays with you.  You will never forget Margaret.",1357344000,,465,3.78125

183342,5,1562021907,"Great portrayal of Cape Breton's coal mining history, although the movie cut short one of the main themes of the story-unionism. The movie keeps well to the book, ""The Glace Bay Miner's Museum"" & Helena Bonham Carter does well in her part of  the unusual character, Margaret. Clive Russell is wonderful in his role of Margaret's husband. I recommend this little known (to the U.S.) movie & also the book. Excellent Canadian entertainment !!!",1288656000,6,441,4.95945945945946
183343,4,1562021907,Be warned! The most memorable opening scene from this film is not on the DVD. How bizarre to cut a visually stunning scene that is pivotal to Margaret's character. Watch out for anything presented by Seville Pictures and Mort Ransen. They do not understand their own product. So much for co-productions.,1241913600,,303,4.96078431372549
183344,5,1562021907,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's definitely quirky, dark humor, but Helena Bonham Carter is a perfect character. The soundtrack is full of Celtic (mostly Scottish/Cape Breton) music, that is a reason alone to get the movie.

Any Monty Python, Terry Gilliam fans should enjoy this.",1190246400,5,296,4.92
183345,4,1562021907,"Let's Go to Antigonish
""Margaret's Museum is a quirky little independent Canadian film made over 10 years ago, featuring an impressive performance by Helena Bonham Carter (trying to do something other than English period pieces) as the title character. Carter is one of the most talented contemporary actresses and her failure to become a major star is a bit of a puzzle.

The film's obscurity is not such a puzzle, it contains just enough wry humor and off-kilter behavior to offend those who take its political message seriously and not enough to become a cult classic. The producers should have amped up the weirdness level a bit.

It will remind viewers of ""New Waterford Girl"", not just because both were filmed in Nova Scotia, but because the heroines are similar as is the theme of diminished small town expectations. It is probably safe to say that these are the only feature films that reference the town of Antigonish.

Gaelic lovers should especially enjoy ""Margaret's Museum as it includes a lot of traditional music. If you are a Scotsman at heart you will pick up on obscure references to things like The Battle of Culloden"" (i.e. Bonnie Prince Charlie 1746).

Margaret MacNeil lives with her widowed mother in a small company town in Nova Scotia (1949 judging by the cars). The economy revolves around the coal mine and the story has all the ""I owe my soul to the company store"" elements (''Sons and Lovers'' and ''The Molly Maguires'' are unfunny examples). Margaret's father and older brother were killed in the mine and her grandfather is barely able to breathe after years of working in ""the pit"". The broken nature of the family and the cause are symbolized by their house, once a duplex the other unit was destroyed when a portion of the tunnel underneath collapsed.

Margaret falls in love with and marries Neil Currie (Clive Russell), at least in part because he has quit mining work for good. Neil is a giant of a man who incessantly plays the bagpipes, speaks in the Gaelic dialect, drinks a lot, and composes traditional tunes. Of course with all the emphasis on Neil staying out of the mines you just know that he will eventually go back to work there. There is a coming of age side story about Margaret's younger brother Jimmy (Craig Olejnik), but it is given too little emphasis to be much of a factor. It does introduce a bit of irony as Jimmy is expected to be the family member who breaks the mold and escapes, but his first love makes him reluctant to leave the town for better things.

Kate Nelligan plays Margaret's deservedly fatalistic mother and creates a complex character. Watch how this hardened woman occasionally exhibits a ray of optimism and even a slight bit of hope for her daughter.

 The title refers to Margaret's ""Cost of Coal"" museum which she opens as an expression righteous indignation. The museum sequences bookend the main story (told in a long flashback).

If not on the perfection level of ""New Waterford Girl"", the fine performances and the excellent production design make ""Margaret's Museum"" well worth watching.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1153958400,4,3121,4.784386617100372

7796296,5,1562021907,"I know this is an older picture from back in the late 1990s, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Helena Bonham Carter was excellent in her role as Margaret and was supported by an excellent cast. The bagpipe music was wonderful and the song Michael sang to Margaret was hauntingly beautiful. It was a sad story about a mining community and the devastations that occurred there. It's a timeless story so it's just a good period piece.

7796301,5,1562021907,"From startled beginning to insane end - this movie had me. Bonham Carter's character is so true to life convincing, which is a bit alarming considering the plot. Her alluring nonchalancy hides inner strengths (and intestinal fortitude) that few could muster in order to deal with things so hauntingly sad and/or appallingly untasteful. Just depends on which side the perspective coin lands.",1389571200,,390,5.306451612903226
7796302,4,1562021907,"Chose 4-stars because it is a chick-flick and I'm not a chick.  Having said that, the story is good enough and quirky enough to keep a guy's attention.  The scenery is awesome, makes me want to visit Cape Breton.  Clive Russel does a good job as the husband, in an understated-by-design performance.  Let's face it, Helena Bonham Carter would be sexy standing neck-deep in a septic tank!  She makes it much easier for us guys to enjoy any movie.  My view of her performance (Awesome!) might be skewed by my physical attraction to her, but I don't think so.  She's just great.",1386892800,,575,4.578431372549019
