8086909,5,B000BI5LH8,"I have been watching this show, or rather watching FOR it, since I first saw a Tina episode some years ago. The schedule changed shortly after and it always seems I'm busy or not at home when it airs. I did find a used Tina set but never the others. I am so happy to have found this because when I do find it on PBS,  it's usually one of the few shows I have seen on a re-run. I love the show and the scenery. I hope to be able to visit Scandinavia someday. It's truly beautiful. The food looks pretty good, too!",1425254400,,512,3.923076923076923

8086911,5,B000BI5LH8,"I saw some of the episodes when they were originally aired.  What a great series.  If you enjoy Scandanavia at all, these episodes will do if for you, the scenery and history are spectacular. There is a wide variety of foods explored, that's what makes it appealing.  Lots of sea food, potatoes, and aquavit!  From doing some fish in a fisherman's shack in sub zero temeratures, to going back to Andreas's families summer retreat out in the country.  Lots of interesting foods and places. I agonized about buying the DVDs for weeks, very glad that I did. I love Emeril and Mario B, this is way different!",1159315200,18,604,4.607476635514018
