8364076,4,B002CJVRSQ,"Despite the titles of the songs on the screen not matching the actual songs in the second half of the DVD, overall DVD was very enjoyable with a lot of close-ups of Yngwie's guitar playing.

The only disappointment was that the last song which was supposed to be Jet To Jet was replaced with a classic rock'n roll song.",1277683200,2,319,4.406779661016949
8364077,4,B002CJVRSQ,"Yngwie looks and plays superb.  The only complaint I have is Graham Bonnet.  He looks and sings like a jackass!  Nevertheless, if you are a guitar freak, yngwie will blow your mind.  I think he was 20 when this was filmed.  Picture and sound are great (from official Japanese laser disc).  A must see for Yngwie's early genius.",1251158400,2,327,4.551724137931035
8364078,2,B002CJVRSQ,"I purchase this DVD from Amazon and to my surprise it does not come with a cover.

this DVD was produced in Brazil and it is a COPY from the Videolaser released in Japan. Although audio & video are great, just be aware that this IS NOT an OFFICIAL RELEASE.

When I complained to the seller that there was no cover, he advised me that that was specified in the condition notes, but CONDINTION NOTES only appear when you click BUY it. it does not appear when you see the advertised item at amazon at first, which is a shame in my opinion. anyway, my bad luck. I should have paid more attention to this detail. so my question is, why to advertise the item WITH THE COVER from the laserdisc ???

but, if you don't care with packaging, this has good image and audio transfered from the Videolaser but I DO THINK AMAZON SHOULD NOT SELL PIRACY MATERIAL LIKE THIS.
