3512058,5,B001CFEBVQ,"Before watching the TV series I would recommend that you read the books first as it fills in some information that the TV series fails to tell you (and has lead many a person to think the series 'weird').

Based on the first novel of the Emily series written by L.M. Montgomery, Emily of New Moon, I felt that while there were difference with the book, the cast were fantastic - I laugh every time poor Perry is demanded by Aunt Elizabeth to come into the kitchen! That scene was bought to life from the novels. Humour aside, the cast really are great, in particular the child actors - Kris Lemche, Shawn Roberts and Martha McIssac are just perfect for their roles.

It's not faithful to the books, but stands firmly on its own as being a good series.",1226534400,8,751,4.39568345323741

I am a big fan of ""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Road to Avonlea"", ""Little House on the Prairie"", ""Pollyanna-BBC-Version-movie"" (though Disney is good too) ""Christie"" was ok.

This series has the outward look of other good period series, but that is all. Simply not interesting. Good-scripts and good-casting are critical, and this series has everything else but. No character-actors.

Women and dudes from Boston may find it pleasing to look at.",1226016000,7,476,5.076923076923077

3512061,1,B001CFEBVQ,"i know movies/shows are never as good as teh books, but i could not be more dissapointed in this show.  if you have actually ever read the books, don't get this because it will only piss you off.  the acting is horrible, the actors that were chosen comletely wrong for the part, and the writters took too much freedom with the story line.  in fact, i think there only about three or four stories that are actually in the book.  this show is like an older version of GHOST WHISPERER or MEDIUM.  if you never read the books, you might like, otherwise DON'T BUY IT!!! it will only frustrate you.  i wish somebody would do it right though.

The girl plays well.  But the story stinks;  dead people walking around in every episode who Emily emagines, I suppose.  This storyline has nothing to do with the books or with the feel which all the Sullivan films have.

3512064,5,B001CFEBVQ,"Aired from 1998-2000 and spanning four seasons
Based on Lucy Maud Montgomery's Novel, Emily of New Moon is the brilliant story of a free-spirited orphaned girl who's vivid imagination, passion to write, and romantic nature clash with her strict adoptive family.
I am an avid fan of period TV and movies so, when I stumbled on this show on cable while in my teens it was almost a given that I was going to enjoy it. But I had know idea then what a deep impression it would leave on me. I had heard of L.M. Montgomery and read Anne of Green Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea but had never heard of the Emily books so the series was completely new to me. and I was hooked, I watched as often as I could but the trouble was that the show's time slot Kept changing with the result that I often missed out, which was annoying because the show quickly became my favorite. Everything about it was wonderful, the casting/acting, the costumes and sets, the music especially the music. in short for me it was TV bliss. It wasn't all bad really, withdrawl symtoms from missing the show lead me to read the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emily-of-New-Moon-Emily-Novels/dp/055323370X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emily of New Moon (Emily Novels)</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emily-Climbs-Emily-Novels/dp/0553262149/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emily Climbs (Emily Novels)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emily-s-Quest-Emily-Novels/dp/0553264931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emily's Quest (Emily Novels)</a>&nbsp;which to this day are at the top of my list of The Best Books Ever.

Season one chronicles the first year of Emily's life at New Moon Farm, after the death of her father. As she battles and begins to win over spartan Aunt Elisabeth, brings light and laughter into the sheltered life of fragile, sweet Aunt Laura and finds a kindred spirit in cousin Jimmy who is anything but simple minded. Emily also finds out where the gift of her second sight comes from. We meet llse Burnley, Perry Miller, and Teddy Kent. who will play important roles in the rest of Emily's life, each in their own way.

Like all book to screen adeptations the series has it's detractors. some think that to many liberties were taken and that as the show went on it drifted further and further from the books. This is true, there where a lot of changes and additions not in the original meterial, but in my opinion these did not hurt the series but improved it. If the books had been followed exactly, I don't think the series would have survived long.

Over the years, I had lost hope that this wonderful but little known show would be released on dvd, so I'm overjoyed that Echo Bridge Entertainment has done so, and I can only hope that there are plans to release the next three season's. I can't recommend this series highly enough.",1222646400,82,4736,6.942953020134228

3512108,5,B001CFEBVQ,"This is a really great show. It is well acted, and well written. I am so surprised at the number of bad reviews it's gotten. People say that it's ""scary"" and ""dark."" One reviewer even went so far as to accuse the show of having bits in it about the occult. There is NOTHING related to the occult in Emily of New Moon. As far as the show being scary and dark, I really don't find it to be that way. I guess it's all about perspective. Emily is a girl who loves to write. Because of this, she has an overactive imagination. Yes, there are episodes where she ""sees"" dead people, but these scenes are not scary at all. I am the kind of person who can't watch anything with ghosts in it. In the movie theater I have to get up and leave the theater if a trailer for some supernatural movie comes on. That's how badly supernatural/ghost things affect me. Emily of New Moon didn't affect me at all. The ""ghosts"" are not scary. They are just people Emily imagines to be there. If you've seen the movie ""From Time to Time,"" Emily sees ghosts like the little boy did in the movie. It baffles me that people think this show is dark and frightening because that is just not true.

Please give this show a try and ignore the naysayers. It has a fantastic storyline and the actors really do an amazing job portraying their characters. You'll soon fall in love with them all from Emily, to Ilsa, to Perry, to Cousin Jimmy, to Aunt Laura, you won't want to say goodbye to them at the end of the fourth season.",1425686400,,1492,4.235087719298246

The costumes, the look of the houses, the interiors, fabrics, wallpaper, china, myriad details --- all very well done. And I loved the poignant portrayal of a little girl who wants with all her heart to be a writer, and will not be silenced no matter how often people try to do it.  The actress playing Emily is enchanting, but then the whole cast is excellent.  ----  I love that Emily is poetic by nature, and that she  sees ghosts and the ghosts are benign or helpful.  This did more than whet my appetite for the remaining seasons, and also for the Emily novels which I've ordered.  I cannot compare the series to the novels, as I have only just begun to read them.  I can say that  I found the series entertaining, delightful, engrossing and in some way soothing. I liked being in the world of the series.  I felt safe there.

3512159,1,B001CFEBVQ,"My mom and i have seen both this, and the 2nd season at Freddy's a few times, and as it was written by the same author that did Anne Of Green Gables decided to give it a try. (never read the books, but thoroughly enjoyed the Anne of Green Gables movie mini-series.)

So far, my mom and i have only made it through the first 3 episodes and it's disturbing.

To sum it up:

Emily learns this weird spirit ritual incantation stuff from her young indian friend, and while it's done in a 'cute' kid way, there's still something obviously wrong with it. When her father dies she refuses to leave and attempts to 'call on the spirits' to bring him back. When she's forced to move in with her relatives, (and leave her indian friend) she apparently gives up this incantation stuff, however from the very beginning of the show she sees and talks to the dead, and also to 'herself' in the mirror.

Emily's aunt Elizabeth is shown as being very cruel and intolerant to her niece, (and her niece's cat,) yet she claims to love and serve GOD, and is constantly throwing the Bible in Emily's face, so-to-speak. Of course some of her aunt's cruelness comes from past regrets, but it still leaves a bad impression of what Christianity is.

While Emily is portrayed as a spunky, nice, cute young girl (who yells too much), she is indeed a bit of a rebel, and this show leaves much to be desired. The music they picked for the show, fits the overwhelming ghostly creepiness of it, but is rather annoying. I find myself turning the volume down, during the music parts when there's no one talking.

After watching the first episode i had hopes the series would get better, but the only redeeming quality the 2nd and 3rd episodes have are Emily's other lovable relatives Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy. However i'm not sure 'redeeming' is quite the right way to describe it, considering they both fear Aunt Elizabeth, and respect her to her face, for the most part, yet they do things behind her back, to reach out to Emily.

The main characters are well thought out, and differ in their personalities, that they clash, yet meld together quite well. However, most of the minor characters are harsh and mean, so it only adds to the darkness of the show.

As a Christian, i find all the talking to the dead, and the spirit incantation stuff rather dark, creepy, and in fact, un-Biblical.

After having read all the reviews from others, i doubt this series will get any better, and will probably end up selling it back somewhere else, due to the fact that at Freddy's when trying to buy it, the system didn't even recognize it, so had to go to a ton of rigamarole just to buy it.

No, i would not, in a million years recommend it to others, but that is merely my opinion, and i'm sure others will disagree with that, but that's your opinion, and i respect it. We're all different. =D",1349913600,9,2856,4.464491362763916
3512160,2,B001CFEBVQ,"I love ghost stories, Gothic fiction, and supernatural thrillers.  I am the proud owner of all the black-and-white episodes of the old DARK SHADOWS serial.  In fact, while reading the novel EMILY OF NEW MOON recently, I couldn't help thinking how well it would adapt to a similar serialized treatment.  So, seeing this DVD set going for a nice low price, and hearing that it emphasized the Gothic/supernatural angle, I decided to ignore the negative reviews and give it a shot.

Well, I didn't like it either.  In fact, it took me forever to get through it.  (The first two episodes are particularly unwatchable).  Though the show improves once the heroine arrives at New Moon and the writers start following the book a LITTLE, it still falls far short of the book's standard and its own potential.

In the novel, Emily is a sensitive and artistic child who cannot help but clash with her Puritanical relatives, but who also has a strong sense of family honor and loyalty.  In the show, she is more often written as deliberately insolent or even nasty.  Her Aunt Elizabeth, in the novels, was upright and honest, trying to do her best with a child she simply didn't understand.  But this Elizabeth is an unprincipled hypocrite ruled by spite, who continually violates her own moral standards.  She steals mail, burns books that don't belong to her, abandons pets to die in the woods, and generally behaves like a witch in a fairy tale.  Attempts to ""humanize"" her are thus unconvincing, and more often involve knocking her down than portraying her strengths and virtues.

And this is the general trend of the series -- turning complex characters like Elizabeth into ludicrous Victorian caricatures, then shooting them down.  Our modern writers clearly feel plenty superior to these benighted 19th Century folks, and cannot stop rubbing it in for an instant.  But rather than being progressive, the ironic result of this approach is to turn once-strong female characters into sexist stereotypes.  ""Kindly"" Aunt Laura has become a cliche ""neurotic spinster"", with an unhealthy emotional dependency on Emily.  The ""good"" male characters (such as Jimmy and Mr. Carpenter) handle disagreements with women through bullying and intimidation, and we are meant to approve.  Jimmy actually seems about to get violent with a child at one point, till Emily stops him.  And Emily's perfectly nice friend Teddy has been turned into a junior masher of the dreamy-yet-dangerous variety.

Social issues of the time are addressed by showing some pathetic victim of prejudice ground under the boot of moustache-twirling WASP cliches.  A First Nations boy is introduced solely to be beaten and ridiculed, and then quickly written out.  The Murray's Catholic neighbor Lofty John Sullivan of the ""stately baring and fine manners"" is now a deranged semi-idiot, similarly treated.  Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura are raving bigots who imply that Catholics have horns and tails, with Laura reduced to ABJECT TERROR if the mild-mannered French priest stops by to chat.  And hired-boy Perry is now a complete illiterate from a criminal and abusive family: This was not true of Perry in the book (who if memory serves had been educated by his father while at sea), but it fits into a general tendency of this show to portray lower-class people as near-animals.

As you might have figured out already, this show places high value on hysterical melodrama.  Every time a child is criticized in school, she throws a fit and runs from the room.  One two-parter has Emily running hysterically out into the snow to Nearly Perish twice in as many DAYS.  Her father's death from consumption wasn't exiting enough.  So here, he dies after falling off a roof, a tragedy attended by so much screaming and wailing and so many ghostly apparitions that I couldn't feel the slightest emotional connection.

Other problems include 1) blatant plot stupidity (a major shipwreck occurs, and nobody but the shipping company knows about it till a decade later), 2) strained PClectures that get in the way of the story (""sex education good"", ""death penalty bad""), 3) lack of continuity between episodes (don't get me started), 4) drab and boring scenery, and 5) ghosts that just aren't spooky (we can tell they are ""ghosts"" because the actors wear weird colors, like turquoise).

It is a shame, because this could have been good quite easily.  On the rare occassions when it isn't trying too hard to be ""dramatic"", it can cast a lovely mood that draws you in.  The atmosphere and integrity of the source material is sometimes allowed to leak through, and several of the adult actors give honest, authentic performances.  The episode ""The Enchanted Doll"" is quite charming.  Even fast-forwarding my way through a ""second viewing"" of the atrocious Maida Flynn episode, I'd find myself stopping to enjoy little scenes: Emily with Laura in the attic, or walking with the French priest by the strand.  Little simple scenes that engage and enchant without even trying.  These good moments encouraged me to borrow later seasons from the library, in the hope that the show would grow to realize its potential.  Unfortunately, it is all downhill from here.",1311379200,9,5195,4.989547038327526

She hasn't even seen it all because she doesn't want to, while she has seen the Hallmark LHOP movie and the entire AOGG series dozens of times. From my point of view, the acting was really weak so it was very hard for me to watch with her (which I had to do because she was so frightened by the ghost scenes).

Going on the LUCY MAUDE MONTGOMERY name, and her wonderful writing of the ANNE OF GREEN GABLES books and Kevin Sullivan's triumphant video series, this series is dry and very slow-moving...my 8 yr. old lost interest almost immediately, compared to her hanging on every word of the Anne of Green Gables video series.

The child actors, I feel, were not very accomplished at all.

Like other reviewers, I found the series surprising and even unsettling as the characters have so many different tragedies to deal with. What is so wonderful about the series is that every episode is unpredictable, every character has his or her own challenge and the actors draw you in and you find yourself caring about them and cheering them on. In that way, this series is like Anne of Green Gables.  This series is truly original and entertaining, and I highly recommend it.",1284940800,,557,4.673469387755102

For that reason I recommend avoiding Emily of New Moon and avoiding Echo Bridge products all together.

In the first episode, she  endures an unfair beating from her school master for supporting an Indian child, whom the teacher says is worthless and verminous.  To top this off, the beginning of the series is confusing (why are Emily and her parents clinging to a sea cliff and crying?  Then, all of a sudden, they are in a cemetery and Emily's mother is dead).  The acting is very poor.  I am frankly puzzled by the 5 star reviews.

I am not a parent--if I was, I would not expose my children to this series.",1279584000,9,684,4.424
3512169,3,B001CFEBVQ,"I loved Anne of Green Gables.  When I found a series other reviewers recommended so highly I jumped at the chance to introduce my children to another of LM Montgomery's worlds.  Perhaps I did not read enough of the reviews.  As I re-read the reviews I find one that hints at what I wish had been more clear to me before my investment into watching this series.  There are some huge themes parents should be aware are in this TV series (1st season).

1) Emily sees ghosts.  They call it 'second sight' in the book, but just about every episode has her interacting with ghosts that want her to solve a mystery, to right an injustice or enable them to rest.  As a Christian I find this disturbing, and have approached it with my children as 'pretend' or 'like fairies.'  The occult is not something kid-friendly, or 'cute'.

2) Real life issues.  Emily deals with: death of mother, death of father (death is symbolized by a black horseman crashing through the wall of her house), rejection by her only relations, verbal abuse.  She encounters others dealing with premaritial pregnancy, their own illigitimacy, drunkenness, adultery, idolatry, broken engagement due to unfaithfulness, hatred, prejudice, unforgiveness, loose-women, a murderer is hanged in one scene, an American Indian boy is beaten, she is beaten.  There are several cases of severe child neglect, emotional trauma, child abandonment, she and her friends try to discover ""where babies come from"" and get pretty close to finding out....  (to name a few).

One reviewer said the series is 'not for children.'  With a sigh I say it has brought some issues about life to my innocent children's minds that they didn't need to know about. Not yet.

But I watch it with my children.  And I have been able to explain some things about life to them, as a case-study of sin and deception.  It has some light-hearted scenes.  But for the most part I would say it is a dark series, where Anne is light and joy.

In Anne of Green Gables, Anne says, ""Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes me feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd be no scope for imagination then, would there?""

This series is quite the opposite.  The message of Emily is, ""Isn't life full of sadness and grief?  I need to help put these ghosts to rest because humans are just so full of unkindness and broken dreams.""

So, if you are willing to put in the time to introduce your children to all the confusing things about life, go for it.  If you can help them structure their understanding of the world around these new ideas, watch it.

I am enjoying it myself, from a creative point of view it is an interesting series.  But parents beware, there be ghosts ahead!",1276646400,105,2837,4.622

3512171,5,B001CFEBVQ,"Upfront I should say that I have never read the original books by LM Montgomery so I can't comment on how true or not the adaptation is.  Initially, people want to compare this to the Sullivan productions of Anne of Greeen Gables and Avonlea. While I definitely enjoyed those series very much ........I have to say that I have enjoyed Emily of New Moon just as much or maybe even more. Emily of New Moon is definitely darker and edgier than Anne of Green Gables....... but it still has the warmth and moral messages that one wants in this type of series. I will warn you though that this series really is not for young children but more for adults and young adults. I really would not show this to children under the age of 11-12 because there are some scary episodes. I watch a lot of period dramas with my two daughters who are older (1 in college, 1 in high school). I bought Emily of New Moon Seasons 1&2 to watch over the winter with my high school daughter and we have had such fun!!!! All of the characters are colorful and interesting, the scenery of Prince Edward Island is beautiful, and there is some light romance in it. Plus it is quite humorous and I cannot tell you how many times we have laughed and had to rewind a scene to watch it again. Emily is cute and her best friend is hilarious. I really don't understand the negative reviews. For Christmas, I gave Seasons 1&2 to my 77 year old mother who is also an Ann of Green Gables fan, and she loves this series also!

What's worse is that starting with the second episode on the second disc, all of a sudden the geniuses who produced this series put an obscuring filter on the camera lens. After that everything is seen dimly as if through a mist. I have no idea what they had in mind, maybe a misguided attempt to add atmosphere to a series that sorely lacks any kind of atmosphere due to feeble writing and characterizations. Making the picture so dim it's hard to discern the actors isn't going to help. It makes things a lot worse, and we had to just stop viewing the programs.",1267142400,3,696,4.480314960629921

Emily is beaten by a mean schoolmaster, leading to her father's dismissal from his job and their move to a new location. Her father has an accident and dies, leaving Emily at the mercy of her ""mean"" relatives. Her mother and father both ""magically"" visit with her now.

3512183,1,B001CFEBVQ,"I purchased these DVDs after enjoying ""Road to Avonlea,"" understanding that the Emily series would probably not be as well done.  As it is, I consider the series to be so bad that it is actually painful to watch.  I think the producers intended for Emily's character to come across as another Anne, as so wonderfully played by Megan Follows in the Sullivan productions, but where Anne was winningly imaginative and earnest, Martha MacIsaac's Emily seems bratty.  Unfortunately, Ms. MacIsaac never seems to ""get"" her character's artistic soul, and therefore portrays earnestness as inappropriate anger, causing the viewer to recoil, rather than to champion her pluck.  The other characters in the series don't offer much relief, as they are wooden and flat.  They are so one-dimensional that they don't come across as real people--they are like characters in a dream world.  Don't expect to see any beautiful shots of Prince Edward Island, either.  As as far as I can tell, the series was shot entirely on gray days.  It is so poorly lit that it has a amateurish quality to it, as if someone recorded the series on their home camcorder, with no lighting aids whatsoever.",1264464000,9,1169,4.928571428571429
3512184,3,B001CFEBVQ,"I like the show and thought it was interesting as a stand alone BUT.....Sorry its just NOT Emily of New Moon and shouldn't be named this at all! It has maybe 15% (and I'm being generous of the story line, its sadly out of order, and it misses many key points).  I read the books many times growing up.  They miss the point on many of the characters including her Father, Elizabeth & even Emily herself (she was usually not KNOWINGLY naughty she just made mistakes... lots of them lol, in this series she is willfully disobedient and almost a nasty little girl). I also have no idea why they added ghosts in - it isn't needed.
My suggestion don't read the book before you watch these if you haven't already, If you have prepare to be disappointed unless you can understand that it is just not Emily from the book and watch the show as a completely separate entity 85% authored by someone else... Maud Hart Lovelace must be spinning in her grave to have her book name attached to this charming but misguided show.",1263600000,9,1011,4.43010752688172
3512185,5,B001CFEBVQ,"This series surpasses the Emily books. I've read all the L.M.Montgomery books, articles and letters. The acting is superb and the characters are better than I ever imagined. The first disk begins slowly with a younger girl acting as young Emily and it tells what happens to place Emily at New Moon. Then the next actress takes over as the continued Emily, and she becomes the real character of Emily. This isn't a child's series, though looking at the cover you'd think it was just for children. Emily's inherited ""second sight"" isn't hokey and very believable. The depiction of that era in history was like being there and witnessing the good and the ugly of real life. It's not candied and predictable.
It was all I could do to stop the disk and go on to work. I'll keep the whole series and look forward to anything that this production company makes of top quality and timeless viewing. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be absorbed in such an unusual and gripping series.

3512186,3,B001CFEBVQ,"I have always loved the Emily trilogy, even more than the Anne books if that is possible, and was excited by the possibilities of this adaptation. I had been put off by the disaster of the last two Sullivan productions, which, after reading the appalling reviews, I refused to watch. Outwardly, this looked like it could well be a production where the makers have honoured the original work. Not so.
I watched the first two episodes with a mixture of bewilderment, satisfaction and regret.
In only the first two episiodes, we already have two characters that are completely made up (little first nations boy and Charles Dickens - what the dickens was he doing there?) The actor portraying Jimmy would have made a fabulous Dean Priest but is completely unlike the Jimmy in the book. Even Emily's enigmatic cats, Mike and Saucy Sal, have merged into one very unassuming looking, incongruously named ""Pandora"".
Emily's father, who dies of tuberculosis in the book, falls off a roof in a completely unnecessary ""dramatic turn"", and of course Emily's teacher is cruel and her father rebels against him - not in the book. Thus it goes on. In very unsubtle flashbacks, we see Emily's mother rocking in her rocking chair or running next to her in the landscape.
A few of the additions were actually conducive to the story, like Emily keeping her father's cardigan, and, less so, the beach scene in the beginning.
But why the dramatic hunt for the cat in the night? Why the Miss Havisham-like garret full of her mother's stuff? Is Emily eventually going to move up there? I thought it was a normal room her mother lived in an that was locked up since she eloped.
All in all, the makers obviously couldn't rein in their own imagination and thought the story didn't have enough ""Umph"", so they randomly added some.
What a shame. This could have been a delightful series: the costumes and props are OK, the scenery is grand, and even the actors are quite good. I will watch the rest just because I bought it, but I am not expecting much.

If you are not familiar with the writings of Lucy Maude Montgomery, do not assume that this is like the Road to Avonlea or Anne of Green Gables.

I'm not sure that we were able to catch every episode during its entire run but even if we had I would never regret buying every episode of every season again. Since that initial exposure to Emily, we've already bought almost every book L. M. Montgomery wrote. And, when Amazon sent me an e-mail about the DVD of Season One, I couldn't order or get it fast enough. It was as if a long lost friend had been found again. We're now on our second viewing of it in a week. Casting of the central characters couldn't have been better and the story lines are superb. While some have lamented the spirits who often visited Emily, they miss the point that, above all, this is a character study of a young, imaginative, and creative mind. When I was Emily's age, I must confess that thoughts of such mysterious beings were within the fold of my imagination as well. Today, as a 68 year old retired judge and having lost the capacity myself, I delight now in reviving such lucidity of imagination, albeit if only vicariously through Emily's eyes. If you love good, clean, family entertainment and can give yourself up to enjoying this as an enchanting period piece of life on Prince Edward Island at or about the turn of the last century, this DVD set will be a treasured jewel.

Emily is orphaned at around age ten, but has ""second sight,"" being visited by the spirits of her parents and others who give encouragement and direction.
Peripheral family members draw straws to see who must take in Emily, and Aunt Elizabeth reluctantly ""wins.""  She is incredibly strict, stern, and dictatorial, although she does all she can for Emily's physical needs. She can't break Emily's spirit, and Emily's sunny disposition gradually prevails.
Many of the situations are extreme and even scary but never perverse, and tend to build character.

The characters were one dimensional and exaggerated, Emily was a self conscious brat, and her best friend was a monster in need of anger management classes. Crap compared to Anne of Green Gables. You don't have to be as cute and escapist as Avonlea, that is true-- but this show was not nitty gritty and realistic. It was a collision of Jane Eyre with a lame kids Halloween movie. By the time Emily was hanging out with dead people in graveyards I'd lost patience and turned the show off.",1474070400,,525,4.479166666666667

8287448,3,B001CFEBVQ,"The actors are great and the scenery is wonderful but there are too many changes.  The events are very disturbing and Aunt Elizabeth seems a bit too scary. Jimmy is not a violent person in the book. He is a wonderful character.
Also, why is there a dog on the cover? Emily always had cats.",1472083200,,289,4.254545454545455
