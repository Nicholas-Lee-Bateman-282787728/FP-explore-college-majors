8631037,1,B00H91LWDC,"Terrible movie, boring, poorly acted, badly lit, badly shot. But for a more interesting take on the same topic (Brit comes to LA to see about dead daughter) see ""the Limey"" with Terrence Stampp and Peter Fonda and Leslie Ann Warren and the ever-reliable Luis Guzman. It's not brilliant either, but better shot, better acted, and a lot more fun.",1420848000,,344,4.75

8631042,3,B00H91LWDC,"Lex Walker (Craig Fairbrass) is a British mercenary. When he is not killing, his second love is Jack Daniels followed by his semi-estranged daughter Samantha (Melissa Ordway). Lex must leave his job to fly to LA (the LA that looks like Baton Rouge where the film was shot) and identify the body of his daughter. Except it is not her!!! Craig Fairbrass stars in this film because Liam Neeson has already done one.

James Caan is in the film, so we know who plays the bad guy and how this ends. The only mystery is what is the daughter into (explained about an hour into the film) and how many people get killed/beat up in the process.

The DVD box description claims Lex works with a detective (Jason Patric) to find his daughter. That is a bit of a stretch, as the two never work side by side. He is instead helped by a bar waitress (Shannon Elizabeth) who he over tipped.

James Caan had to use some carefully orchestrated tough guys moves as it looks like he has been propped up aka ""Weekend at Bernies.""  I had to laugh as he carefully punched some huge steroid freak and doubled him over.

The film is okay for those who need something to pass the time. Clearly formulaic and doesn't create intensity. A bit on the Seagal campy side.
