4593360,5,B00570J4LY,I remember my mom doing the exercises on TV when I was a kid. I am grateful to Mr. LaLanne. I know his program helped her overcome a weak constitution from a couple of surgeries back in the 1970s. It is very well possible that his exercises have greatly help[ed my mom to have such a long life. (She's 82 now) This DVD is well done; the picture is clear and Mr. LaLanne shares many exercises for all types of needs and conditions. His enthusiasm is catchy; he motivates you to make fitness and healthy living a way of life. There is also a spirituality and youthful innocence in Mr. LaLanne's program that is missing from many health trainers today. Thank you Jack LaLanne!,1364860800,9,673,4.435483870967742

They are perfect for me as I have a limiting condition and these workouts (this goes for the series I ordered) are gentle starters that work gradually up to more challenging, and Jack always gives warning for beginners if the next routine is not for them.",1499817600,,410,4.63013698630137

8460154,5,B00570J4LY,"Ok, maybe it's dated and corny at times, but it's basic yet effective exercise.  The only equipment needed is a chair and a few times some sort of band to sub for the glamour stretcher.  Very upbeat, simple exercises that have really helped me.  I love Jack!",1493164800,,258,4.446808510638298
8460155,4,B00570J4LY,"Mr. LaLanne makes you work.  The actual exercise part is only about 20 minutes but you will work.  His philosophy is great.  Makes you feel positive.  Some of his ""talks"" are religious in nature but not enough to bother most.
Just plain fun.",1489536000,2,241,4.534883720930233
8460156,5,B00570J4LY,"I love this.  It's for older people like me to exercise.  Not really stressful very low keyed and easy to do these exercises.  No problem.  The Monday thru Friday half hour sessions are great!  Jack LaLanne is such a sweet guy, fun to listen to and I love his doggie ""Happy"".",1457395200,5,275,4.313725490196078
8460157,4,B00570J4LY,"I started doing the Jack Lalanne workouts I found on YouTube a few months ago starting with the very first episode that aired. I enjoyed them. He started out slowly, building on each episode and I could feel the workouts. I ordered this dvd once all of the workouts on Youtube were gone except for the first two episodes and I wanted to keep working out with Jack. I just did the Monday show from this set and it was definitely a workout. My only comment is that I wish for Volume One you had started with the first few shows or something a little more basic to work up to the faster pace of the episodes on this set. I was enjoying starting from day one with the online videos until I couldn't go past day two anymore. But these are great workouts on this set and as Jack always says, I won't get discouraged. Thanks, Jack!",1445212800,3,824,4.2215189873417724
