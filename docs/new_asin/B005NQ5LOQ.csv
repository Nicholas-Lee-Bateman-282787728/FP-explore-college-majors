4849140,5,B005NQ5LOQ,Got this for my nephew.  He loves the series and now he can watch what he wants when he wants.  I made him happy so that makes me happy.,1324512000,2,136,3.6551724137931036
4849141,4,B005NQ5LOQ,"As someone who was a diehard DBZ fan, I used to anticipate the show's airing each night from Mon-Thurs more than anything, I was tied to what would happen next in the storyline like a soap opera fan. When the movies finally became available it was an exciting breath of fresh air, plotlines that could be placed in the greater narrative but that were free to tell isolated stories, all new (though sometimes reborrowed) action set pieces, overall just getting to see the characters in different situations.

This second movie pack is probably going to be most fan's favorite. It contains the films that have the most advanced DBZ action before getting as silly as some later films did. They also focus most heavily on Goku and the core group whereas in earlier ones favorites like Vegeta were missing and in later ones Goten and Trunks start taking up more screen time.

The package is a similar size (though not exact) to the DBZ orange season sets. It also has similar coloring and artwork design, so it looks cohesive on a shelf if not part of a set. The case is a cardboard slip shell that holds 2 small slip cases (the first had 3 housing 5 movies, so this one is smaller).

I do find it odd that the 13 films weren't released in two movie packs rather than 3 (holding 5, 4 and 4 films respectively). This release pattern also leaves almost no fan favorites on the third impending release, Wrath of the Dragon being the only one I personally feel compelled to rewatch. A question for anyone who knows, why aren't these also being released on Blu-ray for fans who want HD? I personally am fine with DVD but it seems odd that they were moving to releasing all the films on Blu and are now back to rereleasing them on DVD alone.

For fans who don't already own the movies or for those who desperately need more room on their shelves and don't mind buying this to replace the single releases (like myself), this set is a great bargain despite being the umpteenth time these have been repackaged. 5 stars for fans but 4 from me because the division of the movies is weird and no blu option.",1323561600,6,2090,4.463350785340314
4849164,2,B005NQ5LOQ,"as a long time dbz fan, i'm overall disappointed with this purchase. Android 13 was stupid, and filled with racism...a black character that talks stupid and is an alcoholic for example...and cooler was lame as well. Broly was okay at best.... i just wasn't impressed overall. it was passable.",1517011200,,292,4.979591836734694
4849165,4,B005NQ5LOQ,"The box was slightly damaged, I'm sure that was due to shipping and handling though. The disks were kind of smudged and scratched, one even had a large black smudge. Fortunately I was able to wipe away most of the smudges. One disk was somewhat hard to get out. The disks play perfectly without any buffers and the quality is amazing, so that's really what matters to me. Not much to complain about, this is altogether a really high quality product.",1516320000,,449,4.555555555555555

4849167,5,B005NQ5LOQ,"Dragon Ball Z, the iconic anime that made thousands of kids anime fans, has maintained itself as one of the most enjoyable franchises of all time and their films are a big part of what makes DBZ hold up so well all these years later. This second collection happens to contain the best movies, and I certainly recommend these to all fans wanting to spice up their collection.",1515974400,,374,4.514705882352941

4849262,4,B005NQ5LOQ,"Bought this at Fry's a while ago. It's a good thing value comes to mind. Dragon Ball Z: Movie Pack Collection 2 has DBZ movies 6 to 9, from a billion Metal Coolers taking over Neo Namek to Bojack unleashed.

Well basically it's another collection reprint of previous steelbook releases that used to be multi-region coded (1,2,4), now it's strictly re-authored to Region 1 without any changes to the disc art which might be a problem with international customers.
Also, one thing I'm not a fan of (within Funimation releases) is just 1 video angle (16:9 English Footage ONLY) regardless if I'm watching the Japanese version or the English version with Japanese or US music.

Personally, the 8th movie (Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan) was pretty good, because we see even more flashbacks (Saiyan race) and getting to know who the rebellious but legendary Super Saiyan is. His unbreakable strength and power.",1443916800,,908,4.967105263157895

4849371,4,B005NQ5LOQ,"well it had been a while since i had seen any dbz at all but one day i saw the promo for battle of gods. I looked up the other movies and ordered all the movie pack collections i rated this 4 stars because out of all the movies Return of Cooler and Super Android 13 in my opinion weren't as great as the others.

Return of Cooler,
 Cooler returns after becoming part a star in space after goku blasted him into the sun. The Movie Begins with him taking over the new namek. After Dende The guardian of earth notices his people in trouble who does he call for help none other than Goku and the Z-Fighters! After Our heros learn of the trouble on namek they make a trip to check it out. When they arrive they see large robots imprisoning the nameks. Goku orders the mechanical villains to get lost before they have to resolve the problem with violence. Although the robots are not doing this on their own a new and improved MetaCooler if you will arrives to reveal that it is him thats taking over namek. Goku then steps up and fights Cooler as the rest of the gang fight the robots they are eventually over powered and taking to Coolers starship. Goku not aware of whats happening continues his fight with Cooler Noticing that at his normal saiyan stae he would not be able to beat Cooler so Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan  although this did little to help vegeta appears for his usual 5 secinds of bad ass saving he gets tooken down no problem he is truely outclassed by both goku and cooler.at the end vegeta and Goke take down the original cooler just to find out that theres millions so they are thrn captured and stiffened for power but then they both notice if they over power coolers circuts they can destroy him so thats what they do!

Their all great quality except for Bojack Unbound movie number 9 and that's the only reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Movies 6,7,8 all run perfectly good with quality and dubbing 5/5 rating on them but movie 9 for some reason runs choppy, the frame rates on it are bouncy and choppy looking.

Now that technology has changed since then a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. It a WONDERFUL collection. I just love it.

4849411,5,B005NQ5LOQ,"I watch my fair share of anime, both movies and multiple series, but Dragonball, Z, and GT will always be where it started.

Watching these movies brings back memories of watching them for the first time 16 years ago when they started to show them on US television. Dont forget to the buy the  other 2 movies packs. Dead Zone, Worlds Strongest, Tree of Might, Lord Slug, Cooler and Broly Series, Super Android 13, Fusion Reborn, and all the box sets, you won't regret it",1329782400,,470,4.517647058823529
4849412,5,B005NQ5LOQ,"Being I already had the 1st set of these movies, I naturally got this when it was released. When it comes to the packaging, its the same as the first set but a little smaller since it only has 2 slim cases instead of the 3 from the 1st DBZ movie set. The movies themselves look great, and everything comes in clear. Since I tend to watch these on a laptop, I can't speak for the sound quality aspect too much but all of them are Dolby surround sound capable (English or Japanese music).

These 4 movies are the most interesting in my opinion because each movie has a very different villain, with the exception of ""Return of Cooler"" which is the villain from ""Cooler's Revenge"" from the first set of movies returning for another go. Any DBZ fan who doesn't already have these movies should definitely make this part of the collection.",1327276800,3,833,4.444444444444445
4849413,5,B005NQ5LOQ,"Four great movies starting with Metal Cooler, Super Android 13, Broly the legendary Super Saiyan, and ending with Bojack and his crew. The quality is great and the movie is uncensored (just blood showing) like it originally should be. If your looking for the best DBZ has to offer, this collection comes very close, awesome action is always present but there are DBZ movies with better animations and destruction in them. If your a true fan this is a must own!",1327190400,5,460,4.691358024691358
