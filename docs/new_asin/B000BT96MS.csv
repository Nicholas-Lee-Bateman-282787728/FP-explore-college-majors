8092180,1,B000BT96MS,"With this el cheapo Alpha Video release we get two movies.
1.  Il gigante di Metropolis (1961) (The Giant of Metropolis) - Bad quality transfer with English dubbing. Pan Scan instead of 2.35:1 cinemascope. About 8 minute of film missing.
2.  Hercules and the Princess of Troy (1965) - Aspect ratio and run time OK but video discoloured and blurry.
The Italian age of Swords and Sandals (1959-1965) produced a host of entertaining movies but I have yet to see any given proper restoration with the original soundtrack. Not sure why as there seem to be plenty of fans calling for it.",1490745600,,581,4.686274509803922
8092181,5,B000BT96MS,I remember fondly this movie from my youth. It's a very unusual story and the weapons used I've never scene anywhere else. Way cool.,1379894400,,132,4.541666666666667
8092182,1,B000BT96MS,"The DVD is not in the widescreen format, which results in distorted images. The fun of seeing these foreign imports is subsequently lost.",1178928000,,137,5.0
8092183,3,B000BT96MS,"If you're a fan of this cult masterpiece of the bizarre, buy the Retromedia DVD, not the Alpha DVD. While the Retromedia copy is far from the quality this movie deserves, it's widescreen and has marginally better color and a considerably crisper image. It also has a bonus interview with the star, Gordon Mitchell.",1141430400,9,314,4.833333333333333
