I like Romy, but I would wait for about 6 months before you have either taken a class, or started with some of the Lilias! Yoga dvds for beginners or the Himalayan Institute's Yoga:  Mastering the Basics. The Lilias! dvds explain why you place your hands and feet in those positions and allow you to correct the poses for the best fit. If you can follow along with the audio, as you can with either of these dvds, without looking at the tv, a beginner can master the moves without difficulty or hurt.  Romy falls into more of an intermediate-beginner catagory. She has a soft voice and the dvd flows a little more quickly than the aforementioned.  Enjoyable, but more for one that is moving into an intermediate level.",1203379200,,892,4.55625
8114790,5,B000EWBK3K,"This is great for beginners who want to learn how to do the poses correctly.  The modifications for different levels are also very helpful in allowing me to enter the poses at my own pace, which keeps me motivated as I progress in my practice.",1146873600,2,243,4.4
8114791,5,B000EWBK3K,"I'm buying it for everyone I've always wanted to talk into trying yoga :)  The DVD includes:

(1) an introducton to yoga basics

(2) a level 1 (beginner) session with three students demonstrating the beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of the poses, so you can continue to progress with this DVD over time

(3) a more difficult session demonstrated by Romy

(4) descriptions of basic yoga poses

Audio can be set to English or Spanish.",1146787200,3,445,4.866666666666666
8114792,5,B000EWBK3K,"It was easy to follow with clear instructions. For a beginner like myself, I thought it was helpful to hear and see from the instructor key details for each pose.",1146787200,2,162,4.433333333333334
