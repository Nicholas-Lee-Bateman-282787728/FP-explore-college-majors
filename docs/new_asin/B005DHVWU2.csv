8650603,4,B005DHVWU2,"If you are a fan of AKB, it is a must have. However if you are just a fan of yankee dramas and need english subtitles this might not be the drama for you. To say the subs are bad is an understatement.",1358121600,,200,3.6744186046511627
8650604,3,B005DHVWU2,"this is a Chinese translation from Japanese > Chinese > English, and what happens is the syntax gets all screwed up in the last disc. there are also resultant name changes. the true Japanese to English DVD set costs close to $200 in japan",1349740800,,238,4.431818181818182
8650605,1,B005DHVWU2,"Jin I and Jin II are great Japanese TV dramas, and very popular there. These DVDs work fine and the story is very interesting. However, just be sure you can speak Japanese, because the subtitles are ridiculous. There is no excuse for this company to claim there is an English subtitle option on these DVDs. It is just word soup, and the names often don't even match the people: a Chinese pronunciation is given to a Japanese character's name sometimes, so you are even forced not to view the subtitles at all if you do not want to get totally confused). They are not even good automatic machine translations (like in Gooogle's ""Translate this page ...""). I feel that someone who doesn't even have a minimal understanding of English just added some sentences so the product could be marketed as having an English subtitle option. This is sometimes seen in these kinds of DVDs, but this is really unfortunate, because it will make people cautious about buying the correctly translated ones. Thus, people might miss some really good movies and TV programs (like the ones here).",1314316800,8,1074,4.779569892473118
