1424438,5,B00005BJX2,"This is a great volume.  Eva in general is a great series but this is fantastic.  In this volume we get to see the death of two major characters as well as see Asuka become so devistated my an angel attack that she begins to have difficulty in everything she does.
The show gives us an indepth look at what an Evangelion is and how it is formed.  There are a multitude of flashbacks from a great number of the of the characters lives.  The viewers find out what happened to Shinji's mother, Ritsuko's mother, and what Rei really is.  There are many flashbacks showing scenes of joy, love, friendship, mistrust and hatred.  Meanwhile the present scenes deal with sacrafice and mourning. There are some great scenes in this volume.
  Volume seven starts to explain every thing that has led up to this moment.  There two really phenominal angel attacks in this volume.  I would consider these three episodes to be some of the best episodes in Neon Genesis: Evangelion because of the plot and the character development.  It will leave you feeling very sorry for each of the characters in the saga of Evangelion.",986688000,29,1107,4.625641025641026
1424439,5,B00005BJX2,"One person told me they felt it's a shame that Cartoon Network's Adult Swim has picked up NGE because it would be ""casting pears before swine, the swine being the Inuyasha [addicts] that make up A.S.'s Anime fanbase"" While I do enjoy IY, I wholehartedly agree. NGE is exquisite, complex, sophisticated, and tragic, filled with psychodrama and intimate personal emotion. It's closer to Karen Finley or Spalding Gray than George Lucas or Jet Li. I'm positive they'll pull it after episode 6 for lack of pyrotechnics.

THAT BEING SAID: This DVD is a wonderful addition to any fan's collection. Fantastic video quality, and the audio work is (while a bit over the top at times) wonderfully enriching to the experience, even on my measely 2 Radio Shack speakers. OK, so there's no gay interaction between Shinji and Kaworu in the Directors Cut of 24. No matter. This longer version with mild spoiler is fantastic! The bonus 30 minute rough cuts of 24 and (sort of) 25 are sans dialogue, and dirty as all heck. For hardcore fans, it's pure gold.

... then there's the comentary on 26. OK, good, so they got the dub director and an ""Evangellion Lecturer"" to do the commentary. And it's VERY good from begining to end. But isn't that the EXACT thing they did for the EOE commentary? Are the original GAINAX staff and Japanese voice actors under some strict contract not to ever speak about the show? Come on, there must be ONE who speaks fluent English with time on their hands. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they did it. The comentary is fine and provides a tangiable plus well beyond filler on the DVD feature list. But then there's this UTTERLY STUPID extra video of just those two talking about the show for 13 minutes straight. They already elaborated plenty on the commentary track, but now they just sit and prattle on about how great the show is with nearly no editing. They just plopped a camera down, recorded them talking, then transfered it straight to the disk. IT'S MONOTONOUS, and particularly Public Access.

Does that mean this isn't worth it? HARDLY! I'm just warning you that along with the limited edition m&m's, godiva chunklets, and orange Kit Kats, there's some pennies and apples in that Halloween bag.",1130544000,2,2217,4.738341968911917
1424440,4,B00005BJX2,"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Collection 0:7 is the next to last volume in the ""controversial and popular anime series that revolutionized anime (NPR radio program).""  Collection 0:7 contains episodes 21, 22, and 23.

Episode 21: ""He Was Aware That He Was Still A Child"" - Like the last seasons of the X-Files, the truth about NERV is ultimately revealed, in jigsaw pieces of the past that culminate in shocking events in the present.  We see young versions of Futsuyuki, Shinji's mother and father, and Ritsuko's mother, creator of the MAGI supercomputers.

Episode 22: ""Don't Be"" - This episode focuses on Asuka's past, and her inability to be in synch with her Eva Unit.  The Fifteenth Angel attacks with a psychic attack.

Episode 23: ""Rei III"" - The Sixteenth Angel attacks.  Eva Unit 00 is completely destroyed, yet somehow Rei survives.  After listening to Kaji's final answering machine message, Misato holds a gun to Ritsuko to demand to see the truth about Rei.  Shinji is there to witness the terrible revelation.

Extras are character bios, including Ritsuko's mother.",1123804800,,1075,5.056818181818182
1424441,5,B00005BJX2,"Volume seven of NEON GENESIS EVANGELION PLATINUM EDITION is the best of the seven platinum disks. The art, animation, music, and story are incredible. It has both the On-Air version and the Director's cut version of episode 24 The Final Messenger(A.K.A. Knockin' On Heaven's Door). It has the Director's cut version of episode 25 and 26 only. This Ending (I am referring to the original ending to the series which is about the characters' mind trip.) is five times better than that poor excuse of a conclusion End Of Evangelion. I love the Evangelion Platinum Edition series.

P.S. I hope that they will make a platinum edition of the Evangelion movie DEATH AND REBIRTH, I would pay to get that.",1120953600,4,695,4.791666666666667

How do i know this ? Well they seem to think episodes 21 - 23 are on this disc, Wrong! Its the last of the Platinum Volumes and contains Episodes 24 - 26 the Last two of the series. I would also like to point out that Volume 6 which i just got today has the Directors Cut Episodes of 21 - 23 quite cool. So Evangelion Platinum is all you'll need series wise. But Death and Rebirth and End of Evangelion should also be bought. Not really a Review of the Anime but the fact i gave it 5 stars speaks for itself. ^_^",1112832000,14,689,3.964028776978417
1424444,5,B00005BJX2,"These three episodes (21 thru 23) are the lead in to the end.  Even as SEELE's plans approach fruition both Rei and Asuka are subjected to bruising attacks.  New themes are introduced, some questions are answered, and we begin to understand that Gendo Ikari's agenda is to be a god maker - the herald of a new existence.
1) The Birth of NERV
In the aftermath of Unit 1's actions SEELE begins an intensive investigation into Gendo Ikari's actions.  This culminates in suspicion turning on Ryoji Kyogi.  Misato's heartbreak is played against the story of the beginning of Gehirn, the project that was to become NERV.  For the first time we learn of Shinji and Rei's beginnings.  In addition, we learn what Rei has always known - the EVA's are far more than dolls.
2) At Least be Humane
Asuka, worn down by her repeated losses of self esteem, begins to lose the ability to synchronize effectively with Unit 02.  This leaves her vulnerable when Angel 15 (Arael) takes position on orbit where the EVA's cannot reach it.  In an eerie episode, Asuka and her EVA are hit with a psychic attack that frays away at her fears and threatens to destroy her personality.  Rei must attempt a rescue with the Lance of Longinus, but terrible damage is done.
3) Tear
With Asuka in tatters and Unit 01 untrustworthy only Rei can take active duty when Angel 16 (Armisael) attacks.  The angel invades Unit 00 in an attempt to mesh.  Rei finds herself forced into introspection that she isn't used to.  Unable to stop the angel Rei chooses self-destruction.  Even though Rei seems to survive, something is wrong and Ritsuko's guilt leads her to reveal more about the project to Shinji and Misato.
One of the interesting themes that are introduced is that of motherhood and family.  All of the characters share some sort of deep injury in their core relationships.  In addition, we discover that Rei is somehow related to Shinji.  Perhaps, in Gendo Ikari's mind, she is in some way a substitute for Yui Ikari (Shinji's dead mother).  In these layers of misplaced emotions, there is no promise of healing.  Instead, with the appearance of the Lance of Longinus pinning the second angel in a mock crucifixion, the play of spiritual imagery reached a new peak.  Death and transformation is the path offered, as if the only way to recover is to become something more - or less - than human.",1038355200,5,2362,4.675544794188862
1424445,5,B00005BJX2,"Evangelion has long been hailed for being the most provocative, and groundbreaking anime series in history.  It will forever be held as a mark for other series to try and hurdle in regards to art quality, depth, and ability to actually draw you in and make you feel like you're experiencing everything along with the characters.
That being said, this final installment is excellent. This time it delves deep into the inner psyche of the characters, while trying to unravel many of the mysteries dropped throughout the prior episodes. It also reflects the thoughts of the creator of the series and his outlook on the future of the world.
There have been complaints that this being the final episode, not all of the questions were answered and the ending was too surreal.
I agree that there are still questions that need answering, but I liked the ending.
Either way two movies ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" will wrap up any loose ends. And will give a more action based ending. They're due out in August 2002 tentatively.
In the mean time buy this! It's well worth it. Evangelion forever!",1009584000,4,1101,4.7643979057591626
1424446,5,B00005BJX2,"This set is the best, from Asuka's utter devastation to Shinji's shocking discoveries with Eva 01. All characters undergo drastic transformations. For some, this volume is the place to stop, although I'd urge everyone to see the last as well as the supplementary movies. If you haven't already fallen in love with the character of Rei (is that possible?), you will in these episodes, when our discoveries about her bring shock, pity and also anger... you'll have to see it to find out.",1005868800,4,485,4.855421686746988

My ideas of the world have changed since going this far into the series, and there's one disk and movies left after this. This gives insight into Asuka's troubled past, which explains her arrogant behavior. And we finally learn of Rei's past as well, which is needless to say quite disturbing.

Also, the one question that's in my mind right now......WHAT'S HAPPENING TO EVERYONE! A helpful hint: if your sensitive, grab some tissues while watching this. There are some pretty disturbing scenes. I couldn't hold back my tears. Words alone can't explain how great Evangelion is. BUY THIS DVD.

In Vol 7, we learn of the origins of NERV, the truth about Rei(finally), more insight on both Shinji's and Ritsuko's mother and more on the Human Instrmentality Project.

1424457,5,B00005BJX2,"This is one of the more depressing volumes of Evangelion. It starts out with Fyutski being captured by SELLE and being interogatted. As NERV confines Misato for the time being, Fyutski has a load of flashbacks dating back to the year 1999 when he first met Gendo, who was kind of a rebel, and Yui, who was still in college who wanted to fall in love. This episode shows the birth fo NERV and you'll also get to see Risuko's mother. The most sad part of the episode for most people will be when one of the main characters is killed. The second episode deals with Auska's now disturbed mind of piloting an EVA. As the next Angel attacks, it rapes Auska's mind getting into her head. NERV is forced to have Rei use a secret powerful weapon against the Angel that will destroy it with one hit. The third episode takes off with Auska depressed as ever. When the next Angel attacks, Rei is forced into combat and ends up learning a little about herself before the she self detonates EVA 00. After that, both Shinji and Misato learn more about the EVAs and about Rei. This is a rather important volume as it tells the truth and history on some of your favorite characters. And the Spanish and French dialogue only add to the fun! Until the spectacular final volume comes out soon, this DVD is the best!

His father tells him he must pilot a giant humanoid robot to protect the world from the invading angels. The angels and the Evangelion that Shinji pilots both have a secret. They were both alternate possibilities of humanity in the when the world began. There are many dark secrets and conspiracies afoot behind the scenes. Shinji has some major psychological issues and they are compounded when he meets his fellow pilots Rei and Asuka. Evangelion is the story of Shinji, and his fight to save the world and find happiness.

This is a very deep anime. You could watch it over and over, but still find a different meaning every time. The story is very heavy. The emotions of each characters are explored in depth. It's an older series, but the animation, voice acting, and music are all top notch. It is a near perfect series. My only beef with it is the final episode. The final episode is pretty much a psych evaluation of the main characters. When I first saw this series, I hated it b/c of the ending. Since then they have released ""Death and Rebirth"", and ""The End of Evangelion"". They wrap everything up very nicely. Evangelion is incredible and you should check it out.

7937689,3,B00005BJX2,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:7 is a single DVD that contains episodes twenty-one through twenty-three of the series.

The episodes on this disc provide a lot of backstory and revelations that really shed some light into the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe.  The first episode on this disc contains a lot of flashbacks, and the audience learns about both of Shinji's parents, what happened to Shinji's mother, as well as history of Misato, Ritsuko, and Rei.  In the second episode, Asuka is undergoing a lot of angst, and her synchronization with her Eva unit is dropping.  By the end of that episode, there is a major character shift for Asuka.  The third episode of this disc contains a major revelation concerning Rei.  By the time the final episode on the disc concludes, a number of ""truths"" that have been in the series up until this point have been turned on their head; in fact, my head was nearly spinning by that point.

Unlike the previous discs, there were no trailers at the beginning when it started playing in my player.  On the disc, you can choose from four menu options; the options are ""Scene Access,"" ""Communications,"" ""Extras,"" and ""ADV Previews.""  For ""Scene Access,"" you can choose which episode you want to watch on the disc.  ""Communications"" is the option for subtitle and language selections.  For subtitles, you can choose to either have them on or off.  For language, you can choose from English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.

The ""Extras"" menu contains three options.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Shigeru Aoba, Yui Ikari, Naoko Akagi, Fifteenth Angel, and Sixteenth Angel.  The next feature is ""ADV Website""; all this selection does is to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it.  However, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The final extra in this menu is the DVD credits.  The final selection on the main menu is labeled as, ""ADV Previews.""  Like the previous two discs, this one has a menu to choose from instead of automatically starting a long collection of trailers.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.

7937691,5,B00005BJX2,"This collection of episodes is wonderful with probably some of the best characterization and interaction of the series.  You see Shinji find comfort in Kaworu and start to come out of his shell.  But it doesn't last long, and he's worse off than he's ever been.

The last two episodes wrap up the series in an excellent way.  The psychoanalysis, both internal and external, of the main charatcers was brillantly done.  You know Third Impact is going on but not how it has been initated, though you are shown clues to tell you.  I loved the ending to Evangelion.  I also liked End of Evangelion as well, but feel it may have been a little over the top in order to please the fans.  Anno did get death threats for how he ended the series, which are shown at one point toward the end.

My absolute favorite part of the ending has to be where Shinji is shown an alternate reality of his life and those in it.  I laugh every time because it's such a detour from what Eva is.

For those of you who have PC 7, here's a little easter egg I found out recently and thought I'd share.  If you switch your audio to track 4 and go to the end credits of the final episode, Spike Spencer, voice of Shinji Ikari, does a hilarious rant about the ending of the series.

BTW: Anno and co. are putting out 4 new movies of Eva.  The first comes out in Japan next month.  Three will be a retelling of the series and the fourth will be a new ending to the series.  I'm very curious to see what they've done.",1186531200,,1484,4.190812720848056

7937693,5,B00005BJX2,"FINALLY!!!  To clarify once and for all:

Platinum Collection 7 contains four episodes--

#24- The Original Version

#24- THE DIRECTOR'S CUT

#25- The Original Version

#26- The Original Version

There is NO director's cut for episodes 25 and 26.  If you already purchased the Platinum Collection Boxed Set, then you already have ALL of the episodes that are on this seventh disk.  For some reason they organized the single disks differently than the Boxed Set, and therefore there are seven seperate single disks and only six disks in the Boxed Set.

DON'T buy this disk if you are looking for extra episodes that they didn't squeeze into the Boxed Set.  The Boxed Set contains all the original episodes of the series, and it also contains the director's cut for episodes 21, 22, 23, and 24.  There's nothing else available anywhere.

The original end of the series (episodes 25 and 26) was unsatisfactory to many fans, and so the director reworked the ending in the form of TWO movies.  They are NOT included in the boxed set.  You can buy them seperately, or they also come in a two-pack box.  The first movie is called ""Death and Rebirth,"" and the second movie is ""The End of Evangelion.""  They are both excellent films, and serve as an entertaining and thought-provoking alternative to the original ending of the series.

Needless to say, this series is the best that anime has to offer.  All the incredible action and animation is perfectly complimented by a mix of intricate characters and philosophies.  Neon Genesis Evangelion is as much about tackling the nature of the soul as it is about giant alien creatures getting killed by giant robot things.  It's wonderful.",1140566400,37,1676,4.830985915492958
