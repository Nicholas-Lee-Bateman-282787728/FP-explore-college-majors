8366368,5,B000XAMCA8,"I am so excited about this release. I have heard so much about this legendary tour from 1994 featuring some of the greatest musicians from the westcoast genre. I got it imported from Japan. It is released in two versions. With or without the concert on cd and some promotional posters, pluss a booklet including a lot of cool information, but mine was in japanese so you figure it out...

The concert is filmed from one angle. The picture quality is not the best, but the sound is ok. This is for the fans. If you know albums like: Airplay for the Planet, Music for the planet, Toto and the works of Bill Champlin you will dig this as much as me !",1197763200,,647,4.260162601626016
