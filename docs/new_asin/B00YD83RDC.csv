7213288,5,B00YD83RDC,"this is a great movie, though definitely not for everyone. the film follows the main character Harley around the streets of nyc as she struggles to score heroin and get by. Harley has a self destructive nature which can be seen in her drug use as well as in her obsession with Ilya- her cruel detached sorta boyfriend (played impressively by caleb landry jones). this movie is based on the memoirs of arielle holmes who plays herself in the film. this fact lends to an intense authenticity not seen in many movies, the closest comparison being larry clark's KIDS which also used real people from the lifestyle instead of actors. HKW has a low budget feel (which some are calling ""messy"") but it's perfect for this kind of subject material and the film has a lot of heart (i wouldn't want to see the big-budget version of this). i highly recommend this for ppl who like their movies a little dark n dirty...",1447545600,2,906,4.564417177914111

7213290,1,B00YD83RDC,"No budget, horrendously paced film with awful improvised acting to the point that if this was screened at a family gathering as 'look mom and dad, my first film' everyone, even the blind aunt, would say, ""how are your studies coming along?""",1443139200,,240,4.738095238095238
7213291,2,B00YD83RDC,"""Heaven Knows What"" (2014 release; 94 min.) brings the story of Harley and her friends. As the movie opens, we see Harley making out with her boyfriend Ilyou, only later to see her beg of him in the library ""what can I do for you to forgive me?"". Ilyou isn't moved and in fact eggs Harley on to kill herself if she wants to prove to him how much she loves him. Much to Ilyou's shock and horror, she slits her wrist right in front of him. An ambulance is called and Harley survives. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie. To tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by bothers Ben and Joshua Safdie, who have made plenty of previous films (usual shorties), and is based on Arielle Holmes' book ""Mad Love in New York City"". Mad indeed! I had a hard time relating to the characters, and simply couldn't understand what this movie was about, other than Harley and her friends talking, arguing, shooting up, and repeat. After an hour or so, I simply gave up trying to care of understand what this incomprehensible mess was trying to get at. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's been a long time that I have felt so utterly disconnected from a movie (and I see LOTS of movies). I got the sense that the Safdie brothers were going for that same vibe usually associated with Harmony Korine (""Kids"", ""Spring Breakers""), except that they lack the vision which Korine lays out in his movies (and you may or may not agree with his vision, but he has one).

""Heaven Knows What"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater in Cincinnati last week. As a fan of indie movies, I took a flyer on this and, despite not knowing much of the movie, I went to see this a few days ago. The early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. Had I known more about the movie beforehand, it surely would've been a completely empty screening. As it turns out, I made a mistake going to see this movie as it's not worth seeing. That doesn't mean you have to make that same mistake. There are so many deserving indie movies out there for our viewing pleasure. ""Heaven Knows What"" is not one of them.",1435276800,5,2324,4.364896073903003

If you are interested in the life of heroin addicts, Heaven Knows What should be for you. Brother directors, Ben and Joshua Safdie, discovered the film's star, Arielle Holmes, a heroin addict, panhandling on the streets and encouraged her to write her life's story down on paper. Holmes along with screen writing partner, Ronald Bronstein, wrote the script and Holmes stars as Harley, the film's protagonist. Bronstein has a supporting role as Skully who urges Harley to break up with her boyfriend Ilya, after Harley slits her wrists at Ilya's behest (he declares that he has no interest in dating her anymore).

Shot in documentary style, the plot is rather lugubrious and has an unrelenting texture. In other words, this ain't easy to watch! We follow Harley after she shacks up with Mike, another addict and they spend time attempting to obtain money to support their habits (the usual means include of course panhandling, shoplifting and stealing). Mike gets into a fight with Ilya in Central Park and Ilya stabs him with a makeshift weapon but soon afterward Harley tells Mike that she's still crazy about Ilya.

After Harley saves Ilya from an overdose, they decide to take a bus to Florida but Ilya abandons her on the way down and ends up consumed by a fire inside a vacant house.

Nothing very much dramatic occurs at the denouement: Harley returns to NYC and watches Mike inside a fast food restaurant, as he boasts to his friends.

There's not much more to tell here. The Safdies have done well here in bringing us Holmes' gritty narrative. But after a while, the actions of the principals mimic one another to the point where we're kind of happy it's all over. Holmes must be commended for overcoming her heroin addiction and now trying to break into the movie industry (probably harder to do than overcoming a heroin addiction!). For her next role, I'd like to see Holmes take a role that doesn't involve drugs. Then we'll see if she can really act instead of just playing herself!",1456272000,,2037,4.775568181818182
7213299,3,B00YD83RDC,"Beautifully shot and edited, with a haunting score featuring music by synthesizer genius Isao Tomita.  But it's really hard to remain interested in and to care about the incredibly depressing characters, trapped in a world of drug abuse and physical torment, none of whom seem to want to escape the horrible reality they've chosen for themselves.  A slice of life movie based on a true story that most people will find too depressing to enjoy.",1455580800,2,443,4.8933333333333335

8718166,1,B00YD83RDC,"Not only was the content disturbing, the music overpowered the voices so it was hard to hear most of what was being said. It would have been helpful to get a little background on how Harley ended up homeless and on the streets. It would make it a little easier to watch since the movie was just about her finding her next fix and shooting up, while desperately seeking Ilya's affection.",1524441600,,386,4.450704225352113

There is a huge ""If"" here, because you will not like this movie if you don't like learning about homelessness and drug culture, if you can't do bloody gore..If you hate homeless people and drug addicts you should watch with an open mind. This movie is a window into a world most people don't understand and its a true story, with the main characters played by the actual woman who experienced the story!

8718170,5,B00YD83RDC,"Safdie brothers know what they're doing. This and Good Time is next level amazing. Not everyone will enjoy though because they are used to big time Hollywood happy stories. These are NY based raw gritty and seriously deep stories. This one in particular...they used real junkies and homeless people of the area to play these roles and help write the movie. Genius. It's giving people a chance to help themselves, make money and get off the street while maybe becoming a movie star. Amazing. Even Good Time...there's an ex felon in the movie to play that exact role. Just makes sense! But the mood and music and scenes are gritty so beware...it's a dive into what junkies go through day in day out and they don't hold anything back. Amazing. I keep coming back for more!",1504310400,,769,4.661764705882353

8718172,5,B00YD83RDC,This was kind of a thrill ride! Very fast paced and I love how as soon as the film opens we are right in the action and in the thick of things. Harley (Arielle Holmes) and Ilya (Caleb Landry Jones) are really....really good actors. I watched this to see Caleb. Love him. So sexy. Okay....Arielle Holmes is a REALLY good actress . She has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing her future work.,1497052800,,402,4.233766233766234

8718174,5,B00YD83RDC,This movie is probably too real for a lot of people. Reminds me some of KIDS. Very raw and honest. Made in a documentary style. Nothing pretty or feel good about it. As a recovering junkie this was like a kick in the gut reminder of what day to day life was like. In my mind This is a movie about daily survival for a homeless junkie. That's it. This movie was hard for me to watch because of how incredibly real it is. And because of the difficult memories it brought back after 10 years away from it,1482192000,,501,4.070707070707071
