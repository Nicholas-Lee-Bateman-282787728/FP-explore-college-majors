1029230,2,6305426686,i give this movie 2 stars because it would be downright cruel to give it anything less... i think that it was hyped up way too much for what it really turned out to be. they used big stars like jenifer and matthew on  their poster when the probably had a combined total of 15 minutes screen  time.. it really was just a huge dissapointment to me finding out i wasted  13 bucks buying 15 minutes of my fave. stars.,954806400,,413,4.1375

1029234,5,6305426686,"This is a great movie about life in a modern day town.  It is set primarily in a pizza shop, featuring two brothers, one who is trying to find the meaning of life and love while the other is trying to get away  from it.  The writers of the movie, who come from Massachusetts, filmed the  movie to raise money for Leukimia pacients.  The movie is basically about  nothing.  The plot is like a lot of SNL skits thrown together.  Jennifer  Love Hewitt, who most know as the kind, straight-foward, smart, girl next  door in her movies, is an air-head fashion freak in this movie.  She is  still cute to watch.  This movie is exciting all the way through.  One will  laugh and laugh.  It is a great job done for an independent film. A",927849600,2,729,4.288888888888889

A marginally good movie that does have its moments with great points about love & relationships.  All of the performances are notable.  It was a little better than I had anticipated with a surprise at the end.  Definitely a mid-tier level comedy.  Very funny in some parts & worth seeing.",1523059200,,443,4.556962025316456

Here are some thing about Twilight and The Twilight Saga New Moon
The big-screen adaptation of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's bestselling vampire romance, is aimed squarely at its key demographic: teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment. Such a prince is more fascinating than frightening to new girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who moves to the rainy-gray town of Forks, Wash., to live with her dad (Billy Burke), the local sheriff who's puzzled by a series of ""animal attacks."" On her first day at school, Bella appears to (visibly) nauseate her lab partner, Edward (Robert Pattinson). Turns out the scent of her blood is this vampire's ""brand of heroin,"" and his struggle not to kill her causes an irresistible pull toward her. Whether he's attracted for the normal reasons or because she smells especially sweet to him is vague in the book and even less clear on-screen; nonetheless, Bella falls hopelessly in love with Edward, which sets her on a dangerous path when a few nomad vampires show up in town, one particularly keen on tracking the human. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen), Twilight is full of funny moments--not all of which are intentional--and the casting, from Stewart to Bella's self-absorbed friend Jessica (Anna Kendrick) is spot-on. The weakest link, unfortunately, is Pattinson. While he certainly looks the part, his Edward could have used an extra injection of testosterone (Pattinson, who is British, used James Dean as a model for his American accent). In scenes where he growls about the temptation to kill those who would harm Bella, or flitting around a forest warning her how dangerous he is, he comes off more like a whimpering puppy than a debonair monster. The good news is, his chemistry with Stewart (particularly in their big kissing scene) is palpable, which, let's face it, is really what matters to Twilight fans most. --Ellen A. Kim
On the DVD
The special features for Twilight kick off with an audio commentary with director Catherine Hardwicke and stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. There's some mumbling and groaning from Stewart (one gets the impression that Stewart is quite similar to her reserved character in the film), some standard behind-the-scenes observations from Hardwicke, and a lot of awkward self-deprecating remarks from Pattinson (of their big kiss, he opines: ""This is quite difficult 'cause I have a really flat head, and so it's quite difficult to get a correct angle.""). What's funny is Pattinson stumping Hardwicke with some basic plot questions, like ""Why doesn't James just kill [Bella when she's packing at her house]?"" While Hardwicke and Stewart attempt to answer, Pattinson doesn't appear satisfied. The deleted and extended scenes include an additional dream-sequence kiss (rightly cut because it took away from the buildup to their first kiss) and more footage of Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre). The seven-part documentary is a pretty thorough look at the development of the film, including stunts, special effects, and the involvement of author Stephenie Meyer. Another featurette looks at the Comic-Con frenzy; however, it spends no time on how the actors were cast, which would have been fun for fans who did all their own mental casting while reading the books. Also included: three music videos and trailers. --Ellen A. Kim Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doesn't expect much when she moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, until she meets the mysterious and handsome Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson)--a boy who's hiding a dark secret: he's a vampire. As their worlds and hearts collide, Edward must battle the bloodlust raging inside him as well as a coterie of undead that would make Bella their prey. Based on the #1 New York Times best-selling sensation by Stephenie Meyer, Twilight adds a dangerous twist to the classic story of star-crossed lovers.
New Moon, the second in Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster teen-fiction saga adapted for film, is stronger than its predecessor, Twilight. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass), taking the helm from Catherine Hardwicke, brings a lighter, more assured touch to the sequel, which continues the star-crossed love story of mortal Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson). Incidentally, Edward is absent for most of the film; after an accident on Bella's birthday reminds Edward that her life is always at risk when he's around, he chooses to abandon her, sending her into a deep depression. The only person who helps her heal her broken heart is her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a member of the Quileute tribe who, as he grows taller, beefier, and more aggressive (with less clothing), comes to realize he's not entirely human either. But even his love for Bella doesn't prevent her from throwing herself in the path of danger, because that's the only time she can see visions of Edward. One such fateful misunderstanding sends Edward into the coven of the Volturi (a sort of vampire Mafia, if you will), where the most dangerous vampires hold both Edward and Bella's fate in their cold, dark hands. Much of New Moon rests on the shoulders of Lautner, so scrawny in Twilight, who famously packed on the muscle to avoid getting recast. He's very nearly successful in carrying the load, but the cheese-tastic beefcake scenes disservice him, and Jacob and Bella's complicated friendship stumbles on its way to any kind of love triangle. Some of that blame lies with Stewart, who understandably holds her emotions close to her chest but reveals much too little (c'mon, even an angsty girl has to be a little joyful in the arms of two different hunks). As is with the book, the film is just a bridge between sagas, so the plot drags and not a lot happens. Fortunately, while Twilight was trapped in its own self-consciousness, the wobbly-legged cast seems to have found stronger footing in New Moon; the jokes come faster, the writing (by Melissa Rosenberg, who also scribed Twilight) is a hair wittier. (Even Pattinson seems more comfortable in Edward's skin.) The Volturi, highlighted by Michael Sheen's Aro and Dakota Fanning's Jane, also make an all-too-brief impression, but at least there's more to look forward to when Eclipse, the third installment, is released. --Ellen A. Kim In the second chapter of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling Twilight series, the romance between mortal Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) grows more intense as ancient secrets threaten to destroy them. When Edward leaves in an effort to keep Bella safe, she tests fate in increasingly reckless ways in order to glimpse her love once more. But when she's saved from the brink by her friend, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), Bella will uncover mysteries of the supernatural world that will put her in more peril than ever before.",1266710400,,10693,5.100399315459213

7889343,2,6305426686,"I was one of the writers on the original screenplay.  I think the movie turned out pretty well for a couple of first time writers.  Those of you who find so much fault with it should try writing your own screenplay-- very difficult. The script could definitely have used some work-- the director made very few changes to the original script.  BUt for  a first time adventure for all, not bad. If i had known then what I know now, the script would have been alot tighter.  But it was a a thrill to have such wonderful cast, I think they saw the simplicity in the plot and thought it would be fun; no one was expecting an Oscar nomination for the film.  So if you're looking for memorable plots and performances this movie is not for you.  It is not the worst movie ever made (How about Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do?)  It happens to the best of 'em.",1107475200,4,849,4.197530864197531
7889344,1,6305426686,"I would love to give this movie zero stars if I could. Jennifer Love Hewitt for such a popular actress has a proclivity for consistenly exposing her lack of genuine talent.  Jennifer Love is a cute girl who relies on a child-like simplicity  to perform all her roles to date, and in ""Telling You"" she is as vapid and air-headed as usual; ""Trojan War"", ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Heartbreakers"" et al.
This movie has a very boring plot and really bad direction, it is long-winded and not funny, thus none of the actors are served by it.
Dash Mihok was great in the movie ""Whiteboyz"" but he has nothing to work with in this poor screenplay.",1052352000,,633,4.495652173913044
7889345,4,6305426686,"The only thing I didn't like about this awesome movie is that stupid guy who showed up twice in the movie. He's tall(just to describe, not that tall means anything) and he can't act worth beans. He made the movie worse in those appearences, luckily, it was only twice and that's what saved the movie. That, and JLH was absolutely amazing!! She was the best! 4 stars for her, and none for the movie! Plotwise, well this movie didn't have a strong plot, but was pretty funny! LIke when JLH falls off her bed answering the phone! The other actors weren't so good, especially the main actor! But this movie was good enough, mostly JLH, but what can you do, not much, see this, it's worth it!!",1030406400,4,688,4.425196850393701

The cast is really good but they are wasted on a the story. The story may seem OK but there are too many long pointless conversations and boring moments which left me reaching for the ff button on my remote. Theres nothing really going on in the movie...if there is it takes forever to get going.
If you're a hard core Jennifer Love Hewitt or Peter Facinelli fan then this will be bearable...if not just catch it on tv!",1013558400,5,584,4.318181818181818
7889347,3,6305426686,"Even the stunning Jennifer Love-Hewitt could not provide an uplifting performance to justify rating this movie any higher.  It obtains this raiting simply because of content, not quality.",963964800,3,187,5.678571428571429
7889348,1,6305426686,"This was such a disappointing movie.  The previews made it seem like it would be great--starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Peter Facinelli and Matthew Lillard.  All three of them had been in movies I loved before like Can't  Hardly Wait.  But this was a very disappointing movie.
First the majority  of the movie takes place in a pizza parlor where Dash and Facinelli work.  It is mostly about life after school where some people are going off to  make the most of their lives and these guys are working in a slow pizza  place.  Hewitt is by no means the star or even a major role in this  movie--she palys an obnoxious girl and is on screen for a total of less  than 15 mintues.  A total waste.  And Lillard plays his usual role as a  hotshot, but like Hewitt, has his talent completely wasted in this  film.
I was so disapointed in this movie.  I expected more from a cast  that had produced other great movies in the past.  I wouldn't waste my time  or money on this movie.",963705600,11,972,4.329608938547486
