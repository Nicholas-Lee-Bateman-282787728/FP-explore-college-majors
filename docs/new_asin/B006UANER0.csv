5019840,5,B006UANER0,"Although I do agree with other reviewers that it's a little weird to get the first disc of season 1 of everything but Ed, Edd, &Eddy, I still thouroughly enjoyed this collection.  It brings me back to a time when kid's shows were cool not strange.  I not only like it for nostalgia purposes for myself, but it's a good little introduction to the series for my son.  He especially likes Courage because his previous favorite show was What's New Scooby Doo and this carries over with the monster theme I guess.  Overall a great buy.",1348617600,,530,4.489583333333333
5019841,5,B006UANER0,"If you like classic cartoons and Cartoon Network, then you should buy this DVD. It includes hours of classic cartoons from Cartoon Network!",1342656000,,139,5.086956521739131
5019842,4,B006UANER0,"The ""4 Kid Favorites: Cartoon Network Hall of Fame Collection"" may or may not be something worth buying for.  I mean, it's nice to see ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" a part of that series, but it's not really something I - or you - would expect.

Upon receiving this, you will find the first disc of each of the following: ""Johnny Bravo - Season One"", ""Courage the Cowardly Dog - Season One"", and ""Dexter's Laboratory - Season One"" plus the ""Ed, Edd n Eddy - Fool's Par-ED-ise"" individual release.  The ""two special features"" include the commentaries on the ""Johnny Bravo"" disc and ""The Plank Family Players"" shorts on the ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" DVD.

Personally, you'd be better off buying the complete first season releases of Johnny, Courage, and Dexter in full and they are still available, too.  Not to mention the complete first and second seasons of the Ed boys.  (To learn a bit more on these previous releases, check my reviews archive on these and more.)

But seriously, would it kill them to make a complete season release of other Cartoon Network classics like ""Cow and Chicken"" and/or continue the season releases of those series aforementioned plus ""The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"" and ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"".  Did I mention the first season of ""Cow and Chicken"" ?!  Well, que sera sera and all, just tune in to Cartoon Network on Friday nights for your old faves and more on the all-new ""Cartoon Planet"" block hosted by Brak and Zorak of ""Brak Show"" fame.",1337472000,9,1473,4.656370656370656
5019843,2,B006UANER0,"I saw this at the store and saw it was the hall of fame collection. What it didn't say was that it was only disc 1 of the first season box sets of Courage, Johnny, and Dexter's Lab and Volume 2 of Ed Edd N Eddy. If you were looking for individual episodes, the Ed's can handle that but the rest of the shows cant because they are from the Hall of Fame box sets that you may already have. this gets 2.5 stars. for a few reasons. 1. Not cool you only get half of the first seasons of a show if thats what I wanted I wouldv'e went to a goodwill and bought this. 2nd: At least they individualize the Ed episodes.",1335571200,2,608,3.911290322580645
5019844,5,B006UANER0,"If you want a bundle of these kids shows, this is it. I needed it for a theme week at school and I got it in time:)",1335052800,2,115,3.2962962962962963
5019845,5,B006UANER0,"Let's take a look at the lineup that Cartoon Network has today (and what I think of each show) compared to the old days: Level Up (Crap), Lego Ninjago (Really?), Regular Show (Eehh..Decent), Adventure Time (Best one of the whole lineup...), Amazing World of Gumball (Okay..), Secret Mountain Fort Awesome (Whaa...?), Johnny Test (Jokes get too overused), and the list goes on. In the ol' days, we had Ed Edd 'n Eddy (HILARIOUS!), Courage the Cowardly Dog (LOL!), Johnny Bravo (EXTREMELY FUNNY!), Dexter's Laboratory (HUMOROUS!), Billy and Mandy (Little bit gross, but HILARIOUS!), and I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.

The old Cartoon Network was the BOMB. It had shows that were actually funny, and there were hardly any bad ones of the bunch! In these recent times, however, the last awesome shows (Like Chowder, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and some others) have faded away, being shoved aside for anything that qualifies as pure suckage (Come on..Do we need LIVE ACTION series in a cartoon channel?).

Buying this one DVD allows you to (re)experience some of the best Cartoon Network had to offer. Johnny Bravo, Dexter, and Courage can all be seen on Boomerang, while Ed Edd n' Eddy still airs on CN at 4 o' clock, but having to get to see them all together on just one DVD, and with 8 episodes per series (Although 6 for Ed Edd 'n Eddy for some reason), is one major deal no one should pass up, especially if you're a fan if just ONE of these cartoons.",1333238400,15,1477,4.676923076923077
5019846,4,B006UANER0,"First off, what kind of collector are you?
If you're a hardcore fan of all these shows, and you want to own every episode, then this set is not for you.
However, if you like these shows and all you really want is a DVD set that's a compilation of episodes, then this set is an AMAZING and CHEAP set for you!
This set contains the first disc of each of the Hall of Fame sets except for Ed Edd n Eddy, which for some reason, is the Volume 2 DVD. Wouldn't it make more sense to have the first disc of the First Season they released a while back? Or if you're going to put a Volume in there, why not Volume 1? But, whatever.

 If you already own the Hall of Fame season sets, then I wouldn't bother with this release unless you're a completest like myself, or you just want to support these shows.",1331683200,21,793,4.044585987261146

5019864,5,B006UANER0,"This DVD is amazing and I'm very happy with my decision on purchasing it.
I say that you if cannot afford any of the seasons of Dexter's Lab,Johnny Bravo,Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Ed, Ed, N Eddie but still want the cartoons, you should definitely buy this.
 Because it comes with four DVD and each contains about 8 or more episodes from each CN Classics.
I miss watching all of these on Cartoon Cartoon back when CN was awesome and for kids!",1354492800,,445,4.426829268292683

5019866,4,B006UANER0,"Upon receiving this I was expecting it to be some sort of hall of fame but some are just the first season. I only wish they would've included something else in place of Johnny Bravo since I'm not such a huge fan of that show. It's a really really great buy though! Now, if could something something like this for the even older shows, such as Scooby Doo and Tom and Jerry and The Jetsons and The Flintstones. That would be nice.",1353715200,,428,4.2317073170731705
