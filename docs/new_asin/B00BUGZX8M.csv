5675725,1,B00BUGZX8M,"I seriously don't understand how these other people gave this movie such great reviews. It's terrible. The camera shots are awkward. The script is terrible. And the actors are trying so hard to act that they don't sound natural. The main character is supposedly this ladies man and it's not believable. I can't imagine him being able to hook up with so many girls in real life that he has three binders full of them. He sounds awkward when he talks to girls in the movie and the only thing he has going for him is that he is attractive. Just the fact that he has the binders with the names and pictures of them is evidence enough that the writer didn't know what they were talking about. No guy would keep a list like that, and guys who are hooking up with that many people probably won't remember their names. And then there's the actresses. Please. Even the most artificial girls you can find on the planet don't sound like that in real life. And the faces they make. God, talk about overacting. I could find random people on the street that could sound more realistic and I wouldn't be surprised if the actors/actresses in this movie were just random people off the street. And then there's the fact that this is supposed to be a love story. I didn't watch the whole movie to the end because I got really bored with it, but I didn't see any spark between the guy and this girl he's supposed to be falling for. It felt forced. And then there's these terrible lines that are supposed to be funny, like Rick says something about there being more girls than he can shake his stick at, or Candace (however it's spelled) introduces herself as moist and then as Candy and then finally as Candace. No. Just, no. If I could give this movie a negative rating, I would.",1385596800,5,1761,4.404907975460123
5675726,1,B00BUGZX8M,"I don't know what movie the three prior reviewers were watching, but this was terrible  My wife and I stopped watching after just 30 minutes because it was so bad.  The film production was cheap (low-quality even for an indie flick).  The script was poorly written and predictable.  The acting was atrocious.  Don't waste your time.",1385164800,4,332,4.857142857142857
5675727,5,B00BUGZX8M,"An enjoyable film from beginning to end.  Good story, well written, good cast and beautifully filmed.  Most importantly, good audio.  This is certainly a film I am not only happy to suggest to others, but to watch again.",1374192000,,220,4.7368421052631575
5675728,5,B00BUGZX8M,"Very fresh comedy with a nod to the beloved boy meets girl movies of the 80's. We kept repeating some of the great ""one liners"" long after the movie was over.  It's hard to find a romantic comedy that's as much of a guys movie as a girls movie- this one succeeds.  Maybe we have found this generation's John Hughes?",1372982400,,315,4.233333333333333
5675729,4,B00BUGZX8M,"I saw this movie at an industry screening last fall.  I didn't know what to expect going in, and walked out pleasantly surprised.  Great script, wonderfully acted by entire cast, beautifully shot, director did an overall exceptional job.  Recognized Michael McGlone and Ashley from ""The Human Centipede"" in it.  The actor who played Rick is very good.  The 90 minutes seemed to zip by, so my one complaint is that the movie should've been 10 or 15 minutes longer, possibly a longer 3rd Act would've made it even better.  The other standout in the solid cast is Shirin Tinati (I never heard of her, had to look up her name) -- I wish she would've had a bigger role; hope to see her in other things.  Overall, I would compare this movie to a really good pop album, each scene being like a skillfully-crafted infectious hit song.  I'm happy to see this movie is getting a release!",1368835200,,877,4.54140127388535

8574080,2,B00BUGZX8M,"mediocre at best.  The lead is cute, the idea for the script could make a good comedy, but needs some more work...",1421366400,,114,4.181818181818182
8574081,1,B00BUGZX8M,"Nice idea. Deep topic. Shallow output. Seemed like a script-reading, not acting. Lines being peppered back an forth. Nothing stuck.",1399507200,2,131,5.6
8574082,3,B00BUGZX8M,"This movie is good.  Not great.  I disagree with every other review on here because -- in my opinion -- this film isn't nearly as sterling as the positive reviews or nearly as dreadful as the negative reviews.

There are some cringe-worthy moments and a few more-than-obvious plot holes.  But the acting, for the most part, is exceptionally good.  The actor playing Rick more than holds his own and there are several other standout performances.  Michael McGlone's brief presence enhances the film.  Also, this film has an incredible array of GORGEOUS actresses and most of them play very engaging parts.  The actor playing God (reminds me of Ray Romano) is good also.

The plot is interesting, fun, and original, and the pace of the movie never drags.. with the exception of that staff-meeting conference room scene... WTF was that about???  Had nothing to do with the story, right???

Anyway, not bad.  I would've rated this movie 3.5 stars but they don't allow fraction ratings so I subtracted half-a-point because several exterior scenes had horrible background/city noise.",1389225600,,1077,5.056818181818182
