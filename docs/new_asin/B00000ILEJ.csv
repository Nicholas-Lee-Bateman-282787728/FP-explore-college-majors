Skip this one.  Voice over narration and sluggish, sluggish pacing make a great (*fun and interesting) subject like Chaplin, boring and tedious.

This was made in the 1970's and has as much enthusiasm as a film reel on assembly lines. Truly uncaptivating viewing.

The shows many slides and still photos while discussing his life and work. Many will be found in books elsewhere,  more vivid and annotated.",1481500800,,510,4.9411764705882355

Will recommend to friends and play for my enjoyment often!",1360886400,,141,5.454545454545454
7910766,1,B00000ILEJ,"Hi. I'm a Chaplin fan, and believe me, this DVD is not worth even trying to see. I thought it might contain something good ( I collect everything from Chaplin ) and this film just shows some parts from the Essanay films, narrated by some person who describes the film and mentions some general information about Chaplin. It was very disappoining.",1192838400,2,346,4.688524590163935
7910767,1,B00000ILEJ,"This DVD labels itself as a 'Documentary', but it's far frominformative. There's no personal Chaplin information, no realsubstance about his life and times. This DVD is really nothing but a few old Chaplin 2-reelers from his First National Days, with a narrator explaining what is going on.
The narration is uninformative, boring and does nothing but state the obvious.
Stay away. If you want to know about Charlie Chaplin, there are many informative books on his life. If you want to buy some DVDs, steer clear of this and buy the Mutuals or the Essanay collection.  END",950313600,21,571,4.88659793814433
