5104923,4,B007Q1GKR8,"I watched this series in its entirety when it originally aired and I'm happy to now own it on DVD. While Season 8 wasn't my favorite season of the show, it nevertheless continues the ongoing saga of the Carringtons, Colbys, and others. I really hope CBS home video will also release Seasons 1-2 of the Colbys on DVD, especially with recent announcement of Season 9 of Dynasty.",1403136000,,376,4.626865671641791
5104924,5,B007Q1GKR8,One of my favorite series. Waiting for Season nine that will play on my DVD player. Also would like the Dynasty Reunion mini series.,1402531200,,132,4.541666666666667

5104926,3,B007Q1GKR8,"The Carringtons and the Colbys reunited on Dynasty in Season 8 after the cancellation of Dynasty II: The Colbys (still unavailable on home video). It's problematic to follow Dynasty's plot lines between Season 6-8, because a lot of the characters reappearing in this season required the viewer's prior knowledge from plot points developing on its sister show.

Be that as it may, it's fairly easy to see why Dynasty (once the number one show in America) was fast fading from its former glory. The ongoing plots are weaker than average, the actors seemingly going through the motions in Season 8. There are times when Joan Collins and Linda Evans both look generally bored.

Also, Season 8 alters the iconic main titles, each character depicted in a more familial setting rather than presented against a backdrop of moneyed playgrounds of the rich and famous. A mistake. This isn't Thirty-Something or Melrose Place. These characters are not our next door neighbors but the people we'd all like to be as decadently rich as. Knocking them down a peg or two from their uber glamour only served to tear down the series faster than expected.  If you love Dynasty, as I do, you'll wish for it during its heady times (Seasons 2-6) and not what it became from Seasons 6-9.

Video quality is good, though hardly stellar. Some color bleeding and occasional edge effects. Paramount ought to take the entire franchise to digital hi-def where we could really appreciate it for Nolan Miller's costumes and glitz. Otherwise, buy accordingly.",1402099200,,1526,4.94921875
5104927,4,B007Q1GKR8,"I pre-ordered both volumes of DYNASTY Season 8 and watched the episodes in blocks until I finished.  I enjoyed every minute of the continuing intrigue among the Carringtons and the rest of the characters.  Despite what others have said, I feel that for the most part, the show did not lose its edge in the latter seasons.  Frankly I could've done without the subplot of Fallon's alien encounter in the desert because it seemed more approprirate for THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  That notwithstanding, I enjoyed my purchase.

Sometimes the disk seemed to stop in mid-play.  Granted I solved this problem by rinsing the DVD with warm water.  But this is a brand new DVD release and rinsing the disk shouldn't be necessary.  Tsk tsk tsk.

I am eagerly awaiting Season 9 and the reunion movie.  And when are the powers that be going to release DYNASTY II:  THE COLBYS on DVD?  Give the fans what they want already!",1401321600,,900,4.662420382165605
5104928,4,B007Q1GKR8,"Enjoyed seeing the dvds as they filled in the gaps from when the series originally aired.  Besides having to wait too long in between releases, I find them very expensive.  Amazon seems to have the best price but it's still expensive.",1401235200,,234,4.682926829268292

5104930,4,B007Q1GKR8,"After hearing so many go on about how Dynasty went down after Season 7, etc... I was ready to be let down. I used to following Dynasty when it was on first run but that has been so many years ago, I have forgotten a lot.

I really enjoyed this season. It was not so quite over the top as other seasons and for me that was a good thing. Also there were many more story lines with the younger cast members instead of just always Blake, Alexis and Krystle. Also the season finale, which I am leaving vague if case you have not seen it yet, was more satisfying and again not so over the top as other seasons. Even though I admit I loved most of the past seasons finales, this one I enjoyed as well.

I can not believe after all these years we are finally only down to one more season after this: Season 9: The Final Season to be released. Since it was less than a year this season was released after seven. I'm hoping the same will occur with Season 9. Then after that I really hope Dynasty: The Reunion miniseries will be released. And also the Dynasty spinoff Dynasty II: The Colbys. Since that was 1 1/2- 2 seasons hoping that will be released as the complete series. We shall see.",1399852800,,1180,4.171052631578948
5104931,5,B007Q1GKR8,"Dynasty Season 8 offers a lot of plot and entertainment. Alexis and Krystle have a rope pulling contest and guess who ends up in the mud ? It has always been my favorite night time serial, and I am happy it has slowly become available on DVD. The show looks better than when first broadcast. Highly recommended.",1399507200,,311,4.473684210526316

5104933,5,B007Q1GKR8,"The set was worth the wait, the episodes look great, they have been remastered. The ""Last Time on Dynasty"" segments are unfortunately not included before each episode, that would have made it complete. The previews included some scenes not in the actual episode, e.g. Fallon on the phone to Blake in the last season on Dynasty segment.
The US 2-volume set released in April 2014 includes 6 discs, 3 in each and has the remastered picture. The UK release from 2012 is one complete set and is of much poorer picture and sound quality, some reviews here refer to that Region 2 version. But the region 2 version does have the Last time on Dynasty segments...",1399075200,,654,4.646551724137931
5104934,5,B007Q1GKR8,"I have seen all the previous seasons, and I am waiting for the the next (Vol. 2). I just love the series, very good actors and actress, the star: John Forsythe  is my favorite actor, in the series. And play's his character so well, and so real. And so human.  The whole cast, are wonderful.",1399075200,,290,4.254545454545455
5104935,5,B007Q1GKR8,"Season 8 improves from the weak season 7, introduces the fantastic season 9 with a furious and dramatic finale: The Krystle-character is given a last strong storyline before she has to leave in early season 9. Characters from the cancelled Colby series will return: Fallon, Jeff, Sable, Monica and at least Miles in the reunion. The paymont for Charlton Heston, who should also appear in several episodes was too high, so he is just mentioned sometimes. Alexis and Dex are involved in a murder, before they reunite and Blake also has to face a deadly truth about his beloved wife...all in all really entertaining 22 Episodes.",1398038400,,625,4.90566037735849

5104937,1,B007Q1GKR8,"Season 9 was WAY better than Season 8 (or several years prior) and any valid DYNASTY fan knows that.

Several awful previous years ruined the show, including Season 8.

But at least Season 9, with a new producer, gave fans one final great year --- even though it was too late to save the series from the axe.",1396656000,7,308,4.293103448275862

5104939,4,B007Q1GKR8,"Television legends John Forsythe, Joan Collins and Linda Evans headline the glittering ensemble, while entertainment titan Aaron Spelling and creators Richard and Esther Shapiro have devised spectacular new surprises for the essential 8th Season of the landmark hit drama.

Additionally, in this 1987-88 Season, powerful new players join the Carrington/Colby blood feud along with all the trademark glamour, high drama and eye-popping twists and turns - including a deadly hostage crisis, a brutal race for high office, a heart-wrenching battle over a surrogate baby and a final, fatal gunshot. Like no other series before or since, DYNASTY is the ultimate guilty pleasure.",1389052800,,673,5.598039215686274
5104940,5,B007Q1GKR8,"CBS/Paramount has made it official: ""Dynasty-Season 8"" will be released in full on April 29th, 2013. The season, like some previous seasons, will be released in a full set and split into two different sets, Part 1 and Part 2.

 This season of ""Dynasty"" was certainly not the greatest year in the show's history. The season started in the fall of 1987 and ABC only ordered 22 shows, down from the 30 or 34 episodes ordered from the previous years. Gone from the cast was Diahann Carroll whom the writers couldn't come up with any story ideas for and the fact Aaron Spelling couldn't afford to pay her high salary.

 Coming in at a paltry #33 in the Nielsen Ratings with a rating of 14.33, ""Dynasty"" started to air an hour earlier. Much of the fun this season focused on Alexis' new relationship with a mystery man Sean Rowan, a sexy and hunky man who could make wallpaper peal but whose acting was simplistic at best. Taking a cue from Joan Collin's personal life that year (she had divorced her younger husband who nearly left her broke) the writer's wrote a story where Alexis is manipulated into allowing this man control of her finances while he plotted to kill her.

 This season also marked the return of sexy John James and beautiful Emma Samms as Jeff and Fallon.

 Hopefully, season 9, the series' last, will become available this summer!!!",1388102400,14,1348,4.610878661087866
5104941,5,B007Q1GKR8,"Season 8 marked the beginning of the end for dynasty.
 Already by 1987-1988 when this season was released in television that type of soap crazed era had already begun to fade and only dallas was still hanged at the nielsen's top 20 shows.
 Dynasty's last season was the last to be in nielsen's top 30 and with the release of the 8th season the show droped to #33 for 1988.
 The colbys were already canselled since 1987 and dynasty was soon to follow two years later in 1989.
 For the die hard fans this was the last real dynasty season although it was weak compared to the earlier seasons it still held some interest until season 9 came and finished the show for good.
 I already own all 9 dynasty seasons in region 2 but i'm glad that the show is also released in region 1 cause i hope in america they will finally release THE UNRELEASED SO FAR DYNASTY 1991 REUNION which sadly was never released in region 2 so i hope we get it at least in region 1 plus a few extras if possible (the E? true hollywood story and the dynasty 2006 reunion special show)
