I waited a long time to see this movie, since the cast includes one of my favorites: the great American character actor Nat Pendleton (1895-1967).  If that name is not familiar, don't be surprised if you still recognize him immediately, as Pendleton was the big ex-wrestler lummox who expertly played the dimwitted gangster in countless 1930s films.  Think Jethro with a tommy gun.  Cast also includes Barry Mackay (1906-1985, a frequent Matthews love interest) and Alastair Sim (1900-1976), a genuine college professor best remembered as the Scrooge of the 1950s.  GANGWAY is not EVERGREEN, by any means: the plot is ridiculous, the characterizations cartoon-like, but, hey, this is Jessie Matthews in her prime!!",1421193600,,883,5.190140845070423
8220361,5,B00004CSEU,"Any fan of Jessie Matthews should buy this.  The only negative thing is this is on VHS and not DVD.  I bought a different VHS copy of the film about a year ago.  That one was average print quality and there was an obvious scene missing.  In this print the quality is great (I give it 9 out of 10).  Also it turned out there were three scenes missing, two of them with Jessie.  Based on the original running at the movie's release, this is a complete print.",1306022400,3,456,4.125
