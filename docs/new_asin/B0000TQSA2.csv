8002778,5,B0000TQSA2,It is a very interesting movie about my favorite Beckham,1461628800,,56,4.7
8002779,4,B0000TQSA2,This is a really interesting look at the years that David Beckham has spent at Man U. The one thing that got a little repetitive was the fact that they showed allll of his goals. If they had more interviews and just some overviews I would have given it 5 stars. Even though some parts are long its a great look at David Beckham's career!!!....So ENJOY IT!!,1142899200,,356,4.3283582089552235
