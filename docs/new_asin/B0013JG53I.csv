8251262,4,B0013JG53I,"I'm very happy to finally have a good print of ""Lorna Doone"".  It's a pity that it's Region 2, though.  I was unable to get the DVD to play the final 4 or 5 minutes and was sent a replacement by the seller (DaaVeeDee).  The replacement played fine until the final 90 seconds.  Thankfully, this is not copy protected and so it's possible to make a DVD-R copy and append the final 90 seconds from a poorer copy.  I hope this is released in Region 1.
The film is quite enjoyable, though the first 18-minutes with the children is rather dull and spoiled by wooden acting.  Once the adults take over, it's an exciting and romantic swashbuckler.  Richard Greene and Barbara Hale are excellent as the leads, and the actors playing the villains acquit themselves well.
Typical of classic Hollywood historical pictures, this is a brighter story than the novel, but it works well as a swashbuckler, with exciting waterfall sequences and some fine duels.",1389830400,,943,4.678787878787879
8251263,4,B0013JG53I,"The United States audience is missing a great version of this timeless classic. It was released in the PAL format in Europe and not here. As I have access to a pristine 16mm copy and have viewed this many times, I can tell you that the color work done by Technicolor Labs is some of the best Ive ever seen. The story takes place in the Moors in the 1600s and stars Richard Greene and Barbara Hale. When John Ridd (Greene) climbs the waterfall it is breathtaking. Emerging from a hole in rock at the top of the falls he first encounters the princess (Hale). This scene is one not to be forgotten it is so beautiful. The entire story has not only romance, but plenty of action, sword fights, and decent acting that is well paced. Again, its hard to believe that this has not been released by Columbia, as its a fine film all the way thru.",1207353600,11,836,4.264150943396227
