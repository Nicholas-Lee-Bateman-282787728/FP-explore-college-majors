Lots of foul language and graphic scenes, but that's what makes it good!!! 4 of their music videos are also included they are: I'm Broken, 5 Minutes alone, Drag the Waters, and Planet Caravan. Lots of cool concert footage. A different part on each of the crew members. A really cool and entertaining video.  END",898300800,2,397,4.753623188405797

I own the DVD and it's an absolute killer. Can't wait to sit down and actually watch it on VHS. Getcha pull!",1498348800,,280,4.30188679245283

8204350,5,6304528744,"The drunken anthology of one of the best bands in heavy metal, Pantera's ""3: Watch it Go"" is hilarious from beginning to end.  The only gripe is there are no live performances as in Pantera's previous home videos, but we get the music videos for ""I'm Broken"", ""5 Minutes Alone"", the trippy ""Planet Caravan"", and ""Drag the Waters"", plus cameo appearences from Marilyn Manson, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Biohazard, Kiss, and NIN mastermind Trent Reznor in what may be the funniest segment of the video.  Strongly recommended to any Pantera fan along with their previous two home videos, or get the DVD ""3 Vulgar Videos From Hell"" if you have a DVD player and save some cash.",1011484800,,676,4.720338983050848

It shows all the good stuff you want to see: CFH demolishing a dressing room, naked chicks, dimebag's practical jokes, wagers on everything, and the badass videos. I'm broken and five minutes alone is enough to buy this video, it's entertaining and makes you want to be a roadie. Even the crew is funny:wiggins, the cat, the package, lean on it, and the famous BIG VAL. WATCH IT GO 666.",992736000,,404,4.5479452054794525
