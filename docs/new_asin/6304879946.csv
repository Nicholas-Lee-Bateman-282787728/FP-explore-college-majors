940600,5,6304879946,"Jhon Romer's DVD is truly stunning! It deals with a thousand plus year empire apparently overlooked by recent historians. It also conveys an ambiance which transports viewers into the mystery of the Byzantium empire itself. It's my all time favorite DVD documentary. The music adds a haunting quality as it beckons the senses to absorb the culture that made it history's most astonishing civilization. I've recommended it to many. Bravo!! Mr. Romer

I first found it on YouTube, and I wanted a copy on DVD. It's my favorite period in history. John Romer gives a passionate explanation of Byzantium from a Christian point of view. He didn't go into the details of byzantium's culture and government, but still a good documentary.",1370390400,,418,4.901408450704225

This isn't a step by step history and I don't understand what people expected. John Romer's passion for his subject shines in this dvd set as well. It was done back in 1997 and I watched it there first. Then I saw it again recently and it's still worth watching. The fact that on here the prices are outrageous is do to the greed of the sellers who automatically like to jack up prices of out of print items. There are four episodes here and they are a good overview that really imparts how grand the Eastern roman empire was. the film quality looks like it was transfered from vhs. It's clear and looks decent but perhaps the film is faded a bit. Still that didn't detract from me enjoying this in the least.",1358726400,,949,4.307262569832402
940603,4,6304879946,"American students of history are served well by Professor Romer's documentary. He is the first historian we have seen, who documents the fact that Constantine the Great (313 ad) moved his empire's capitol from ""old"" Rome in Italy to his ""new Rome"". Belgrade was his first choice, but its site had too many pagan remnants, and was too close to the barbarian hordes that were threatening his people and governance. Romer, however, does not mention the origins of the misnomer, ""Byzantine"": Europeans invented this name because they (from Charlemagne's time) claimed the title ""(Holy!) Roman Empire"" for themselves. Therefore, they created a new, obscure title for the real Roman Empire - with its Ancient Christian Faith - which had moved east to avoid barbarian attacks which eventually destroyed Old Rome Italy.  Napoleon fancied himself a new ""roman emperor"",like Charlemagne, so historians in his time coined the name ""Byzantine"" Empire. Yet, in the Middle East even to this day, Orthodox Christians are known as ""Roum"" (Roman) Christians. Prof. Romer gives an excellent report on Crusaders' sacking and pillaging of Constantinople (1204 ad) during the 50-year reign of their latin king. According to another well-documented history of this empire, ""Fall of an Empire: Lesson of Byzantium"" (on Youtube), the banking systems in Europe were founded on the tons of gold melted down into coinage.  Romer takes care to respect Orthodox Christianity, although his segment on ""Icons"" reveals the usual misunderstandings common to non-Orthodox. He is an art historian, after all, not a theologian. His use of source documents adds evidence pointing to the envy of barbaric Franks, who after taking over the papacy (10th century) began their war against Orthodox Christians in their first crusade against Orthodox Britain in 1066 ad. (Orthodox scholar/theologian Dr. J.S.Romanides has this same theme based on many more source documents. The Frankish barbarians' trophy in battle was the Roman Capitol known for its erudition, education, and grandeur, Constantinople. Having done our own research on this subject, we appreciate this honest historian, invaluable for his insights into the everyday life of this graced Eastern Roman Empire which flourished for 1,000 years by the grace of God!",1357862400,,2284,5.377094972067039

940606,5,6304879946,"True to the title, this gives a great introductoin to the history of the lost Byzantine Empire. But it is just an introduction to the topic, so those who are already familiar with the subject will not learn much. First and foremost, the show gives a nice and simple narriative of the history of the Eastern Empire, from it's beginnings under Emperor Constantine to the Ottoman conquest. The narrator can seem a bit flip at times, but overall he does a good job (one can blame his British sense of humor for this). He also does a very nice job of explaining how the Byzantine Empire ultimatly enriched the West (notably by influencing the Italian Renisance). In discussing the history, the show also attempts to give you an idea of what historic Constantinople must have been like in its heyday. This is hard to do since most all of the significant buildings from historic Constantinople have been completely destroyed (the most notable exception being Haga Sophia). Relative to ancient Rome, there just isn't as much of the old Eastern Roman Empire left in Istanbul. So the show has fewer visual ""props"" to work with. Nevertheless, it manages to compensate for this in numerous ways. The show must be a bit dated because it lacks any fancy computer graphics recreating historic Constantinople. Nevertheless the host does an excellent job of describing events and structures.

Bottom line: This program does a nice job of summarizing a thousand years of ancient history in four 50-minute programs.",1330819200,2,1496,4.913043478260869

The overall impression is that it's low budget and outdated; furthermore, the picture is grainy so it isn't even visually stimulating.

940609,1,6304879946,"I was extremely disappointed by this DVD.  I am an ancient history junky and I have been to many of sites mentioned in the DVD.  Based on the DVD's description and reviews, I was hoping to see footage of artifacts never seen before or at least not accessible for the ordinary visitor.  We did see some of that, but it was very limited.  I thought the documentary was very shallow given the length of the recording time.  There was very little information provided and it focused mainly on the religious aspect.  While religion was very important in Byzantium (although you could argue that Byzantium was more important to Christianity that the other way around), Byzantium was a multi-faceted society and very, very little of that was explored.  I take particular issue with Romer's presentation.  He seemed like he was trying to be ""poetic"" or ""cute"" and talk a lot without saying much of substance.  In fact, he was often repetitive and sounded like a broken record.  The information presented was not organized in any logical manner.  Romer seems to have forgotten that he was writing for a documentary, not a literary essay.  This documentary fails to provide the viewer with an accurate summary description of what Byzantium was about.  This DVD was made in 2007, but it appears to be a copy of the VHS edition released in 1997;  the video quality is not the best and it feels old.  This is the most boring and less fulfilling ancient history documentary I have ever viewed.",1294099200,5,1479,4.745098039215686
940662,5,6304879946,This really was a new world for me.  I have read through lots of ancient history but never really knew much about Byzantium.  This provided an excellent introduction.

I would recommend buying this film and really enjoyed disc 2 (Forver and Ever)

940664,5,6304879946,"Recent negative reviews of John Romer's 1997 documentary series reveal how much documentary film making has changed in the last decade.  For those of us who are Romer fans, most of this change has been for the worse.  A concentration on historical recreation, flashy CG effects and supplying 'facts', typical of much History Channel product of recent years (predicated as it is on the notion that most watchers suffer from a major attention deficit problem and lack a general historical knowledge, or any ability to use TV as a springboard to further reading), has dumbed down a lot of what is offered.  Thus documentary making, with a few notable exceptions, has largely become a niche sub market of the 'Entertainment' industry.

John Romer never treated his audience as idiots or the television medium as necessarily simplistic and trivializing.  His treatment of historical subjects is also strongly thematic, especially concerned with the history of ideas, and as such inevitably selective in nature.

So yes, this series could have dealt with Basil the Bulgar Slayer, or the consequences of the Battle of Manzikert, or how to make icons or what Byzantines wore or hundreds of other important or less unimportant events and developments, but its failure to do so is neither here nor there, and does not detract from the excellence of this series.  It does not aim at completeness and its organization is on a higher and more ambitious level than providing a simple chronological narrative.

As to those reviewers who find Romer's presentation style annoying, well all I can say, like many others, is that, in my opinion, he is among the best and most natural presenters of this style of documentary, with a lot of humour and warmth, but combined with an uncanny ability to examine ancient artifacts with both an artist's and historian's eye simultaneously: never afraid to use the television camera to examine both form and content.

Hopefully, there will come a time when we will see a new wave of historical documentary makers who, like Romer, see television as something valuable in its own right as an educative tool rather than just more 'factual programming' fodder for cable programming.

For those who enjoy this style of documentary series may I also recommend two of Romer's finest series, recently released by Athena (Acorn) in North America: 'Ancient Lives (1984) and 'Testament' (1988).",1275350400,22,2404,5.063291139240507
940665,3,6304879946,"I expected something different from Byzantium: The Lost Empire than the DVD presentation actually delivers.  That doesn't mean it wasn't worth watching, but I just thought it could have been a lot better.

Narrator John Romer basically wanders about the lands of the Old empire (mostly Turkey) and shows the remaining wonders - now often in a ruined state. From time to time the presentation goes into deeper explanations, especially about the Christian church at the time.

Where the DVD lost me is that it was too artsty for my tastes. They often show artifacts at unique camera angles, then fade from one image to another. Also, the whole presentation wanders about from one site to the next, like a conversation that jumps from one topic to the next without following a guideline. I often wanted to know what the inscriptions on stone said, or when they were built. You get that sometimes, but not often enough.

After watching the presenation I still don't have a good feel for Byzantium. I know it was basically a continuation of the Roman Empire, but have little idea how the people lived or how the ruling class managed to keep it going for another 1,000+ years. 3 stars is about all I can give it.",1266192000,3,1206,4.6745283018867925
940666,3,6304879946,"Although John Romer is excellent when telling the story, you have to use lots of imagination.

A little re=creation would have been great, the kind done in the videos from the history channel.  I had a hard time keeping myself awake and I really wanted to learn about this topic.

The programs, hosted by John Romer, are fascinating travelogues as well as historical investigations into the once great Byzantine Empire.  Romer visits far flung outposts of the empire where tantalising evidence remains of the civilisation that once dominated much of Europe and parts of the near east.

A poignant air of melancholy persists throughout the programs, as Romer finds tantalising bits and pieces of Byzantium that were carried off or reused by her conquerors, both Christian and Muslim.

The scenery is wonderful, the filming superb, the commentary enlightening and entertaining.  Though a film format cannot capture the depth of material of a book, this is still well worth the investment for the big picture view.  Many important characters and events in a thousand year history must be left out and that is disappointing but understandable for a film.

940725,5,6304879946,"First night I received the DVD set I stayed wathing this 208 min long
documentary till 2 AM in the morning.

Presenter, John Romer, is probably the best presenter of the documentaries I have ever seen on TV. His tells the stories of the greatest cultural and historical value in a lyrical, enaging personal style making you wanting to watch the whole documentary all in one viewing.

Being originally from this broader region, and having a foundation in the material itself I still found the tremendous value and the depth in this documentary. Learning was constant, but it never felt forced or dry.

Interestingly, there were no flashy maps, reenactments, big computer generated effects to ""keep you interested"". Contrary, at one point in the show John Romer pulls out the Rand McNally map of the Istambul, unfolds it and holding it on the ground, with a marker, draws the expected location of the once standing Imperial Palace.

Now, to answer the question that comsumers as well as Amazon equally care about:

Why should one buy this DVD?

You should do so:

- if you are interested in establishing the cultural and civilizational link between the Ancient Greece, Roman Empire and the Western Societies
of the medieval ages.

- understanding the origins of many essential Christian beliefs, rituals, traditions and symbolisms.

- learn essential historical and archeological facts about the Byzantium

940728,5,6304879946,"Having visited Istanbul (formerly Constantinople) recently, I became interested in learning more about the Byzantine Empire. For me, John Romer, who both wrote and narrates this program, was an excellent guide.

Like many people, I assumed that the Roman Empire disappeared with the Sack of Rome (476 AD). When Romer pointed out that the Empire simply shifted to the East with its center at Constantinople, my reaction was ""Of course!""

Unfortunately, as a result of the iconoclastic movement that took place around 800 AD, most of the great Byzantine art was destroyed. That which has survived was looted by the Crusaders of the 4th Crusade (1405 AD), much of it ending up in Venice.

Thus, most of this film shows Romer wandering around in the architectural ruins of the empire.

A surprise at the end was Romer's revelation that an exotic figure in the frescoes on the walls of the Magi Chapel in the Medici Palace in Florence was Emperor John VIII of the Eastern Empire (see customer image at top of page), who had come to Europe seeking help in keeping the Ottoman Turks from capturing and sacking Constantinople. He failed and Constantinople was lost in 1453.

Perhaps because virtually all of Romer's information was new to me, I thoroughly enjoyed this video. Other, more sophisticated, viewers may react differently.

Unfortunately, I was dissatisfied with the style of the presentation, and, far worse, found the host to be terribly dull.

John Romer is obviously an expert on all things Byzantine.  This does not, however, dictate he is acceptable as a documentary host.  The feature is not at all what I was expecting -- it was merely John Romer parading about in front of one ancient site after the next (the Hagia Sophia, ruins of ancient Constantinople, etc.), rambling on about the ""glories of By-ZAN-tium"".  I spell the term phoentically because his hyper-pronunciation of the second syllable well and truly worked my last nerve at his every utterance of that word.

Besides his expansive knowledge of the subject matter, the second aspect of Romer which is glaring is the love affair he has with the sound of his own voice.  This proved very tiresome after a short period of attempting to enjoy his unceasing monologues about the ancient Byzantine empire.

I would have enjoyed this much more if the format had included different presenters, with Romer doing pieces of the exposition rather than the entire piece on his own.  I also disliked the ""travelogue"" format, where one is presented with modern-day shots alone of the sites featured, rather than historical reproductions.

In any format, this is a fascinating and very well developed documentary about the Byzantine Empire that ruled from Constantinople from 337 AD until the Turkish seizure on May 29, 1453.  John Romer, the writer and presenter, goes into great detail of the major artisitic, architectual and religious influences, countless empowering and debilitating world events, and personalities that composed the 1,000 year history of the empire.  His narration is simple and beautiful at the same time.  It's obvious that he has great love and knowledge concerning the Byzantine civilization.

I love the approach of Romer's visiting and pointing out the modern locations while using his narrative abilities to ""paint a picture"" of how the Byzantines lived and ruled.  We're shown the earliest Byzantine books and how they influenced the iconoclastic fervor in 8th century AD (Romer is in the Vatican library extensively), Syrian fortresses that fought the early Arab invasions, Justinian and his wife's mission to revive the ancient Roman ideals by conquest and blood, and how the peasants lived, including their diet, farming products, and manufacturing processes (Romer visits a Syrian ruin and details the process of creating wine in that era).

Too bad there isn't an accompanying web site for anyone interested in futher learning about this great civilization. (This film was released in 1997, and should have had one!) The actual video (both tapes) is close to 4 hours viewing time.  This documentary is invaluable to anyone interested in Byzantine history.  An absolute gem!",1119744000,13,1776,5.26241134751773

For some reason the West has decided to ignore the Bulwark of Constantinople that protected the West from the forces of the East for over a 1000 years. Maybe because they stabbed the Greeks in the back in 1204. Anyway, Mr. Romer as usual did a wonderful job setting out the history of a great people. I can safely say that its a great film to behold.",1114732800,16,463,4.333333333333333

I also would like this video to be reissued in DVD format. More importantly, however, I would like Romer's older T.V. series on ancient Egypt to be published as a DVD set. To date, I am unable to track it down. If anyone knows of its existence, please advise. Thanks.

940785,5,6304879946,"John Romer does an excellent job telling the history of Byzantines. His vast knowledge of Roman/Byzantine history was quite evident. His explanation of the Resurrection Icon was the best I have ever seen. I shown it to my students and months later they still remembered. His telling of the fall of the city and the Death of Constantine XI was beautiful, and yet sad. I just wish I could find the icons of Constantine XI dying that John Romer used in the film. All-in-All, a great guide to the Byzantine/Roman Empire",1056326400,11,515,4.670329670329671

He brilliantly illuminates the Byzantine empire and makes it come alive on your screen.  The thing which I believe makes all of Mr. Romer's series so enjoyable and enlightening is his own sense of wonder and his ability to communicate that sense of wonder to his audience.  That is what makes history (and most other subjects) so enthralling to some people while the majority find it boring and uninteresting.  Please continue producing wonderful videos, Mr. Romer, and I will continue to share your sense of wonder with my family!  Thanks.",1026000000,12,677,4.752136752136752
940787,5,6304879946,"Many Americans know little of any history, even their own.  And what little they know of world history is mostly caricature.  This series of four videos goes a long way toward helping to explain one of the least known of world histories, that of Byzantium.  John Romer does a super job of putting the long history of Byzantium into some kind of context for us.  The concept that the Roman Empire did not ""fall"" but survived in the East until the 15th century may be astonishing to most of us, but so it was.  Romer also deals fairly with the sack of Byzantium by the Crusaders in 1204 (as opposed to the vitriolic treatment given it by Terry Jones in another recent video series).  Particularly wonderful is the second episode of the series which deals with the role of icons in Byzantine culture and with the brutal history of Byzantine iconoclasm.  The art and architecture of Byzantium forms a large part of the series and with great justice, as a reflection of the society that produced it.",1021593600,61,994,4.581920903954802

7879614,4,6304879946,"A nice introductory piece for anyone not already familiar with the Byzantines. Its like a documentary ""lite"" in the sense that the viewer is not overloaded with so many facts and figures.  Romer almost seems lost in aesthetics at times, which is ok with me.  He takes us to all sorts of venues in and around the old Byzantine empire--old Constantinople, Mistra, and other locations. This series has a sort of charming quality to it that keeps you interested.  So long as you don't expect Romer to turn into Kenneth Harl, you will like it just fine.

 Production quality is pre-HD and the same music cycles over and over again throughout which is a bit tiresome by the last installment--but tolerable. It grows on you like elevator music.",1449619200,,737,4.7265625
7879615,2,6304879946,"The lone commentator journeying around ancient cities begins to wear thin when you realize he or she does not bring in additional scholarship. In other words, all the perspective is from one angle similar to a Rick Steves exploration of a European tourist attraction. Despite an incredible subject, the History of the Byzantine Empire prior to the rise of Western Europe, I felt that the reliance solely on John Romer's perspective and narration kept the documentary one dimensional which was frustrating if not rather boring. At several moments, my interest began to wane. The Gonzo-like journalism in which the viewer is not only supposed to be enthralled with the ancient sites but enthralled with John Romer's own fascination diminished the import of the subjects being discussed. Somehow, the narrator also playing sole commentator makes for a rather distracting experience. I prefer documentaries of this type in which the narrator and the commentator(s) are separate.

Aside from the Gonzo format, the other major problem is that the documentary lacks a clear thesis. What was Romer's goal aside from showing us interesting ruins? The documentary is mainly an exploration of ancient sites and a few artifacts with Romer standing in front of almost every ancient building. Romer then presents some history, but almost off-handedly. He would walk around a site and tell some stories about what happened there, but I wanted to hear the larger story, particularly about the reign of Emperor Constantine. As the documentary unfolds, I realized Romer never used to stills and did a poor job of explaining the chronology of events. Another frustration was Romer would bounce from city-to-city but it was not always clear where we were exploring. At one point he jumps from Istanbul (aka Constantinople) to Ravenna, Italy and back without clarifying that we had returned to Istanbul.

A far superior documentary on a similar subject is Secrets of the Dark Ages. The format is somewhat similar: a journalist-scholar goes on a quest of exploration to uncover the many mysteries of the Barbarians. However, in Dark Ages, the goal is very clear: to debunk previous prejudices about the so-called Barbarians. The host meets a plethora of scholars and experts that tell him (and us) about many of the unknown aspects of Barbarian culture which fit into his larger purpose. I would have loved to hear the perspective of local scholar-historians in Istanbul explain the historical implications of the Byzantine Empire but Romer decided to do it all himself. With the numerous scholars who have spent entire lifetimes studying this history, Romer really does not have much of an excuse for not using other scholars. If there was a larger point to the documentary Byzantium, I missed it, and maybe that's the other big problem.",1433030400,,2816,5.132897603485839
7879616,5,6304879946,"Even though this was a ""used"" DVD set, it was in mint condition and played beautifully with no skipping or pixelation. Shipping was fast and secure.

And of course the production itself, was absolutely marvelous, as have been all of John Romer's productions. He truly brings history to life and makes it interesting. If we had teachers like this in school, perhaps fewer students would drop out.

This is a wonderful production spanning the life of Byzantium from start to finish, an area of  history that is little known and gets little attention in our public schools. We were always lead to believe that Rome fell in 476 CE or AD, followed by the Dark Ages and a retreat into barbarity, ignorance and illiteracy, when reality was quite the opposite. Byzantium picked up where Rome left off and continued on for another 977 years !!!

The Byzantine Empire was replete with marvelous art, architecture, science, literature and astronomy. This was quite an eye-opener for me, as I am sure that it will be for any who buy or rent this DVD, which is becoming quite rare and unavailable.",1427932800,,1084,4.75

I would have liked it more if a more livelier narrator/host was used as there were times that John Romer many times had lulled me to sleep with his monotone voice. I had to rewind the documentary a few times to see what I had missed during my nap. I am glad that I did because there truly were quite a bit of interesting facts that I wanted and needed to know about this historic time for my research. The other thing that might put people off about this documentary is that it is difficult to find, and thus sold at a premium (even used copies)!  Unless you really need a good, reliable resource for your research/scholarly work, or need to complete your DVD collection on history, or simply love this era, or are wealthy, I would suggest that you wait for either the selling prices to fall, or something more affordable on the Byzantine Empire gets released.",1424476800,,1025,4.510752688172043
