8237935,5,B0010K46YU,"Saw this quirky and creative German film in the USA theater when it was released. We loved this entertaining film from start to unexpected ending. It took you into the character's world and kept the interest up right up till the end. Sorry to see it end!
Photography and colors were amazing too.
Can't figure out why it never made it to the USA on DVD?",1245888000,,352,4.348484848484849
