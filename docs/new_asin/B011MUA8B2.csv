7337861,5,B011MUA8B2,"Indeed, the Season Two of Penny Dreadful, was spectacular, exciting and emotional. I was pleased with the acting. I believe that in this cult series, collected the best constellation of contemporary actors. What is remarkable for this series? Here you will find both positive and negative characters. Each character has individual characteristics and each of them has its own special mystery. A mystical atmosphere is fascinating, and the plot is built in a dynamic way. I loved the second season and I hope we will see a continuation of the third season.",1439424000,4,555,5.043478260869565

Possible spoilers

As season 2 comes into its own, as ever Penny Dreadful, continues to provide sumptuous sets and gothic atmosphere. This is a season, where Helen McCrory comes to the fore; she plays the head of a Lucifer-worshipping coven, her singular mission to deliver Vanessa (Eva Green) to the Prince of Darkness. I am still at loss to understand the role of Reeve Carney as Dorian Gray, as his character continues to indulge his carnal needs. While Harry Treadaway as Dr Victor Frankenstein continues to have problems of his, with his two creations Lily Frankenstein and Rory Kinnear as The Creature, his first creation that loathes his creator for numerous reasons.

This is season where we see some of Vanessas back-story. Timothy Dalton as Sir Malcolm Murray seems to go off the rails, with a little help from Helen McCrorys character. Danny Sapani as Sembene, a long-time assistant of Sir Malcolm, his main role, as ever, still remains a mystery. While Josh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler becomes more Canis lupus during certain lunar phases.

While not a central character, Simon Russell Beale as Ferdinand Lyle, an Egyptologist with an unhealthy interest in the occult and a certain duplicity when it comes to his friends, - at times his character is a real scene stealer. There are other characters of interest, but enough on the spoilers front, return to the tenets of the seasons narrative. The story telling as ever, is unhurried in nature. With this genre, the path the narrative takes is almost as important as the final destination, with its amassed diversified assortment of characters and themes.

This show is impenitent fun.

Penny Dreadful is absolutely sublime in every way. I have nothing but the highest praise for this show and confidently mark this season as one of the best, most beautiful, refreshingly original, memorable and well-executed seasons ever to grace television. The extraordinary production, transformative set designs, seamless visual effects, striking cinematography, gorgeous music score, and above all else, stellar acting of captivating characters and a poetic sharp script makes this show truly a labor of love and absolutely loved by so many viewers. You will lose yourself in Victorian London and among the lives of these tragic, beautiful and real characters finding themselves in this dark and dangerous world. Eva Green is absolutely ELECTRIC and other-worldly in her acting abilities - she is a goddess among us mortals and deserves so much attention for her portrayal of Ms. Ives. Timothy Dalton, Josh Harnett, and a host of other fantastic actors own their parts wholly and recreate these literary classic characters into real human beings, full of danger and full of beauty. Each episode tailors so much time to let these characters really breathe, to let them drive the story and not the other way around; to slowly evolve and discover who they are, the path of embracing their inner demons, and the time to build genuine synergy and bonds between each other is fantastic and so well-earned. It is an absolutely beautiful and captivating original premise and a twist on the universe of these separate literary classics as one world. Penny Dreadful is pure cinema - frightening and beautiful and palpable and emotional. This is one on-screen team you will be dying to root for. Penny Dreadful is, to me, the most emotionally-invested and anticipated show I have ever seen, and truly the pinnacle of how a television show captures your heart.",1439078400,7,1988,5.08256880733945

7337867,5,B011MUA8B2,"I'll just make this short and to the point. Penny Dreadful is fantastic, beginning to end. There truly is never a dull moment. Every character has been perfectly cast, every cast member is superb with their character. Eva Green, being so exotically beautiful right down to her gravelly voice, is phenomenal and this show has been robbed, twice now, for any Emmy nominations for acting. The addition of Patti LuPone as The Cut-Wife of Ballantrae Moor in Episode 3 was magnificent - and she, too, was robbed of an Emmy for a Guest Star role. Season 1 was great and really pulled you in - Season 2, with adding Helen McCrory as a full-time cast member (from a guest role in Season 1) - well, I just don't have words. Helen's portrayal of the beautiful but wicked, evil, powerful witch, Evelyn Poole (Madame Kali, the ""psychic"" from Season 1) was just an evil delight. If I have to say anything negative, it is that the ""Seasons"" are whopping 8 episodes for S1, 10 episodes for S2. Aside from the brevity of each season, I'm like a little kid at Christmas while it's playing, just not able to wait for Sunday nights for my ""Penny Fix!"" So eternally thankful that the show has been given a 3rd season and, from the ending of Season 2, it will be most interesting, with all the main characters moving separately to the far corners of the Earth. I won't go into the fantastic performance of each individual actor - it's not at all to slight anyone, but only because I'd have the same to say of them all. Absolute perfection. Now, only a few months for S2 on blu-ray, then the long 9 months for S3. I want to have a tantrum!",1437264000,55,1616,4.426174496644295
7337868,5,B011MUA8B2,"I was so excited about the second season of John Logan's ""Penny Dreadful"" that I actually had the premiere date marked down on my calendar.

Combining familiar characters from 19th century Gothic literature (all of which are in the public domain) and throwing them into a story that pits them against vampires, witches and the devil himself, at first glance ""Penny Dreadful"" may look like a silly, pulpy experiment along the lines of Hollywood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B001JIHGO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>&nbsp;and their attempt at Alan Moore's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/League-Of-Extraordinary-Gentlemen/dp/B000I9YWIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>.

But ""Penny Dreadful"" is a dark and intriguing blend of campy drama and careful character study, the combination of which makes for compelling viewing. Every Victorian Gothic trope you've ever heard of makes an appearance at some point (sances, opium dens, resurrectionists, spiritualism, madhouses, exorcisms, desolate moors, witch burnings) but writer John Logan usually finds a way to subvert expectations.

Vanessa Ives (Eva Green in the role she was born to play) is a troubled young woman who has spent most of her life haunted by otherworldly incidents that seem to have a particular interest in her. Last season her guardian Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) used her psychic gifts to track down his daughter Mina Murray from a nest of vampires; now he discovers that even greater powers have their sights set on his foster-daughter.

Brought into the fold are American gunslinger Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) and dedicated surgeon Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadwell) who lend their services to protecting Vanessa and finding out what might be troubling her. Of course, these two men have secrets of their own. Frankenstein is working under the duress of his monster Caliban, who has demanded a bride to assuage his loneliness, while Ethan (as revealed in the final episode of last season) is the Wolf-Man, whose transformations each full moon put everyone around him in danger.

Rounding out the cast is Rory Kinnear as Frankenstein's Creature, perhaps one of the most accurate portrayals of the character as described in Mary Shelley's novel (no green skin or neck-bolts here!), Reeve Carney as the feckless and languorous Dorian Grey (complete with portrait concealed in a secret chamber), and Danny Sapani as Sembene, Malcolm's trusted right-hand man, who remains criminally underused.

Of particular note is Billie Piper as the Bride of Frankenstein, who spent the first season dying of consumption as Irish prostitute Brona, and who is resurrected here as Lily, the English cousin of Victor Frankenstein - at least that's what she's told by her creator, grooming her as the future wife of his *first* creature. You naturally expect great things from the likes of Eva Green and Timothy Dalton, but you may be surprised at just how good Josh Hartnett and Billie Piper are in their respective roles. It's a testament to how good writing can improve an actor/actress, and there's a particular scene late in the season in which Piper dishes out a performance that nothing she's done previously led me to expect she'd be capable of (you'll know it when you see it).

This season picks up moments after the last concluded, with Ethan waking up in the bloodbath of the Mariner's Inn, and Vanessa being attacked by dark forces in a public park, moments after leaving the church she visited at the end of last season. Over the course of the ten episodes (two more from last season's eight) Vanessa is targeted by a coven of witches led by Evelyn Poole, who want to prepare her for her destiny as the Amon-Net to the devil's Amon-Ra, prophesied to bring about the end of the world and the destruction of heaven. Yeah, this show doesn't play things by halves.

These witches make for much better antagonists than last season's vampires, mainly due to a) having FAR more characterization, and b) Helen McCrory's wonderfully sultry and elegant performance as Evelyn Poole, in which she oozes malevolence and charm in equal measure.

This makes up the main storyline of the show, but ""Penny Dreadful"" also has an assortment of subplots to keep track of - including Ethan avoiding the police investigation brought on by his wolf killings, Dorian's love affair with a transgender woman called Angelique, and Victor Frankenstein struggling with his feelings toward his ""children"" Caliban and Lily as they begin their tentative courtship with each other.

If there's one thing I often find myself saying to newcomers to ""Penny Dreadful"", it's that it is a show that values atmosphere and characterization over plot. If you look closely, there are actually tons of plot-holes strewn throughout the show, as well as other weird inconsistencies, pacing issues and anti-climaxes. (For example, one episode involves a lengthy montage of our heroes setting protective charms and spells around Malcolm's house - skip forward a few episodes, and one of the witches effortlessly sneaks in without the slightest impediment).

This is not a criticism so much as a warning. ""Penny Dreadful"" is not for everyone - valuing style over solid continuity, it's dark and disturbing and gory, and though it takes pleasure in subverting familiar tropes, it requires prior knowledge of Victorian Gothic literature in order for you to appreciate said subversions. But as a result, it's one of the few shows out there that feels genuinely unpredictable.

Whew, this review is getting long, so I'll round things off with two of my favourite components of season two: the first is the wonderful episode ""The Nightcomers"", an extended flashback episode that details Vanessa learning about her abilities under the tutelage of an old woman (Patti LuPone) living on the moors. It feels like a mini-movie and - as was pointed out to me at the time - could just as easily be an origin story for Vanessa becoming a villain as it could her becoming a hero.

The second is the performance from Simon Russell Beale as curator and Egyptologist Ferdinand Lyle, a catspaw of the witches (thanks to blackmail) but a wonderful ally to the team, whose insights and bravery prove invaluable. As an eccentric closeted gay man, he could have very well ended up a clichd or comical character, but Beale infuses him with wit and chivalry - making him one of the most memorable aspects of the show.",1437004800,148,6569,5.286673058485139

7337880,5,B011MUA8B2,"Best show showtime ever had. Great characters & acting. High quality production. Only problem was that Showtime stopped any further seasons because they didn't make enough $$$ on it; apparently it was placed 6 out of 10 for making money. I heard that John Logan didn't want to go further due Vanessa Ives,the main character dying; Logan's a great writer so he could have figured a way for her NOT to die. AND still he could have created a new main character or had  another cast member's storyline become the main focus. So I'm not really buying it that Penny Dreadful had to end due to Vanessa Ives dying. Gee what would Game of Thrones be like if their writers took that same position?? Really not buying it John.

Season 3 left me feeling unhappy as it's a show that could have easily been on 7+ years and still be highly rated. I feel that viewers that invested in watching were short-changed...however, I also realize most/all the actors and actresses on Penny Dreadful are normally in big screen movies and not television per se. I hope someday they can bring the series back as I felt there were loose ends and season 3 felt empty and incomplete in my opinion.",1497139200,,594,4.5092592592592595

7337913,4,B011MUA8B2,"Overall the series is a great success and an inventive, yet respectful nod to the legacy of the Universal and Hammer films of the past, as well as to Oscar Wilde and an apparently inexhaustible propensity for buggery in gothic Victorian England. God, I love that era.

I thought the second season was weaker than the first. IMO, while I liked the ""cut-wife"" back story, the ""witches coven"" thing dragged on for too long. I mean, are they really that big of a threat compared to Satan himself? And wouldn't Vanessa Ives have more of a psychic insight as to who is or is not a witch, even as the men around her were being seduced by them?

I do find it interesting that the ""science"" in James Whales' 2 1930s Frankenstein films was actually more sound than that of PD's Victor Frankenstein, where there is no mention of morbidity, decomposition or rigor mortis. In all cases the corpses were relatively fresh as a daisy when they were resurrected, whereas a more gruesome finished product might have been expected in a contemporary production. But then again, this subtle vagueness is right out of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein novel, which described no specific scientific techniques. Artistic licentiousness, I guess.

Hate to see the series end but better to leave them wanting more rather than becoming anticlimactic.",1485129600,,1317,4.870535714285714
7337914,1,B011MUA8B2,"Yuck.  Hollywood just doesn't get it.  Watching gay scenes are like watching someone else's poo bob around in a public toilet.  Yes - I know that it occurs but I don't want to see it.  If the directors had removed of all of the in-your-face gay scenes, I would have rated it much higher.  They really wrecked the show for no reason other than to have the gay moment checkbox filled.  However, if those situations don't make you want to projectile vomit, then you might actually like this series as the plot, photography and twisted interactions were quite good.  Comes down to preference I guess.",1485043200,,596,4.619047619047619

I understand why the witch was seducing Sir Malcom, but that freak of a tran doesn't need to be in it. The one good thing to come out of the tran was realizing he needs to stop being something he's not. And of course, there's got to be some jerk to influence the foolishness. Just when he was going to start acting like a man, BOOM!!! Nope, gay porn time. Hopefully there's a plot twist and the tran (as well as the other characters) pray for forgiveness and repent of their sins.

I love the cast, the imaginative rethinking of stories.  I am sad that the subtitles give away... a little more than they should.

7337970,1,B011MUA8B2,"Screamo Frankenstein???  Seriously???  ""Penny Dreadful"" would be more respected if it 1. had decent writers behind it, and 2. used original characters instead of butchering the Dracula story and drastically altering all our beloved monsters..

The acting is amazing.  The production value is high.  Its the writing that makes this flick suffer.  At first glance, it appears we are in for the tale of the Murray family (the parental family of Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."")  It seems like we are about to get a whole new story that will  follow alongside the Dracula timeline, with other monsters thrown in for fun!  Sounds amazing, right?!  Sure.... until you see the 12-something year old girl have a threesome with 2 adults.  That's not edgy, its WRONG.  There's tid bits of promising horror interlaced with ever growing interludes of poetry, monologues, and endless ENDLESS exchanges and awkward, barely legal sex.  You will LITERALLY hear the same lines come out of different characters mouths, as if they all share the same voice.  TONS of Deus ex Machima.  The guy who spends 15 minutes renouncing god performs an on the spot exorcism.  The show has no continuity and does not even stay true to its own world.

It is NOT a clever story that takes place alongside the events of Dracula.  Rather, it is a poor re-imaging of the tale.  Instead of making their own characters, they butcher the ones we love and alter their histories so drastically that it would make no sense for Dracula and the Penny Dreadful story to coexist!  The amazing, brass balls van Helsing has one snippet of air time as a feeble old man who is easily duped.  Frankenstein is a dude in white face paint with black lipstick, and we have to listen to his every internal thought.  Intense scenes of witches struggling against the main character's faith look like nothing more than people straining to push through a bowel movement.  Eva Green is a real life Egyptologist, so of course vampires are supposedly creatures from sunny Egypt land.  ...This crap doesn't fit....

And don't get me STARTED on what they did to Dracula!  They turned him into a powerless panty-waste, and they even screw up explaining who he was in history!!  The talent-less hacks behind Penny Dreadful summed his entire ageless character up as  ""He started a war because he wanted blood.""  NO.

Look, if the writer's are going to steal Stoker's Dracula....  then at least do some research!!!!  HACKS!  Stoker's Dracula was based off the real life Vlad III voivode of Wallachia!  Half the world feared him as a terror, and half the world CELEBRATED him for restoring order and abolishing crime in a completely destabilized Wallachia!  What if you couldn't go to the supermarket without the real threat of being raped or murdered?  You'd probably cheer the dude that put an end to that!  At that time in history, the Ottoman empire had been impaling people into submission (from China to Greece to Armenia) for centuries!!!!  Dracula (Vlad III) and his father (Vlad II) were members of a Christian organization named the Order of the Dragon, whose purpose was to defend their land from the Ottomans.  Modern history tells us the tales of blood drinking came from angry Saxons who were furious that Vlad III Dracula was able to defend his land and restore order, because it took away from the stranglehold they had on the trade routes.  They assassinated his father Vlad II because of this.  It was political.  The historical Dracula was taken from his home as a child in forced tribute to the Ottomans, he learned about Impalement from the Ottomans and turned it back on them when he defended his country - refusing to suffer his people to live in chaos and refusing to pay tribute to the Ottoman overlord Mehmed.  After finally repelling the Ottomans and making Wallachia somewhat prosperous again, Vlad III was betrayed by another nobleman who was vying for the seat of Holy Roman Emporer, and defamed like his father was.

Modern history tells us that he was a desperate man with a limited army trying to defend his country by all means necessary, celebrated much more than feared.  So it bothers me that they take the ""Dracula"" character and screw up not only his fictional aspect but also his history as a real person.

I wish the acting HAD been terrible, because then I wouldn't have been ""tricked"" into watching so much of this garbage.",1476835200,,4405,4.805592543275632

7338114,1,B011MUA8B2,"Someone involved in the creation of this show loves their characters and story so much that they couldn't see them objectively. This affection ruins what would otherwise be a very compelling show by destroying viewers ability to suspend their disbelief. Here are a few examples arranged from gross to subtle:

This review contains spoilers from seasons one and two. You have been warned.

1. Frankensteins original creature is constantly harangued for being ugly, but he is really strikingly good looking. This makes his plight  preposterous, not tragic.
2. At the creation of Brona / Lily, how can Dr. Frankensteins machine of uninsulated knife switches and bare copper contacts function when it is drowned in a deluge of rainwater? This gross oversight makes our dear tragic scientist look incompetent when he should look like a conquering hero.
3. We wait and wait and wait to see the portrait of Dorian Grey. When we finally do, it looks like a cheap, B-Movie zombie pooping on a squat toilet. This image is laughable, not haunting.
4. We wait and wait and wait to see Ethan as a werewolf. When we finally do, he looks like Eddie Munster. This image is ludicrous, not awe-inspiring.
5. While on the subject of Ethan, great pains are taken in this narrative to establish how important he, the Hound (or Wolf) of God, will be in defeating the great evil that plagues Ms. Ives; however, when the time comes, all our glorious Hound does is get locked in a room, kill his best friend, and kill a witch who was already dying. This incongruity renders the entire plot arc ridiculous.
6. Great pains are also taken to establish that Dr. Frankensteins original creature had nowhere to go after he lost his job at the Grand Guignol. The creature moves in with the doctor, who promptly beings an affair with Brona / Lilly. She and Dr. Frankenstein are seen all over the apartment, making love, cooking, dressing, undressing, but where has the creature gone? How can Victor and Lily / Brona be living this way if he is nearby? His unexplained absence ruins this entire plot arc.
7. When Ms. Ives leaves the hovel of her witch mentor, she puts a scorpion sigil on the stone gate. This sigil is apparently effective since, when she returns much later, the house is totally untouched. Yet when she protects Sir Malcoms house with the same sigil, a witch seems free to visit Ethan because she doesnt believe in totems. How does this work? If the scorpion sigil is not effective, why didn't the nightcomers just break into the witchy hovel, steal the Book of Satanic Awesomeness, and destroy Ms. Ives company entirely? This oversight makes Ms. Ives powers, not to mention her very identity as scorpion avatar, seem questionable, not herculean, leaving the viewers confused by her when they should be impressed.
8. Much screen time is devoted to Bronas degenerative lung illness. We are led to believe that she is at deaths door just about the same time Ms. Ives begins to struggle with a major possession. Rather than juxtaposing these two plots, forcing Ethan to make a tough ethical choice, Brona just vanishes from the narrative. Are we to suppose that Brona has conveniently stopped dying just long enough for Ethan to help Ms. Ives? This might be okay if it was just for an evening, but, according to the narrative, Ms. Ives possession took at least a week. The arrival of winter snows during her episode suggests that it may have taken a month or more. This incongruity leaves the viewer wondering about Brona when they should be focused on Ms. Ives, and makes Ethan look careless when he should look compassionate.
9. Dr. Frankensteins second creature, Proteus, was born with almost no pyrotechnic fanfare. Based on the battery of black apparatus surrounding his head, some form of magnetism seems to have been employed in his creation, so he is born in a lovely, eerie silence. Given this fact, how is it possible that Brona / Lily who, the doctor tells us, was made even better than Proteus, is born in a veritable fireworks display of lightning and showering sparks? Comparing the two scenes makes Brona / Lilys creation seem laughably overwrought.

I am putting this these flaws down to love. Love sometimes blinds us to the faults of our beloved, keeping us from seeing them objectively. Someone creating this show loves it so much that they are blind to the flaws of the thing they have made, which, given the presence of a Frankenstein story, is especially ironic.",1469145600,,4465,4.787289234760052
7338115,2,B011MUA8B2,"It isn't smart, it's horribly plotted, the story lines never go anywhere, and at its best it could only ever be considered campy. But Eva Green is entertaining enough and there is occasionally some interesting imagery so it might be worth a watch.

Basically, this show is like a Ryan Murphy show but for people who think they are too good for Ryan Murphy shows.

(Also, how dumb is it that while I'm reviewing this the only name that shows is Josh Hartnett. Eva Green IS this show.)",1469059200,,483,4.4772727272727275

7338145,3,B011MUA8B2,"Hissing, melodramatic, cliche witches are not scary. EVER!

Where this show continues to fail with its unimaginative villains and dull action set pieces, the acting and protagonist character drama remains intriguing enough to keep me watching. The performances are wonderful. The period recreation of Victorian England remains accurate, moody, and intoxicating.

When the show forgets about the irritating machinations of completely uninteresting monsters and explores fascinating themes like human frailty and vanity, social class structure, the complexities of love in all its forms, and the alternately tender and terrifying dynamics within some of these relationships, it shines! I want this show to hit its stride and succeed. Unfortunately, I fear the show lives up to its title a little too much.",1468540800,,803,5.628099173553719

(i wonder if they could make a rated pg-13 for those of us who are modest enough NOT to want to watch that filth?) the story that i like is the promise of Dr. Jekyll/Dr. Frankenstein as a dastardly duo! i will await a tamer version, though . i won't purchase this filthy version. too bad they think that they have to put in filler to make the product a winner. i enjoy John Clare's story most of all. there hasn't been any nasty material with the creature's story line, yet.",1466121600,,700,4.154411764705882

7338373,5,B011MUA8B2,"Penny Dreadful is a wickedly beautiful tale filled with horrors and passions intricately explored in gruesome detail.  It rewrites our favorite iconic characters in such away that the narrative revives them for a new generation.  The characters are ugly just as they are alluring.  They are given flesh that is tried and torn as one could imagine the real world would during that time.  They are not perfect and in many cases they are their own worst enemies.

If that were not enough, the sets are magnificently staged, with detail paid to the dark and dirty realities of turn of the century England.  The room with the dolls is both grotesquely fascinating and terrifying, revitalizing an age old fear that some might still be harboring.  Frankenstein's workshop is filled to the brim with all manner of bottles and gadgets that it impresses upon the viewer a sense of claustrophobia.

Penny Dreadful is a delightful watch and I would recommend it to anyone.  As long as they don't mind an oceans worth of Horror to keep them company at night.",1465257600,,1045,4.793296089385475

It also just seemed like worse, more clichd writing than the rest of the show.",1463356800,,428,4.4743589743589745

I am especially attracted to that time period. That aside, the characters and twists in the script made me love it even more and season 3 promises the same. The casting is creative. I imagined how many must have auditioned for those roles. I cared about the characters and not too many movies or series accomplsh that in me. Books can, but it's rare that a movie or televison series does. Five stars for the writers as well.",1461024000,,593,4.4

If you haven't seen it,do begin with season one.  It is very adult,very sexual,gruesome,frightening and all the things a person would want in a horror.  But this is much more!  It is intelligent!  The writing flawless!  And the music will make you drop to your knees!!!  Beautiful,haunting and lush!

7338849,5,B011MUA8B2,"Arduous, Malleable and Transfixing is how I would describe Season Two of Penny Dreadful. The second season has permanently cemented why this is my new favorite show of all time. I'm mesmerized by anything and everything Horror related and this is right up my alley. I will begin my review and I have my review for Season One on other review sites entitled ""The Bloodborne Equivalent Of A Macabre Horror Masterpiece."" if you're interested in checking it out. I will delve into the story which takes place literally the next day after the Season One finale. I won't divulge what happened as that would ruin the first season but without saying much it picks up very quickly with new threats and predators around every corner. The deadliest of them all would be each other and how they intermix with one another and each of them having their own agendas and emotions which play a ginormous role this season. I loved the story this season even more so then in S1. I will now move onto the acting which as in my review for S1 I cited that the acting is what really enticed me to keep watching. I never in all my years have seen such a cast of actors and actresses that could make me get so emotionally invested in each individual actor and actress as I have with this show. I should say that is also due to magnificent writing by John Logan who is also the creator. I will carry on with the action and drama segment of this review and as it stands S2 is paramount to any other show that I have ever watched and I watch a ton of t.v. along the lines of GOT and The 100 to name a few. The action is just as brutal and relentless as S1 and far more demonic. The drama is far meatier then the action but that only lends a helping hand for when the action does finally unfold throughout the season. I will round out my review with the Cinematography and Location which were superfluous and I mean that in the most genuine way possible. I mean everything is shot with such authenticity and care that you truly feel like you're there yourself. Bravo to the production teams that deal both in the sets and the decor. I will close out my review by saying that if you have not seen this show yet then please don't dawdle. You need to go out and buy the first 2 seasons or watch them elsewhere but buying them would support this much beloved and prodigious television show. I promise that if you love anything drama and or horror related then you will not be disappointed in the least but you will be pleasantly delighted.",1454976000,2,2505,4.354700854700854

The series takes every great tale of the Gothic era and throws them together in perhaps the bloodiest version of 1800's England imaginable. Frankenstein and his monster come with new twists. Dorian Gray is a the height of narcissistic evil, leaving broken hearts and dead bodies in his wake. By far the most compelling villain (and storyline) involves Mrs. Poole and her obsession with bringing Vanessa to the devil. A must have for anyone who loves Gothic horror.",1453334400,,476,5.025316455696203

Poetic and old sayings are used well in the right places. Actors are committed and really pull you in. When you look at it looks like a beautiful painting (lights, colors, camera angles). The music is so wonderful! I can`t believe this was written (composed) `just` for a tv show.  This is true for Season 1 and season 2.

7338888,2,B011MUA8B2,"I purchased season 2 in the hopes of seeing more of the wonderful actor portraying the Frankenstein ""monster"". I was disappointed to learn that the writers had decided to make him a monster whose most lethal quality was non stop whining. I was even more disappointed to watch the writers torture the lead character (Ms Green) more than they had in the previous season and consider it character development.
When the werewolf was finally revealed in all his glory, he appeared more along the lines of a werepuppy and far from instilling terror, my only reaction was to get a rolled up newspaper and smack him on the nose with it. I understand the producers wanted to keep the actor in focus as he is a handsome young man but werewolves are not supposed to be cute and cuddly.
On a whole, this series, despite an interesting premise, is a fail for me. The only memorable scene from season 2 is when Dorian Gray and the Bride waltz about in gory splendor but even this was marred by the fact that the character of Dorian Gray has been misunderstood by the writers. Not a chance I'll be spending on any further seasons.",1452729600,,1115,4.524752475247524

7338911,5,B011MUA8B2,"+++Warning....This will contain some season 1 spoilers, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 yet, skip the first paragraph+++

The second season picks up down the line from the events that ended the first season.  Malcolm and Vanessa are dealing with the loss of Mina, Ethan is beginning to realize what he is doing when he blacks out, and Frankenstein is preparing a bride for The Creature from Brona's remains.  The new antagonists this season are witches as opposed to vampires, but there are a lot of tie ins to the first season while presenting a new story line, and moving the show forward.

I cannot say too much without spoiling too much of the second season, but it is all about evolving character relationships and dealing with the various characters inner monsters, with the witches trying to exploit them.  By the end of the season all the characters are in very different places, with a great set up to who are likely to be the villains of the third season.  Dorian Gray also plays more heavily into this season and he is far less the fringe character that he was in the first season.  Like the first season it is part thriller and part mystery.  There is a lot of sex, nudity and violence in it, so if that turns you off, then you definitely want to skip this.  However, that said, it all fits within the context of the story and none of it is just blatantly gratuitous.

For those who get the discs, the show looks and sounds fantastic on blu ray.  For extras there are several short behind the scenes features on the making of the second season.  There are also short character profiles for each of the main characters, and a short history of the occult.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there, and all totaled about 45 minutes worth of stuff.  If you liked the first season you will definitely like this one as well.  It does itself a service as a show by keeping the season short, just 10 episodes, and does not drag out the story.  Like was the case at the end of the first season you will be left wanting more when this one gets done.",1449360000,,2098,4.37984496124031

Written by John Logan.

Returning: Timothy Dalton, Eva Green, Josh Hartnett,  Rory Kinnear, Simon Russell Beale, Helen McCrory, Billie Piper, Danny Sapani, Harry Treadaway, Reeve Carney.

Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton), in the country-side, tries to make amends with his former wife now that both of their children between them are dead, but she rejects him. When he returns home, he comforts Vanessa Ives (Eva Green).
  Vanessa is still mentally tortured. Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) recovers from his night of turning into a werewolf and as he tells Vanessa, he feels he has to move. As Vanessa and Ethan ride in the carriage, the Nightcomers attack Vanessa.
  The creature, John Clare (Rory Kinnear), needs to find work again. He finds one from Oscar Putney (David Haig) who owns a wax museum. Mrs. Putney (Ruth Gemmell) is cold to John because she doesn't like his face, but Mr. Putney believes his face will bring in more customers.
  Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) obtains Lily's body (Billie Piper) to restore her back to life. John is excited to possibly have a woman as a mate, but Victor has his own ideas for Lily.
  Malcolm and Ferdinand (Simon Russell Beale) have an interesting puzzle of unique objects they need to put together and solve. Each object contains writing on it in a certain language, like Latin, and forms a story that continues on another object, but they discover this story may be about the devil himself.
  Malcolm has an interest in Madame Kali, however she has her own evil intentions for Malcolm unbeknownst to him.
  Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney) pays for his time with a woman whom is actually a young man, Angelique (Jonny Beauchamp). Dressed as as a fashionable woman, Angelique shows Dorian his penis on their first meeting. They go out together and Angelique continues to flirt with him.

Also in the cast: Patti LuPone, Douglas Hodge, Sarah Greene, Dave Curry, Aideen Wylde.

I really enjoyed Season 2 and I was glued to the television set. I had to find out what would happen next.  The story and character development was intriguing.
 The advantage to watching Penny Dreadful on this DVD set is you can watch one episode after another and another one in one day. It is so much easier to absorb and remember the story this way.  I wanted more episodes than just ten
.
Penny Dreadful has been renewed for Season 3 to be broadcast on Showtime premium cable network in May 2016 (9 episodes). Brian Cox (Red (2008)) and Patti LuPone (now as a regular in a different character) will join the cast.",1447891200,,2907,4.9730848861283645

7338962,4,B011MUA8B2,"Really like this show. The first season was very good. I think Eva Green is the one of the greatest underrated actresses of our time. Did you know she has a twin? Anyways... This new season of Penny Dreadful is cray cray (sorry I had to)... If you thought the story was dark before, be prepared for something even darker. I am still in the process of watching the whole season, but I have seen enough to let you know that this is better than the first season. Nothing against the first... But you always hope a show will improve from season to season. This is the case with Penny Dreadful. The scenery is very beautiful and the music is bold and riveting. The backstories for some of the characters are interesting and help develop the plot. The dialogue again is new and very refreshing. Usually in shows you can guess what the person on the screen will say before they say it. That was not the case here. I was surprised every time. I definitely recommend checking this out if you enjoy good, intriguing dramas. Cheers.",1447459200,,1021,4.46524064171123

7338965,5,B011MUA8B2,"So glad to read that there will be a season three.  The darkness pervades this season.  Many scenes of dark stair cases and dimly light grungy places.  Seems to underline the stark contrast between the lovely clothing and manners and the ever-present poverty and suffering of others.  The actors are splendid.  Must admit I questioned where the Dorian Gray line was going, but it was explained in the final show.

I am a Gothic Literature fan, so this show appeals to me - all the Gothic themes - outsiders, superstition (as we know from the show - it is reality, no a set of myths).

This show could easily be campy, but it maintains its serious note and in a teeming London, the central characters wage a desperate and concerted battle against evil forces.  The loneliness and isolation is palpable.  Watch this - however, not for the faint of heart.",1447372800,,852,4.626666666666667
7338966,5,B011MUA8B2,"Love, love love this show! Season 1 was a bit slow the first couple episodes,  but hang in there and the characters really start developing and it just keeps getting better. Season 2 is even better, and I can't wait for season 3. The characters and their interaction and relationships with each other are amazing,  and there's so much depth. Kudos to all the actors in this show.",1447286400,,379,4.5588235294117645

My only issue is with Josh Hartnett, his performance is below par and his ""wolf"" form looks like something from the 70s and its horrible special effects. Imo it would be the best horror show out there  if Hartnett was removed and a more ""aggressive and intimidating"" looking wolf was used instead.

7339005,2,B011MUA8B2,"As a devotee of the first season, I was thoroughly disappointed with this sophomore effort. After glancing through a few of the reviews for season 1, it seems that the few detractors were mostly displeased with the ambiguities of the storyline and the lack of a strong, central villain. For me, that was the greater part of the appeal of season 1. It was like watching a voluptuous period piece that didn't always make complete sense, but the obscurities of the plot worked in perfect tandem with the foggy Victorian environs to heighten the sense of mystery and suspense. I credited the writers with sacrificing the chronological storytelling that most viewers demand in favor of an evasive narrative that unfolded deliberately. The adjective I found myself most frequently using to describe season 1 was ""poetic.""

[Minor spoilers follow.]

Season 2 takes a diametrical path. It provides us with an explicit set of villains: a coven of witches in service to Satan, headed by Evelyn Poole (Madame Kali from season 1). We learn that their object is to entrap Vanessa Ives, whom Satan has tapped as his future bride. To clear up all that lingering vampire business from season 1, our gang of heroes discovers a set of artifacts detailing how Lucifer was not the only angel thrown out of Heaven by God, but was accompanied by an equally ornery brother. Lucifer descended into Hell, where he feeds on human souls. His less glamorous brother landed on earth and subsists on the blood of the living. The unholy brothers now find themselves locked in sibling rivalry for supremacy in their respective campaigns against Heaven, and both believes Ms. Ives is the key to his success.

As horror fare goes, this is a respectable enough story arc. It's the execution that's lacking this go around. Penny Dreadful in season 2 has lost its methodical pacing, and along with a more perfunctory style there's a strong element of camp that feels out of place in a show that takes itself so seriously. One wonders if the scripts weren't outsourced to Ryan Murphy. The most outlandish silliness is reserved for the season finale, when we finally meet the Father of Lies  and he's taken the form of a talking puppet. As annoyed as I was by this piffle, I couldn't help laughing out loud watching Ms. Ives and Satan-the-puppet engaged in a staring contest while shouting at each other in a fake language.

Another byproduct of the precipitous decline in the writing are issues of sloppy continuity. Some are major, e.g., Dr. Frankenstein parading Brona around town and right under the nose of her ex-lover Ethan Chandler (luckily for them the full moon leaves Mr. Chandler indisposed on the night of Dorian Grays ball). Others are minor but still peeve an observant viewer. In one episode, Vanessas facial bruising after a violent altercation miraculously disappears from morning to mid-afternoon. In the finale, a witch attacks Mr. Lyle and chokes him, suspended against a wall, for a solid 20 minutes while the rest of the plot unfolds. When the action finally returns to Mr. Lyle, there he remains hovering against the wall in the witchs grip, somehow still breathing.

To the show's credit, the acting for the entire cast is still on point, and the sets and cinematography are the equal of anything else on television. Now that the first two seasons have each focused on one of the two fallen brothers, it seems likely that the devil and vampire plot lines are set to converge in season 3. In the meantime, Ill hold out hope that Penny Dreadful rediscovers its form and that we might see a return to the quality exemplified by its premiere season.",1446422400,8,3631,4.829581993569132

7339014,5,B011MUA8B2,"Although I do feel this season lacked the urgency of Season 1, when the allies had a specific goal, it does satisfy exploring the middle part of Vanessa's story--how she traveled from her vision of Mina on the beach to her appearance at Sir Malcolm's door.  Other characters also get their storylines:  Dr. F discovers love (or lust?), the Creature ventures out on his own, and Sir Malcolm engages Evelyn Poole.  I prefer vampires to witches, honestly; the latter just aren't as terrifying in this season.  Look for an excellent story arc involving actress Patti Lupone: the Bechdel test is blown out of the water as this show features females an episode of danger and sacrifice that has nothing to do with the opposite sex.  That said, fans of Ethan Chandler can look forward to more heroism!  Overall, I look forward to S3, hoping for some more action and forward plot movement.",1446076800,,880,4.756578947368421

I loved this show b/c it incorporated all your scary, mythical figures in a intricated way, where all the characters are interrelated. Although, I hav to say, if this show is going to last, the main character, Miss Vanessa Ives, shouldn't be the main one to always suffer fr her demons. I just started watching the 1st episodes of S2 & i was like,"" oh no, NOT again, she's still suffering!."" I thought the 1st season was enough & they wud concentrate on the werewolf guy Ethan this season, or Frankenstein, or the bisexual, Mr. Gray. But so far, the 1st 3 episodes. it's all Ives story, again. Oh, if u hate dolls, the voodoo ones are REeeeeal creepy, made me hav chicken skin, make-up & special effects are done so realistic, it's disgusting.

7339063,5,B011MUA8B2,"One of the best shows on television. Who would have thought you could combine vampires, witches, werewolves, mummies, both of Frankenstein's monsters, Dorian Gray, voodoo, religion and probably some themes I'm forgetting into a single cohesive, compelling plot. The cast is outstanding, which further deepens my respect for the program.

My only serious criticism is that the series made insufficient effort to tell the story of Sembene. We finally get glimpses through his friendship with Ethan, but they remain wholly inadequate when compared to the visual backstories of other leading characters. It's a glaring omission. The show's creators should have given him equal billing by exploring his past more throughly. They did not. Unfortunately, I can't elaborate without revealing spoilers. It's an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise brilliant work of art.",1444435200,10,857,5.541984732824427

7339072,5,B011MUA8B2,"*I received a review copy of this TV show in exchange for an honest review

When I first heard about Showtimes original series PENNY DREADFUL, I was immediately curious.  A show that combines new and beloved literary horror characters, and that is set within the realm of Victorian Londonhow can you NOT be interested?  I knew I had to give it a look, so I bought the first season earlier this year.  I was not disappointed; the show blew me away.  Unique and brilliant, the concept alone was enough to snare me.  But the writing and the characters kept me coming back.  When season one ended after only eight episodes, I was foaming at the mouth for more.  Thankfully, the fine folks at CBS and Showtime saw fit to grace me with a copy of season two.  And I have to say:  much like THE WALKING DEAD, PENNY DREADFUL is a show that gets better with age!

PENNY DREADFUL is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  The sets are painstakingly detailed, and nothing is spared when it comes to accenting the scenery.  I daresay this attention to detail is part of what makes the show so engaging.

The characters are vibrant and alive.  Each is fleshed out to a point beyond realism, and this helps suck the viewer in; it creates an almost insatiable need to know more about who each is and why they are there.  I particularly like how the shows creators stay fairly true to the original vision of each literary figure, while creating new mythology to surround him or her.  This shows the depth of imagination the show encompasses.

Season two starts off with a bang, and it never lets go.  I will not divulge anything specific, as I don't want to give details away.  But I will say things are not what they seem (they rarely are), and the stakes have been upped even further than what we previously thought!

PENNY DREADFUL season two is a major win for me, and I cannot wait to see where the show goes from here.  Chocked full of interesting characters and engaging situations, this show is one every horror or thriller fan will want to check out.  Season two hits store shelves today, so make a note to grab it.",1444089600,12,2107,4.458115183246074

7339078,5,B011MUA8B2,"An incredible--and incredibly literate--show. Poetic. Exotic. Erotic. Brilliant. A wonderful breath of fresh air after decades of one mindless slasher film after another. If Hammer films made monster mash-ups today, they would be Penny Dreadful, and that is the highest compliment I can give this breathtaking show. The cast? Superb. And not just Eva Green and Timothy Dalton. Harry Treadaway plays Victor Frankenstein as a complex middle of contradictions. Josh Hartnett was born to play a Talbot, and wears his lycanthropy like a crown of thorns. I can not say enough about the supporting cast. They are just as amazing. One of the two finest shows on television today, Penny Dreadful is a goth's dream--or nightmare--come true.",1442534400,8,730,5.247863247863248
7339079,5,B011MUA8B2,"Of course, since the release itself won't be until October, this review is for the season as aired on Showtime.  John Logan can write dialogue for these characters like nobody else.  Even the smallest and most mundane turn of phrase seems like poetry coming from the mouths of this uber-talented cast.  The cinematography is awe inspiring.  The costumes and the music are equally terrific at setting the mood.  The prosthetics and makeup crew, under the leadership of Nick Dudman and Sarita Allison, make flawless transitions for the actors into their characters.  And what characters they are!  The tag line for the season is 'the devil is in all of us' and that theme wove its way through each character.  All of them were shown as flawed, ruled by both their negative and positive sides.  Although they only had three scenes together, Eva Green and Rory Kinnear were burning up the screen this season with their chemistry ... not as a potential romance in bloom, but as kindred spirits for their characters.  Their final scene in ""And They Were Enemies"" was totally gut wrenching and moving.  Definitely looking forward to more of that in Season 3.  Simon Russell Beale was even more of a delight as Egyptologist Sir Ferdinand this season than last.  Helen McCrory was deliciously evil and Billie Piper really got the opportunity to come to the fore as Lily.  Guest performances by one and all were very effective, like Sarah Greene as Hecate and Douglas Hodge as Inspector Rusk.  And I was particularly struck by the juxta-positioning of The Creature and Lily's continuing evolution and Victor's disintegration.  The strongest possible kudos for this cast and crew.",1439942400,6,1669,4.9496402877697845
7339080,5,B011MUA8B2,"Penny Dreadful... what can I say that hasn't already been said.  Except perhaps, Eva Green is probably the best actress of this generation.  Damn, this woman has power and range on screen!  Why hasn't she been nominated for an Emmy at least!  C'mon people!  And Rory Kinnear... what a great actor!  He's the best reviewed Hamlet on stage in years... What a great cast.  Great writing!",1439424000,10,384,4.7272727272727275

The acting remains superb and amazing, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful, the costumes are lavish, and the sets are gorgeous. There is still a ridiculous amount is sex and blood, but many others will love that. I just don't need to have pouring blood associated with everything. The ballroom scene at Dorian Gray's home is a feast of beauty - the pink gown worn by Lily is a masterpiece. Season Two special effects are astounding.
