5613173,1,B00BF0SKKQ,Not one of the 4 CD's was labeled correctly. They all had a label for different episodes than the one that was on the disc.,1373241600,2,123,3.96

5613175,5,B00BF0SKKQ,I have always loved this show since it first came out and I am so glad it is finally out on DVD.One of the best roles Carroll O'Connor ever played. The supporting cast members were also excellent and the show always had great guest starts as well. Thanks,1371945600,4,254,4.3125
5613176,3,B00BF0SKKQ,"This four disc set is a bit messed up. On vol. 1 disc 1 the dvd and the back of the case says the show is A MATTER OF JUSTICE, But when you play the disc, the title says WHO WAS GELI BENDL?, and thats what the show is. Vol. 1 disc 2, both the disc and back of the case say the show is WHO WAS GELI BENDL?, but when you play the disc the show is BY DUTY BOUND, and thats what the show is. Vol. 2 disc 3 the dvd and the back of the case say the show is BY DUTY BOUND, the actual show is A MATTER OF JUSTICE...only vol. 2 disc 4 has the right name on the disc and back of the case. Hopefully if you release the other seasons...YOU DO A BETTER JOB!!",1371168000,16,645,3.5815602836879434

5613181,3,B00BF0SKKQ,WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT NONE OF THE COMPLETE SEASONS WAS COMPLETE EXCEPT FOR SEASONS 1 AND 8.  THEY EVEN SKIPPED THE 2nd PART OF THE KIDNAPPING OF CHIEF GILESPY...  VERY DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING.  THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE DVD SETS AND NOT THE SELLER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW OF THE DECEPTION.  I WAS ABLE TO TAPE ALL THE MISSING EPISODES BUT ONE ON GRIT... WHICH OUR LOCAL STATION HAS NOW DROPPED... BUT MAYBE THEY ARE BEING SHOWN ON CABLE OR SOMETHING...

5613187,5,B00BF0SKKQ,"5 star show. Bad dvds. Still, I'm happy to have bought season 8 since it doesn't air as often as the previous seasons, but ugh... the picture quality is awful.  I'm not sure how the other sets look but this looks like old recordings of old vhs copies.  I hope this show get's better treatment for future releases...  One can only hope for HD quality eventually.  But for now, it's better than nothing.

UPDATE 5/8/15: I just got my hands on another season and the quality of those seems a lot better, so I'm assuming it's just season 8 that is poor in picture quality. Season 8 is STILL worth the purchase because I just saw ""A Matter of Justice"" on WGN and it was edited.",1430524800,,672,4.301587301587301

5613194,5,B00BF0SKKQ,"I am writing the review under Season 8 but it covers the entire series. My wife loved the series when it first aired and now she is disabled, so I purchased the entire series for her to enjoy. Carrol O'Connor is an excellent actor and the DVDs are well done. The only disappointment was the missing episodes. I found out there are 28 missing episodes in the DVD series. I have managed to record the missing episodes and put them on my personal dvds. They are not quite the same quality as the purchased DVDs, but at least my wife can enjoy the entire series. Anyone interested in the series or follow Carroll O'Connor should get these DVDs.",1421452800,,640,4.432203389830509

5613203,5,B00BF0SKKQ,In my opinion in the heat of the night is one of the best police shows of the last 80 and early 90s. The cast enhanced the shows quality of a small southern town. The story lines were also well written so the whole family could enjoy them. Sadly this is not the case with some television programs today.,1411516800,,303,4.1525423728813555

5613223,4,B00BF0SKKQ,"Season 8 of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was actually only a series of four made-for-TV movies with the same cast as the series first seven years.  The titles and chronological order of these four movies were as follows:

* Season 8
Episode # 143  8-01  21/Oct/94  A Matter of Justice
Episode # 144  8-02  09/Dec/94  Who Was Geli Bendl ?
Episode # 145  8-03  17/Feb/95  By Duty Bound
Episode # 146  8-04  16/May/95  Grow Old Along with Me

This DVD set contains all four HEAT movies in a nice boxed set.  Good video and audio transfers.  But there is one problem.  That problem is that three of the four DVDs are mislabeled.  The movies are listed in the correct order on the disc clamshells but only one disc - Disc # 4 has the correct number labeled on it.  Disc 4 contains the last of the four movies GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME.  The Disc labeled # 1 is actually Disc # 2 and contains the 2nd movie WHO WAS GELI BENDL?.  The Disc labeled # 2 is actually Disc # 3 and contains the 3rd movie BY DUTY BOUND.  The Disc labeled # 3 is actually Disc # 1 and contains the 1st movie A MATTER OF JUSTICE.  I suppose this is a small concern except for HEAT purists like myself.  But the manufacturers should have done a better job of quality control with the DVD labels.  Still a great addition to any HEAT fans collection.",1385251200,28,1308,4.152610441767068
5613224,5,B00BF0SKKQ,"Love the series and put the rest out they will sell.  You don't go from season one to season 8.

5613228,3,B00BF0SKKQ,I would seriously think before buying this. If you are wanting to pay this price for four episodes go for it. I believe I was tricked and swindled by thinking this would have more than four episodes. Instead of putting these on one disc they put each episode on a separate disc. Be careful people. I am seriously thinking about maybe returning or looking into this item and series further to make sure that is all that is in the complete 8th season.,1379721600,,449,4.421686746987952

5613231,4,B00BF0SKKQ,I would of liked it better if it was a complete season . They kind of mislead me with saying season 8 so I thought I was getting a number of episodes. what season 8 was 4 movies of in the heat of the night. They all were great shows so I can't complain about that. I can't wait now for them to bring out season 2 thru 7 so I can see the shows I want to see. I got the season 1 and this season 8 but now it is time to bring the rest of them in a complete series package .,1377216000,,470,3.4857142857142858
5613232,5,B00BF0SKKQ,"I think the country needs to open their minds and hearts and really watch this series. They managed the day-to-day racial tension showing both sides. There were whites that were terribly bigoted and there were blacks with rage as well, one major difference though in this show and today's programing is the Americans solved their problems with local government and not Washington bureaucrats, nor with the race-bating media hype, or grand pretenders saying ""they care behind their lecterns or bullhorns"".

Americans need to take their country back!! ALL AMERICANS",1377129600,2,563,5.325842696629214

I  just  didn't  find  it  as  interesting.
I  am  content  with  just  the  first  7  seasons.
There  should  have  been  more  episodes,  All  it  is  is  a  couple  of  movies  that  end  the  series.
But  not  what  it  should  be.
When  I  watched  it  I  was  disappointed,  I  kept  it  for  about  a  year  before  giving  it  up  realizing  i  couldn't  get  use  to  eighth  season.  There  were  plenty  of  episodes  in  this  season  that  are  missing.  If  they  wanted  to  do  something  special  at  the  end  of  the  series  they  should  have  made  season  8  the  way  you'd  remember  it.

8567495,5,B00BF0SKKQ,"Season 8 of In the Heat of the Night is a series of 4 television movies that ended the run of the television series, which aired from 1988 until 1995.

On Disc 1 is A Matter of Justice, featuring George C. Scott as Judge Walker, whose grandson Todd (Josh Lucas) has been murdering young women in Sparta and using his family name to shield himself from justice.  Sheriff Bill Gillespie (Carroll O'Connor) and Sparta Chief of Police Hampton Forbes (Carl Weathers) work the case together to track down the serial killer. [60 minutes]

On Disc 2 is Who Was Geli Bendl? Sydne Rome portrays Geli, a former resident of Sparta's bottoms, now a successful European entertainer, who comes to Sparta to convince her desperately drug addicted sister Laura (Arienne Battiste) to go to Europe to live with her. Geli requests assistance from her friend police Sgt. Dee Shepard (Dee Shaw). [95 minutes]

Disc 3 contains By Duty Bound. Unscrupulous wholesale business owner Kerry Madigan (John Calvin) is going to run for Sheriff to replace Bill Gillespie (Carroll O'Connor), who wants to buy a fishing boat and retire to a quieter life, a decision fully appreciated by his wife Harriet DeLong (Denise Nichols).  Madigans warehouse foreman Frank (Corbin Bernson) helps Madigan steal his own merchandise from supplier shipments, which he  resells on the black market.  In covering their thievery, the foreman murders two people.  Though Spartas Chief Forbes (Carl Weathers) solves one murder and is able to arrest the foreman, the second murder remains unsolved and the corrupt Madigan is left free to run for Sheriff.  All law enforcement in the county are aware that Madigan is unfit to run for Sheriff and Sheriff Gillespie must decide whether or not to retire. [95 minutes]

Disc 4 contains Grow Old Along With Me. John Ryan (Bill Cross) marries Pauline Medford (Constance McCashin), leaving unfinished business with his former girlfriend Trina (portrayed by Janette Lee Bradbury, once again appearing as a slobbering drunk). The new Mrs. Ryan is very understanding and sympathetic to her husband's dilemma and dives right in to help, leading to traumatic escalations of the matter. [96 minutes]

As an Amazon customer, I feel so lucky to be able to purchase episodes of In the Heat of the Night so many years after it ended, and enjoy this brilliant show again. The episodes in Season 8 contain intense drama with terrific script writing, acting and directing.",1463270400,,2447,5.002463054187192
