4858107,3,B005QBIUKA,"The copy of this movie I have was bought on Amazon. It is clearly copied off of Fox Movie Channel. The copy was good as far and sound and picture quality goes. But, I wonder if it is bootleg. The sellers web sight says these are public domane movies. I sure hope so I do not intend to steal. As for the movie it was great. I loved the songs and loved the dancing.",1348531200,,363,3.918918918918919
4858108,4,B005QBIUKA,"I wish this film were available as DVD or VHS!  There's an unforgettable scene with Phil Silvers singing ""Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder"" that is worth the whole show. You can find that on Youtube (I just watched it yesterday), but I'd like to see the whole film.",1331337600,,280,4.490196078431373
4858109,5,B005QBIUKA,I am a big Betty Grable fan She was the biggest star when Hollywood was Hollywood with all of its glamor. For me it brings back the day when I was excited to see the posters and names in lights of these stars. Days long gone by. This is one of Betty's best. The video has lush Technicolor and good audio. If you like musicals from the forties buy it.,1421107200,,350,4.014285714285714
4858110,5,B005QBIUKA,"Glossy, garish spectacle with Grable doing her spoiled girl routine with great relish. Lots to admire and ogle here and for once, Fox's MOD DVD program gives us a fairly lush and artifact-free DVD we actually don't mind watching more than once.",1405641600,,244,4.833333333333333
4858111,5,B005QBIUKA,"IF YOU LIKE MUSICALS THEN  THIS IS THE TAPE TO BUY  IT IS WONDERFUL  FOR SONG AND DANCE AND BETTY GRABLE IS  SO LOVELY FOR THE  PART, THEN THERE IS COMEDY WITH CESAR ROMERO. AND GEORGE MONTGOMERY TO KEEP YOU LAUGHING, THE COLOR IS  OUT OF THIS WORLD  THE PRINT IS THE SAME  AND THE SOUND AND IF YOU HAVE A BIG SCREEN SET UP THEN, YOU WILL BE BACK IN THE CINEMA DAYS  OF THE 40s AND  50s. REALLY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE  YOU NEED TO HAVE A BIG SCREEN TO REALLY ENJOY THE WONDERS OF THE CINEMA , GOOD FOR THE PRICE  AND EXCELLENT ALL OVER  A PERFECT BUY .",1404172800,,549,3.794642857142857

4858114,5,B005QBIUKA,"A lovely movie,what you would expect from beautiful Betty.a fine performance,gorgeous costumes  and great co stars,pure entertainment. The only problem was the chemistry between Betty and George Montgomery,there was none. They didn't convince me. Other than that small point,I really enjoyed the picture.",1390694400,,304,6.069767441860465

She was a ""one take star""  always on time..was a fav of all the crew members...no temper..saw her in Vegas many times..Very down to earth .. Best number..""Take it From There"" also  ""Cuddle Up a Little Closer"" and ""Put Your Arms Around Me, Hold Me Honey",1381276800,6,518,4.931034482758621

music and a good story behind it also it has a great lineup of stars in this movie
  fantastic stuff",1378598400,,229,4.181818181818182
4858117,4,B005QBIUKA,"The story is a standard musical representation. It keeps moving i.e. story, songs, plot, so you keep your interest going.  The print is very good, and clear.  C6",1376956800,,161,4.714285714285714

4858121,5,B005QBIUKA,"At last, on dvd, this bright Technicolor film has wonderful music and production values.  Betty Grable is at her beautiful best.  Highly recommended!",1366588800,,149,5.434782608695652
4858122,4,B005QBIUKA,"Not great cinema, but a heck of a lot of fun to watch.  The print is wonderful . . . sharp, colorful and clean.  The sound is so good that it almost sounds like stereo.  Coney Island is typical 1940s 20th Century Fox fare but Betty Grable is major joy to watch, especially in technicolor.  No wonder she was so popular.  If you like the genre, if you are a fan of Grable, or if you just enjoy a good time, this one's for you.",1365984000,7,425,3.9529411764705884

4858124,4,B005QBIUKA,"As Phil Silvers would say, ""Glad to see ya!"". Well, I'm glad to see this film on DVD! Finally, finally - after waiting years and years. It's  nice to have this film (and it's ""twin"", Wabash Avenue) out on official DVD. There's plenty of bootlegs of this film  (and many other Betty Grable films) running around out there - buyer beware!. Neither Coney Island or Wabash Avenue have ever been available on VHS or DVD. Both films are part of the ""bare bones"" Fox Cinema Archives collection - no chapters, no fancy inserts, no extras of any kind. Just the movie. I have had a bad, taped from TV bootleg of this movie for years because it never was available. Finally Fox has smartened up and realized that there is a market for this type of film, after all - look at how many badly made bootlegs there are out there. I just think that Betty deserves fancier packaging.

The only thing I don't like about this film is that George Montgomery's singing voice (obviously dubbed) doesn't match his speaking voice. Good thing that it's only for a few lines in one song - ouch!",1363996800,9,1066,4.456410256410257
4858125,4,B005QBIUKA,"Story line is a young guy (George Montgomery) looks up an old pal (Phil Silvers) who is working a stall at Coney Island and convinces him to become his partner. Along the way he runs into another old pal (Cesar Romero) who cheated him and he wants his money. Situation is complicated by a singer (Betty Grable) who works for Romero...lots of singing and dancing,,,back stabbing by both men and eventually all is well.......pretty good story and music from the era......",1363564800,4,469,4.802469135802469
4858126,5,B005QBIUKA,"Coney Island (1943) is perhaps Betty Grable's best musical.

When you take wonderful musical numbers, add a great cast and fill
the screen with Technicolor, the result is pure entertainment.
Betty is joined by George Montgomery, Cesar Romero, Phil Silvers
and Charles Winninger.

Songs include: Beautiful Coney Island, Pretty Baby, Take It From There,
Who Threw The Overalls In Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?,
Put Your Arms Around Me Honey, Cuddle Up A Little Closer,
Miss Lulu From Louisville and many more.

In 1950, Coney Island was re-made, with Betty Grable, as Wabash Avenue.
The story is almost the same scene by scene, but the songs and the
supporting cast was changed. The only other star I can think of
that re-made a film was Clark Gable with Red Dust (1932)
and Mogambo (1953). That's star power!",1362873600,2,800,4.911111111111111
4858127,4,B005QBIUKA,"If you love the 1940's musical, the Fox Technicolor and Betty Grable, then ""Coney Island"" is for you. This is a terrific color print on DVD. There are some wonderful old fashion tunes, beautiful costumes and Betty at her best. There is nothing like these great old musicals.",1362700800,12,274,4.729166666666667
4858128,5,B005QBIUKA,"Coney Island and Sweet Rosie O'Grady made Betty Grable the number one box office attraction of 1943.

Coney Island showcases the girl-next-door-set-to-music persona that made her such a favorite with movie audiences - and the GI's favourite pin-up girl of WW2.  She gives the impression here of enjoying every moment of what she is doing to entertain those watching her on screen.

Grable remade the film as the 1950 release Wabash Avnue, and opinion can be divided on which is the better version.

Coney Island has the most well-known tunes, and is perhaps more light hearted and spectacular. Helen Rose created Grable's terrific wardrobe.

Musical highlights include the Wintertime number, the Danger in the Dance segment and Grable reprising Take It From There throughtout the movie.",1362700800,5,786,5.2063492063492065
8483049,5,B005QBIUKA,"One of Betty's best films with great technicolor, songs and costumes a good supporting cast with George Montgomery, Cesar Romero, Phil Silvers and Charles Winninger, with great musical arrangments by Alfred Newman and choreography by Hermes Pan. A delightful film top of the box office for 1943 and looks great on blu ray I hope Fox release more of these great musicals like Springtime in the rockies, a Cinemascope copy of The best things in life are free, Hello frisco, hello, I wonder who's kissing her now, I'll get by, Oh you beautiful doll thank you Fox.",1529712000,,560,4.783505154639175
8483050,5,B005QBIUKA,"Most of the old Fox Technicolor musicals have only been available as dvds. This and ""The Gangs All Here"" are the exceptions. This is a fun movie. Fox at its best. The picture quality is as good as possible given the fact that Fox no longer has the Technicolor YCM's for the transfer. This was done off an Eastman safety film negative. Too bad!",1511049600,,343,4.375

8483054,3,B005QBIUKA,"THIS IS FOR THE BLU RAY EDITION.
Overall not much better in quality than the standard archive DVD, the image is clean and sharp with slightly more detail but the color is variable on the skin tones especially the male actors much like the release of On The Riviera but not quite so bad, but bad enough to distract you, the faces in some scenes are orange / jaundiced, certainly wish I hadn't wasted my money. This is one of my favourite Betty Grable films so I am very disappointed with this transfer, also there are no extras, not even a trailer, very poor and not worth the asking price. Fox need to up their game, as their track record of poor blu ray transfers is growing at an alarming rate, which is out of order for what is supposed to be a professional company. I for one will be very wary before I waste any more money on their future products. BUYER BEWARE !!!!",1483315200,8,871,4.284848484848485
8483055,4,B005QBIUKA,"Coney Island stars Betty Grable and takes place at the turn of the last century. Smooth-talking Eddie Johnson (George Montgomery) talks his way into a job at friend and rival Joe Roccos (Cesar Romero) Coney Island night spot. Eddie meets the clubs star attraction and Joes love interest, Kate Farley (Betty Grable), a rough-around-the-edges singer who loves flashy clothes. Eddie and Kate argue as he tries to soften her image, and she eventually becomes the main attraction in Coney Island. They fall in love, but Joe tries to sabotage their wedding plans. Songs include Cuddle Up a Little Closer, Beautiful Coney Island, Miss Lulu From Louisville, Old Demon Rum, When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, The Darktown Strutters Ball, and Pretty Baby.

Betty Grable was a huge star in the 1940s. Most of her films followed a traditional backstage musical plot. Though her singing and dancing never won her the stature of the top-notch performers, her lovely looks and bubbly personality came across on screen and she became extremely popular. Technicolor was especially kind to her, as she photographed beautifully in vivid color. According to exhibitors rankings, between 1941 and 1952, Betty Grable was among the top 20 stars in the country.

Also starring in the cast: Charles Winninger and Phil Silvers. Hermes Pan is credited with the choreography and Walter Lang directed. Coney Island was among the ten top-grossing films of 1943.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1482710400,,1482,5.115702479338843
