3871461,4,B00280QNK6,"You know how it goes:  Someone tells you an ""art"" film is good, you put it on your list, you Netflix or rent it.  And then it sits, because you don't have quite enough energy to watch something that might require your brain to kick into first gear.  Such was 12, with me, until I decided to give it the ""30 minute test"":  if I wasn't hooked in 30 minutes, back to Netflix with this sucker.

I was hooked inside of ten minutes.  This Russian language film (English subtitles)serves notice that the Russki's really can make good films, REALLY good films.  Based on the premise of the original American drama Twelve Angry Men, a Chechen teen is accused of murdering his Russian stepfather.  The jury expects deliberation will take less than a half hour, the audience knows otherwise.

Though borrowed from an American film, 12 is uniquely, and in many ways, purely Russian.  Using sharply defined acting and amazingly detailed character studies, 12 unfolds for Westerners an intimate portrait of Russia in the 21st century, and a fascinating and engaging portrait it is.  In a way reminiscent of Slumdog Millionaire, the story unfolds as each juror tells a story about life in Russia, each story but one whittling down the guilty votes.  Each story reveals the Russian soul and temperament in ways that a dry treatise simply cannot.

Complete with a twist at the end that is engaging and powerful, this film will please any viewer that prides him/herself on being a student of foreign cinema.  A bit lengthy (hey, ever heard of a Russian novel that was SHORT?) 12 will reward a bit of patience richly.",1247788800,34,1598,4.722021660649819
3871466,3,B00280QNK6,"If you are from the area or know the politics you will probably like it better then I did.  I'm a huge fan of the original ""12 Angry Men"" and was looking forward to seeing this re-visioning of it.  Instead of being just a great story with amazing acting it was trying to be artsy (which can be good) and camera, staging plus extra footage that just didn't fit for me.

But still take a look and check it for your self.  I'm not saying it isn't worth the time, just not good enough for more stars.",1474848000,,496,4.082474226804123

3871468,5,B00280QNK6,"It's a great movie. I like how the story is overly told so dramatic. The English subtitles worked perfect, a bit beat slower some lines but not so bad. The one thing I did not like about this movie is the closing shot (the dog....and the one he is holding with mouth...), I don't think it was necessary scene needed to close the movie, it could have closed just as the ending of the story. Other than that, it's a great movie to watch. You can feel how the humanity, each ethical perspective is so different depends on people's culture, history, and experiences.",1459209600,,562,4.466019417475728

Inhumanity and humanity so perfectly displayed. If you're not into subtitles, this would be a good movie where you might even forget they're there.

3871479,5,B00280QNK6,"I have been a fan of the Henry Fonda version ever since I first saw it.  The Jack Lemmon George C Scott version was my 1st, but original will always be close to my heart as one of the great classics.
That being said, this Russian adaptation is near perfect.  Do not let the subtitles detour you.  There is powerful emotion behind the acting that helps give the closed captioning life.  The jurors are more flushed out, giving each one time to talk, and you learn a little something about each one.  The biggest change that I don't know is good or bad is the boy on trial.  The juror room scenes are interrupted to see the boy in his cell waiting, biding his time until a decision is reached.  It also cuts to the boy's past, so you can understand where the boy came from.  Again I don't know if that was a good or bad choice, but here it seems to work well.  Definitely check this one out.",1447200000,,889,4.182352941176471

3871482,5,B00280QNK6,"The Russian film ""12"" is based on the American classic, ""Twelve Angry Men"" but it is immeasurably better. Not only is ""12"" a compelling drama of 12 jurors trying to arrive at a verdict in the case of a young Chechen man accused of murdering his stepfather, but also the film opens up a window into contemporary Russia that avoids the traditional stereotypes.

3871489,5,B00280QNK6,"I am stunned by this g888t movie.  The doctor with his knife/dance was just totally jeepers creepers out of this world and how it ended up on the table and cut off the TV producer's purple cigarette into half in the process.  The doctor afterwards giggle and does his aw shucks expressions just so tickled me silly.  The cab driver's story abt his son was so haunting that I literally shivered.  The bird caught in the jury room/school gymnasium gave it a thought provoking touch especially in the end and how it gave it an ironic twist (free) along with  graphics of the horrors of war.  I know I missed some things such as the dog with the amputated arm WITH THE RING FLASHING.  I will need to watch it again to find out WHOSE arm is that.  I also enjoyed seeing different cultures of the many kinds of Russians with these 12 men.  I saw the American 12 Angry Men as well as the earlier one with Henry Fonda.  All 3 are excellent in their own ways; the earlier one with the culture of the 50's, the later one with the many different cultures/nationalities of today besides the great actors that are dead now, George C. Scott, Jack Lemmon and Hume.  I enjoyed seeing so many different personalites and their quirks.",1429920000,,1216,4.4324324324324325

It shows how Russians overcame the collapse of the Soviet Union, the struggles they faced just to make it a democratic society with a strict legal system.

This film stands out as great cinema without requiring any help from the original.  The basic story is the same, a young man accused of a crime and his life is placed in the hands of a group of mostly indifferent men full of their own biases that inclines them toward a speedy conviction.  But one juror take a chance and challenges the others to think more deeply about their actions and why they think the way they do.  That is where the similarity to the original classic ends and the truly Russian flavor of the film takes over with vivid symbolism and gritty heart-wrenching dialog.

It doesn't follow the same story as the original American movie, just the premise (a juries deliberations over a seemingly simple case). But the whole story is different and takes place in an intensely Russian way, with Russian concerns and cultural issues.

There are stories within stories in this movie, and it's gripping, intense, moving, emotional, and incredible fun to watch. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves dramatic movies.",1401408000,,535,5.357142857142857

It soars as high above ""Twelve Angry Men"" as mercy does justice.  If you don't get this point, you won't understand its powerful message.  Man's justice?  Christ's mercy.

If you have seen the English version then it is even more interesting to make the comparison. The screenplay of the Russian version brilliantly places the story elements of the original English version within a modern Russian context that works completely. Strongly engaging and convincing. Not recommended if you cannot deal with subtitles, otherwise highly recommend.",1373241600,,546,5.590361445783133

This is, hands down, one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time.  It is something of a remake of 12 Angry Men, but is so, so, so much better.

I'm not a foreign film buff, or an independent film buff. I do like mainstream Hollywood product.  I say this so you will take my comments as coming from an average, ordinary audience.  I'm sure this is getting raves from foreign and independent film buffs and I don't want others to be put off by reviewers eschewing Hollywood.

It includes information about Chechnya, you know, the place the Boston Bombers are from.  It looks in on Russia after the break-up of the USSR. It looks back on the USSR period sometimes in nostalgia and sometimes with chagrin.  Like 12 Angry Men, it shines a bright light on preconceived notions about what pieces of evidence might mean.  From beginning to end every aspect of the film is top drawer.

The acting is out of this world.  Every performance is superb.  As for why the CD cover has birds on it; you'll just have to see.",1370822400,,1242,4.256410256410256

If you are not into foreign films and you thought that Slum Dog Millionaire was over rated then I think that you should give this movie a try. Amazon is giving it away at this price. The movie has a great feel. Hard to describe, but I think a lot of what American audiences find to be a negative about foreign films is not a problem with this film. That problem generally has to do with pacing and production values. This movie has great pacing, good tension throughout and very high production standards. Add to that a great story/script adaptation - which Hollywood hasn't delivered in years - and I think just about anyone will enjoy this movie.",1357171200,2,920,4.514970059880239

The movie is in Russian with English subtitles. The story is Russian but follows the American move in true form. After seeing this movie I had to get a copy for myself.

If you are only interested in the basic story and you don't want to read it, I would suggest you see 12 angry men.  Same story in a different country and it's in English...if you LOVE IT then with a Cliff Notes idea of what is going on. Read it in Russian for two and a half hours.

It is a truly great movie in both venues.  But I would say not for light viewing.  The whole movie takes place in the sequestration of the Jury room.  It is an excellent study of human psychology as well as the influence of one person on another.  It is a lot of leader/follower relationship.

12 is directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, whose 1994 movie, gBurnt by the Sun,h won an Academy Award for best foreign-language film. On 8 September 2007, the film 12 received a special Golden Lion for the gconsistent brillianceh of its work and was praised by many critics at the Venice Film Festival. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.",1323043200,,590,5.91764705882353
3871520,5,B00280QNK6,"Twice ""12"" is 24, and that happens to be the number of five/four star reviews already posted about this film. The really odd thing, however, is that all of the favorable reviews are unusually brief, while the critical one-star is extended. I can relate to this response. I surely don't want to say anything about the film that would disclose either its story line or its powerful sociological content. That leaves me only the option to acclaim the acting of the twelve jurors and the bailiff, along with the genius of the casting director. I knew these guys! They're all the Russian/Ukrainian post-Gorbachev immigrants who live next door to me in San Francisco. In other words, they're utterly convincing, even when they explode bizarrely. Their emotions are as Russian as their faces.

This film is an ""imitation"" of the American film ""Twelve Angry Men"" -- an ""imitation"" in the sense that Robert Lowell intended for his very free translations of poetry. The American film was powerful. The Russian ""imitation"" is every bit as powerful. Don't miss it!",1319414400,3,1052,4.943502824858757
3871521,5,B00280QNK6,"I loved this movie when I saw it at the Palm Springs film feastival.
It was nice to add it to my collection.
It was delivered on schedule and in good condition.",1308009600,,160,4.03125
3871522,5,B00280QNK6,"This is an extraordinary work which in good Russian style manages to be both intensely serious and yet quite light, with acute observation, great philosophising and a sting in the tail. It riffs on its original very well with a focus on modern Russia, the war in Chechnya, and the very different motives of the jurors. At times it might be a bit 'talky' for Western tastes--but it is a kind of modern morality play that is as unsettling as it is thoughtful.",1306195200,2,457,4.518072289156627
3871523,4,B00280QNK6,"""Twelve Angry Men"" is a script that is almost Shakespearean in its ability to morph with the times.  Here, Mikhalkov proves that it can also morph with the culture.  And ""12"" provides a sense of suspense that equals that in the Henry Fonda vehicle.  I have two disclaimers:  1) I didn't know this didn't have English subtitles when I ordered it and 2) I didn't understand it well until I watched the subtitled version online.  But if you are familiar with ""Twelve Angry Men"" and know a bit of Russian, as I did, avoiding the abstraction of subtitles adds to the sense of contemporary Russian and Caucasian culture.

I wish Mikhalkov had stuck to the ""one set"" rule of the original, which took place in a claustrophobic jury room (perhaps in a nod to everything falling apart in Russia over the years, Mikhalkov's court is in repair and the jurors have to use a high school gym; we also meet the Chechen defendant they are discussing, in scenes of his early life with the father he's charged with killing, and as he paces nervously in his cell awaiting his fate).

Thoroughly enjoyable!  Just make sure to get the version most appropriate for your viewing comfort.",1303430400,2,1163,4.639024390243902
3871524,5,B00280QNK6,"A superb dramatic movie... exceeding, by far, anything that has come out of Hollywood in many, many years. The actors are brilliant in their portrayals, the script is a gem, the cinematography is perfect for the context. However, in the interest of full disclosure, to get the most out of this film, to fully appreciate it for the gem that it is, probably requires that the viewer is either a native Russian, or one that has been extensively exposed to Russian culture, to the language... to have a feeling for, an understanding of, the Russian ""soul"", the very unique modern Russian personality. For those that do not have such familiarity, the movie can provide an excellent vehicle with which to discover, to experience that unique personality. Yes, there are a few situations that overreach- exhibiting behavior and personal revelations that go beyond what might reasonably be expected under the circumstances. But these 'defects' are infrequent and overwhelmed by the otherwise superb quality of this movie. For anyone studying Russia, the language, the culture, watching this movie- without turning on the English subtitles- can be  more valuable than a semester abroad in, say, Moscow or St. Petersburg.",1301875200,3,1210,5.173469387755102
3871525,4,B00280QNK6,"I'm a fan of the original, and while the Friedkin remake might leave us wondering why anyone would do it again. We are so use to remakes of foriegn films by hollywood. It was refreshing to see the reverse. Its as good as the original and better than Friedkin's remake. The Director even tied AC/Heat problems to construction issues and callousness. Very smart.

Here are my cons resulting in a one point deduction. The Russians speak fast, and the subtitles had me rewinding a bit. This is a personal gnostic problem I have. I'm wondering if there are double meanings or hidden allegories, so I have to rewind when something is said I might chew on. Also, this movie is very long, so it was challenging.

The Director did something remarkable, and unexpected. He played it like the original, deconstructing contemporary society past and present. I'll admit, my sympathies had long been for the far removed Caucuses, Jews and Siberian folk. Here the characters deal with their own pasts, their prejudices. The flashback sequencies and long personal stories make each flawed character sympathetic. No punches pulled. All along while the 12 very angry men are sitting in judgement of the youth, we see the tragic life of the youth revealed through the horror of war, the death of his parents, and the warmeth of his first adopted father. (Number of Dads is 3).

This is 12 angry men placed in the Russian societal context, and yet a slight wink is made toward the hypothetical of the American form of courtroom justice. Very clever. The Director takes it farther, by revealing the faces of the killer(s), and leaves me rooting for FSB hit squads. That was neat trick.

I came out of watching the film feeling intense hope for the future of Russia.

The future of the youth is laid out in a myriad of possible tragic conclusions, not unlike the abyss of the US Foster Care program but worse. Yet, one glimmering hope for the boy is revealed and its tied to Greater Russian (ie Multi-cultural) Unity and Decency. The Law is a brick to build walls, and only mercy, respect and other virtues cultivated can tear down the prison we build for ourselves and our cultures.",1297209600,6,2161,4.721485411140583
3871526,4,B00280QNK6,"It wasn't too many years ago when I first saw ""Twelve Angry Men"".  I was duly impressed but, like many things you wait a long time for, there were aspects of the movie that left me mildly disappointed.  I suppose it was the way it ended; it seemed to have been too abrupt.  When I saw that the Russians had made a new version of TAM I was skepticle and when I saw how long it was, I put it aside.

When I watched ""12"" last Saturday night, I quickly became aware that the scope of ""12"" went beyond the scope of TAM.  We were to know the accused, his background, the conflict from which the tensions and prejudices arose.  The bulk of the movie was still the focus of 12 different men.  The drama of ""12"" (and TAM) was how each of them was confronted with themselves.  Each of them had their story to tell and in each of those stories was the unique perspective it brought to them and to those who would listen.  It took longer for these stories to come out and they went a lot longer than in TAM but the impact, to me, was greater in ""12"".

The stories of the jury are interspliced with scenes from the accused, the circunstances and the crime.  While many of the aspects of the original play were there (the knife, the witnesses's testimony, etc), ""12"" adds to the outcome by adding a chapter (and a significant one at that) after the point in which TAM has concluded.  The gist of it was the question that the jurors had to confront.  In reaching the verdict they chose, were they willing to walk the walk besides just talking the talk.  Sounds simple enough but it was impressive how ""12"" challenged the viewers to consider the responsibilities of judgement; it's not so hard to do if you don't have to help clean up the mess.

Finally, there was another compelling aspect of the movie in the form of a small bird which somehow got caught in the rather large jury room.  In the end, the last juror leaving opened a couple of large windows to give the bird a means of escape from its' comfortable prison.  The opened windows revealed a cold winter's storm with blowing snow.  What would the bird chose; challenging freedom or comfortable captivity?",1297036800,4,2149,4.370277078085643
3871527,5,B00280QNK6,"I've never been much interested in foreign films but the title of ""12"" caught my attention as I have long been a fan of the wonderful old Fonda/Begley/Klugman/Marshall/Cobb/et.al. classic ""12 Angry Men"".  Thinking this was a remake (which it is), I watch it on Encore TV.  What a surprise - a Russian English-subtitled movie!!  Almost from the beginning I was captivated.  The tremendous performances of each actor were both obvious and incredible - even reading the subtitles.  The farther I went along in the movie the more I was edge-of-my-seat engrossed!  As good as the old ""12 Angry Men"" was, this movie is that much better!  I hate using artsy terms like ""powerful"", but that's what this movie was.

If all you have studied or are interested in is American history, then this version would be shocking, as it was to some of the other reviewers. Unlike the American film, the Russian ensemble cast is almost all brilliant actors, whereas the American version really only has Fonda, who made that film successful, in my opinion.",1292025600,2,530,4.966292134831461

Mikhalkov's  movie's ending is more philosphical. Also Mihkalkov's role as an actor is something that was missing from 1957 movie.
I liked also Mikhalkov's characters  -  they are more lively and depicting well Russian nature and society, not that 1957 movie's characters were weak.",1286928000,3,446,5.166666666666667

They are both excellent movies with a powerful message.  However, the Russian movie ""12"" was by far my favorite and the main reason is the cultural dancing shown by the young defendant (in flashbacks as a child and also while waiting his fate in his jail cell).

""12"" is a gripping tale of a ragtag group of jurors(a bigoted cabie, a neurotic TV producer, and a kindhearted architect to name a few) who must decide the fate of a young Chechen boy accused of murdering his father. As they gather in a run down high school gym, the disinterested jurors quickly agree on a guilty charge. They all have places to go people to see. One open minded juror disagrees and begins a fascinating process of deduction and personal revelation. As the jurors slowly pick away at the case they take turns being the star of the film, each one giving their back story and a reason for casting their guilty/not guilty vote. Even though the film is in Russian, there is no denying that the acting is superb. Every actor gives a riveting performance and that's something rare in film. ""12"" is a wonderful film, The acting is some of the best I've seen recently and it's a very entertaining ""whodunit/court room drama"". Fascinating, gripping, and at times touching, ""12"" is a film you should make a point in watching.",1257638400,4,1195,4.4363636363636365
3871538,2,B00280QNK6,"""12"" is two title-words shorter and a full sixty-three minutes longer than ""Twelve Angry Men,"" the 1957 Sydney Lumet classic on which this turgid Russian drama is based.  Despite the obvious language difference, the Nikita Mikhalkov/Alexandr Novotosky/Vladimir Moiseyenko screenplay follows the Reginald Rose original - which began life as a ""Studio One"" teleplay in 1954 - fairly closely in form and outline.  Again, eleven members of a jury stand ready to convict a young man of first-degree murder (in this case, for killing his foster father, an officer in the Russian army, for money) - until, that is, the lone holdout is able to sow enough doubt in the other jurors' minds to eventually get them to vote his way.  And while in the original film the suspect faced racism and xenophobia on account of his being Hispanic, the suspect here suffers a similar fate for being Chechnyan.

In the central role of the original dissenter, Sergei Makovetsky lacks the easily recognizable charm and charisma of Henry Fonda - and while this may make him a bit more believable as an ""everyman"" figure, it also makes him a less compelling focal point for a drama that takes far too long to play itself out.  The extended length results, primarily, from the inclusion of brief flashbacks to the defendant's past, recounting the lead-up to the crime and the crime itself, as well as from individual speeches that drone on long past the point where any point can still be made.  Each of the twelve jurors gets his moment in the spotlight to ham it up and declaim wildly on his theories about the case, his hatred of one ethnic group or another (in addition to anti-Chechnya sentiment, there's a great deal of anti-Semitism floating around the room as well), and the deplorable state of life in Russia - till the point where we no longer care about these people or the decision they're being forced to make.  Eventually, we just want to get out of that place as badly as the men who are trapped inside it.  And not all the talk about the Russian soul, not all the discussions of national politics or personal spleen-venting on the part of the participants can make us care one iota about the drama that`s unfolding.

The question one must finally ask when watching ""12"" is why anyone would want to take a work like ""Twelve Angry Men,"" celebrated for its brevity and dramatic precision, and turn it into a lumbering, ponderous, elephantine bore - replete with endless speechifying and scenery-chewing performances.  Why indeed!",1252627200,11,2513,4.823255813953488
3871539,5,B00280QNK6,"I accidentally stumbled upon this movie one boring Friday night when I stopped by a local Blockbuster store.  Never even heard of it before and at first rolled my eyes thinking that this would be Mikhalkov's feeble attempt to remake a classic that I like so much.  As an expatriate from the former Soviet Union, I tend to be a bit suspicious when it comes to Russian attempts to ""go Hollywood.""  Yet, I felt some weird pull to rent it...

I must say, this movie completely blew me away!!!  I would imagine it tough reading the subtitles for a movie that relies so heavily on dialog and small nuances of speech and my hat is off to those of you who were willing to invest the time to watch this movie.  It's also sad that some of the things got lost in translation: accents of some of the jurors, or the fact that the bombed cafe in the flash-back scenes was called ""Cheburashka"" - a sweet stuffed animal cartoon character every Russian child grew up with (oh, the irony!), or that the hand-scribbled sign above the entrance into the basement where the boy was hiding read, ""Don't shoot, there are women and children inside,"" etc.  Nevertheless, the fact that none of these things - the length, the subtitles, the little things lost in translation, the cultural differences - took away from the power of the movie serves as a testament to the director's craft.

The acting is superb (if extravagant), and the direction and montage artful, even at times beautiful.  Mysterious and poetical symbols are scattered throughout; it is a credit to the director's skill that they remain so effective.  Two hours and 40 minutes of speeches you have to read as subtitles may seem like a chore.  It is instead a moving and illuminating experience.",1251244800,21,670,5.036363636363636
3871541,4,B00280QNK6,"Nikita Mikhalkov has re-worked Sidney Lumet's 1957 film ""12 Angry Men"" for post-communist Russia in ""12"", which he co-wrote and directed. In contemporary Moscow, twelve jurors are to decide the fate of a Chechen young man (Apti Magamaev) who is accused of the stabbing death of his foster father, a former Russian army officer who adopted young Umar when he was orphaned in the Chechen War. As the jury room is undergoing renovations, the jurors are compelled to conduct their deliberations in the gymnasium of a nearby middle school. The court expects a quick verdict; so do the jurors. They are surprised to find that one among them, a physicist and recovered alcoholic (Sergei Makovetski), votes ""not guilty"". This begins a long day and night of arguments, re-enactments, and speculation about the case, until they reach a unanimous decision.

Conventions of the American judicial system have been superimposed on Russia for dramatic purposes. In reality, Russian juries must only reach a majority, not unanimous, verdict, and appeals are unlimited. To give the deliberations more weight, the film's jury is working within the constraints of the American system. ""12"" seems to have been better received by foreigners than by Russians or Chechens, though. It's easy for foreigners to see the film as a social commentary in which the jurors represent different perspectives, classes, and backgrounds of a diverse and modern Russia. Like ""12 Angry Men"", it is not so much a comment on the working of the courts as an examination of the sources and consequences of people's prejudices, as well as a condemnation of moral laziness.

I gather that Chechens see ""12"" as misleading in claiming that a Chechen defendant could get justice from a Russian court. They think it's unrealistic that a jury would be so diligent in deciding the fate of a Chechen. But that is true anywhere in the world. People don't care that much. The premise was never intended to be realistic. One Russian opposition journalist accused the film of being pro-corruption and pro-Putin. It seems opaque on the issue of corruption. And, while the filmmaker is a Putin supporter, it is difficult for a foreigner to judge the film's politics. I don't recognize the various allusions presented by the jury members. I was only struck by the long-held Russian view that businesspeople are corrupt and parasitic. And the film does seem to support jury trials, which have been a contentious issue in Russia since their revival in 1993.

In the end, I was impressed by this film's ability to hold my attention for 2 hours and 37 minutes, even though it is talky, and I had to read subtitles the whole time. It gets going after a dull first 20 minutes. Predictably, most of the jurors give us their life stories so that we understand why they are so quick to find the defendant guilty -and so quick to change their minds. Intercut with the jury deliberations are flashbacks to Umar's experiences in wartorn Chechnya, as he awaits the verdict in his cell. Some speculation about the crime's true motives seems to be based on hearsay and overactive imaginations, which undercuts the film's themes to an extent. And the final moments of the deliberations feel contrived. But the characters and their speeches are generally engrossing.

It is a good movie for the Americans to watch particularly at this time of prevailing fear of immigrants and/or people of color. A better idea might be to watch the Twelve Angry Men first. The acting in this movie is top quality and the traditional biased Russian petite bourgeoisie attitude toward people of the Republics occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire (by the sword) comes across clearly. At the end, things turn onto unexpected direction pointing finger at the true source of evil in societies. In the original Russian the movie is more effective but the subtitles, if you can catch up with them, are adequate. I find this movie to be closer to Nikita Mkhalkovs heart and values than his other attempts. He is an intelligent and talented director and actor.
