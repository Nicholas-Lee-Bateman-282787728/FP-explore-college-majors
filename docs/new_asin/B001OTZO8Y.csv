3736486,5,B001OTZO8Y,"Although ""love"" isn't the first word I would choose to describe my response to DAY AND NIGHT, it is a remarkable film--emotionally wrenching without an ounce of gooey sentimentality; darkly disturbing, though not without moments of humor; and beautifully acted by some of Sweden's finest artists.  Mikael Persbrandt, who is equally well known for his stage and film work, is spot-on as a businessman and family man who has reached the end of his rope.  I highly recommend Persbrandt's other films available on Amazon, and hope Amazon will add more of them to its offerings.",1355702400,,573,5.021052631578947
3736487,3,B001OTZO8Y,"Ok,maybe a 3.5 but I wouldn't go higher than that.  There are two good things to say about this movie. 1. You are surprised - at least I was.  2.  Michael Nyqvist looks really, really good (Then again, when has he looked bad?) He is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise very dark film.
There are three things that caused the low rating.  1. You really, really have to pay attention to what is happening, otherwise it's easy to get lost.  2.  Michael is on screen for about 3 minutes in the entire flick.  3.  The subject matter deals with both incest and suicide - so if you are sensitive to these, think twice.
For a collector, it's a good movie to add to your collection.  For entertainment?  Not really.",1302048000,4,707,4.287878787878788
3736488,5,B001OTZO8Y,"From the first spoken sentence in this movie you know what will happen, but you still keep feeling sad throughout the whole movie. And of course Micke Persbrandt is gorgeous...",1286582400,5,176,4.9
8331558,5,B001OTZO8Y,I have watched this movie several times. and without a doubt Mikael Persbrandt delivers a spellbinding performance.,1505952000,,115,5.823529411764706
8331559,2,B001OTZO8Y,Very disappointed.  Loved the actor in Beck; do hope they find a good lead role for such a talented actor.  Such a pity there aren't better writers.,1504396800,,148,4.444444444444445
8331560,1,B001OTZO8Y,"Set in Sweden, starring the great Mikael Persbrandt and other wonderful, celebrated Swedish actors, this film is a one-note downer. In the opening credits we're told this man is going to kill himself and at the end of the film he does. Meanwhile, we're treated to the people in his life he wants to say good-bye to in the most abusive way possible. YUK.",1491523200,,353,4.53125
8331561,3,B001OTZO8Y,"I love this actor and the performances all portray Scandinavian angst at its best, but it is the cinematic equivalent of watching a long, slow, tub soak with a dependable razor in play.",1452124800,,185,4.636363636363637
8331562,1,B001OTZO8Y,"I love this actor and love the Scandinavian noire films and series. But this movie just droned on and on. The pace was so slow and the subject so maudlin. By the end of the first half hour, I could not stand waiting for something to happen.",1444867200,,240,4.127659574468085
8331563,5,B001OTZO8Y,"OMG. Once again the beautiful Mikael deliver. from the very beginning, u can feel the tension building, the scene in the car with his son, was gut wrenching because u know how the day will end. The actress who plays his girlfriend is his real life ex-girlfriend. If u are having a really, really really, bad day this is not the movie for you. Otherwise, highly recommend
an aside Mikael has admitted to alcohol problem and being bipolar. Ck out his facebook page, the man is a wonderful artist, singer, race car driver, producer. multi-talented",1435881600,,544,4.7368421052631575
8331564,3,B001OTZO8Y,"If you liked Gunwald from the  ""Beck"" series, you will like this movie.  My 3-star rating only means I didn't see enough of this actor and hoped for a different ending.  Can you tell I can't remember Mikael's last name? ;-)",1429401600,,223,4.390243902439025
8331565,3,B001OTZO8Y,"Well, if you've had a terrible day, been fired, had divorce papers served on you, or made a bad investment, don't watch this film. On the other hand, if you are under a Pollyana phase of senseless optimism and utter joy, this film will certainly rid you of such silliness.

Don't get me wrong - the film is a serious work; it's just deadly. Only 15 minutes into it I'm thinking, my word, Bergman is back - with a vengeance. The characters do that form of mono-dialogue that segues from utterly mundane chat to existential despair - in two paragraphs. This script will leaven no one's sense of feeling down. Don't watch it with a loaded gun in the house.

If you try real hard, you might view this film as a parody of Bergman and that will help you. If you do this you will view the film as enormously funny - but very grim humor indeed.

The cast is wonderful - many very fine Swedish stand-bys including Erland Josephson in one of the funniest characters ever seen. But, can't say the film was really entertaining in any robust sense of the word.",1411516800,6,1047,4.38659793814433
8331566,5,B001OTZO8Y,Very interesting movie - A bit disturbing but very original.,1410739200,,60,5.1
