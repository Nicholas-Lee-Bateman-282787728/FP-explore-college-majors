7868290,5,6304290055,"these f1 vhs from 10 years ago are becoming harder to come by. these NTSC version are harder to find especially here in the US.

the 1996 season dvd is by far, personally, the best ive seen. no traction control, its schumacher first year in the ferrari! benetton's struggle. schumacher verses hill vs villenueve. the argentinian gp on is it ever hear of that?

all the races are covered. each having all the highlights of each race lasting 10 minutes approximately. its covers, the news from driver changes, new technicals on the cars, to qualifying and race.

if you can get your hands on one of these do so or youll miss a great season full of surprises.",1217721600,,656,4.5423728813559325
7868291,5,6304290055,"The 1996 Formula One season marked the return to power for the Williams team and saw Michael Schumacher move from his championship-winning Benneton team to Ferrari. Jaques Villeneuve arrived in Formula One and at Williams with a bang, but Damon Hill fought valiantly to finally obtain the title that had eluded him in the years prior. Although 1996 was the year before the arrival of digital footage in F1, the video material is of superb quality, and there is lots of extra footage and background material accompanying each race that was not previously seen on TV. Well worth it!",1078704000,,580,4.8686868686868685
