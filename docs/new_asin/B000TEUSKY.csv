Con's : It was a reality show that seem to point out the drama of the unsucessful climbers. The movie could have been shortened to save time.

2896944,4,B000TEUSKY,"Please note that this review contains spoilers. Don't read if you don't want to know the ending.

First off, let me say that if you're looking for a series that covers an Everest expedition with careful attention to detail, this is the series for you. Over the course of six episodes, we get to know the individual climbers pretty well. We learn their motivations, their fears, their hopes and the risks they are taking by climbing this mountain. We watch them suffer from exhaustion, oxygen deprivation, frostbite and other serious ailments. By the end of the series, you've come to care about these climbers and you feel you have a vested interest in the success of their summit bids.

What's even more noteworthy is the exceptional job done by the photojournalists who shot the climb -- some of whom were sherpas. Using special cameras attached to their headgear (humorously nicknamed ""sherpacams"" by the production team), the climbers were able to continuously shoot their dangerous trek from the Death Zone to the summit. As someone who has seen a lot of documentaries of Everest, this is some of the most breathtaking footage ever shot of that mountain.

From the production angle, this documentary gets top marks. Kudos to the Discovery Channel for placing this in our hands.

So why is one star deducted?

It should be noted that this documentary was shot during the 2006 climbing season -- one of the deadliest seasons on record, rivaled only by the 1996 climbing season recounted in John Krakauer's book ""Into Thin Air"".

If memory serves, 11 people died in 2006. One of them is David Sharp, a solo climber who collapsed in the Death Zone. Members of the Discovery Channel's expedition encountered the dying Sharp while making their way down from their summit attempts (there is actually some dispute as to whether they also encountered him on the way up).

To their credit, some of the climbers (like Lebanese climber Max Chaya) attempted to help Sharp. But ultimately Russell Brice -- the expedition's guide who stayed below at Advanced Base Camp -- ordered them to leave Sharp to his death. All of this is covered in detail in the final episode, as it happens -- even to the extent of including Chaya's weeping transmissions as he has to leave the climber to die.

Brice's logic is simple:  he doesn't want to risk the lives of his own clients (who are already frostbitten and on the verge of exhaustion) to save the (at the time) unknown climber.

In retrospect, he was probably right.

All the same, when it's all said and done, I can't decide if I like Brice or not. That incident causes you to see the trek to Everest in much different light. Is it really worth it? It would be one thing if you were climbing for the purposes of exploration and discovery...if the trek had never been done before and you were hoping to learn something new. (Like the first lunar landing or a manned mission to Mars.) But why are these guys going? To fly a flag and get their picture taken? Bravado? Vanity?

Leaving Sharp was a tough moral decision...one that's hard to reconcile. Until I can do that, I'm docking one star.

Oh...and one quick note to the producers:  there's no such word as ""disorientated"". Other than that, it's an excellent documentary.",1194825600,39,3256,4.739823008849558
2896945,3,B000TEUSKY,"I purchased this with high hopes of seeing a dramatic presentation on the effort and details on climbing Everest, with spectacular views of the region and some information too about the Sherpas who make a living guiding good and bad climbers up the mountainside.  The views and the Sherpas are here, but the focus is almost completely on the people and their personalities.  I got bored in the first episode and it went downhill for me afterwards.  Lots of worrying, grandstanding, sorrowing, and so on.  Very emotional at times, but again, not much about the climbing or climbing techniques.  Not informative but perhaps best described as a passionate human-interest story.",1193270400,7,674,5.090909090909091
2896946,3,B000TEUSKY,"I saw every episode.

Cons: The shows tended to focus on some of the weaker players.  Men, who did not seem to not belong on Everest.  I would have much rather seen much more footage detailing how the pros prepared and climbed Everest (such as ""Max"" who seemed to be smart and strong).

Pros: I really got a feel for what it took to climb Everest.  I have a better understanding of the physical requirements as well as the natural elements that come into play.

In a nutshell: Since I've seen the episodes, I just can't get myself to buy this.  It was good, not great.  If you have not seen this, then it's worth buying (and it would be a great gift!).

The production is first rate, but the content left me starved for more information and for that reason I can only give it 3.5 stars.  I'm looking forward to the next installment ""Everest2"" starting in late October of 2007 on the Discovery Channel.",1192406400,6,901,4.373493975903615

I have been an armchair Everest fan and have read many books on the subject. This series really helped bring the climb to life for me, with the amazing views and images. A video is worth a thousand words, I guess, as I had read about this climb so much but nothing compares to actually seeeing this stunning place.

2896962,4,B000TEUSKY,"Great show overall for mountaineering enthusiasts.  I'd really love to see a season 4 shot in 1080p.

FYI, a helicopter did land on the summit so I'm not sure why it's not an extraction option.

Pluses:
Compelling climbers and leader.

Show's Russell's extreme organization and respect for the mountain and the importance of a quality guide service

Makes a good example of people like David Sharp.  It was devastating to see someone die, but I actually think they should have showed more of him during the revival attempt to show what can happens when things go wrong.  If they had saved him, the message would be ""It's ok to climb alone through cutrate outfits for $6000 because a team of four that paid $40,000 each will give up their summit attempts and risk their lives to save me.""  If 2 lives are saved because 2 future climbers decided to spend a bit more for a Sherpa companion, David will not have died in vain.  Keep in mind, guides and Sherpas need summits as well as that is their resume for future jobs and clients.

Negatives:
Should have explained the difference between the North and South routes and why Russell chose this route.

Should have covered Sherpas better.  They are a compelling mountain super men, and I would have loved to see them setting the fixed lines.

Should have covered guides a little more.

Should the steepness and exposure more.

Should have shown some mountaineering technique.  It just looked like a long slog with a few scrambles.

Hated all the made for TV commercial break recaps.

The over dramatic narrator.",1332288000,,1557,4.724907063197026
2896963,2,B000TEUSKY,"Did no one else find it incredibly disturbing that, in the first episode alone, a young Sherpa passed away during the show's first few minutes and a very severely ill man was shown labouring for breath and turning white as his brain swelled?  It was played as a heroic story of the climbers rescuing a man, but I just found it deeply unsettling.  I couldn't take away the inspirational messages of conquering the mountain and all that tripe.  I could only sit there and wonder, ""Is climbing a mountain for entertainment really worth it?"" as, on the screen in front of me, a man's eyelids were peeled open to reveal blank and unresponsive eyes, before the camera cut away to dramatic closeups of the climbers.  Not to mention that Sherpa.  Everyone is concerned over David Sharp's death, but what about the young man who died?  Is he less important?

This was too disturbing and voyeuristic.  I couldn't stomach it.",1305158400,2,914,4.70440251572327

2896966,2,B000TEUSKY,"Only a Discovery reality series could take climbing the highest mountain on earth and make it seem as melodramatic as The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Some of the characters (that's what they are after all) are truly inspiring, but when you get down to it, commercial summit expeditions aren't really very interesting. The dramatic focus of the last few episodes of Season 1 is basically a bunch of guys standing around waiting for a bunch of other guys to climb up a ladder (yes, a ladder like you get from the hardware store).

2896968,4,B000TEUSKY,"Very enyoyable, 21 April 2010

I watched these series with a gap of about 2 years between series 1 and 2. My impression was that series 1 was more interesting as there was a greater variety of charathers whereas series 2 was overshadowed by the amusing Tim, whose ego was as big as his frame. The scenery is really lovely but there are annoying features, namely the obsessive Machismo, the personifcation by the charachters of the mountain and the frequent recapitulations which must have preceded and followed commercial breaks. Even so, it is all very enjoyable and one really wants to know who will summit. Clearly these guys have extrordinary self-discipline in this context but I wondered to myself whether this self-discipline was reflected in other parts of their lives. As the Dane rightly put it, his bigger challenge was his forthcoming marriage and in that he was spot on. Climbimg everest is about a dialogue with oneslef - there is something more majestic about making a sucess out of a marriage where the dialogue is with another person rather than with myself battling a mountain!",1271808000,,1095,4.887096774193548

But I don't think thats my job as I'm reviewing it as entertainment and as a series. As far as that goes, it was great, as many other people have pointed out. I feel thats already been covered, so I wanted to point out, this DVD is not enhanced for 16X9. Anamorphic Widescreen is not part of this, so one will have to stretch the image, losing some resolution. On my TV, it looked like poo.

Avoid Season 3 altogether; it is extremely repetitive, and its climax involves climbers with uncontrollable diarrhea and no place to go except in their own pants, a VERY unpleasant thought.

To be honest, I have very mixed feelings about climbing mountains like Everest.  Yes, it is beautiful, and I like people challenging themselves -- but is it worth the expense, the risk to their own lives, and the risks to the lives of others?  Nothing new is being learned, and the idea that the feat will draw attention to some worthy cause or serve as inspiration is self-delusion.",1526688000,,676,4.843478260869565

8208788,3,B000TEUSKY,"This was compelling to watch, but there were a couple of extremely annoying aspects to it. The constant overdubbed chatter of the narrator. He never paused. When I'm watching a film about Everest, I want a few moments of silence with maybe just the sound of the wind - to get a FEEL for the mountain. Any beautiful shots were over before you had a chance to absorb them, as if the mountain itself were only a backdrop to these people and their little dramas. The reason I watch any film about mountaineering is to try to get a feel for the mountain itself. This was completely devoid of any sensibility for that aesthetic and I became so frustrated that I finally turned the sound off. The other thing that made the sound track unbearable was the constant repetition of clips, shown not just 2 or 3 times, but 5, 6, 7 times! I don't care about your need to catch up viewers new to the show. That can be done at the beginning of each episode, perhaps, but to put the exact same clip up over and over and over and over again tries the patience of the most dedicated watcher. It assumes a level of abject stupidity on the part of the watcher, and I don't think today's audiences are as stupid as all that. It drove me crazy and by the 3rd episode I had to take time off from even watching it. That's sad... I realize that as humans, we're all interested in human behavior, but the constant chatter drowned out the sounds and sights of the mountain itself - the sounds of prayer flags flapping, the wind, the crunch of snow under the crampons - NONE of that was in this series. The views lasted 2 seconds at most then back to close up shots of people's faces as they yammered on and on. If you're going to bother to film one of the greatest mountains on earth, give us a bit of a sense of the mountain, for God's sake! Finally, Betsy drove me NUTS! While she continuously claims that she can visualize herself on the summit, she hasn't even bothered to spend a couple of days before coming on a simple guided effort on a lesser mountain. She is the only person that any of the others has ever seen put on crampons both upside down and backwards. She has no idea how to use ropes, or even to straighten her legs on an abseil. To me, this is the height of arrogance. She seems to think that just visualizing something makes it real. That may be true in the magic of her Los Angeles world, but completely ignoring any effort at preparation is the most arrogant thing I've seen in a long, long time. There are plenty of opportunities right in her own backyard to take a weekend or a few days to climb Mt. Ranier, for example, with guides, and learn how to use her equipment. She exemplifies the very worst of American culture and paid Everest experiences, by thinking that just by being able to pay for the experience, she didn't have to do one tiny bit of preparation. Who thinks that way? I grew up in L.A. and people know they have to prepare. All her thinking is completely magical and right brain with not a hint of any deeper thought or analysis or awareness of any need to prepare. At ALL. For EVEREST! It's crazy. It might be a mental problem. I don't know. I was so happy when Russel forbid her to try for the summit. In that sense, Russell is a good example of a good guide - one who tries not to let people endanger themselves and the others too much. Another extreme example of hubris is the Kazahkstani climbers who radio'd for help, then once the sherpa team who risked their lives to get to them arrived, REFUSED THE HELP! Why didn't they call off the rescue if they were going to risk other people's lives because they got scared? Insane lack of respect. You have to wonder about people who cry wolf like that. They make it harder to send rescue teams in the future. How are the sherpa supposed to know who really wants help and who doesn't? Finally, Mogen is in complete denial about his ability. All the evidence shows he cannot do it without oxygen but year after year, he continues to try each year measurably weaker. Yet he thinks that by saying he's stronger, it will be so I'm appalled at how our culture has become so reliant on magical thinking, as if saying something is true makes it so. That's not how real life works. At least not when you're climbing mountains! The constant repetition, the arrogance, the endless chatter and the lack of any feeling for what it's like on the mountain when no one is yammering on about something takes a lot away from what could have been an excellent portrayal of what it's like on Everest. Unfortunately, we won't find out from this show because we are never given a few minutes to sense it.",1524441600,,4648,4.3436781609195405
