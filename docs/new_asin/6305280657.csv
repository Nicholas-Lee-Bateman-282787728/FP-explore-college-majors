7886820,1,6305280657,This is the worse rat movie I ever seen. It was more dialogue than seeing bunch of rats. Boring.,1523491200,,96,4.105263157894737
7886821,1,6305280657,Horrible! Like everyone else said: What Rats? There was none. I shut it off.,1519603200,,76,4.5
7886822,1,6305280657,"Acting, scenery etc. was acceptable, but I thought I was going to watch a creature feature.  No creature and no feature.  They investigate reports of giant rats in the sewer.  There aren't any.  Found it dull and boring.  Couldn't finish it.",1512950400,,241,4.780487804878049

7886824,1,6305280657,"Wow, where to begin. First off it's a combination of boring and plain cheesy. Spoiler alert, there is no monster, or anything else to make this movie interesting. Stupid dialogue and period typical stereotyped characters. Then the R rating, on something that is PG at worse for language it must have been put there to try and sell this sleeper.",1504137600,,344,4.75
7886825,4,6305280657,"It' has drama, adventure and mystery.  As the plot unfolds there several unexpected twists and turns.  Sure, the only rat is in the opening ten minutes because it is not the true story line, rather that is the way the real plot is revealed,  I had no problem watching start to finish/",1503878400,,284,4.423076923076923
7886826,1,6305280657,"The very deceptive cover of this film hides an extremely tame and boring film; I bought it because I was curious. There're no monsters or anything like that in the movie. There're these reporters and a rat is found in the toilet. Then a reporter gets some pictures developed and shows it to a guy; he refers to the person in the photograph as ""rat people."" They go down in the sewers and a bum with long hair makes a face and scares them; this is that creature that you see on the cover and what's described on the back of the case! It has minimal violence, no gore or nudity, no effective atmosphere or any interesting scenery, and I didn't even notice any profanity; if there's any swearing, then I missed it because I was bored. You've got these people in the sewers, some cops, some reporters, and some bad guys. There's minimal action and a considerable amount of boring talk in this movie that's also called CRIMINAL ACT. However, I thought the directing was decent, and I didn't have an issue with the acting. If you don't mind how tame the film is and that it lacks intensity, a small number of people may have a possible interest in the movie if they're looking for a mostly calm TV type film that doesn't have much happening in it. It has an R on the back of the case, but it can't be R-rated. That was obviously just put there so it'll sell. It looks like it was made for TV, and it's at a PG level.

The DVD has no menu screen or extras; you just get the film. The quality is pretty good and appears to be mastered from a VHS source.",1418947200,4,1545,4.237288135593221
7886827,3,6305280657,"Tunnels was also released on video as Criminal Act. The picture is crisp, but the audio is fair with most of the dialog coming from one channel and music from the other. The plot is basically the story of two female reporters trying to blow the lid off of an underground slave labor trade. There is very little action in this movie, but does occasionally inject some humor. This was apparently made for TV. The highlight for me was getting to see some of my favorite veteran TV actors from the 70's and 80's. The movie has a decent plot, which moves kind of slow, but should not be classified under the horror genre. Only see this if you are feeling nostalgic and can't handle too much excitement. It's a decent way to waste some time on a Saturday afternoon.",992563200,5,759,4.428571428571429
