4552367,5,B0053TWW4K,Absolutely love it!!! Great cast and comedy! Thoroughly enjoyed the writing as well. Look forward to seeing more from Mr. Donald Welch.,1318032000,,135,5.181818181818182
4552368,4,B0053TWW4K,There are some fine men in this movie. I give 5 stars for the eye candy alone. This story had alot of cussing and if a woman being called the B word or a woman calling the man the B word is offensive then definitely don't watch this. This story is one that actually captured relationship issues from a male perspective. Bravo to the writers for making the ending a shock. Even though this movie just ended abruptly there was not that wonderful happy ending that normally happens in movies it was indicative of what really should have happened.,1317859200,,543,4.494949494949495
4552369,5,B0053TWW4K,"I've seen films similar to this on BET and most of the time they are kind of boring or corny basically but this was really a good film. It's funny, realistic and good acting. A great cast and a very well written film. I would definitely say ""ORDER"" or go out and grab a copy. You will not be disappointed. It's great to know that people still like to put out good quality films from the actors to the directors. GO GET IT!",1317600000,5,422,4.096385542168675
4552370,4,B0053TWW4K,"i thought this play worked,actors were great in their roles it ended on a cliffhanger which i liked. what i didn't like was the audio laugh ins, i felt they were missing the punchline meaning it was all over the place. it wouldve been nice to hear ginewine sing or that mentioned cd played out in the closing credits.",1317427200,,317,4.389830508474576
4552371,5,B0053TWW4K,"""i got this DVD not really knowing what to expect. I am an Essence Atkins fan, so i get everything she is in. I throughly enjoyed this DVD for several reasons. One it was not the same run of the mill DVD films geared toward the african american audience. 2. The characters, although hilarious at times, are very intelligent and you come away feeling that you know one of these dudes..They seem to touch on some deep subjects, but only lightly..mostly its all about some guys having fun during a Bachelor party... So don't expect anything other than that.. its a bachelor party so you can imagine what goes on. Im not familiar with all the actors but they all do a great job. I recommend having a fun night and checking it out..""",1317427200,,728,4.440298507462686
4552372,1,B0053TWW4K,"The story line is everywhere and they don't really give an ending to the majority of it.  I'm not sure what audience it was for but it doesn't seem like it really reaches any particular one.  And even though there were a lot of talented actors it still managed to be a MESS.  I wouldn't suggest anyone watch this unless they just feel like watching a stripper dance, wondering whether one of the ""brothers"" is a homosexual and/or a pedophile, and watching guys get drunk and discuss how their different views on women.  Yeah so....that basically sums up the whole movie.",1317340800,12,570,4.6138613861386135
4552373,3,B0053TWW4K,"Let's get the basics out of the way:
The video is good, the audio was good. 90 minutes, recorded in hi-def. Recorded at the wonderful Nate Holden Performing Arts Center of the Ebony Repertory Theatre, or ERT, in Los Angeles, California, a great venue. Written, produced and directed by Don B. Welch (or Donald Welch, according to the IMDB website).

The DVD is barebones, only the chapters selection and a few gallery pictures are available.

Now for the meat of the review:
Everyone has jumped on the Deep South chitlin' type productions, performed in front of a live audience, and with a typical morality message intertwined throughout, complete with Black stereotypes (Big Mama, the down lo brotha, the skank sister/cousin/relative, a lot of baffoonery, etc.) and a redemption at the end for someone and of course, lots of gospel-type singing. I think that the main goal here was not only tell a similar story, but also to cash in on a trend that I think has pretty much burned out for a lot of Black folk.

This is a new one on me, though. This is NOT your typical 'Tyler Perry-style' production.

This is a straight-forward story about the before-and-after of a Black man's bachelor party, and all the male drama (and a little female drama) they can squeeze in here. There's drinking, cussing, sexual situations, a stripper who entices the groom to try and sleep with him in the other room, accusations, and a whole lot of other things happen that propel the story to it's very odd conclusion.

Now for the positives and negatives...

THE POSITIVES:
This 'play' reads like a typical soap opera, filled with stuff straight out of so many different other movies, plays and TV shows, all you needed to do here was take a scene from each one, write them on the back of a playing card, shuffle them up and then string them up together and you'd have this. But I still watched it and enjoyed the show regardless. The twist ending is not what I expected it to be, and it left me hanging. Will there be a sequel to this?, I asked myself.

The list of actors and actresses is impressive, from the ever-beautiful Essence Atkins, hunk Christian Keyes, the sassy Caryn Ward, strong performer Lamman Rucker, and singer/rapper/actor Ginuwine (among the others) playing their parts very well - these people are professionals, and I felt they were comfortable and believable in their roles.

THE NEGATIVES:
THIS WAS NOT PERFORMED IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE, and the canned laughter and applause does NOT help the situation. It may be a three-act play, but the ENTIRE play is performed on one set with no feeling that there was anyone (other than the stagehands and lighting crew) watching the performance. It felt cold, and I didn't really feel it the way I should have.

This was obviously done no-budget, and if the actors got paid 'scale' financially I'd be surprised...

In summation, I'm giving the performances by everyone 5 good stars - I liked them, and their choice of lines was a bit cheesy, but I kind of enjoyed it start to finish. Because of the lame production, the lack of live audience, and the really blah-blah typical plot, I've got to drag it down a few stars to only three, and I'm being REALLY REALLY generous in keeping the third star.

If you've never seen a Mr. Perry production, and you've got 90 minutes to spare, it's okay. But please, don't look into this for anything socially redeeming. Don B. Welch's attempt here worked for me, but only a little.

It's a bit of brain candy to get you through a lazy afternoon, or whatever, but that's about it.",1317081600,16,3566,4.660828025477707
4552374,1,B0053TWW4K,This play had great actors but the play itself was garbage. It had no ending at all...slow at the beginning. Nothing about this play is exciting or even worth rating. I recommend no one to purchase this dvd.,1316908800,4,207,4.473684210526316
4552375,3,B0053TWW4K,I thought this play would be awesome because of the actors and actresses. The play was pretty good but the ending was horrible. It could of lasted longer but who knows. Besides the ending it was a good play.,1316822400,3,207,4.333333333333333
4552406,5,B0053TWW4K,Loved it!!!! Great play. Loved the cast. Loved the storyline. Why do i have a word limit on this review,1401580800,,103,4.2
4552407,1,B0053TWW4K,Wasted my time and money. I like Lamman Rucker and Christian Keyes but this was a mess of a film. I had to fast forward through section of it to bypass the trash...everybody don't want to see all that. This could have been better and had potential but failed in that aspect.,1400371200,,274,4.288461538461538
4552408,4,B0053TWW4K,"Recently relaxing at home, and I decided to go on Netflix and make it a movie Sunday. Furthermore I came across a play ""The Bachelor Party"" thought to myself, ehhh js might be another one of those ""plays"" but to my surprise I actually got something out of this play.. You're whole relationship status can change just as easy as a woman's mind.. My friends, this play teaches you to always be completely honest with ""your soulmate/soon to be partner in life"" one lie or secret can definitely effect your ""future"" with the person you wish to spend the rest of your life with. I know this from experience. Keep it real all the way through! You live better that way! Great play Mr. Donald Welch!!",1389484800,,692,4.5
4552409,5,B0053TWW4K,It's sounds like a great movie I know it has some great actors playing in it can't wait to see it.,1384992000,,98,3.7142857142857144
4552410,2,B0053TWW4K,"So I chose a TWO star rating because I didn't like this movie so much that I could even finish watching it! That's also why my review ins't fair, because I didn't finish watching it. I though that because the PLAY had people I'd normally love to watch that it would eventually take a turn for the better but it never happened. The beginning was bland but I kept watching, when all the friend started coming it was boring but I kept watching. eventually when nothing but I boring conversation kept continuing I had to stop it. Maybe I'll give it a try again...",1381104000,,559,4.384615384615385
4552411,1,B0053TWW4K,I wasted my time looking at this movie.  I should have stopped the first fifteen minutes because it kept going on and on and on and slow and uninteresting.  Boring!,1380153600,,164,4.433333333333334
4552412,5,B0053TWW4K,"It was a good movie it had good actors and actress,  it was very entaining.  and had a good rating",1379808000,,98,3.85
4552413,3,B0053TWW4K,I am a fan of Lamman Rucker.  He and his co-star have acted before so there is a chemistry- it just didn't come through here.,1377388800,,125,4.0
4552414,3,B0053TWW4K,ok but lacked serious substance. There were some ideas that were not developed sufficiently enough  for the story to end with the cancelation of a wedding. Only the hint of a past career in dancing could cause a huge break up like that? it needed more substance.,1375401600,,262,4.574468085106383
4552415,2,B0053TWW4K,It was ghetto and typical. It had NO substance and way too much profanity. I'm surprised my favorite actors would stoop so low.,1370995200,,127,4.565217391304348
4552416,4,B0053TWW4K,Known actors who perform as expected. A really nice plot twist. Film has a play like setup. All the action takes place on one set. Ginuwine does NOT sing.,1370390400,,154,4.344827586206897
4552417,2,B0053TWW4K,It wasn't  that good. I liked most of the actress & actors but I think  this was Rucker's first play writing run. Hopefully the next one will be a home run because i will continue to support,1368835200,,190,4.108108108108108
4552418,2,B0053TWW4K,this movie was not good . the whole plot of the movie was not good and the ending was not good either . just would not recommened this to anyone else,1368057600,,149,3.838709677419355
4552419,5,B0053TWW4K,"this is a lesson on ""the chickens coming home to roost"" some one has a secret and it comes out in the most unexpected places and persons, Can we handle it or walk away from the best thing that comes into out lives.....You be the judge.

Essence is brilliant as usual. And Lamar Rucker shows us why he is the next generation Denzel and Sidney....Christian Keyes surprises us also. Enjoy good purchase.",1367712000,,400,4.555555555555555
4552420,5,B0053TWW4K,The movie was the best I ever saw funny cute and sexy good jokes excellent lines to learn from so go buy it watch it with a friends bring all and enjoy Ty,1367712000,,154,3.696969696969697

4552422,3,B0053TWW4K,"I gave it 3 stars, because it has it's moments, but some of the acting is horrible, I was not a big fan of 1 of the actors at all.",1364515200,,130,3.3666666666666667
4552423,2,B0053TWW4K,"I choose this rating due to the fact it had to much cursing in it.  Almost every other work was cursing.

It didn't hold my attention to long because of the language that was used.  I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1363564800,,227,4.357142857142857
4552424,3,B0053TWW4K,Too much of the same story line as every other move.  Need to let your story line be a little more ceative.,1362787200,,107,3.8636363636363638

4552430,2,B0053TWW4K,"I thought with the cast, this would've been a good play, but I was wrong.  I love all the characters, but not in this, it was bad all around.  It started out okay, but it didn't keep my interest.  Since I paid my money for it, I watched the whole thing, but it was really a waste of time and money.",1353369600,,298,3.8524590163934427
4552431,5,B0053TWW4K,I Love it what a great play the stars was great to. At the end of the play was u need to tell the truth,1350864000,,103,3.16
4552432,5,B0053TWW4K,"I am particular impressed that even with this movie having great actors, great points were made. No I don't care its' low budget, the picture was excellent.  These days we need to love each other or give each other props when trying to do something.  Big props to the director, writer, producers and cast, etc.  Y'all did great. I am very impressed. I had a bunch of us me and my females friends watch this, we had a blast. It's not a bad movie at all.
Disclaimer>Spoiler below.
However, Lamman Rucker's character didn't have to be so one sided but then again I guess some men are like that and that's part of what the movie tells all.",1343779200,,635,4.364406779661017

4552440,5,B0053TWW4K,"This was a fine outing for the director's first attempt at making a movie.  It is not a black male bashing movie which I am very proud of.  The women did not seem like they needed a man to save them or to save a man. Also, no heavy overtones of calling to Jesus. We know he is on the mainline, but you have the ability to handle some of your own problems. Well done, I expect the same quality of and a progression in the director's directing ability.",1322006400,4,450,4.044943820224719

4552442,5,B0053TWW4K,There were some seriously funny moments in here. Like watching a major network sitcom. Someone did some great casting too cause each actor was excellent for their role. And even there was some slap stick humor there were also serious issues and tender moments where the actors really got a chance to shine. Definitely worth buying.,1319068800,,331,4.928571428571429
