8642299,5,B00IICF6ME,"Here is one of the most vile, disgusting, disturbing and rare horror films ever made. This hard to find gorefest was limited to 1000 copies back in 2008ish and has been out of print ever since. It feels almost like a Fred Vogal Toetag film and it has some of the most inventive deaths ever put on film with the gore effects being top notch. It is a must see for underground horror fans.",1428278400,,386,4.22972972972973
8642300,4,B00IICF6ME,"Hammer smashing, Razor blade eating, mixing meth with broken glass, and corpse sculpting for kicks are only a few of the creative atrocities these collaborators cooked up for The Gateway Meat.  The acting is poor but the gore scores a perfectly vile ""10"".  If You are seeking this out it will appeal to you. Otherwise steer clear of this evil little film.",1396224000,,355,4.709677419354839
