Even my lowest performing kids watch this VHS tape in rapt attention, and want to know if further research has been done on ""Ally"" and ""Cleo"".  (Most are very disappointed to learn that the story was likely pieced together from many different alligators and crocodiles.  They start to groan when I pull out the VCR, but they love the story.",1400025600,,444,4.740259740259741
7792019,4,0792252365,I thought this program was great.  It was the story of a baby alligator and a baby crocodile.  Both live in the same are of the Everglades.  It is about their strugle to survive a hostile environment.  They are forced to be on the move to new areas all their lives to find food and avoid being eaten.  Only the lucky survive to adulthood.  The photography was wonderful and the naration was quite good.  I was quite surprised with how good this one was.  I enjoyed it a lot.,989366400,2,474,4.247191011235955
