7038754,5,B00UGPVOIG,"I love that it has a bunch of different moves, and that compared to some other of his videos, there isn't as much jumping around. I want another like it! I was looking at piyo but the reviews say it sucks... any ideas?",1437091200,,218,4.093023255813954

7038761,5,B00UGPVOIG,"This dvd is so challenging, yet FUN! Tony always tells you to go at your own pace, utilizes a ""modifier"", take a break,
etc. But don't get me wrong, you WILL workout! But it's so fun, the time will go fast!",1396310400,,206,4.048780487804878
7038762,5,B00UGPVOIG,"Yes I said fun! Tony is a little silly and very supportive. He gives great descriptions of each exercise and you get testimonials from people working out with him. I enjoy doing this workout, and am feeling results after a month of doing it every other day-ish.",1393545600,,261,4.574468085106383
7038763,5,B00UGPVOIG,"I'm not a huge fan of Tony Horton's silly personality but I do enjoy his exercises.  This came w/ the P-90 system which I liked okay (became monotonous quickly and therefore boring). I did not even try this until AFTER I discovered that P-90 circuits 3-4 are exactly the same as 1-2 only longer :(  When I first got the system, although this was recommended to 'jump-start' the program, I put it aside b/c I thought it might be too high impact for me as I was just returning to workouts after a period of convalescence. Frankly, I think the name scared me because I am not a huge fan of cardio but I recognize its importance & I'm trying to raise my game so I tried it.  I ended up LOVING THIS!!! It might have been easier b/c I HAD done circuit 1-2 for several weeks prior.

This is set on what looks like a golf course in Hawaii w/ 'real people' exercising along w/ Tony in the lead.  The moves are fun, not too jarring or high-impact and you WILL get a nice little workout. I consider myself low to middle intermediate level exerciser and I thoroughly enjoy this routine. The moves are not so repetitive that it becomes boring. In fact, I wish a few of the moves were done for longer/more reps. I DO use a weight or medicine ball when recommended for extra impact and feel that my thighs get worked harder for doing so but a weight is not required neither is a mat. All exercises are low impact 'standing' moves.

This is a great workout when pressed for time and not to difficult on 'lighter days' if you don't use weights.  I was very pleasantly surprised w/ this.  I like it very much and wholeheartedly recommend it to challenge beginners and as a fun day for those who are slightly more advanced bordering on intermediate. I DO NOT think an advanced exerciser would find this challenging at all.

While I feel that for me & my current needs this dvd rates a 3-4, I am giving it 5 stars b/c I do think its a great, fun workout for someone in the mid-beginner range.",1367280000,12,1972,4.293800539083558
7038804,5,B00UGPVOIG,"This video is excellent for fat burning, and Tony Horton makes it fun !  He's got real people there doing the exercises, and they show how to modify each exercise for whatever ability you might be at.  This DVD is one of my favorites !!",1365897600,,236,4.222222222222222
7038805,5,B00UGPVOIG,"this dvd is a step up from power 90 sweat 3-4  - well it feels like it to me. its about 28 min of workout- after the yoga. it keeps you moving with alot less time in between segments, and there are less options for you to wimp out. nothing in here is too terrible on you but the pace makes you feel it. it was upbeat and kept you going ,although Tony gets a little silly at some points, hes a nice guy and a good instructor. it was nice to have a bunch of people and for it to be outside - thouhg you only get a couple shots of the ocean.",1365206400,4,538,3.719298245614035
7038806,5,B00UGPVOIG,i love all the stretching exercise  i have learned from Tony Horton his video has helped me stretch correctly in order to avoid injuries.,1358726400,,137,4.708333333333333
7038807,5,B00UGPVOIG,Wife and I have loved this video for regular workouts.  Its easy and is only 35 minutes in length.  You don't need alot of floor space for this one or any weights or bands.  Its you and the video.  I recommend this workout video.,1357430400,10,229,4.136363636363637
7038808,5,B00UGPVOIG,I've done this work out atleast a hundred times. I can recite most of the dialogue start to finish. It is a great work out. You can do it lightly and get a good work out or you can do it hard and go a little more extreme. It is solid and fast and will get you stronger. It is a good all around full body work out that is fast to do. Plus it has a warm up built in. It's my goto when I'm feeling weak and want to work out. Much easier than the p90x or the p90 master series. Still a solid work out though. Easy enough older peeps can do it but easily made harder by adding jumping to many moves. Love tony and the p90 beach body series.,1348876800,4,635,3.746268656716418
7038809,5,B00UGPVOIG,"I love tony hortons workouts!! This disk is very good for beginners (might feel a little sore after fist exercise). I usually can't stick to any exercise because they seem/are complicating to do, are boring, don't seem to work, or seem to take an eternity.
 In this DVD, Tony Horton shows some simple moves - with exellent instructions - all in about 35-40 minutes. I have alot of energy after I do these exercise (and sweat when I do them), so I like to do them in the morning to keep me moving all day.  I let my sister borrow my dvd, and she liked it so much, she bought one of her own!
 You will lose weight if you do these exercises, only key is - you have to be consistent, and never skip (only in the beginning I skipped 2 days because I was feeling a little sore).
  These workouts are very easy, and I would suggest you try something more challenging if you are advanced in exercising (unless you want to double these workouts).",1334275200,17,937,4.271186440677966
7038810,5,B00UGPVOIG,I have Rheumatoid arthritis and have had problems trying to find a low impact workout that still gave me the challenge that running did. I gained 94 lbs during a complicated pregnancy as well and I can tell you I love this workout. I do this along with the ab ripper and the power 90 boot camp and I feel great. Definitely worth the money!,1329264000,11,339,4.230769230769231
7038811,5,B00UGPVOIG,"I just got this dvd, used it once and I love it. You get a really good workout that is fun and will get you sweating. I like how the people in the background are actual users of the Power 90 system and some before/after pics are shown to motivate. You won't regret buying this dvd!",1296086400,12,281,4.035714285714286
7038812,5,B00UGPVOIG,"Ive been using this workout for a week and im telling you i can see my abs already popping through. The routines are very entertaining and are very effective. I recommend not going thtough the motions and doing a few reps of each,instead just go for it big time aim for 25 pushups for example instead of 8-15.

ALL IN ALL IT WORKS!!

8706082,4,B00UGPVOIG,"I just found this DVD at a used book sale.  I actually read some reviews while I was at the sale that described it as fun light cardio, which sounded up my alley--I'm an experienced exerciser (I work out daily), but cardio is my least-favorite activity, so I tend to go easy in that area.  I was already familiar with the instructor, Tony Horton, and I knew that I didn't mind his somewhat goofy personality, so I decided to take a chance and purchase this DVD.

This workout was filmed live in Hawaii in 2005, and the entire group of background exercisers are ""success stories"" in the Power 90 program.  Five of these participants have brief vignettes featured on the Main Menu.  Like most BeachBody workouts, Fat Burning Express features a countdown clock on the lower right-hand corner.  Additionally, there is a right-side frame that shows what round you are on/what is upcoming, and the frame across the bottom of the screen provides information on the names of each move as well as ongoing tips from Tony throughout the workout.  These features are nice, but they do take up a lot of room on-screen!  Viewing this workout on a small device would likely be rather difficult.

The workout itself is 36 minutes long.  It consists of a warm-up, a ""power yoga"" segment, five rounds, and a cool-down/stretch.  The warm-up is mostly stretching, which I question; the current wisdom is that cardio workouts require an aerobic warm-up.  I was questioning the wisdom of purchasing this DVD further with the ""power yoga"" segment that followed.  First, there was nothing ""power"" about this (as an aside, I should mention that I am a certified yoga instructor), and second, it simply seemed out of place at this point in the workout.  The moves were okay--right angle, twisting right angle, and what Tony called a prayer-squat salutation--but they would have worked much better as a stretch at the end of the workout.

So at about 7 minutes in, the actual cardio segments begin, and finally, I started enjoying the workout!  The moves were fun and easy to modify up or down in intensity; several of the background exercisers display lower or higher impact, and Tony himself shows modifications as well.  An optional medicine ball is used for some of the moves as noted below.  Each of the five rounds is repeated once, and each round lasts just over two minutes total.

ROUND ONE
*Jab-Cross
*Locomotion
*Tires on Fire
*Crescent Switch  >optional medicine ball

ROUND TWO
*Front Kick
*Twister  >optional medicine ball
*Four Corners
*One-Legged Speed Squat

ROUND THREE
*Hook-Uppercut
*Side Hop
*Lateral Touch
*Calf Raise Prayer Squat  >optional medicine ball

ROUND FOUR
*Side Kicks
*Crazy Horse
*Run Stance Squat Switch
*Frog Hops  >optional medicine ball

ROUND FIVE
*High Knee Kicks
*Groucho Pivet  >optional medicine ball
*Wide-Lunge Press  >optional medicine ball
*Chair to Prayer  >optional medicine ball

At the end of the rounds, there is a 30-second ""bonus"" of body blocks.  This is followed by a 1-minute cool-down to allow the heart rate to slow and then 2 minutes of stretches focused mainly on the lower body.

In the end, I enjoyed this workout quite a bit!  I especially liked the addition of a medicine ball for greater intensity--mine is 4 pounds, and it definitely made a difference.  In the future I plan to simply skip the warm-up/yoga segments and jump straight into the cardio routine for a nice 29-minute workout.",1508630400,2,3428,4.902608695652174

8706084,5,B00UGPVOIG,"Great, fun cardio workout. Not too difficult, but you can still get a good sweat up by ramping up your intensity.
