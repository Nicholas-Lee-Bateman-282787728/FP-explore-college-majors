8749379,5,B0195N5214,"I have been looking for the edited version of this masterpiece for a long time. Other extended and so called restored versions were only available up until now. The restored version with its found footage may be of interest to film historians but I think interfere with this films simple moral tale. All the extra scenes in restored versions do, is add padding that dull the clean point to this smart, entertaining and atmospheric morality play.  Yes, someday I hope they restore the edited version of Welle's Magnificent Ambersons, but in the case of  All That Money Can Buy, some footage should just stay on the cutting room floor. Film editors exist for a reason.",1494028800,3,666,4.782608695652174
