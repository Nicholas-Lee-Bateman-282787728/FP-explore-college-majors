8260133,3,B0015VTDMO,"Typical early-to-mid 60's Italian-made, English-dubbed sword-and-sandal mini-epic.  This time Hercules has his hands full rescuing and protecting a Polish princess from invading Mongol hordes.  I ordered a Movies Unlimited DVD-R (pictured below) and the quality is only fair.  It seriously needs re-mastering.  Hopefully it will be someday.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1440288000,2,376,6.018867924528302
