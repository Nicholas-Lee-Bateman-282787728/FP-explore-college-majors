7019604,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Thirty minutes of gorgeous working out.  As a P90X graduate, multiple times, I like the intensity here but the shorter workouts give me more time in the morning and more energy.  Frankly, P90X was just a bit too much for me with my full time job, and being 49 years old, maybe that's not helping.  Although, I don't believe in aging -- I got your aging right here.  So far this is working great for me and my fears that it would not contain upper body strengthening were misplaced.",1427414400,53,481,4.370786516853933
7019605,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"Updated 11/16/14: Original review first with final impressions at the end

If you check my other reviews you'll see that I have top reviews for P90X and P90X2. I'm not a Beachbody coach. I've never purchased supplements or shakes or anything other than the original push-up stands from them. I'm just a guy who enjoys Tony's workouts and have gotten great results with them.

That being said, I wanted to give you guys a breakdown of this system as I'm sure there are a lot of questions out there. Is it like the first or second series? How much additional gear will you need? Do you need to do the first two series to do this one? Is it really 30 minutes? And on and on. . . This review is designed to answer those questions for people wondering about the series that don't want to wait 90 days to find out what's in it. Here we go. . .

First, calling it 30 minutes is a little bit disingenuous. Each DVD has the option of beginning with a ""Cold Start"" that is a 12 minute, extensive warm-up. You can choose to skip that and jump right into the workouts if you like, most of which have a short 2-3 minute warm-up that is of a higher intensity. The cool down doesn't begin until AFTER the 30 minutes has elapsed and can be anywhere from 3-6 minutes depending on the workout you've done. There's also no dedicated ab routine like in the previous 2 series. So if you want to put an ab routine in after your resistance days that's up to you. If you were to do the warm-up, the routine, the cool down, and the abs, you're now back up to about an hour. Now, this doesn't bother me as trying to cram all of that into 30 minutes would guarantee your workout wasn't very good. I was skeptical that they would try to do this and I'm glad they didn't. I rather it be a bit longer than shorter.

But what about the gear? You need very little. This is one place they've embraced their roots. Gone are the army of medicine balls and plyo platforms. This is original P90X style: Dumbbells, pull-up bar, yoga mat. There are some other things you can grab, but none that are necessary. For those who didn't like P90X2 because of how much gear there was, this new set will appeal to you in its spartan attitude towards equipment.

You absolutely don't have had to do any previous P90X series in order to use this. Unlike P90X2, which had a high learning curve that turned a lot of people off, this one is much simpler and straightforward. The moves are nowhere near as complex and come with plenty of modifications for people of all fitness levels. And, of course, the shorter time limit makes it more attractive to people who thought an hour and change was just too much. Even the guide book encourages people to try this first and then graduate into the other two series. I would wager to say that this is actually a better starting point than the original series for people new to this type of rigorous workouts.

So what are the workouts like? Glad you asked. Unlike the first two series, Tony pushes the pace on these videos to make it all work in the time limit. While he still has plenty of banter (which I personally enjoy), it's now mixed in while people are working out. This isn't Insanity where it's literally non-stop, but it isn't meant to be. You're definitely getting your 30 minutes worth of working. Now for those of you that loved the targeted approach of P90X (chest and back one one day, arms on another) as opposed to P90X2's more compound movements, I'm sorry to say that this system is more like 2 than 1. There are no dedicated arm workouts. There is a push/pull video called ""The Challenge"" that is a lot of fun, but other than that you're going to find videos dedicated to Upper Body and ones dedicated to Lower Body. Others are full body and use compound movements and isolation positions to work a lot of muscles at the same time. Again, Tony is focusing on a functional body that works together and less on isolating muscle groups. But because this isn't P90X2 where it felt like every resistance exercise was done in a balance pose, you'll be able to keep your heavier weights right off the bat. It'll be interesting to see at the end of 90 days how my strength is compared to where it is now.

Some of the cardio workouts definitely get you breathing. While I loathed Kenpo X in the first series because it felt like a throwaway and had too many static moments that allowed you to catch your breath prematurely, MMX (an MMA inspired cardio workout) is a lot of fun. By adding an army of Superman Punches and Sprawls (called Burpees in the non-combat world) the workout is a beast. I have to say that I was certainly challenged by MMX and CVX.

Maybe the greatest thing about this series: yoga is just 30 minutes. Yes, you read that right. The most loathed of all the workouts is just 30 minutes. It's paced well and plays like a highlight reel of it's 90-minute big brother. Unfortunately, it moves quickly for a yoga workout and will not give you the results of the X2 or X1 yoga vids that were longer. But what really threw me was that Tony now has a Pilates video. Never before has a workout series had something I've never tried before. This was a first for me. Never in my life have I attended or attempted Pilates. This was probably the most challenging thus far because I've no familiarity with any of the movements. Even Tony isn't great at it, so it's even more inspiring that he's pushing himself through these workouts, still attempting mastery right along with me. It was heartening to seem him struggling. This one left me sore in a some new places.

Like the previous versions, this comes with a nutrition guide that has what appear to be some solid recipes and eating plans that take into account vegan, vegetarian, and the gluten free lifestyles. The guide book has a breakdown of the four different versions of these workouts you can do: Classic (standard routine rotation), Lean (combination of workouts focusing less on muscle mass and more on weight loss), Mass (for bulking up), and Doubles (for crazy people that want to work out twice per day). The timeline is much more similar to the original series as you'll spend 3 weeks in one phase, one week in a transition/recover phase, and then repeat. There is also an Elite Phase after the 90 days ends that will use the three bonus workouts if you purchased that package.

The bonus workouts are an upper body, a lower body, and Ab Ripper X3. Honestly, I like the resistance workouts a lot and am glad I got them. Although I have no need of the resistance bands or the Energy formula they provided. So those will gather dust. Ab Ripper 3 still can't live up to the brilliance of the original. It tries to be too complex with plank moves and isometric holds that don't do the job that the X1 routine does. Sometimes you just can't beat the original.

So here's what we know: The system is much simpler and requires minimal gear like P90X. It uses less targeted training and more complex moves to work muscles and cardio at the same time like P90X2. 30 minutes is a stretch and is closer to 40 minutes. There's no dedicated ab routine. This is fantastic starting place for beginners.

If you're out of shape or are in decent shape, this should be great. But, to be honest, I'm skeptical that this program will work for existing P90X superheroes. If you've been through the original or the sequel a few times, if you can get through Plyo X at full pace or are one of those crazies (I'm one) who mixes your P90X with your Insanity/Asylum, I'm not sold that this will challenge you. While there is solid science about the 30 minute routine, I just have a hard time believing this will push you to new heights if you can already keep pace with Shaun T in the longer Insanity vids. BUT, I do think that this is a great thing to have for those days where time is at a premium. Blend these in to the previous two series to create something monstrous and beautiful.

But only time will tell and I'll update as I progress. Please feel free to ask any questions as I'm happy to help people make informed decisions when it comes to their health choices. Happy X'ing!

And for the record, can we all agree that P90X3 has one of the worst, most innuendo-laced tag lines in recent memory? I just want to know how much someone got paid to create that gem.

FINAL UPDATE: Let's cut down to it. Do I love it? No. Will I do it again? No. X3 has some real strong points in it that are worth revisiting by themselves. But as whole, the 30 minute limit just isn't enough to do what I need it to as someone who can hang with Tony's longer workouts. X3's biggest drawback is that it suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. It wants to be everything, and it wants to do it in 30 minutes. 30 minutes can work if you stay focused, but when so many of the discs want to be resistance workouts and core workouts and balance workouts it just doesn't do it.

I did X3 earlier in the year after I had been on a bit of a layoff and it was great. But coming back to it after having been doing a combo of X, X2, Insanity, and a few other things I've put together, it just doesn't challenge me enough. Let's hit the high points first.

THE CHALLENGE is a great push/pull routine with some great variations on classics that will get the work done.

CVX is a true monster. It is the beast in this set. It's virtually identical to MEDICINE BALL CORE CARDIO from Tony's 1 on 1, but they've extended the time and changed the ball to a weight (I still use my 12lb medicine ball for the entire routine and it leaves me a disgusting mess, which is perfect). Either way, it hurts.

MMX is a great piece of cardio work as well. Punches and kicks are so-so, but the addition of elbows (that really turn the core) and sprawls (advanced burpees) will leave you sucking air.

PILATES is a shining spot. Having never done it before until X3 it was incredibly difficult. Because it's all dedicated to the core 30 minutes is more than enough to get a great core workout. A great example of how staying intensely focused on something for 30 minutes can prove effective.

ISOMETRIX is incredibly difficult. Grab a pose, hold it for 45 seconds. It never gets easy. You'll feel it. They should have had the same philosophy on the yoga vid.

The UPPERS and LOWERS are fine, but they still suffer from the problem of too few sets to really get the muscles growing. It addresses chest and back well enough, but neglects the arms.

ECCENTRIC UPPER & LOWER work because they focus on doing slow negative movements, which can really tax muscles over a shorter time period. Conventional wisdom says that big muscles (back, chest, quads) should get 8-12 sets to be effective. Smaller (bis, tris, calves) only need 6-8. But doing negatives will allow you to get away with less sets because of the intensity placed on the muscle.

COMPLEX UPPER & LOWER (bonus routines): Again, these routines don't have as many sets per muscle group as you'd like, but the manner in which the sets are done will definitely put work on the muscles.

The rest just won't get it done for people in P90X shape. As much as I love Tony and his work, and that he's given me the tools to become a superhero, this just isn't his best work as a ""next step"" in the X repertoire. AGILITY X and TRIOMETRICS both want to be variations of PLYO X, but neither get to that level of intensity. I even did a little experiment where I did 30 minutes of PLYO X to see how it compared to its X3 counterparts and PLYO X was way better. Even just a 30 minute portion of PLYO X had me huffing and puffing.

The others just have identity crisis issues. THE WARRIOR and TOTAL SYNERGISTICS and the others just try to be too many things. You'll start getting a good sweat going with the heart rate and then it comes to a screeching halt with a core move that kills the cardio, but doesn't do enough to totally work the core, either. Too many times in the middle of a workout I found myself saying, ""So what's the goal of this workout? I'm not sure what the emphasis is here.""

And that's the big issue with it. Often times when a workout is finished you're kind of sweaty and kind of out of breath and you've got a decent pump, but no one thing feels like it's been worked more than another. Nothing feels exhausted or really worked. Even the next day there's no real soreness to let you know you had a great workout. There are no dedicated arm workouts and the Ab Ripper only comes with the bonus package and isn't used until week 14 (and that's only if you have the extra workouts and do the bonus weeks). Plus YOGA X3 is too short to get the benefits of Yoga. Yes, I hate that the original is 90 minutes long, but it is absolutely one of the most effective of the P90X series. The X3 version just doesn't provide enough time to really sink into the poses and let the muscles do their work. The strength of X1 is that you can hold a position for a while, sink a little deeper, and feel the progress. In X3 it's a couple of breaths here, move on. A couple of breaths there. Move on. YOGA is less about the movement than it is the holding of the positions. X3 just moves too fast. I almost wish they had done less positions so there was more time to hold and breathe.

So where does that leave us? If you're new to the X world and are looking at getting into more intense workouts and have a low to medium fitness level this is a great place to start. It'll do plenty to get you into a good place. There are some gems here like CVX and ISOMETRIX and PILATES that I'll work in to future workouts. The problem is that they've taken all the full body, complex movements from X2 (where the workouts tended to be longer than the X1 workouts) and tried to cram them into 30 minutes. The lack of arm and ab workouts, the lack of focus in general, just didn't get me the results of the other systems. I didn't feel as challenged as I was in the other series. After PLYO X I'm a sweaty, out of breath mess. After SHOULDERS AND ARMS my arms feel like noodles when I'm done. X3 just doesn't get you into that elite place that X1 and X2 will. It unfortunately feels like less time, less focus, less results. My arms and abs are weaker than they were prior to X3, and my pull-ups have suffered.

But it is still a great system that will benefit a great many people. It's just not the next step in the X series that those of us who have been with Tony for a long time are looking for. It's great in a rush or on the road, and it certainly did have its points where it pushed me. For those looking to bulk up and throw weights around, X1 all day. For those looking for athletic performance with great science like the myofascial release and PAP, X2, without prejudice. X3 is good. Better than most of what's out there. It just can't hang with its older siblings. Also, if you're looking for a workout that you can do in 30 minutes while getting a crazy resistance and cardio workout, try Keith Weber's kettlebell video (vol. 1). Subbing that in one day per week will make amazing things happen. Here's to hoping X4 takes us back into that 5 star range and pushes us even further.",1426464000,507,15139,4.3376898622394915

I think this program would be ok for beginners, but not for people that have been actively working out for awhile. I never really felt challenged and the moves were not explained at all. 20-30% of my time was spent staring at the tv screen just trying to figure out what they were doing.

7019641,1,B00TQ8FSWC,"So the first DVD I tried was the yoga and Pilates. What a joke. Its pretty obvious its not where this guys expertise lies. He just runs through the poses, and doesnt verbally explain what you should be doing with your body. Its pretty hard to stare at a TV while doing yoga and keep up and attempt at being balanced. You have to rely on your instructor to instruct. He has three other people doing the routine. He rarely joins in. When I did have the chance to watch what they were doing, to try to follow along, the camera wasn't showing all three people at the same time. They would zoom in on their face, their upper body etc. In order to follow you need to see their entire body the entire length of the video. I have no clue what to do when Im staring at a blonde ladys face. The three people represented three levels of expertise. This is the first DVD from this collection that I tried. I thought it sucked and it was frustrating. I did yoga for four years. I haven't done it in seven and I wanted to get in shape and get back in to it. Im hoping the other DVDs are better. With all the good reviews, Im expecting it to be. I did not buy this on Amazon. I got it brand new and way cheaper on eBay. If anyone is like me and wants to do some yoga, Jillian Michaels has a good video. Its a nice workout with yoga combined. She knows what she is doing. For anyone that has never done yoga, please don't base your opinion on this dvd. Yoga is not an easy work out, but it should be enjoyable and rewarding.",1516060800,,1508,4.063758389261745

I wasn't even sore the next day or two afterward. That's not true with P90 and P90X - when you worked out, you know for certain you worked out.

7019695,1,B00TQ8FSWC,"When I found out there were over 300 different named exercises to memorize, I shelved the product without attempting the course. If I had wanted to attend exercise college, I would have enrolled in exercise college. All I wanted was a SIMPLE effective workout program, but P90x3 is more complicated than Advanced Calculus and Geometry. The written descriptions of the exercises are not easy to understand. One, for example, calls for you to ""switch your knee and elbow in the air"". Another commands that you ""bring your legs into plow"". Another orders, ""jump in between your hands and reverse the swan dive to standing"". Fully half the instructions are just as unclear as that. If I can't even understand the instructions, how can I do the exercises? I am also fairly certain that maintaining good form matters, but there are no explicit instructions about that. I was hoping for a rigorous video demo - ""follow my moves"" type course, more strengthening and toning than Richard Simmons', but I perceive P90X3 to be too user-unfriendly to be of value.

7019724,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"I'll start with the cons.
CONS:
1. I absolutely hate the advertising at the end of the DVDs. Imagine you just did yoga and you slip into your corpse position and within a few seconds, you hear ads for another program or shakeology or something. Guess what beachbody, I already bought your product, stop selling ads to me.
2. Not enough emphasis on cold start. I think for marketing reasons, beachbody wants to make it a 30 min thing, but I think the 12 min cold start is a must for most workouts.
3. In the how to videos, it would have been great to get tips on perfect form for pull ups, etc

Everything else is a PRO.
I am the CTO of a 150 person company in silicon valley. At 43, my goal is not to bulk up or to compete or anything. Working out is almost a business decision for me. It is irrefutable that you cannot be at your mental best if you don't focus on your physical prowess. I wanted an exercise routine that doesn't take too long, something I can do at home, something that has variety and focuses on all aspects of fitness-cardio, strength and flexibility.
P90X3 fits the bill perfectly.
I do it early in the morning, use the cold start dvd pretty much everyday and then do the 30 min workout of the day. One thing that I do differently from what Tony says in the DVDs is that I don't really ""kill"" myself in those 30 mins. My top most goal is injury avoidance. I do what I can at the pace that I can as I know that I am not going to stop after the 90 days. I take breaks as needed during the 30 min workout.
What has happened with this strategy is that slowly and gradually your strength builds up. I can now do about 15 unassisted pull ups with top notch form. The correct way of doing pulls is the following:
- starting position is arms totally extended (when you turn your head, your chin should hit the shoulder)
- now lock your shoulder blades (at this time your neck is stretched upwards and if you turn your head, your chin is clear of the shoulder
- go up
- come down
- unlock your shoulder blades.
This ensures that you have full range of motion, will protect your rotator cuffs but these are very hard for folks who haven't been doing pull ups without using the full range of motion.
I also use fat gripz which in effect makes the pull bar very thick. This also protects your arms and strengthens your fore arms, but makes the pull up way more difficult.
The important thing is to not worry about the numbers at all, do everything with perfect form and not get injured so that you can continue the next workout the next day.
The workouts are varied enough that they touch every part of your body, keep things interesting and keep you motivated.
Tony is very inspirational, leads the workouts very well and I love the respect he shows for every member of the crew. That's true leadership.
I highly recommend this program as a lifestyle workout. Don't think that you'll do this for 90 days and will be done. Think of this long term as an amazing way to stay in shape and get stronger for whatever life throws at you for the rest of the day.",1490400000,,3064,4.237606837606838

7019753,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"By far the best canned workout routine I've used.  No apologies for my gym habits over the last two decades-- I worked hard and fairly consistently.  But in my late 50s now, I realize a) I'm never going to get a truly muscular-looking body, the best I can aspire to is lean and strong; and b) coming home, getting changed, going to the gym, coming home and showering eats up way more time than I really want to put in on a daily basis.
P90X was something I used in place of the gym, and it's absolutely fine.  But I found myself fast-forwarding through the warmups, cool downs, and sometimes the rest breaks.  I never felt like I was really sweaty at the end, and the (theoretically) 60+ minutes was often more than I could confidently budget every day.
A half hour, though? No problem.  I can fit this in easily before dinner, even getting home late.  And it definitely makes me work.  Using it during the insane eating times that come with the holiday season, I actually lost a pound or two (first time that's happened).  Now that I'm back to a reasonable dietary regime, I'm really tightening up.  I think within a month I'll be as defined as I've been in years.  Things that were hard 2 months ago are now challenging.  I can see using this on a daily basis for a long time, and if I ever decide to hit the gym again, I can absolutely see using the sequencing as a model (e.g. substituting bench and pull-ups at the gym for the chest and back workout for variety) and filling in gaps using these routines.",1484697600,,1509,4.353571428571429

7019809,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"If you tried the original P90x but were overwhelmed at the amount of time you had to commit as well as the extent of each workout, give this one a try.  It sticks to the 30 minutes and results are there even though it requires much fewer reps than the original. It is really important in this one to stay focused on a tight core throughout the workouts as a good amount of the core work is imbedded in other moves.  If you love ab work you may find that you want to supplement with the original abripper 1-2 times a week.  The food guide has a simple system for converting servings of protein/carbs/fat into your daily caloric plan.  This also includes a caloric intake ""system"" to meet your goals that's based on your current weight, and what you want to achieve (mass, tone, lose weight, etc).  Also - it is much less cheesy (no ""pterodactyl backing out of trouble"" stuff) but at times he can still make you shake your head in mild disbelief.  If you can find one without the band at a cheaper price buy it - the band included with this set is garbage.  Just a few minor issues, overall a great workout & if you stick to it, you'll see awesome results.",1479081600,11,1154,4.290322580645161
7019810,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"First the good. I have done the original P90X, T25, and now P90X3. This is easily my favorite. I feel like the original was an overall better series but finding an hour every day was not always possible so I tried T25. I did that entire 3 month program and probably only missed a couple days. The 25 - 30 minute routines are definitely easier to fit in every day but I didn't care for the workouts in T25. To me they felt like they had a lot of repetition. Not necessarily in the movements but in that it was the same muscle groups for the entire routine. By the 1/2 way point my muscles were burnt out and each move was becoming less effective. P90X3 is the best blend of both. You have the convenient 30 minute routines but with enough variety that you don't burn a muscle group out and can finish the entire routine strong. That is not to say that the routines are easy, I actually feel I get a much better workout overall and I don't find myself watching the clock counting down to the finish.

The workout schedule is broken into 3 week blocks with a transition schedule in between. Each schedule contains routines focused on upper body or lower body strength, cardio, or flexibility. Each successive 3 week block picks up the intensity so just as you feel like the workouts are becoming comfortable he steps it up! If you continue to push yourself in each workout you won't hit hit that dreaded plateau you can with some programs.

The one minor complaint I have is with the cheap exercise band that is included. Pretty much every routine I have used it in the band has popped out of the handle at some point and I've had to stop and reattach it. I used a fine grit sandpaper (200g) to rough up the inside beveled surface of each handle so that the bands wouldn't pop out so easily and that helped. If you try that just don't get too aggressive with the sand paper or you can enlarge the hole making the problem worse.",1478217600,16,1924,4.326869806094183
7019811,4,B00TQ8FSWC,I am currently enrolled in the BeachBody on demand and have committed to following this program all the way through this time (after 2 initial attempts).

7019814,3,B00TQ8FSWC,"I have mixed feelings about this workout set.

Positives:
- The pacing is very good and the 30 minute sessions usually feel complete.  On some of them, I'm getting a 600 calorie workout when I add a 10 minute abs session at the end.
- Tony likes pull-ups, so there are a lot of those in this program.  Pull-ups are mandatory as part of any serious resistance program, IMO.
- Tony delivers an upbeat, friendly environment.  I think P90X3 is more effective in this sense than the P90X set I also have, in which Tony's humor becomes a little tiresome.

Negatives:
- Some of the moves in the program seem needlessly complex.  Tony might have you stand on your right leg, clench your left butt cheek, and wiggle your little finger when an air squat would be equally effective.  The complexity of some (not all) of the moves makes P90X3 a little harder than it has to be for beginners.
- There is a lot of jumping and hopping in this program.  Nothing wrong with that as it relates to the quality of the workout.  But, if you live in an apartment or if you do the workout very early or very late, you may be noisy with all the movement.
- I wish Tony would maintain a more consistent vocal cadence during the moves.  It's not practical to maintain eye contact with the TV for many of the moves, and when he stops counting or pauses to add an anecdote, I can't tell whether or not he is trying to slow the pace down.  What's worse, it turns out that sometimes he is and other times he isn't.

Excepting a couple of the workouts (The Challenge, Upper Eccentric in particular), I don't find myself getting very sore from this program.  Which tells me it is angled more towards cardio than towards strength training.  That is not bad, it is what it is and may be obvious anyway.

The best workout is the one you keep doing, so in that sense P90X3 can be a good program for many.  It is especially effective for people who like to keep their workout time under control.",1477094400,2,1958,4.337912087912088

7019827,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"I have done P90X, P90X2, and Insanity. P90X helped me lose 40 lbs I put on after getting laid off from work and P90X2 with its functional fitness focus helped cure my ITBS and improve my running but I don't know if I will ever do either of those again. I had been doing great, running close to 50 mpw and increasing while training for my 2nd marathon but messed up the alignment of my pelvis doing agility with my dog. While out of alignment, I pulled a hamstring after a hill workout. I had to cut way back on running since my adjustments would not hold and I was in pain.  I needed to work on balance and strengthening the stabilizer muscles to keep my pelvis stable. Of course it was hard to cut way back on the calories I had been eating to fuel my running so I gained some body fat which didn't help. I started P90X2 again but the workouts are so long and trying to run as well seemed like it would be too much. So I ordered P90X3 and just got it this week. So far I have only done 4 days but I already love this program. Unlike a lot of people, I liked the yoga in the original X but thought the shorter version in X2 was too fast paced. I like the yoga in X3 so much I will probably do it more than once a week. I get up at 5am to run so I go to bed at 9pm. By the time I get home from work in the evening and do the tasks I need to get done, it's close to 7 or 8 before I can workout. Just the thought of an hour workout made me tired. But only having to do 30 minutes works for me and the workout is done before I know it. I did Challenge last night, pushups/pullups over and over. I am so sore! I have used the chin up max since it was introduced, check out my review, and I highly recommend it.

I'm back to running 6 days a week and have found it is very doable to run 4-6 miles in the morning and do X3 at night. I think I could even do this workout when I train for a marathon again next year. I think the nutrition guide is easier to use than previous ones. I eat a plant based diet so the nutrition part is not difficult for me although I won't get as much protein as the plan suggests, however, that is still more than most athletes need and I'm not looking to build mass but get lean and stronger.

7019861,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"To start with, about me: I'm early 30s, mom of 2 young kids, work full time. My dedication to exercise has varied over the last few years from doing absolutely nothing to weight-lifting and running 5-6 days weekly. I'd tried P90X after my first baby was born to lose the baby weight but gave up because the work-outs were too long (seriously, who has time to fit 60+ minute work-outs in when you work and have a newborn?) and too dude-centric, by which I mean too much chest/back/upper body for my taste. So I went back to my old ways and let the hubs do P90X and P90X2 by himself. I wasn't in amazing shape, but I fit into my pre-baby clothes; hence, I was complacent about my fitness goals.

Then Tony invented P90X3, and hubs and I cut a deal to do this together. Am I ever glad I gave Tony another chance.

I won't explain each work-out because other reviewers have done that. I'll just explain why I like X3 compared to P90X.

1) time investment: I really appreciate the shorter work-outs. Thirty minutes is manageable for this working momma to eek out each day, but not much more. X3 has an overall much faster pace than P90X, so I feel like you get a lot of work done in the shorter time frame; basically, you give up rest/break time and not work-out time. I work out in the evening, so I never used the cold start and can't comment on it.

2) great core workout WITHOUT dedicated abs video: I hated abs day. Hated, hated, hated it. Ab Ripper X killed me, and I felt like I never made progress in either keeping up with the video or in my actual abs. But with X3, core-strengthening moves are built into each video without ever being the primary/sole focus. So by the end, I saw major progress in my belly. After 2 pregnancies, my belly was actually FLAT. Crazy, right? No 6-pack, but I blame myself for not following the nutrition plan well. My core is so much tighter, and my balance is also much, much better with the focus on core throughout the program.

3) good balance of total body/integrated and body-site specific work-outs: Remember how I complained about too much upper body in P90X? Well, there's still plenty of upper body work, but I like the more integrated approach taken here in X3. Plenty of time spent on the legs in the areas of cardio, true weight-lifting, and body-weight resistance training; my butt and calves are toned again. (I thought getting a firm butt over 30 would be like hunting a unicorn, but it's happened!) The Challenge (all push-ups and pull-ups) and Incinerator (resistance and body-weight upper body moves) are the only pure upper body videos. And after moving through the 5 stages of grief, I've come to love to hate The Challenge. For the first time in my life, I can do a few real deal, unassisted pull-ups!

4) good cardio: Tony admits in CVX that he doesn't love cardio, and I think that shows in the earlier P90 series - way better resistance training than cardio to be had there. Even though they aren't as intense as the cardio in some of the Shaun T series, I feel like they can stay challenging because you can always go faster deeper higher. After X3 my husband did T25, which is way more cardio focused; however, when going back to X3, he still felt like CVX and MMX were challenging because of the pace and intensity.

I didn't get the initial results for which I was aiming, but I am very pleased in the end. My actual body weight didn't change. At all, not even a pound. But I am much leaner with a flat stomach. And not only did I get my beloved lower body muscle tone back, but I'm really pleased with having toned shoulders and back for the first time ever. Moreover, I can tell I'm stronger; hauling in groceries or wrestling my kids is easy.

My husband overall enjoyed the program, too, as he suffers from the same time constraints as I do. He also noted gains in muscle mass and tone but not much weight change (we share the sweet tooth issue). I've repeated X3 and continued to get good results. He now prefers to mix up X3 upper body videos with T25 for cardio. I highly recommend this series - X3 is dude-centric no more!",1468108800,10,4094,4.413245033112583

7019935,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"I started P90X3 on 10/31/15 and finished on 1/30/2016. It was the 3rd time I started it, but the 1st time I finished it. I cannot say enough great things about this work out plan. I had been skinny my whole life until I had my son 8 years ago. Since then, the weight had gradually gone up each year. I was at the point where I had a serious muffin top going on over my fat pants. I was going to have to make some changes or buy a bigger wardrobe.

I had bought this years ago, and it helped but due to work or other factors, I never got past 2 to 3 weeks.  I decided to give it another try.

For the 1st 2 1/2 weeks, I did well with the DVDs, but hadn't changed my diet. I gained 2 lbs. No, it was not muscle...I was eating too much. Some Co workers told me about calorie counting apps, and I used one to start counting my calories. The 1st week was really hard...similar to quitting smoking or any bad habit. Since I'm in my 40s and a female, I could only net 1200 to 1300 calories a day to lose 1 to 2 lbs per week. However, the 2nd week was easier, and by week 3, I felt like my new diet was becoming a habit. I actually like salad now...you just have to experiment and find what you like. I still have chocolate and adult beverages, but only occasionally and in moderation.

So, I started at 165, went up to 167 and finished at 137. (As of today, I'm down to 132.) I couldn't do 1 push up on my toes when I started. I did the DVDs religiously. I did also walk my dog about 30 minutes a day, 4 to 5 times per week. I went to Zumba classes on Saturdays when I could. I can now do over 180 push ups on my toes (in sets of 18 to 20), I have muscle definition in my arms, I lost 7"" in my waist, and lost 30 lbs in 90 days. I've never felt better!!  I'm on the verge of 6 pack abs with continued effort!!

It's been 30 days since I finished, I still work out 6 to 7 days a week aND still do the DVDS bUT go to the gym too. I have started running as well. The 1st time I ran, I was able to run 3 miles straight without slowing down to walk. I probably haven't been able to do that since I was a teen. I think that shows how fit this DVD set helped me to be.

The key thing here is that this DVD set can really help in just 30 minutes a day, but diet is key!! If you are eating too many calories, you will not lose weight.

I can't recommend this enough!! Buy it, do the exercises, (do what you can to start), diet, and you will see great results!!",1457136000,101,2444,3.797244094488189

To compensate they make the moves quite challenging and relentless. It also seems more about weight loss and less about strength gains than previous iterations (which were by no means bodybuilding routines themselves.) This can either be a pro or a con depending on your goals. The MMX routine is an absolute blast, probably my favorite single home workout I've tried.

7019981,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"I have done P90X previously and I like Tony. I have also done Insanity, T25 and many other workout programs and I am in pretty good shape. My husband and I are both busy and the idea of a shorter version of P90X sounded great. And it is - I really like the workouts and the concept behind it. To compare it to P90X - there is more focus on full-body workouts than on just working 1-2 muscle groups at a time. We have just completed the first month and it's going great - no major body changes, but we are both just trying to maintain so we are happy with it.

My complaint and 1-star deduction is because Tony talks SO MUCH. It's only 30 minutes - there is no time for chit-chat. In comparison to T25 where Shaun T has you moving the whole time - with p90x3 you are stopping after every single exercise so Tony can remind you again that it's only 30 minutes, or that you don't need a gym or that's it hard or whatever - it makes me crazy. YES - you can get a good workout in 30 minutes, but not if you are stopping every 30-60 seconds to talk. Or high-five - that kills me too. Why are the back-up dancers/exercisers high-fiving after every exercise?  Come on, now - save the self-congratulatory high fives for after the 30 minutes, not because you just did some pushups or high knees for 30 seconds.  After the first week of this, I just started jogging in place or continuing the exercise we just finished or starting the next one, so you can work around it, but it gets annoying.

7020006,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Super workout. This will work you out like nothing out there. It helps built muscle and strength. Like any workout you need a very good diet to loose weight, but if you combine both you'll look great in no time.",1444003200,,211,4.3
7020007,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"I've done the original P90X and loved it. In this version you have to Learn to push harder, because it is only 30 minutes. I like it though. I am only on week two, so take that for what it is worth, but so far it is a first class 30 minute workout. You will need court shoes (tennis or basketball). Don't try to do this workout in running shoes.",1443571200,7,345,3.942857142857143

However Beachbody wants you to ideally purchase from their website, as many reviews will tell you, they have problems supporting purchases via Amazon. HOWEVER if you order from Beachbody, they want to sell you nutrition for extra money every month, extra DVDs of course for more money & it GOES ON & ON!!! I shop online extensively, but have never seen a more greedy or arduous ordering process in my life!!!
Tony you made an excellent product, which even though expensive is worth every penny, but all the extra money you are trying to extract from me, just bought respect for you and your product quiet a few notches down.",1441411200,17,657,4.721739130434782

7020014,1,B00TQ8FSWC,"Actually I do not like Beachbody's policies.  Because we bought this through Amazon, even though it was the Beachbody storefront, Beachbody will not honor its lace a missing DVD that was not in the original shipment.",1441152000,16,216,5.0

7020026,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Purchasing this was probably one of the best things I've ever done for myself. I've spent years coming up with my own exercise routines (including cardio and strength training) with little to no results, even after working out for 45m-1hr+ a day. Since I started this about 5 months ago, I've become very close to looking like the after pictures (very toned and fitter than I've ever been in my life), I don't recognize my body in the mirror anymore!
I can't recommend P90X3 enough! Between the variety (cardio, strength training, balance, yoga, etc...) and only having to spend 30-55m a day working out (I pause when I feel too exhausted. Each week I try to cut each workout down in time closer to the 30 minutes), this exercise program has been a Godsend!",1441065600,5,757,4.656716417910448
7020027,2,B00TQ8FSWC,"Look, the workout's fine, but this is sold as a kit, and it should be said that the included resistance band is a joke. The handles, featuring some sort of ""clever"" closure clamp for holding the tube, can't stand up to the resistance of securing the tube, let alone an actual workout. Both handles fail at the slightest resistance rendering the equipment unusable.",1440979200,7,364,4.7936507936507935

7020029,5,B00TQ8FSWC,WOW.These workouts are intense. They are short but packed with workouts that make you want to quit. Tony is a little quirky but you probably already knew that. The best way that I have found to use these workouts is in fast forward. Speed the DVD up to 2x actual speed and hang on to your butt. This way you don't have to hear Tony and you get an even faster harder workout. I would definitely recommend.,1439942400,,404,4.259740259740259

7020032,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Great product so far!  I was doing P90X for 13 weeks prior, but this is better for me since my wife and I have limited time as we both work and trying to raise the kiddos right.  It moves a lot faster, but the 30 minutes are gone before you know it and I feel great all day.  My joint pain is gone and my left knee has a (no need to operate) meniscus tear that I barely feel since using the P90X and P90X3.  The demostrated 'modified' workout routines for each exercise make it possible to stay in great shape and not put my knee in further jeopardy.  This program is worth way more than the ~$155!  I was spending way more for the gym membership and getting way less out of it.",1438905600,4,678,4.022388059701493
7020033,5,B00TQ8FSWC,I started P90X3 two weeks ago after doing two rounds of 21 Day Fix. These workouts make 21 Day Fix look like a walk in the park and those weren't easy! P90X3 is HARD but the results are noticeable right away. I find that I was able to do way more reps of the exercises this week than the first week. Week one I could do zero pull-ups (even with the assist bands) and last night I did 20 (with the bands)! The diet is easy to follow along with and explains in depth the pros and cons of eating various types of food.,1438905600,6,515,3.9615384615384617
7020034,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"Don't buy this until you try it via their on-demand streaming service. Don't buy ANY Beachbody program that's available via streaming until you try it first. Why? Streaming is free for the first 30 days. You could try 30 different things by lots of different trainers to see what you like before committing to something that's more expensive. That said, I have both and prefer the DVDs. But make sure you get what you like and are capable of. The printed materials are downloadable so those are digital too.

Streaming has P90, P90X2, P90X3, Insanity, and full single workout samples from many other programs like Body Beast.

It also streams via many different devices. See: http://beachfitrob.com/2015/08/04/beachbody-on-demand-streaming/ You've got one, or you can get one cheap to use.

Here's a tour of the streaming service I made:

7020046,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"Loved P90X, Love P90X3 just as much. I love Tony, he is funny, engaging and never bores me. I should say I am a serious athlete, and don't have time to waste on something that doesn't get my sweat running like hell. That said, I do love these workouts. Personally I don't think 30 min is enough, so I usually do 2 or 3 of these workouts in a row and let me tell you, they get the job done. My only thing with this set is that its got too many fillers. Fine, one yoga is OK. But there is that + Pilates, dynamics, isometrics...these are really not workouts, just active recovery type of thing. If I am paying for 12 DVDs, I want 12 DVDs thats gonna shoot my heart rate up through the roof. I know how to do active recovery on my own. So more hard core workouts, less fillers next time plz. Other than that, great workouts.",1438560000,3,821,4.074074074074074

Like a friend told me, do what you can do. If they do 40 push-ups and 20 chin-ups, then you do 12/6 or whatever you can do.  This stuff is easy to modify, yet as difficult as you can go.  Tony helps you feel comfortable doing so.",1437177600,2,402,4.0

I was able to get my weights from a friend as well as the chin up bar. (In all honesty, you could do the workout routines with a big can of soup if you wanted to lol) The workouts are VERY effective and you can feel them within the first 5 minutes, but not to difficult that you quit after a couple days.

7020099,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"After baby #2 I needed to take charge and a physical therapist friend was doing X3 so I decided to try it. I'm a month in and like the workouts. The 30 minutes length is perfect. If I miss a day I can double up and only need an hour. Tony is annoying- mansplains to the women and seems possibly racist in one video. I'm guessing sexual inadequacy issues (you are going to watch these videos over and over, you will start to analyze this man too). He's ok in some. The included resistance band SUCKS. Breaks regularly while I'm trying to keep up. I feel strong and fitter. Plus i keep getting compliments on my ass (nobody has complimented my ass since I was 19)",1434412800,3,661,4.253968253968254
7020100,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"I am almost done with this program - two more weeks!  It's a tough 30 minutes (plus cool down) 6 days a week, but it's great for your overall health and fitness. I have certainly increased my muscle-to-fat ratio and gained strength and flexibility from P90X3. P90X3 includes weight training, yoga, isometrics and pilates for flexibility, a variety of cardio workouts and even an agility workout  I appreciate the strength training most since you can't get that just from going for a run.  Some people find Tony annoying but I find him entertaining- following his energetic positive guidance keeps me from looking at the clock too often.  There is a lot of variety of the workouts which keeps me from getting bored.

There is a diet element to the program, and if your goal is to lose a significant amount of weight you'll want to follow the diet as well- it's a healthy diet that involves mostly getting rid of junk food and refined flour and sugar and using portion control.  There are vegan options too, as Tony spent many years as a vegan before adding a small amount of meat to his diet.  I borrowed some good advice from the nutrition guide but didn't follow the whole plan.

Even if you don't follow the nutrition plan, the P90X3 workouts will improve your muscle-to-fat ratio and build your tone, strength, flexibility and overall fitness. Tony Horton is in his 50's, so you don't need to be 25 to do this, but you do need have a basic level of fitness to start with because the workouts are tough.  However, every workout includes a ""modifier"" as one of the cast, doing modified versions of some of the moves so you can certainly start on the lower end of the fitness scale and work your way up.  (The cast for each workout DVD includes three participants plus Tony Horton as the trainer.)  If you haven't been exercising regularly you might want to start with a program that is less hard core than this one.

I recommend the P90X3 workout program if you're willing to commit 90 days to jump-starting your personal fitness.  I do love being able to do it at home regardless of weather or traffic conditions, and I feel it's a program that emphasizes overall long-term health and fitness, not just looking good.  Also see Tony Horton's book The Big Picture and consider reading it for inspiration between sweat-fests.",1434412800,4,2324,4.65036674816626
7020101,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Love it and all the Tony-isms throughout. Workouts are tough and so nice to be done in 30 minutes.

7020116,5,B00TQ8FSWC,"Everything you need to get started...Great Instuctor..Guys you will do pilates and yoga...Its challenging give it a shot

Things you will need:

Pull up bar (can substitute using bands included)

Weights from 5-12lbs and 15-35lbs (can substitute using bands included)

Yoga Mat or something of the sort I guess you can go with carpet if your in the living

Enough room to move around I would say 360 about 7ft unless your taller also you will move laterally (left & right) so I would say about 12ft but that's just me also depends how big your steps and your height but keep in mind you need the space

30 mins a day and ambitioun to work hard and get it done it a short amount of time a day

You will not need a pull up bar...i think its better to have one but it comes with a band and a loop so you can attach to a door hinge and substitute the pull up bar...you don't exactly need weights but you will get better results weights from 5-12lbs and 15-35lbs whatever your comfortable with again you can substitute the weight by just using bands...there are modifiers in the video also Tony (the instructor) does not push you to hurt yourself or make you do it perfect but he does want you to work and use adequate (good) form also he says if you need time to finish with a move he says you can pause then resume when your done(does not mean you can be lazy and don't rest for a while either get it done so you can progress through video and get rresults

I personally think everything about this product is great and I'm having awesome results if you didn't like it or there is a bad review they just have excuses and didn't put in work to get results what more could you want its convenient 30 mins a day your in your own home no gym needed no one is watching you get it done and get results I reccomend to any fitness level because weather your fitness level is beginner or expert you'll have a great time with this program
It doesn't just stop after 90 days either you can choose to do it again or there is a Lean,Bulk, and doubles option as well which uses the same workouts just in a certain order to achieve what you've chosen to do...hope all this helps!!!

7020154,3,B00TQ8FSWC,"Other customers have written thorough reviews about the workout, so let me just add this brief comment: Tony Horton is the most unfortunate thing about P90X3 and almost ruins what is an otherwise very good program. His attempts at humor are not only horribly unfunny, but they are completely out of place. When I am struggling with a resistance movement or gasping for breath during a cardio workout, the last thing I want is for someone to crack inane jokes. In fact, I have let 4 different friends borrow my copy of P90X3, and after several days, each of them gave me virtually the same response: ""It seems like a good workout but I can't stand Tony Horton and his ego.""

If you decide to buy P90X3, my recommendation is to quickly learn the routine and then mute his comments. Horton is an unfunny showoff, which is too bad because for a 30-minute workout, P90X3 is pretty good.

Update: TONY HORTON IS THE WORST.
I just wanted to reiterate this a year later. At this point, I would strongly recommend looking for a workout with a different company because Horton is a liability, not an asset.",1431388800,10,1096,4.586734693877551

7020203,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"This review is just not of the P90X3 program, but all of the P90X programs.  Thus, a buyer can make an overall decision of which program is best for them.  First, let me say that the Beachbody is in the money-making business, which sometimes clouds the overall quality of their products.  You also have to get past the Tony Horton goofiness factor.  The only person that thinks Tony Horton is funny is Tony Horton.  He fails to realize that people have to watch these programs numerous times, and his goofiness is a grand distraction from quality fitness programs.  It can get quite annoying especially in the new P90X programs.  And you have to get past his huge ego.  However, I will give him credit for looking incredibly fit for a guy the same age as I am.  If he would just keep his mouth shut he could be the next Jack Lulane.

Background: I have been using the P90X fitness programs for over eight years.  I use the original P90X program, the P90X+ program, the P90X2 program, and the P90X3 program.

P90X

Overall Grade: A

This is probably one of the best fitness programs put on a DVD.  The program follows a logical sequence, and if you follow the program you should see promising results.  However, the sets are long, many times over an hour.  There is nothing really fancy about the program, just good old weight lifting 101.  The brilliance of the program is weightlifting using just dumbbells or bands.  There are great cardio programs in the set with Plyocide and KempoX.  There are really no clunky discs in the program.

Tony Horton goofiness rating: 5

Marketing push: Results and Recovery Drink

P90X+

Overall Grade: A+

Of all of the P90X programs this is the best one.  The only thing is there are only five discs to the program.  This program is very condensed with very little down-time between routines.  If you want fast, results driven routines these discs rock.  Even today they still beat my butt into the ground.  They are so condensed that there is very little time for Tony Horton to be goofy.  Plan on sweating in this program. You will definitely see results from this program.

Tony Horton goofiness rating: 4

Marketing push: BowFlex Selectect Barbells (Tony Horton was a spokesperson for BowFlex at the time (I found them well worth the money)

P90X2

Grade: C

Things really come off the rails in the P90X2 program.  What happened!  First, there are long segments of stretching, I mean more than 20 minutes of stretching and foam rolling.  Oddly, this program was released at the same time research was showing that before exercise stretching is not really recommended.  Also this program has a lot of balancing, sometime on balls that can be downright dangerous.  Further, there is loads of equipment added to this program: physioballs, medicine balls, push-up bars, weights, and a stand.  Tony Horton really talks too much in between sets, which considerably lengthens the sets.  If he were to stop talking the sets could be substantially reduced in time. Once I had the routines down I found myself proceeding ahead of the sets due to Tony Hortons rambling.  There are sometimes minutes in between sets allowing the heart rate to come way down.  The routines are sloppy with Tony Horton not even maintaining a correct count. Also, with P90X2 & P90X3 Beachbody tries to squeeze some more money out of you buy trying to get you to buy two more discs for $60. I would not recommend this program.

Tony Horton goofiness scale: 10

Marketing push:  All of the equipment mentioned above.

P90X3

Overall Grade: B

Beachbody tries to broaden their market with shorter routines, 30 minutes.  This is not necessarily bad if you need a short routine.  But I would recommend the P90X+ program if you want shorter more condensed tough routines.  Why?  Well the Tony Horton goofiness factor influences the time between sets again.  If he would just stop talking and let the people work out this program would be better.  There are some discs that are just plain clunkers.  But some of the discs are good.  If you work very hard in these sets you should see some results.

I think Tony Horton has reached the end of his creative exercises repertoire. Hes done  now its all about making Tony money.  I really cant take anymore of his goofiness. This is why this will be my last P90X program; time to move on to something different.

Tony Horton goofiness factor: 8

8702713,4,B00TQ8FSWC,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but wanted to put in my two cents, as I just finished the whole 90 day program. Let me just say that this is honestly meant for beginners and intermediates. For more advanced peeps, you may want to look elsewhere. I remember seeing all the videos and advertisements of the people's ""before"" and ""after"" and they were chiseled hot bods, and though hey that's not bad for 90 days. Honestly you may be able to achieve that, as I wasn't religious about it, sometimes skipping a day or so, and not following the food guide to the tee.

For the most part I stuck to program and did the workouts on the days it said. I feel like they had a lot of ""fluff"" on some days. Like jumping around and yoga. At least for me and my body type, it was useless. I never felt sore or increased strength on those days, I felt soggy and soft after. It's also possible I wasn't able to fully utilize some of the jumping days as I have neighbors below me, so i wasn't able to do the jumping and stomping moves to their fullest.

They do have some good strength based workouts, but I never felt truly pushed after the first month. I do like the 30 minutes and it really helped mentally to push to workout, thinking it's only ""30 minutes"".

To me the big benefit with these was the schedule and routine of working out. Each day you check off a specific workout, with focused goals and specific areas instead of the ""free styling"" I would do before. They really push the importance of working all parts of your body, especially your core to increase strength. I liked that.

Overall the benefit with these, at least to me, is routine and focus. If you're a beginner who is looking to lose weight or increase strength, these are great. It keeps you focused with the daily routine with short workouts that you can complete with any sort of schedule.

If you're anything past intermediate, these are a waste of time. I honestly feel these are geared more for losing weight and toning than truly increasing strength. You won't look like the people in the photos after, but you can be kinda close.",1533772800,,2096,4.377892030848329

8702715,1,B00TQ8FSWC,"The program itself is probably 4 or 5 stars. Beachbody Customer Service is TERRIBLE!!

However, the DVDs themselves have so many copyright protections that they work on certain players. EX- I have a Xbox 360: the incinerator DVD will work on, but it will not work on my PC, my Xbox one or my Panasonic blue ray player.
For a program that bills itself to work with travel, the DVDs should work with most players- or Beachbody should have an alternative available for customers. Like offering to replace the DVD or provide access to on demand content. When calling TS, typical runaround, rude, poor English and mysterious hand up.
