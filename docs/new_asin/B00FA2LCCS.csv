5972821,5,B00FA2LCCS,"I go to Jazzercise classes when I can manage to get to them. On the days that I can't, I workout at home using fitness DVDs.  My favorite was the Jazzercise Burlesque DVD but this one is quickly surpassing it.  I work up a sweat but have so much fun doing it that it really doesn't feel like work...except for the planks; those are greuling.  Don't worry you only do 3 sets and I can feel my muscles toning by the minute.

Shanna's cueing is right on and I love her enthusiam/stage presence.  Watching the DVD makes you wish you could have been there in person.  One of the biggest reasons I love Jazzercise is because they use real hit music and not this canned generic stuff that most workout videos use.  I much prefer moving to songs I recognize. I have lost
40 lbs from last year and it is because I made exercise a part of my life.  In the past I never stuck with it and that was because I usually became bored.  I would go running but even that got monotonous after a while.  Dancing never gets old.  I can see myself doing this until my legs don't work anymore.",1380585600,5,1069,4.1911764705882355

Jazzercise is no joke, trust me. My mom got me into jazzercise classes when I was 16. I thought it would be a goofy exercise class where everyone would be wearing leotards and leg warmers and prancing around, but after my first class I was hooked. Eight years of classes on and off, due to college and moving around, but I absolutely love it and it will always be my workout of choice! I've used this DVD to keep me in shape all through college (no classes near my school or I would have gone!). I was surprised at how challenging it was, considering I had been jazzercisng for a few years. I even got all my roommates into it and they will never make fun of me for Jazzercising ever again!! Some have even asked to borrow it over semester breaks while on vacation! It's pretty intense if you're doing it high impact all the way through, especially since this is a HIIT program. We also had a lot of fun with it because you are ""dancing"" to popular songs all while burning fat and toning muscle! I can't stress how much fun jazzercise is and it's really easy to follow along. When they say right, you go right. When they say left, you go left, but It was definitely a little difficult at first, getting the steps down and keeping in time. It's sort of like a dance class, but you're thrown right into the recital your first day - doing full routines with no practice. Don't give up, with a little time and some practice you'll be a pro... and you'll be doing it in your living room anyway so you have nothing to worry about!

I should mention this DVD requires the use of weights or a exercise tube/band. I personally prefer the bands - it's easier to carry/store, cheaper than weights, and most of the instructors in this video use them - but use whatever you're comfortable with!

I like that the instructors will show you low impact options if you're feeling tired or if you've got a bad knee, etc. An instructor once told me if you can't talk while you're jazzercising, you're going too hard! Like I said before, this is a HIGH INTENSITY  workout, so pace yourself, start out slow and work your way up. Low impact movements will effect your body the same way and you will most definitely break a sweat and feel it the next day.

If you get really into it and you've memorized all the moves in this DVD, I suggest trying out the Burlesque DVD. It's a little more dancey than this, but still a good workout. Actual jazzercise classes are great too. They're always changing up the music and routines so you'll never get bored! It's always a great time when I can make it to class, but when I can't, I'm doing this DVD!",1490486400,,2751,4.354775828460039

8613656,5,B00FA2LCCS,I love this Dance Hiit DVD I have been doing Jazzercise for about 20 years I used to go to Classes but with a Husband and Child it is easier to have a DVD and do this at home on my own time I love the music and the moves and I love the teacher she is good  the first one I bought off of the Jazzercise website and about a year later the disc fell in the floor and got stepped on and had a crack in it and would not work so I got lucky and someone was selling a used one on here Thank you!,1459209600,,488,3.5185185185185186
8613657,5,B00FA2LCCS,I just finished doing this DVD - I had put it away last year because i go tired of it - I did it too much! Today I decided to revisit it and i'm going to wear it out again - The music is fabulous and keeps you pumped up throughout the sweat fest! So Much fun! I WANT MORE - I hope they make another with the live format and great music - Hurry Up!!!,1434758400,,349,3.6052631578947367

8613659,1,B00FA2LCCS,"Wow,Can't understand the high price tag on this site-I'm glad that I didn't pay that much,as I sold this right after using it. Bought it based on great reviews and did not feel worked out at all,nor energized. I'll admit that none of my other workouts are ""dancy""but I thought this would add something new to my collection and thought it might be fun. To me it was a combination of silly&annoying and even the music couldn't save it. There are so many great dvds out there that I refuse to do a workout a second time unless I thoroughly enjoyed it. The high price listed here is just ridiculous-it's not like it's a dvd set-its just 1 awful dvd and it's over $50.00",1392768000,3,665,4.370967741935484
8613660,5,B00FA2LCCS,"This is the best Jazzercise DVD to date, awesome upbeat music and moves that will get your heart rate up and making you feel sore the next day!!  I'm obsessed and can't wait for more!!",1391558400,,184,4.257142857142857
8613661,3,B00FA2LCCS,"I was an avid Jazzerciser, attending multiple classes per week in the 80's for about 12 years. Once I was married, working full time and started a family, was not able to go as often. Then I went onto other forms of exericse including doing the Jazzercise routines I loved in my basement!! I loved those routines and still do. This DVD and others before it held such promise but just don't deliver. Shana is OK, it's the choreography, music and moves that are really the problem. Just not fun at all. She was even having trouble getting the huge crowd into it. Nothing catchy or uplifting about it. I used to leave Jazzercise class (and my basement as well!) high as a kite just from the adrenalin rush of the music and the moves. I have written Jazzercise to see if they will create any retro DVD's. Highly unlikely but we'll see.",1388880000,2,831,4.437908496732026
8613662,5,B00FA2LCCS,"THIS DANCE WORKOUT IS AWESOME. JUST LIKE IN THE BURLESQUE WORKOUT, SHANNA IS AN EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR & HER CUEING IS IMPECCABLE. I LIKE THE BURLESQUE JUST A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE DANCING IN IT & I AM A DANCE FANATIC. HAVING SAID THAT, THIS ONE IS STILL FULL OF DANCE STEP & SHE JUST PLAIN MAKES IT FUN. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE FROM HER!!!",1386374400,,348,4.287878787878788
8613663,4,B00FA2LCCS,"The jazzercise Burlesque dvd was a very pleasant surprise and quickly became one of my favorite cardio dvds.  The only issue I had with that dvd was it was too short for my tastes.  I saw this dvd listed under the new dvds and I jumped on it even though $16.99 plus $5.95 shipping is little pricey for exercise dvd which is why I took a star off.

The dvd is filmed live in front of a stadium class of 1,000 people.  It is lead by Jazzercise President Shanna Missett Nelson and she is joined on stage by four back ground exercisers.  The dvd is designed to use exercise tubes/bands but one of the ladies uses dumbbells.  The music sounds like original pop songs but it might be canned remakes since I am not up to date enough on pop music to know real songs from fakes.  Regardless, the music is great and Shanna does a good job of matching the routines to the songs.  If you liked the Burlesque dvd then you will love the cardio / dance sections which are just as fun with the intensity up just a notch.  The toning section should be perfect for most of Jazzercise's core audience but advanced exercisers might need more weight training and use this just as cardio or light weight training days.

The Full Routine is 48 minutes.  It is broken down into 10 routines or songs.  You get a five minute warm-up then move right into the first high impact cardio section.  Each section is 4 - 5 minutes long.  Here is the breakdown: warm-up / cardio / bands - upper / cardio / lower body standing / cardio / bands - upper & lower compound / cardio / core (w/ planks) / cardio / stretch (2 min.).  Each section is based on a song and has a choreographed routine - even the weight sections.  I find Shanna's choreography easy to follow but not so easy that is is boring.  People who do not do dance dvds often might take a couple of times to get it down perfect but they should not be so frustrated or lost that they cannot get a workout on the first use.  Note of caution: this is not a beginners dvd and it is high impact.  This is High Intensity Interval Training which assumes you already have some conditioning and are looking to take your fitness to the next level.

In addition to the main routine the dvd also offers three pre-mixes of the same routine.  Pure Cardio is 30 minutes total (5 warm-up, 23 cardio and 2 cool down) and is just the dance or cardio portions. This Cardio section would be great to add to Burlesque to extend the cardio on that dvd by 20 minutes. Pure Strength is 19 minutes with no warm-up or cool down and is just the four toning sections.  HiiT Express is 18:46.  The warm-up is replaced by the arm section then cardio / bands / cardio / part of core section and cardio.

This is a good mix of cardio and toning and I think it will appeal to intermediate exercisers who enjoy good music and moderate choreography to their routines.  You do go on the floor in the eighth section and hold planks and then two sets of each side bringing your knee to your elbow.  I am not big fan of going to floor in cardio programs but this is o.k. since you are static when you go down instead of popping right back up and you only do this three times. I also think the legs could be more challenging and I am going to try the leg exercises using my Fire Walkers and I think that will do the trick.  I will update this after I do the full routine and premixes wearing my heart rate monitor.",1381708800,11,3400,4.21483771251932
