1651374,4,B00005QW63,"I remember the ABC TUESDAY (and WEDNESDAY) MOVIE OF THE WEEK very fondly.  This 1973 entry was one of the better efforts, along with THE ROOKIES (1972), MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING (1971) and of course, BRIAN'S SONG (1972).  You have good performances across the board, with Richard Roundtree in his prime (post SHAFT) and standard TV vets as Vince Edwards, Andrew Duggan, Richard Jaeckel and Val Avery.  FIREHOUSE on DVD.  Now bring on THE ROOKIES.",1102464000,6,456,4.8076923076923075
1651375,4,B00005QW63,"This 1973 movie was the pilot for the ABC TV series Firehouse which ran on Thursdays at 8:30pm from January 17 to July 11 1974. It was great to see again having only seen it before from a young child's perspective. Although there is no definitive departmental location, it seems to be set in New York City. One frame stock shot at a fire is of an FDNY truck. The credits mention Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles and New York fire departments. The story's main plot has the firefighters in Engine Company 23 locate an arsonist (whom they refer as a firebug) setting several fires in apartment buildings. Roundtree's character is under fire (no pun intended) for replacing a fallen dedicated firefighter killed in the line of duty. The movie's undertone deals with racism and is gritty at times. All in all the movie is not bad, though is definitely dated even for '73 (may as well had horses pulling a fire wagon). Firehouse is recommended for fire fighting aficionados and those who enjoy stepping back in time for TV nostalgia.",1099353600,7,1026,4.705555555555556
1651376,3,B00005QW63,"I, being a modern day firefighter, usually get a kick out of seeing actors run through burning buildings full of smoke without any REAL turnout gear on and no air pack. This adds to the drama I guess, but I like a little more realism. Anyhow, some of the senior guys around my firehouse tell stories about the days before air packs. This movie seems to be real for its time. It starts off like a ""B"" rated movie, but pretty soon you start recognizing all the famous faces. The movie is definately worth watching if you are into firefighting movies, and probably worth it even if your not.",1092614400,5,588,4.4036697247706424
1651377,2,B00005QW63,"I was actually a fan of the television series loosely based on this 1973 TV movie.  That doesn?t mean I wasn?t familiar with the movie...it aired endlessly on late night television for years.  It?s a very racist-themed movie, so much so my wife said that she?d forgotten how bad it was 30 years ago.
The exterior fire scenes appear largely to be actual fires the film crew just followed a fire department around and shot, which probably weren?t hard to come by in 1970?s Chicago.  The tone of the film is gritty and dark with kind of a neat low-rent pulsating soundtrack, but again limited to a 1973 made for TV movie kind of way.
The print quality is about what you?d expect for the price.  It?s in its native 4:3 screen ratio, it has obvious commercial break inserts, it?s soft with dull colors that fade into each other, and it?s pretty dirty.  It may have been a dub of a VHS transfer. On the other hand, I could say you?ve never seen it look better, and probably be right.  Sadly, this is probably as good as gets.
The soundtrack automatically showed up in PLII on my receiver but was mixed off to the right, which may have been intended to make it sound wider
There are no extras of any kind.  Click ?Play Movie? and it starts cold to the point you appear to be jumping into the middle.  (You're not...it just starts that way.)
I wouldn?t mind seeing a DVD release of this movie cleaned up and including the 13 episodes of the loosely-based television series that followed with maybe a Richard Roundtree commentary for the movie but...oh, who am I kidding.  That anybody bothered to release this on DVD at all is probably something of a miracle, and I?ll take it.",1083110400,4,1669,4.463815789473684

1651434,4,B00005QW63,"FIREHOUSE is an impressive Aaron Spelling pilot for a mid-70s TV series that had a brief 13 week run. The drama is enhanced by actual multi-story fire footage. It concerns the then ongoing integration of previously all-white fire departments, as seen within fictional Engine Co. 23, where Edwards is lead fireman, a true pro and a rampant racist. He clashes immediately with new man Roundtree, a black who's taking the place of Edwards' best friend, killed while fighting one of the too numerous arson-related ghetto blazes in their district.

Their tense war of words escalates into a handball court fistfight which is interrupted by yet another arson call. It's at this fire that Roundtree earns the grudging respect of his peers. A final scene between him and Edwards which could've led to a definite resolution is once again halted by an incoming alarm.

Of the exceptional cast seen here only Jaeckel would return for the 30 minute series, which probably contributed to it not being renewed for the second half of the season.

1651438,5,B00005QW63,"So glad to have finally found a copy of this explosive movie ""Firehouse"".  I first saw this movie in the 1970s during the height of what was called ""blaxploitation"", but now is lovingly called ""soul cinema"".  I collect those movies that I enjoyed so much during the 1970s.  This movie stars Richard Roundtree (star of Shaft) and his wife is played by Sheila Frazier (love interest in Super Fly).  The other stars are Vince Edwards, Val Avery, Andrew Duggan, Richard Jaeckel, and Paul LeMat.  The film itself is low budget, but the quality of the story line and the excellent acting performances make up for the low budget.

Roundtree plays a newbie black Fire Fighter who gets assigned to a firehouse that just lost a fireman in a tragic fire.  There is a firebug starting fires all over the city and must be caught.  Roundtree's marriage is on shaky ground because he has had trouble finding gainful employment and now that he has gotten a great civil service job as a fireman...he must face prejudice and hatred being the only black at his station.  Several cities to date in 2012 still deal with racism and prejudice within the Fire Department, so the story line is still relevant to date.",1345248000,,1192,4.6650717703349285

1651440,1,B00005QW63,"I purchased this dvd movie from ""Once Around the Block"", it skipped and froze several places throughout the movie.  I tried to contact the seller regarding the problem, all I wanted was a replacement and they never would respond to my e-mails.  I am really disappointed in the product because of it skipping and freezing, and even more disappointed in the seller never responding to my request, not even a word from them.

1651441,4,B00005QW63,"Though this film was made back in the 70's, it didn't feel as dated as I expected it to.  I bought it strictly because I am a Vince Edwards fan and was not disappointed.  Initially it has a cheesy, ""made for tv"" feel, but after the first ten minutes the story is engrossing.  Richard Roundtree (of Shaft fame) plays a newbie firefighter encountering racism in the 23rd precinct, which is pretty much run by Vince Edwards.  I expected a predictable ending, which did not happen.  A much better than average tv film that gives some insight into the lives of firefighters.",1212192000,2,569,4.594059405940594
1651442,4,B00005QW63,"I was enormously skeptical about this movie, but the 12 year old kid across the street bought it at Wal-Mart for $3.99 and wanted to watch it with me because I'm a professional firefighter.

At first I really thought it was going to be a Blaxploitation flick that got dipped into the world of fire, replete with Richard Roundtree as a righteous black man in a racist all-white firehouse in the inner city.  But it was a rather morally complex story where both sides have to learn to see one another for what they truly are, and have to learn to integrate into the team they must be to survive the early 70s in ghetto New York (called by FFs of the era, ""the War Years"" because of previously unheard of rates of arson and targeting of FFs for violence).

The white FFs have just lost a loved fellow FF to an arson-for-kicks fire in a heavily black neighborhood, they have their firehouse burgled on regular basis while out fighting fires, they have trash and bricks and insults hurled at them by the very people they risk their lives to save day in and day out.  Enter Richard Roundtree who is the new black rookie FF assigned to take the recently deceased's place.  Most of the men of the house want to give Roundtree a fair shot, except the senior man of the firehouse who is palpaply angry and bitter.  While probably not a true dyed-in-the-wool racist, the senior man wrongly takes his friend's death out on Roundtree because he's black, baiting him at every turn and pressuring the other's to do so.

Things in the house go as well as can be expected until Roundtree catches one of the young, black arsonists in the act.  The young man accuses Roundtree of being an Uncle Tom, and Roundtree lets him go.  The other men in the firehouse find out, and--seeing this as a MAJOR VIOLATION of what it means to be a fireman--make it clear that he could not have done a worse thing and set out to break Roundtree with harrassment and overwork.

In the scene leading up to the final climactic fire, Roundtree and the senior man meet in the alley hand-ball court behind the firehouse to have it out in private.  Great scene, just the two of them, no music, no screams, just two men grappling.  In the middle of all this, the fire alarm goes off, and they wordlessly break and trot toward the truck to respond to an apartment fire.  This scene may possibly be the distillation of of firehouse life: You may hate someone in the firehouse, but when the bells sound, you both get on the truck and watch each out for one another.

Roundtree redeems himself at this apartment fire by dragging a white slumlord who was complaining about the firemen standing around over to the covered corpse of a covered fire victim, and telling the slumlord in no uncertain terms that he should be in jail because of the firetrap he owned.  Roundtree also discovers the true mastermind arsonist behind a recent spat of arson fires set intentionally to kill firemen.  Roundtree chases him down and kicks the crap out of him in the alley and turns him over to the police before returning to the fire to fall thru a floor while trying to save a dog.  The senior man, heretofore the antagonist, rushes upstairs against the orders of the captain to help Roundtree, a fellow fireman.

In the final scene of the movie, days later, the senior man tells Roundtree that while he may never like him personally, he respects what he did to catch the arsonist and fight the fire.

I would bet my next paycheck that this film was written by a firefighter.  The language, the sentiments, the intricate firehouse rules and mandates are too genuine to by written by an outsider.  Unfortunately, there are no directing or writing credits.  It's too bad the production values are so poor,  if someone had taken a little more time and spent a little more money, this could have truly been one of the greatest fire movies ever made.  If you are a fan of the genre, it's definitely worth seeing, if only for the stock footage of the FDNY at work in the early 70s.

This was written at a time when no fire dept on earth in peacetime had seen what the FDNY in the Bronx and Harlem was seeing.  It was hell on earth every single day for these men, with 40 calls a day and 3-4 large working fires a shift.
