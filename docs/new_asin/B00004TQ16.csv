1351656,1,B00004TQ16,"I recommend the VHS version. I jumped at the opportunity to have the silent drill team on DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD recording has the same quality as a VHS tape as well as pour sound. The aftermath is a prolonged ad. I was in the Marines and this DVD recording lacks attention to detail, except for the Marines in it. It has three minute references to becoming better target shooters for competition shooters, to make the sale ads. I felt I lost an hour of my life watching the advertizement on this DVD, then I took it outside and shot it!!!",1180396800,20,544,4.396039603960396
1351657,3,B00004TQ16,"I have seen this video several times and owned it at one time. My husband, who was a former marine and served where it was filmed, never tired of watching it. I'm not sure what the above viewer was looking for, but if you want a way to honor our military in your own home, this video is for you. I have been searching for a new copy for over a year.",1116028800,,349,3.861111111111111
1351658,1,B00004TQ16,"This video looks like a home video made by some proud mom who watched the ceremony!
I was extremely disappointed in it (after having purchased The Silent Drill), and returned it to Amazon.com for a piddling $5.49 refund of the original $19.99 I paid!  This is ridiculous and gives me pause for wonder about future purchases from Amazon!",1004572800,9,336,4.793103448275862

7923010,5,B00004TQ16,What can you say about this video?  Embodies the pride and dedication the USMC represents every day.  Made my father cry. Precision and honor on display.,1401494400,,153,4.846153846153846
7923011,1,B00004TQ16,Think twice before you buy this DVD.  It shows only the drill team performing at their Barrack area for those regular tourists. Nothing spectacular.  Just like they are practicing or what.  The video and audio quality are worse than an old video tape.  The DVD contains quite a lot of advertisements to sustain the 45 minutes claimed duration.  I feel nothing but being ripped off.,1309824000,,381,4.8
7923012,1,B00004TQ16,"I gave it one STAR just to get this published otherwise it would get Zip.  Very disappointed to get a DVD that was shot with a home recorder.  The disc started with a few minutes of film obviously taken off a TV screen, very fuzzy and washed out.  My heart sank when I remembered what I paid for this junk.  Then the image improved for the taping of the Color Guard and the Silent Drill Team performances.  Not too bad with some close and wide angle shots.  The cameraman didn't always zoom in on what I wanted to see but it did break up the shooting.
The whole scene is a concrete or blacktop drill field with stadium bleachers, don't expect to see a beautiful and historic background like Arlington or DC.
I'm not kidding, what I found on YouTube was mostly better.  TOO EXPENSIVE!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Marine-Corps-Battle-Color-Ceremony-Featuring-The-Silent-Drill-Team-DVD/dp/B00009VRET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Marine Corps Battle Color Ceremony Featuring The Silent Drill Team DVD</a>",1268352000,3,1049,5.559748427672956

7923014,5,B00004TQ16,The DVD is better then a 5.  If there is anyone who has been a marine or on the drill team this is great for their friends and family to see what they were involved in.,1260576000,,168,3.6666666666666665
7923015,4,B00004TQ16,"I purchased this video for my father-in-law, who is a former marine. (There's no such thing as an ""X-Marine"".) He loves the video and I have to admit, I enjoyed the precision, discipline, and talent these young marines show here. There are many chapters on this video so you'll enjoy several hours of show.",1239148800,,306,4.685185185185185
7923016,5,B00004TQ16,"I purchased this for my father in law, a retired Marine MSgt.  He loved it!  My husband and I, both Marines, watched it as well and were very happy with the purchase.  If I can't see it live, then this video serves as a great substitute.  The Silent Drill team was spectacular.  The Marine Corps Band and the Drum and Bugle Corps are outstanding.",1225238400,,346,4.34375
7923017,1,B00004TQ16,"Very disappointing DVD of a magnificent team.  Shot outside in San Diego from somewhere in the upper stands, the camera work is choppy and the sound awful.  The constant noise of aircraft leaving/arriving at the civilian airport is almost as annoying as the audience clapping.  The team deserves applause - but at the right time, not canstantly throughout the drill.  Sorry I spent my money on this; wish there was a film of the team done professionaly in a quieter local.  I saw the team on a TV show years (and Years) ago; done on a TV stage, and yeah, maybe the local was not as historic as San Diego, but with multiple cameras and great editing, wow - what a memory.  My advice, though I appreciate that the producers tried to share a great example of the Marines with us, is don't waste your money.",1189641600,12,803,4.465753424657534
