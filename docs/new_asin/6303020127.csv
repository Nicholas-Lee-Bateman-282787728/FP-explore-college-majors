8164120,5,6303020127,"Ok, I know some people would disagree with me but this is the best sonic vid ever. It's much better than the episodes we see today.

In this one the sloths annoy you to no end by moving ssssoooo ssssllllloooowwwwllllyyyy. Heck they even talk slowly (i have no idea how the actors put up with it). Sonic gets hit with Robonik's new toy and becomes as slow as the sloths and ends up getting captured. Tails comes up with a scientific solution and he and the sloths bust sonic out of the prison.

I don't remember much about the second one because i watched the first one so much. We lost the vid when i was 8 and haven't found it since. But... This is one vid no sonic fan should be without.",1099094400,,689,4.172932330827067
8164121,5,6303020127,"This particular video has a mix of good and bad. The episode ""Over the Hill Hero"" is well-written and contains some wonderful dramatic moments. Sonic meets Captain Rescue - an overweight, retired super hero - who gets in his way while trying to help, so Sonic is horribly mean to him. In the end though, it's Captain Rescue who comes to save Sonic from Robotnik! It also has some hilarious moments and is worth watching again and again.
""Slowwww Going"" however was not so well-liked. As it's name implies the action is really slow and so are some of the characters dialogue. As a young child I was irratated by the Sloth family's really.... slow... lines... that seemed to drag out the minutes. Sonic and Tails meet the Sloth Family who they protect from Robotnik. But Robotnik has made a weapon that will slow Sonic down so the SSSSS Squad (Scratch and Grounder) can capture him. Unfortunately, they succeed and capture him, so it's up to Tails and the slowwww sloths to save him. The action picks up from there and the rest is really fast-paced.
As an adult watching this again, the sloths are hilarious and I still love all the jokes. This is also the episode where Tails reveals in a cute joke that he's only four and a half years old.
I would buy the video just for the Over-the-Hill Hero episode, but it is a must for AoStH fans.
One more note: Yes, the animation is NOT like Sat-Am, but you have to keep in mind that Sat-AM is a drama and this is a comedy, so of course the styles of animation will be different.",1064102400,,1519,4.428571428571429
8164122,4,6303020127,"Featuring two episodes from one of the two Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series (this one features the Syndicated version, the other was part of ABC's daytime lineup), the tape includes ""Slowwww Going"" and ""Over the Hill Hero"". They may not be episodes from the best cartoons, but they are adequate with animated slapstick and groaner puns. References to the Sonic video games and music based on the games also brings a smile.",1008374400,,423,4.888888888888889
