5161551,4,B008H45T7K,"This is a very high energy, easy to follow DVD. It really gets your heart rate up and I a full body workout.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1374278400,,138,3.9285714285714284
5161552,3,B008H45T7K,"I love Cathe videoas, however, I expected this one to be a bit more challenging, but it disappointed me in that respect.  I am an advanced level exerciser and runner and wanted to try this out to mix up my fitness routine. Did not get my heart rate up enough, and frankly, just found this a bit too easy.  Not a bad DVD at all, but maybe better for beginner or intermediate levels.  The moves are varying and it is not a boring DVD, and she uses lots of different equipment.",1364169600,3,474,4.186813186813187
5161553,3,B008H45T7K,"The exercises in the video are okay (some are quite challenging), but the amount of time spent doing nothing between exercises is considerable.  I found that just as I was getting my heartrate where I wanted it, it was time to stop, take a breather, and change equipment.  Very frustrating as I was hoiping this would be more of an aerobic workout.",1363564800,2,348,4.596774193548387
5161554,5,B008H45T7K,"This is one of my favorites along with ""to the max"". I won't break down the workout as others have done that but it's a good mix of tabata, HIIT, and strength.

It's excellent at keeping your heart rate up but is manageable. Cathe's instruction is good and motivating. I would say it's suitable for intermediate to advanced exercisers. My sister did it with me and she's decently fit but doesn't work out regularly and found it ok, and took breaks where she needed, substituted jumping jacks for some moves etc. The point being to get started, keep moving and build up to it. Things can be modified quite easily. I've been doing it for some months now, once a week or so and find I'm still getting a great workout every time, lots of sweat and feel great afterwards!

The music is better than some other Cathe workouts, like the low impact series, which I appreciate.

As others have mentioned, I don't care for the bonus core as it's too hard on my wrists.

Don't worry too much about the equipment required, as long as you have some dumbbells, everything else isn't really necessary to get a good workout. Paper plates can be used instead of gliding disks and although I now have the firewalker bands, I used to do it without and get a good workout. Cathe's DVDs sometimes appear to have a frightening amount of equipment but a lot of it isn't essential.

All in all, one of my favorite exercise DVDs!",1362009600,16,1403,4.486274509803922
5161555,5,B008H45T7K,I love this dvd.  Excellent cardio intervals to really step up my routine when exercising at home.  I love that there are various pre-mixes so you can work out as little as 20 min or as much as an hour.  You can even create your own workouts.  Great 20 second intervals that get right to the point.  Keep in mind you do need to purchase the sliding discs and the exercise bands to use this dvd.,1359504000,3,394,4.131578947368421
5161556,5,B008H45T7K,"This DVD is supercharged!  If you want a tough, long (entire workout with warm up and cool down is 55 minutes) cardio workout, with some strength moves( you'll need, 3, 5, 10 and one 15lb. weight), high variety, with modern, fast paced, fun music then this is for you.  Cathe's dvd's are always tough, but I have not always enjoyed the music on her dvd's.  But the music on this one is fantastic.  The workout is so tough it does have a little bit of a dread factor to it but I remember the fun music and it makes me push play.  I love all the premixes too! I would have given it 4.5 stars if possible only because I didn't like the first core bonus exercise.  It was tough on my wrists.",1358380800,4,687,4.12781954887218
5161557,5,B008H45T7K,"This is an amazing workout. Great for anyone who is looking to really sweat and get in shape fast. At first you think it's not going to be as tough as you want, but once you start, you will be surprised at how fast it tires you out. Love it!",1357776000,7,241,3.84
5161558,5,B008H45T7K,"I have not felt the love for cardio in while.  Maybe it's because I've been nursing some injuries or because I'm burnt out.  Well, after doing this DVD, the love is back!  Cathe has created a definite winner with CrossFire.

The workout breakdown:

Warm up---6:30
CrossFire Fitness Blast---8:50
Firewalker Tabata---4:55
CrossFire Circuit Blast---22:45
CrossFire Plyo Tabata---5:20
Stretch---6:45
Bonus Core---9:10
Bonus Low Impact Cardio Tabata---4:40

The equipment you'll need:

Firewalker loop
Pairs of 3, 5, 8 and 10 pound dumbbells
One 15 pound dumbbell
Set of slide and glide discs
Tubing for use as a marker.

CrossFire is non-stop cardio; you'll do tabatas, plyometrics, and circuit training.  A step is not used in this workout.  In case you're not familiar with tabata training, it's 20 seconds of high intensity cardio, followed by 10 seconds of rest.  This pattern is repeated.  Tabata workouts typically last about 20 minutes.

Why I love, love, love this workout:

**The variety of cardio exercises from circuit training to plyometrics to tabatas.  There were several places that I was ""talking back"" to Miss Cathe (and I was not saying nice things....), but before I knew it, that particular torture, I mean workout section, was over and we were on to something new.

**The Firewalker tabata that combines the infamous firewalkers with plyometrics.  All I can say is ouch!  (In a good way.)

**Yes, Cathe does it all high impact.  I didn't and my heart rate was still up at the high end of my aerobic range.  I am an advanced exerciser and I am delighted to find a tough workout that really challenges me without stressing my joints.

**The fast-paced music.  The music in this workout helped me get through the tough sections.  Usually, I don't care for Cathe's taste in music, but the music here has a driving beat.

**The variety of premixes.  There is something for everyone.  I love working out for 60-75 minutes a day and by doing this workout, plus the two bonus sections (core and low impact cardio tabata), the workout came in at about 70 minutes.  Most of the premixes are shorter and are various combinations of the workout sections. So those who want shorter but really intense workouts can do so.

**The premix mixtures.  By doing shorter workouts, you can really give it your all during the super high intensity sections, but not be totally exhausted at the end of your workout.

**Cathe's mention of modifications for a lot of the exercises.  Cathe was especially thorough in giving alternative movements.

A few things to note about this workout:

**This is not a workout for beginners. Even though Cathe gives lots of modification suggestions throughout the workout, it's still a tough routine.  Beginners may just get frustrated and not want to do the workout.  Heck, I'm an advanced exerciser and I feel that I have room to grow with this workout.

**For most of the core work, you're on your wrists doing supine planks, side planks etc.  If you have wrist issues, this may not be the core workout for you.  Cathe kept mentioning that your wrists will get stronger with these exercises, but I could only see how they might aggravate your wrists.

In spite of this, I really loved this workout and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to spice up their cardio routines.",1341360000,46,3303,4.881081081081081
5161559,5,B008H45T7K,I have been doing Cathe Fredrick DVDs for years.  This DVD was amazing.  My butt is still sore......in a good sore way!!,1418774400,,120,4.409090909090909

5161561,5,B008H45T7K,"Cathe really does not play around.  I'm a solid intermediate, have been doing this video on/off for well over a year and STILL I, quiver, lol no really, I still grunt through some of the reps and sometimes I flat out can't make it through the entire set.  I'm not going to go through the entire video, others have done that but I will say I feel like if there's any dvd in my collection to take me to the next level, it would be this one.  My consistency historically has been more the problem than this program failing to work.

I like that this dvd uses less equipment than most of her others.  She's one of my favorites.  This dvd gives an outstanding total body workout that will be felt the next day.",1406160000,6,705,4.223880597014926
5161562,4,B008H45T7K,"This workout is great because you can adjust it to your schedule, whether you're short on time or want to complete the entire set, etc. I love the options of creating your own workout with the ""premixes"" and though they are short sections, they still provide a good workout.",1405555200,,274,4.612244897959184

5161564,5,B008H45T7K,"I have done this workout countless times, on those days when I feel I need an extra hard cardio push.  It is one of the toughest workouts I've ever done!  Lots of plyo work, and the breaks fly by so fast.  My heart rate skyrockets during this workout.  Some days I've had to pause the DVD between the sections to catch my breath.  I will keep coming back to this one again and again!  Definitely for advanced exercisers.",1400025600,,420,4.32051282051282
5161565,5,B008H45T7K,"I was unsure whether I should buy this because I was never a big fan of Cathe's workouts,due to the fact that they were so long&punishing and seemed to use a lot of ecquipment-I don't have a big workout area and felt that I was tripping over all the gadgets I'd need for her workouts!!I really enjoyed her Low Impact Hiit dvd and this seemed to have similar music and energy so I thought I'd give it a try. It is so much fun and like Low Impact Hiit,I love that there are so many options to mix and match segments or do 1 short,high energy segment when I want to fit in a quick workout but still want to feel like I accomplished something. I am so glad I took a chance on this one! I also enjoyed her new Great Glutes&Flextrain dvds. Many of her older dvds I sold,because they just had serious dread factor. I think she has gotten better with workouts that are challenging,yet fun.",1393977600,,881,4.218934911242603
5161566,5,B008H45T7K,This is a grueling workout if you do the whole thing through. I like the premixes. The music is better than my other dvds,1390521600,,121,4.083333333333333

5161568,5,B008H45T7K,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,2,155,4.777777777777778

8527929,5,B008H45T7K,"As I have mentioned in other reviews, I am a long time ""Cathlete"" and have worked out to her DVDs for over 10 years, as well as others such as Insanity and Turbofire. This is some intense cardio that will leave you breathless and feeling as though your entire body has been worked! I did this one today (for the 2nd time ever) after her Slow and Heavy Chest and Back workout. Probably not the smartest of ideas, as I was completely spent afterwards and will likely be sore, sore, sore tomorrow. :-)

For almost an hour, you will work out using various and proven techniques including HIIT, tabata (20 seconds of high intensity followed by 10 seconds of rest), and metabolic conditioning (cardio which incorporates light/moderate weights for added intensity and muscle toning). There is a variety of equipment used but you could get by without some of it. I would, however, highly recommend the firewalker band (simple round rubber fitness band) as it really works the adductors and abductors while getting your heart pumping!

Using my Suunto HR monitor, it showed that I burned almost 500 calories with Crossfire today. Not too shabby! It is fun, fast-paced, and effective. Also really enjoyed the music on this one. I am confident that consistent use will render great results. Definitely a keeper and one that will be in my weekly rotation! Thanks for another fantastic workout, Cathe!",1482883200,4,1388,4.852320675105485

8527931,5,B008H45T7K,"What a Nice Change from my other Exercise DVDs.  I have purchased 50 or more and just recently tried Cathe Friedrich.  I am probably intermediate-advanced in my exercise ability and find her routines challenging but do able.  I have deleted alot of my previous purchased from Jillian Michaels (although some of hers I really like) because they are just too disorganized with what I would call bizarre movements. Killer Body and Extreme Shed and Shred are examples.  Bob Harper is so boring!  He has such long segments of the same exercise it is torture!  I like Amy Dixon's Breathless Body series but others she has produced are too easy.  Cathe keeps me motivated and I love, love, love the short fast moving segments.  Never boring and really challenging.  She does require more equipment than others but it is easy to substitute.  I don't use the slide and glide disks and can perform all the movements without them.  I did purchase the exercise leg bands from Amazon (not her Firewalker band) and find that a good addition to the workout. I use a Garmin and Cardiac monitor and burn more calories with her workouts than others that seem harder to do.  Plan to add more of her DVDs!",1459555200,8,1185,4.671497584541063
