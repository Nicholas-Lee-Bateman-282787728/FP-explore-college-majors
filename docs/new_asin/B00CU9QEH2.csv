5741801,4,B00CU9QEH2,"It has been very long time since the last Gundam setting in UC universe. this series is living up to its expectation. I have already finished the novel. I must say the first episode felt kind of rushed on the story line, but it is still very good. if you can read Japanese, it is highly recommended to read it before watch the anime. for the anime itself, i will give it 5 stars.

I gave it a four stars because compared to the release in other area (Japan, Taiwan). there is no ""extra"" in the package. Japan and Taiwan version has an outside cover, and there is a 15 page booklet. US version? nothing.....",1268611200,,606,4.269565217391304
5741802,4,B00CU9QEH2,"I have been watching Gundam since Mobile Suit Gundam came out and this series like the original takes place in Universal Century. However if you are new to Gundam I wouldn't start with this series which is sad to say.

The positives are really positive. I have never seen an anime more polished than Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn period. It's like the art pops out at you with amazing color and animation. The movement of the mobile suits really sucks you in like you're on the battlefield. You get longer episodes it appears and it has more than enough story and action to keep you wanting more. However that's just the problem.

The negative is that this series is being released one episode at a time. 57 minutes of viewing pleasure, but the price of the average full length movie and a little extra. Also episode two isn't around the corner it's a few months away. Worldwide releases for the DVD and Blu-Ray, but you won't want to watch it in anything less than HD.

So what about extras, well you will get them as long as you have a Blu-Ray player connected to the internet. All the extras are accessed through BD-Live. So techniquelly it has the potential for plenty of extras, but you may have to wait as not much is up already and once again without an internet connection you are out of luck.

For fans this is more than likely worth every penny. It takes place after the events of Char's Counterattack and is not a side story like many of the Gundam's previously released in the U.S. Bright has already been mentioned, so my assumption is he's going to make an appearence in the series before long. They've also mentioned the main character's Haro is an exact replica of an Ace Pilot from the war.

Other than that I really don't want to give away much of the story, but it has the normal Gundam series of events. As me and my friends say, ""Welcome to Gundam"". Your friends at school got killed in a new war that just happened to be in or around your colony, ""Welcome to Gundam"". You're a teenager who has a difficult home life or your a troubled child who is now piloting a mobile suit, ""Welcome to Gundam"". Anyway this happens in pretty much every Gundam series. It's kind of funny and a little sad, but it's true. Of course there are exceptions, but this is what you can expect.

So I say it's geared to the fans who want a Gundam experience unlike any other. My guess is the distance between episodes is the fact that it probably takes months to even finish one episode seeing as how it's like it's own movie. So you will get animation and the feel of something that takes that long to make. The characters and story even flow in seemless motion sucking you right in from start to finish.

To be honost this is probably an expensive project and you pay for it. For fans like me I'm sure that initial fee was or is worth it. I did take off one star for the set-up, but I do believe they have valid reasons as to why. So if you have been with Gundam for awhile I really recommend it or if not try to find Mobile Suit Gundam which is actually kind of difficult.

With this release I can only hope Bandai of America releases ZZ Gundam in the U.S. I have a feeling we will run into characters from all through out U.C. which means Judua could likely make an appearance.",1268438400,41,3275,4.339869281045751
5741803,4,B00CU9QEH2,"Finally Gundam has returned to it's best and truest form, the Universal Century, aside from the CG stuff a few years back that was terrible the UC has been missing for some time.  Taking place three years after Char's Counterattack, Gundam Unicorn returns to good traditional animation that manages to blend the new and the old perfectly, way better than I thought.  Gundam Seed and Gundam 00 where not my cup of tea, in fact Gundam 00 was one of the worst things I ever saw not only in Gundam but anime.  00 was full of fan service(something that does not belong in Gundam), lazy animation and a stupid plot that was nothing short of boring.  But alas, Gundam Unicorn has made be welcome the name Gundam with a smile again instead of a cringe after the Seed/00 years.  The action is perfect, visuals amazing and granted it is a set up story but it left me wanting more.  If you are a new Gundam fan wanting to connect to the REAL Gundam then this is a bad place to start, but the show did give some backstory to other series that can help.  As to the old Gundam fans well I have been one for over ten years and I think this is a welcome story to the UC.  I gave this a 4 out of 5 because there is only one ep on this expensive blu-ray and there are no special features on the disk, you have to have a player that connects to the net I think.  So once more Gundam has been revived and I hope this series will continue well and generate more interest into the UC for more series.",1268438400,3,1478,4.157894736842105

It's a bit pricey for just one episode though, but I'll give this one a chance. Depending on what I see in the next will make my final decision on the full worth.",1268352000,,281,4.222222222222222
5741805,5,B00CU9QEH2,"This is the latest addition to the Universal Century, the original universe of Gundam. The animation is amazing, created for a BD release.

However, this is a sequel to several series. To enjoy the true value of Unicorn you should first watch Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam & Char's Counterattack. They are being streamed for free on the internet from Spring of 2010 to the end of the summer, so google it so you can be fully prepared to watch this awesome OVA.",1268006400,6,462,4.566265060240964
5741806,5,B00CU9QEH2,"I've been a Gundam fan for almost 10 years now, and have spent more money on the DVDs (and no Blu-Ray) and models than I care to even try and think about.  That being said, I'm NOT one of those fans that goes ""it's Gundam, it must be good!""  I try and weigh each and every item I buy on it's own merits - even though my first Gundam series was G and Wing, those are the two series I like the least (in fact, I don't like them at all... )

Having been disappointed by the lack of Blu-Ray release for Gundam 00, I was very VERY excited when I found the BR release for Unicorn.  I've really enjoyed the mech designs for the model kits so far, and have been looking forward to the BR release of the anime.  While having one hour-long episode per disc is a bit of an expensive purchase (the only ones more expensive in the Gundam universe were the MS Igloo releases, at $50 apiece, and that was just for DVDs) I believe the high production values more than make up for it.

What we have on the disc is a true masterpiece.  The visuals are stunning (and unlike some of the other Gundam releases - looking at Seed and 00 here, they don't fly by so fast you have to rewind and watch again to make sure of what happened), absolutely gorgeous, more of an updated First Gundam than anything (which is as it should be).  Sound quality is vibrant and balanced, the special effects for the pewpew of the lasers were not tinny; every aural sensation possible on film sucks you in and is absolutely pleasing.  And I've only watched it with the English 2.0 audio so far... I'm really looking forward to the 5.1.  The music as well is very enjoyable.  There are quite a few orchestral pieces that had me wanting to watch over and over again just to hear some of the highlights of the music.

I won't get into the story too much, because I don't want to give away plot points and spoilers.  It's Gundam, and if you're reading this I expect that you've at least watched some Gundam before.  While it somewhat seems to stick true to the formula, it's going to be hard to tell for sure after just an hour viewing...  The subsequent releases will give us a better idea of what's in store.  If you liked the character designs from Zeta, then you'll like this.  The main character, Benegher, is like a not-nearly-as-annoying version of Kamille Bidan (from Zeta), and even looks a bit like him.  The female characters have similar designs to those found in Zeta as well.  The mech designs are amazing, Kshatriya really made me fear for me life (even though I know it is just an animated video). All of the mechs are very well detailed and the animation is very realistic.

Is this a worthwhile purchase?  I would say without a doubt.  Even non-Gundam fans who like anime in general might really enjoy this.  I really hope that the next episodes aren't too far off",1267833600,31,2837,4.331439393939394
5741807,5,B00CU9QEH2,"i just watched the first episode on the internet and as soon as i was finished i went online to pre order it that's how god it is.

If your a fan of the gundam universe then i recommend this dvd to you.",1266969600,15,337,3.869565217391304

The soundtrack and animation are top notch and what any Gundam series truly deserves.

5741823,5,B00CU9QEH2,"This is a beautiful Gundam ova series, it looks absolutely fantastic on blu-ray, so crisp and clear and colorful you will be gawking at certain scenes on your HD television.

Problem is at nearly $60 for a single 50 minute epidsode, most people won't pay that amount, so Bandai  missed the boat big time by being greedy.

But the sad news is the Bandai Entertainment which was the distributor for these blu-rays announced that the are no longer producing dvds and blu-rays this year, so I would recommend picking up these blu-rays as quickly as possible, as they surely will become collector's items in the future.",1326499200,,614,4.773584905660377
5741824,5,B00CU9QEH2,"The picture quality, the music that they composed for this ova was breath taking. Didn't know it was the story continued after ""Char's Counterattack"" so I jumped on it as soon as I found out. Like I mentioned two sentence ago, what really took my heart away was the music. Whenever I re-watch the ova, first thing I do is go back to the scene to listen to the music that plays in the back and then watch the entire ova. Every time I listen to it I get that goosebumps all throughout my body.

There's been controversy that some people don't like the story line and all, but in my opinion I didn't think this and the rest of the ova was that bad. Because all the curiosity was built in my mind what happened after Char's Counterattack.

So before buying it, be sure to check out the trailer and maybe ask a friend or two what they thought of it. THEN consider buying.",1312761600,,866,4.242424242424242
5741825,5,B00CU9QEH2,"This movie/episode is fantastic on Blu Ray.  If you are a fan of Gundam UC then you need to see this.  If you can, try to watch the Blu Ray version.  There is so much detail that is missed when watching the online stream versions.  The animation and sounds are almost designed for high definition.  The battle scene between the Kashatria and the souped up Jegan is breathtaking and the most high production and technically animated Gundam battle to date.  The film in this format is a real treat to watch.  I don't mind spending the extra $$ if it significantly changes the experience for the viewer... in this case it really does.  The English dub is surprisingly good and the sub titles are not bad either.",1311984000,,708,4.519685039370079
5741826,5,B00CU9QEH2,"Gundam fans were elated to hear that the new Gundam OVA, Gundam Unicorn, would be released in America at the same time as its Japanese release. But for those without Blu-Ray players, the wait would be a very long one, as the simultaneous release would only be for the Blu-Ray and Playstation Network, not for DVD. And now finally, patient Gundam fans without Blu-Ray players have been rewarded and rewarded very well with this excellent, albeit way too long coming, DVD.

This video is only one disk containing the first two hour long episodes. The packaging is fantastic, featuring a reversible cover with both Blu-Ray covers on either side. Sadly there are no inserts, but that has become common with Bandai as of late. The content of the disk is the real meat of this set anyway.

Both episodes look fantastic in standard definition. As I haven't watched it in Hi-def, I can't compare but I can say that the show look absolutely amazing from beginning to end. The story is very well told and roots itself firmly in the cannon of 80's Gundam. Fans of the classic Gundam shows will find plenty to love in the story, along with the great mobile suit battles and the very 80's looking characters. This series feel like a natural continuation of classic Gundam, rather than a random story that was shoved in to sell more model kits. There's very little I can say that's bad about the show itself. Everything is tight and both the English and Japanese versions are very tightly cast and well acted.

The closest thing I have to a complaint are the extras. The character and mech highlights are excellent, but the vast majority of the extras are promos for episode 1 and even a recap of episode 1, the first thing contained on the disk. There's nothing on the disk related to episode 2, which was a bummer, but overall, this is a great purchase and I'm glad to see this show finally both at an affordable price and on a format that more people have access to.",1309132800,18,1955,4.564102564102564
5741827,4,B00CU9QEH2,"Gundam fans these days can almost be divided into two camps: UC-era and nonUC-era aka 'alternate universe' fans.

Gundam Unicorn marks a glorious return to the original 'Universal Century' calendar storyling that started the whole Gundam saga in the first place.

Created in celebration of Gundam's 30th Anniversary, this new show is based on a series of recently published novels that reunites several famous Gundam creative staff almost like a celebrity rock supergroup.

Story takes place in UC 0096, about 3 years after the events of Gundam: Char's Counterattack, and is a nice change from the 'earthnoids' vs 'spacenoids' conflict that seems to dominate most of UC Gundam storylines.  Instead it is more of a mystery story beginning as far back as the inauguration of the UC calendar, starting with a tragedy that kicks off UC 0001 and now 92 years later, leads up to the search of an object known as 'LaPlace's box' which can threaten to undo the Earth Federation govt as we know it.  Mixed up in all this is a new teenage hero named Banhager Links who like his predecessors, is thrown into the middle of a conflict he doesn't understand and finds himself to be the unwilling pilot of the title mecha.

Animation is gorgeous and while done with modern CG techniques, keeps a lot of the handdrawn feel of Gundam series from the 80s and 90s, but done in stunning HD.  The intricate story is written by novelist Harutoshi Fukui who is a best selling novelist in Japan of the status of Michael Crichton.  Character designs and mecha designs are provided by Gundam greats Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and Hajime Katoki.

Without giving too much away, this is a fantastic new chapter to the Gundam Saga and due to its novel-like intricate plot, very little is actually revealed in this first ep (out of a projected 10) but grabs you with engaging action, visuals and the return of some very familiar characters.  Newer younger Gundam fans used to the flash and glitz of series like Gundam Seed or Wing may find this series hard to get into, but fans of the U.C. series will be blown away.",1299974400,2,2078,4.731301939058172
5741828,4,B00CU9QEH2,"First off, I'm going to go off in two tangents so please bear with me...

First off the show is fantastic, love the story, classic Gundam formula.  The main character is extremely likable, unlike previous Universal Century characters such as every character (minus Amuro, Char, and Noah Bright) in Gundam Zeta.  Whine, whine, blah blah I hate you all type attitudes either annoy or aggravate me to no end. but the characters here, as I stated previously are extremely likable.  The mobile suits are nicely done as well, unlike Gundam Zeta (i seem to be beating a dead horse here so sorry) which lacked any creativity.  Anyway, The animation is top notch, unlike recent Gundams which exhibit a, how you say, a rather cheap appearance (Gundam Seed, Gundam Seed Destiny, & Gundam 00).  Also, as far as I've seen, Gundam unicorn does NOT seem to exhibit the ""kill em' all"" mentality that has plagued the Gundam universe.  Gundam Zeta (yes yes I'm sorry but the facts speak for themselves, dang near every main character dies...seriously, look it up or dare I say watch it if you don't believe me), Gundam Victory wasn't good to begin with but killing dang near everybody sealed the deal with a poor reception, Char's Counterattack seemed to exhibit it as well but not as bad as say Gundam Zeta.

Here's the downside of this amazing series.  It's currently only available on Blu-Ray, it's not the end of the world or anything but almost 50 bucks a pop and for only 1, yes count them ONE episode spanning just shy of an hour.  Lame in my mind, so I see that this series might not be for the feint of heart.  But being a fanatical Gundam fan I swallowed my pride, laid my money down and was still very happy...

So lets sum it up shall we:

Pros:
  1. Awesome Universal Century story
  2. Fantastic animation
  3. Likable characters
  4. Does not seem to exhibit the ""kill em'all"" mentality exhibited in previous Gundam series

Cons:
  1. Close to $50.00 per disc for one 50 minute episode
  2. Only available on Blu-Ray at the current time
  3. Release of each episode is so far apart from one another.  2 episodes in the span of a year?

So, in conclusion, I would only suggest the most loyal of Gundam fans to take part in this series.  In the end I feel Bandai is merely giving the Gundam fans in North American the finger, but that's just one otaku's feelings.",1297728000,,2358,4.529691211401425

5741832,3,B00CU9QEH2,"Outstanding we have Gundam on Blu-Ray,
Well not exactly this is a new Gundam OVA and it is released on Blu-Ray and it has an Outstanding Story line, well thought out characters and very cool mecha designs. However with all of the great things going for this series it still is a Bandai America Crap release. Meaning Instead of giving the Gundam fans here in the US and the rest of North America the same quality as our Japanese counterparts they give us a sub par release. It may even be priced the same ( although reality is the Japanese version which is in the same Blu-Ray region is about $20.00 more) but there are jumps in quality in comparison between the 2 releases mostly in the accuracy of the colors ( meaning that the colors on a vibrant or high end HD set will appear washed out if you set your TV to a SD or darker setting it isn't as noticeable on The US release). Now that being said the quality of this Blu-Ray VS the other 2 Blu-Ray offerings ( Escaflownea & Eureka Seven ) does use a higher bit rate to remove pixelation but fails in color accuracy. In the Japanese version the colors do not looked as washed out as they do in the US release in fact the few defects that are in the US Release are no where to found in the Japanese Release. Now this is a better Blu-ray release then Bandai's other Blu-ray to the US market but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

Note my review here is a comparison between the Blu-ray release in the US and in the Japanese market if you want a really thorough review of just the US Blu-Ray edition I would suggest you check out [...] review.

Having literally watched every single Gundam title ever created I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, this is by far the ultimate, and I'm not just saying that because I love the Gundam franchise. The story progresses quickly into the main plot and while easy to follow at first, takes you for a few surprises. The characters are very well implemented and their personalities accurate. This really is not quite the same story as all the other Gundam titles although the generic mecha-war type plot will surely develop although probably not a very large scale at first if I am correct.

Blu-ray. This is the first ever Gundam title to be completely rendered in 1080p with the matching TrueHD and Dolby encoding which further compliments the orchestral pieces chosen for the film. Stunning from the minute you see first light of the beginning. The quality is simply amazing and this title is truly something special for all Gundam fans and Anime fans in general. This is the type of anime to be enjoyed on a big screen TV in HD with the surround sound on and kicking. Sound effects are brilliant; video is absolutely out-of-this-world! I won't give away the plot, although I know this will be one of my all-time favorites for many many years to come.

It makes you wander how the next dvd is going to be. The story line is also pretty good. I would tell anyone to get this gundam anime and start getting the whole series. It would worth it.",1270425600,,320,4.095238095238095
5741838,5,B00CU9QEH2,"First off, I am a Universal Century grognard. My first foray into the Gundam universe(s) was with 0083, followed by 0080, then Zeta Gundam, and so on and so forth. The UC universe has a special place in my heart, invoking what I loved about not only mecha anime, but specifically what I loved about anime in the 80's! Superb story-lines, memorable characters, classic hand-drawn designs, and the unique ""shades of grey"" approach towards war is what made the Universal Century an entertainment gold mine that I am proud to be a fan of.

That being said, Gundam Unicorn brings back those qualities and invokes the feel of the Universal Century perfectly. The characters are rich and interesting, from the protagonist Banagher, who blends the characters of Amuro Ray and Kamille Bidan without the childish angst, to the antagonist mobile suit ace Marida Cruz, who successfully combines mysterious with menacing. The series itself takes place in UC 0096, three years after Char Aznable's Neo-Zeon uprising, and the Earth Sphere is still reeling from the aftereffects. Another Neo-Zeon movement, known as ""the Sleeves"" are attempting to procure the Box of Laplace, an item/concept that represents the support pillar of the entire Universal Century. Fans of previous series will be delighted at the numerous references to previous series, and even the politics which pertain specifically to this universe.

The animation is fluid and colorful with the classic style (of the same character artist as the original series, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko) of the earlier Gundam series, the battles are vivid and dynamic, and the soundtrack is beautiful and inspiring. This isn't the frantic and overly complicated style of Gundam SEED and its sequel series, SEED Destiny, or the sentai heroes theme of Gundam 00. This is your father's Gundam series: classic, nostalgic but clean and polished for the next generation. Check it out!",1270166400,,1908,5.171521035598706
5741839,4,B00CU9QEH2,"This was a good start to the OVA, many of the action scenes and other visuals were really done well. A complaint about the OVA is that it can be hard for first time Gundam watcher to get into. Some of the characters and backstory are introduced in the previous series, which they reference to. Their is only a couple reasons why this product is getting a 4 and not a 5. For a $50 msrp I expect more extras than a couple of previews for the episode I already own. Another thing that bothered me was the non translation on the mobile suit extra.",1269388800,,543,4.180952380952381
5741840,5,B00CU9QEH2,"I have been a UC universe Gundam fan ever since it first appeared back in 1979.  I am so glad that after all these years since V Gundam, that Bandai/Sunrise has returned to this storyline.  Through the past several years of Seed, Seed Destiny, 00, I was picturing how wonderful it will be to have the quality of animation and action sequences be implemented in the UC universe.  The Zeta Trilogy gave a glimpse of it through the new added animation.  One of the reviewer said that the animation looked very 80's.  I don't think he meant the quality of the animation, but more of the character design/look...it isn't as much of a ""pretty boy"" series here...it is back to the original character designer Yasuhiko's work.  The animation character execution does look more like that of ""Arion"" than ""Crusher Joe""...which I wished it was the latter.

This 50 minute first of six episodes just wasn't enough (we don't even get to see Full Frontal, the second coming of Char)...but every story has to have a beginning somewhere.  I have tried to look for synopsis of the Gundam UC novels, but could not find any....so I don't know if past characters from previous series will make an appearance.  However, I hope the writers do what the writers did for ""Star Trek"" and please the faithful UC Gundam fans...especially having characters from original Gundam (who hasn't died off like Sayla), Zeta Gundam (probably just Kamille and Fa, Double Zeta (I don't want him back per se, unless the comedy aspects are gone...or maybe Jude grew up), 0080 (Christina/Alfred), 0083 (like Kou), show up and intertwined in the story line somehow.  But this is probably wishful thinking.  However, one Zeta and Double Zeta character has already appeared in this first volume....do you know who?  This character knows Char and Haman Karn.  Another character that has appeared is related to a major character in Double Zeta.

As for Zeta timeline, will the writers use the TV series or the Movie ending as its base...is Kamille a vegetable (not too much of a vegetable since he was running on the beach in ZZ) or not.  He is one character I would love to see reappear with a semi-major role.

The picture quality is great on Blu-ray.  I hope the sales and popularity is good enough that Bandai will continue to have its worldwide release for the remainder of the series.  Very much looking forward to see where the story goes...but hating the fact that it takes like 6 months for an episode...which means 3 years before we see the ending.  I hope Bandai will release, at least, the Zeta Trilogy Movies on Blu-ray (I doubt they will spend the money to re-release the TV series on Blu-ray).",1269302400,,2661,4.720779220779221

5741842,5,B00CU9QEH2,"I have not been this excited over a new anime series in years.

The production value is excellent and hits on all points.  The animation and music are feature quality, and masterfully executed.  The animation in particular really jumps out.  It captures the character designs and style that Yaz made famous all those years ago, and combines it with a fluidity of movement that is mesmerizing.  The real charm of excellent animation is the way it can take ordinary movements and make them fascinating.  Hair movement takes on an almost balletic quality in this feature, and got almost as much attention from me as the incredible mobile suit combat animation.  The music perfectly sets the mood and tempo of the story, and has been in my head ever since I first watched it.

The production quality only forms half of my favorable opinion however.  One of the great joys in Unicorn lies in the universe itself.  I have been a Gundam fan for years, and have been yearning for more Universal Century material for some time now.  The manga, ""Gundam the Origin"" (still running in Japan) has done an astounding job of updating the original Mobile Suit Gundam story, which is every bit as fleshed out and detailed as any of the great science fiction or fantasy worlds of our time.  Unicorn taps into that deep and detailed history.  While it follows some of the traditional Gundam clichs, it manages to make them seem fresh and exciting through strong dramatic execution, and reinforces the idea that there is an almost cyclical elment to the events in Gundam.  Unicorn should be fun for anyone, but it is a must for those interested in the U.C. timeline and its characters.  This is the beating heart of Gundam!

I will close with one last note on the price and package.  This is an international region-free release.  It may seem quite expensive, but considering we are getting this at the same time as it is released in Japan, it is understandable that we will be paying something close to Japanese prices.  I am perfectly fine with that.  The disk is no-frills.  It has the feature on it, numerous audio and language options, and that is all.  Considering the quality of the feature, for me, this is more than enough.",1269216000,,2212,4.6909090909090905
5741843,5,B00CU9QEH2,"This is beyond five stars!

Considering this is not Yoshiyuki Tomino's original work, it is extremely well done in terms of story line.  It is a shame that most of the UC timeline Gundam was created with low budget.  I only wish the Zeta Gundam trilogy was made with 100% new animation like this.

The animation is superb and the battle sequence is the best in all of the Gundam series (Similar to the new animation found in the Zeta Gundam Trilogy), they really have the mobile suits down!  The script is faithfully written with many references to the prior UC century story line and this may very well be the final chapter of the original Gundam with couple of carry over characters.  Sorry, F91!

You need to watch this OVA, even if you're not a Gundam fan.  You will love it just for the fact that it is so well made.  The dubbing quality is also one of the best I have seen.

Get it, you will love it!",1268956800,,906,4.276470588235294

The animation is top notch, the mechanical designs are fantastic, and the English cast isn't annoying.  A shame that this title clocks in under sixty minutes and that there are zero extras on the disc.  I would recommend watching the first three Gundam movies, Zeta Gundam, and Char's Counterattack to get some background to the universe if you aren't familiar with this series.  A must buy for any self respecting mecha fan.

If there were extra included with the disk, this would have been a five star rating.",1268870400,,656,4.8125

5741847,5,B00CU9QEH2,"If you're a Gundam fan then this is one series that you must see. The story created exposes new elements in the U.C. universe that has never before been explored as well as having some yet unrevealed tie-ins to the original Gundam. The animation in this episode was outstanding and the fight scenes were very well produced. The soundtrack for this episode is also very well done and fits perfectly into the scenes. This series is also very unique in the fact that older Gundam fans who have seen all the shows in the U.C. time-line know the events that happened before (Char's Counterattack)and after the series (F91), yet still manages to intrigue the viewer and leave them wanting more.
One drawback to this episode is that it leaves very many questions for the viewer unanswered and hopefully the later volumes flesh out the rest of the story.
The Japanese and English casts are very well chosen, this is one of the few series where I actually don't mind which language that I'm watching it in.
While U.C. Gundam fans will have a far greater appreciation of this series than more recent or non-Gundam fans, I believe that this show still delivers a good stand alone story that can still be enjoyed without seeing other Gundam shows.
For those who want a get even more out of this episode I recommend watching the original Gundam, Zeta Gundam and Gundam Char's Counterattack.

8586465,5,B00CU9QEH2,"I probably fall somewhere between the fans who think Gundam can do no wrong and and like ALL of the Gundam shows, the fans who only accept the Universal Century as Cannon, and people who think a lot of the Gundam shows are garbage. I've watched the original Mobile Suit Gundam show all the way through in English, been blown away by the original film trilogy (truly a must-see for people who don't mind a mix of old and new animation), loved Gundam Wing to death, watched Gundam 00 over and over, and even tried to slog through Turn-A-Gundam and Gundam Seed (yuck!). Right now the best non-U.C. series I've seen in year that I'm working through is Gundam X. And the best U.C. story I've seen in year is Gundam Unicorn.

I actually put off watching this one for a really long time because it was so incredibly expensive at launch. Back the you paid a king's ransom for just two episodes, and and the episodes were only coming out a few at a time (yeah, it's an OVA, but I didn't want to wait). I've lived through paying 1990's anime prices before, so I also didn't want to encourage ridiculous pricing for new anime. However, now that I have seen this show, I almost wish I had paid top dollar when it was initially released so I could have enjoyed this anime sooner.

Production Values

First of all, I have to say that the overall quality of this anime is such that I get the ""Cowboy Bebop effect"". I was watching Cowboy Bebop the other day and thinking how the creators KNEW that they were creating what would be considered a hugely popular classic. I get the same feeling watching this anime. There are famous characters from the Universal Century. There are incredible action sequences. And there is amazing dialog, music, sound mixing, and voice acting. Even the English dub is absolutely fantastic, with some of the best voice actors in the business giving it their all.

I'm watching this show on a projector and I have to say that the bass is explosive, the music riveting, and the animation gorgeous. I am extremely grateful that both 5.1 and 2.1 sound is included in both English and Japanese (5.1 sound makes the sound effects too loud and the voices too low on my stereo receiver).

Every Episode is Movie

There's been some attempts to create Gundam stories that played out like movies either in OVA form or in films created from television shows, but I can't recall any since the original trilogy that really did play out like a film in every episode with complete story arcs. I haven't gotten around to watching Gundam Origin but I only hope it's as good as this is. Like every good Gundam show or film I've seen, there's enough going on on the surface to keep you engaged, but if you can manage to follow the labyrinthine plot you'll enjoy the show even more.

I'm watching this show all the way through right now to make sure I enjoy the entire story, but if the entire series is as good as the first volume this will be a must-purchase for sure.",1488672000,,2963,4.475925925925926

I've been meaning to get the series since last year with the final release, but wasn't going to pay almost $200. I got them on DVD as well to fit the rest of the collection (all of which are DVD as well).

I absolutely LOVE Mobile Suit Gundam UC. It's one of the best two Universal Century series out of them all, with the other being 0083 Stardust Memory. The animation & soundtrack are well beyond expectation, I only wish they would redo the other UC era series with the current-age tech to give them the same level of graphical beauty as Gundam Unicorn (Not to mention it would FINALLY give ZZ Gundam & Victory Gundam a dubbed release).

HOWEVER, the reason that I rated them at only 3 Stars out of 5...

2 Day Shipping.

When I get 2 DAY shipping, I expect the order to arrive 2 days later, not 4 days Amazon...

My order was placed on Saturday, July 18th with a GUARANTEED arrival of Monday, July 20th. Yet, when I access the tracking later on it says that the guaranteed arrival is now Wednesday, July 22nd. My question; Why?
