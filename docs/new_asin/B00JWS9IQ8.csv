8654239,5,B00JWS9IQ8,"I think a lot of the bad reviews are from people that either don't like experimental cinema or don't get it. This is an experimental giallo flick. It's done so well. I think it's one of the best in the neo-giallo genre next to the short film, ""Yellow"".
Don't listen to the bad reviews if you like experimental films or giallo. Give a chance, it's SO WORTH IT.",1500768000,,359,4.294117647058823
8654240,1,B00JWS9IQ8,"This movie seemed so promising with its homage to classic giallo grainy/yellow film style of the 70's.  However, it made no sense or it could be possible that I was so bored, I fell asleep in the movie.",1462147200,,202,4.315789473684211
8654241,2,B00JWS9IQ8,"Oh how much i want to give it one star, but i have to give it a little bit of credit. The film style was spot on, the shading, the lighting was stunning, the music was well done. However, that does not make up for the one hour and six minutes of looking at an apartment, sometimes a forest, and who really cares? I like giallo films, i think they usually have a decent structure to them which also keeps you guessing. This ""movie"" however, did not, i never got interested, or involved. (I lied, i was interested for the first four minutes, then i realized the only decent thing will be the colorization of this film).  It just, wasn't good, it could have been shortened, it could have tried a little harder to convey the plot. I know, i know it's Giallo! if you are watching one, you shouldn't have things handed to you, but this felt like a point and click adventure game of old home movies.",1454630400,,892,4.27810650887574
8654242,3,B00JWS9IQ8,"i really have no idea how good this giallo homage movie might be.
I liked the trailer,  but my puter glitches badly while trying to stream Amazon features.  Problem is on me.  I'll be checking it out.",1445990400,,200,4.351351351351352
8654243,2,B00JWS9IQ8,"Looked and sounded period correct. A great soundtrack and proper cinematography. Kudos to the director on that. However, the whole 1st person point of view in a giallo is to hide the identity of the characters so you can keep guessing until the end, but you always meet and see the characters. Not so with this. No characters to suspect, no one to change your mind about, nothing but 1st person shots and flashbacks that are more art film than giallo. The upcoming Francesco film looks far more promising than this.",1442793600,,515,4.670329670329671
8654244,1,B00JWS9IQ8,Garbage no dialog shaky camera avoid it waste of money! If you want a real Giallo stick to Dario Argento movies.,1423785600,2,112,4.380952380952381

8654246,4,B00JWS9IQ8,"""Sonno Profondo isn't a spoof or an homage to the giallo genre it is a giallo film. Well, you could consider it an homage, but I would go one step further. Its not just the look or the tone that make it a giallo film, its the story (or maybe a lack of) and how the whole thing is shrouded in a mystery that will leave you guessing literally until the last minute and when everything is tied up at the end and revealed and doing so without hardly any dialogue, there is a great feeling, genuine joy, from solving the mystery and excitement to see everything come full circle.""
