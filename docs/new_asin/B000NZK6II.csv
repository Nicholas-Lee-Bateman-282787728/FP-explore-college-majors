8182466,5,B000NZK6II,"I found a Smart Bell at a second-hand store and just had to buy it, the shape begs to be picked up and used. I got this workout DVD to go with it, and I am so glad I did. I love it! I am just getting back into exercising and for years my upper back feels so tight and twisted. All day long I am trying to get the kinks out. This workout progresses from head to toe and the moves are just right to make me feel strong and that my muscles are properly placed. There are 3 parts to the DVD: warm up, the workout, and floor work. The warm up itself is a mini workout for me and I may go to just that on days I want to do other exercise and need to feel aligned again first thing in the morning. Before, I was not an avid weight trainer, everything seemed so forced and boring. The Smart Bell and this DVD make it fluid and fun.",1350172800,,823,3.7906976744186047
8182467,5,B000NZK6II,I love this video. 'm glad I have it. I'm an older woman and this is just right for me. It goes from move to move seamlessly.  I love that it is not fast or have moves that don't flow. Lisa is an Excellent instructor and I look forward doing more with my Smartbells. I say this is a 5+ video. I was able to complete it and that made me happy. Looking forward to working out again with the gang.  Just right. I can't say enough good things about this dvd.,1346716800,2,454,3.9239130434782608
