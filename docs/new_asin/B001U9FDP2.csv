3797506,5,B001U9FDP2,"I have read Starting Strength and found much value in the book.  This DVD is a great tool if you are a visual learner.  I will reference the DVD more than the book, but would recommend both.  The video/audio quality is decent, but the instruction of the athletes of different backgrounds is very helpful.  The video is over 2 hours and is an excellent value.",1249603200,5,358,4.461538461538462
3797507,5,B001U9FDP2,"The 4 lifts - squat, deadlift, bench press and overhead press are much more complex than it might seem. I was doing strength training with machines for 3 years but few months back I realized that free weights are much better. Unfortunately free weights are much more difficult but they are definitely worth it. These 4 lifts are the best exercises one can do and this DVD will teach you how to master the technique for these and ""clean"". Sure you can watch some videos over youtube (that is what I did first), but it will not teach everything. You will not regret buying this DVD.

Only thing I wish was they had covered more exercises (pull ups/chin ups, bent-over barbell row, close Grip Bench Press etc.) and explained in detail the grip (on barbell). Also some variations of these exercises would have helped. Hopefully they will update this or come up with a new DVD.",1249257600,5,872,4.589743589743589
3797508,5,B001U9FDP2,"I've all three of Mark Rippetoes products, Pratical Programming for Strength Training, Starting Strength and this very DVD and i'd say that this DVD helped me more than the books. I'm not knocking the books, SS is excellent and a must buy along with this DVD in my opinion and PP is abit more advanced but is applicable to a much wider range of lifters, athletes from many different sports.
But i sometimes get a bit lost in the details of exercises. I struggled with the Power Clean specifically for ages and am just about happy with it, my problem was i tended to over think it. Watching Rip teach the PC to old guys, girls from scratch showed me how simple it really was (jump with the barbell in hand, rather than simultanous triple extension) and just noticed that my squat could've been better from watching the DVD having thought i had it nailed before. Really recommend this DVD along with SS the book to anyone wanting to but on a bit of muscle and not waste there time at the gym (as i did for ~7yrs).",1245974400,4,1011,4.382978723404255

3797510,5,B001U9FDP2,"I bought the book about a year ago. The book was very informative. This DVD is an excellent complimentary tool to the book. Some people learn from reading books, while some learn from watching videos. I happen to be the guy who learns by watching.

The quality of the video is top notch. You can probably get bits and pieces of Mark Rippetoe's instructions on youtube, but even youtube has its limitations. This DVD is complete insofar as the topic it covers - ranging from squats to deadlifts to bench press to overhead press and to power cleans. The video shows the viewers in step-by-step method, and at different angles - on how to lift properly.

I especially recommend the DVD and book for older trainees like myself and women - people whose idea of fitness is  doing hours of mind-numbing ""cardio"" or doing useless isolation exercises on machines trying to ""tone.""

I have used Starting Strength to guide my weight training over the last eight months and it has changed my life and health tremendously.  I just got this DVD and it is awesome - compliments the book perfectly.  I read parts of Starting Strength 10-15 times, e.g., about Power clean technique, but seeing the exercise on video cleared up some remaining issues.  Very helpful seeing all ages, sizes, and levels of trainee, both men and women.  Buy the book and the DVD and you will have a master class right at home for less than my monthly gym membership fee.

At almost 2 1/2 hours, it is an absolute must for anyone who either has the book or is interested in learning how to perform the major lifts correctly. The book covers squats, deadlifts, power cleans, presses and bench press. Each segment has several people of different ages who are ""coached"" through each lift, starting from the basics and progressing from there. While the book in and of itself is fantastic, there is some truth to ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", especially in video format. Unless you are able to attend one of his certification seminars, this is the next best thing. Actually, it may be better than the seminars in that you can pause, rewind and learn at your own pace.

3797542,5,B001U9FDP2,"Starting Strength Basic Barbell Training. By Mark Rippetoe
This is a great video for anyone wanting to understand ""BASIC"" barbell training. The book is great and much more in depth, however I found the video made the book come alive. For me having both the book and the video was key to greater success. Think about trying to describe lifting technique and anatomy in written form. The video says volumes that words can't describe. For the price of going out to eat you can have textbook lifting form and much greater confidence in your heavy lifting. This is need to know if you care about proper form and injury prevention. I have used this video many times to perfect my technique and to help train my 16 yr old son in the safe, correct way to perform these movements. There is no way I would have convinced him to sit still long enough to read the book. However with a little coaching which I learned from the video we have gained almost instant understanding of some fairly difficult techniques. He has even correctly coached me and corrected my form. The video shows Rippetoe coaching Men and women of different sizes, ages, and abilities. Each person has there own flaws which he shows how to identify and correct. I am a 48 yr old firefighter. I have been lifting off and on for 20 years with no formal training. I definitely needed this book and these movements to help me increase my longevity in a demanding career. Many of my fellow firefighters have learned from this dvd as well.
 Thanks Mark. Adding this to your book was exactly what we needed to take the next step forward.",1369094400,4,1590,4.559440559440559
3797543,5,B001U9FDP2,"This is a great companion video to Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength book (I have the 2nd ed, I believe).  While I appreciate the depth and comprehensive coverage of the excercises in the book, I found the chapters quite long and I had trouble assembling all of my notes/cues on form and technique.  This video shows Rippetoe coaching a variety of lifters through the entire mechanics of the 5 major lifts.

It is a very easy way to expose them to lots of lifts from multiple angles in a very short amount of time.  It really helps the students develop the skills to see, analyze, and correct lifting errors in others. They actually develop a 'coaching eye' very quickly because they get to see different anthropometric proportions, different ages, and different types of athletes in a short amount of time.  I think watching the video is akin to 20 hours of internship in strength coaching.
The video follows the Starting Strength teaching progressions which I also believe are incredibly helpful to new coaches.  If you want to increase your strength coaching skills and you are relatively new to strength coaching you will not regret buying this DVD.",1361923200,,915,4.922077922077922

That being said, at times (particularly in the 3rd Edition) the wording can get somewhat heavy and you can get lost in the elaborations on biomechanics, anatomy, and ""human geometry"" as Rippetoe refers to it. As an earlier poster put as well, ""A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words"".

Sometimes getting lost in it, the visuals as well as watching Rip coach the lifts to Trainees over and over again (might I add they all have different builds, limb lengths and are of different ages), really works as a great companion to how REAL weightlifting is done.

The book will give you every piece of information as well as many illustrations. It will be sufficient for 95% of the people out there. There is a small niche of us who need to be physically shown how to do the lifts. That's where this DVD came in handy.

It's a 2.5 hour video broken up into five parts (the five main lifts). Rippetoe spends about a half hour per lift explaining the lifts in his own words and then having multiple students of his perform the lifts. While the perform them he gives running commentary on corrections that need to be made to form and little tips and tricks.

3797554,5,B001U9FDP2,"This is a DVD that everyone who lifts should watch, whether new or experienced. It teaches you how to properly do the five major compound lifts that build a rock-solid, freakishly strong body: the squat, bench press, standing press, deadlift, and power clean. (A ""compound lift"" is one that engages more than one muscle group. An ""isolation exercise"" is one that only engages one muscle group.)

Don't listen to the BS magazines that push fake workouts endorsed by steroid freaks that will say anything for a buck. Don't waste your time with the whole slew of Men's Health products that will have you doing ten thousand reps per week only to make no gains.

If you want to get bigger and stronger, you MUST do several if not all of the lifts explained in this DVD. Nothing builds better legs and butts than squats. The bench press is a staple chest exercise that, when combined with dumbbell presses, builds big, powerful chests. The standing press builds strong shoulders that look like cannonballs. The deadlift is one of the best overall mass building exercises, and it builds your entire back, legs, and traps. The power clean is one of the toughest lifts you can do and works just about every muscle in your body.

This DVD shows you the proper form for all these exercises in amazing detail. This is CRUCIAL because bad form can lead to injuries (but proper form will completely prevent them). Remember, heavy weight lifted with poor form is NOT worth it (while the guys doing it think the heavy weights makes them look cool, their poor form actually just makes them look like idiots).

If you lift weights, you owe it to yourself to buy and watch this DVD. Your workouts--and results--will never be the same again.

Only thing I didn't like about the dvd was the price, It should be at least half this price, if not just included with the book.",1321660800,,463,4.458823529411765

The video shows demonstration by men and women of various ages and sizes.  This allows just about anyone purchasing the video to relate to someone demonstrating the lift.

Negatives:  The video quality is average.

Conclusion:  I think this is a great purchase if you are interested in performing barbell lifts correctly.  Personally, I have always struggled with squats and deadlifts.  However, after watching the video I am considerably more confident in my squat technique and I immediately doubled the amount I could deadlift.",1302480000,6,673,5.273584905660377

The DVD alone will leave you bereft of a number of major points that are there in teh book, the anatomy of lifting, the mechanics of the lift, various alternate excercises etc. The video quality is good and camera work isn't too bad either. Good buy",1297296000,3,393,4.253333333333333
3797569,3,B001U9FDP2,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD. On one hand it has some great demonstrations of proper form in the lifts covered. I certainly learned some things I had overlooked previously. On the other hand, it goes to extremes of seemingly endless repetition of the lifts without any demonstrable benefit to the viewer. It really needs to have a quick review section for each lift just showing the essentials so a person can jump into it for a quick refresh to assure them of proper technique. It's nice that they have a number of different body types performing the demo lifts but there's very little useful information regarding how to correctly compensate in the form based on individual physical limitations. It would have been really nice to categorize the body types so you could, again, get into some information more helpful for your particular problem. Also, there's some hints for how to exercise around an injury but nothing in depth for other limitations. A particular disappointment for me was the lack of any remedial action for my particular problem in the press - lack of shoulder flexibility. It seemed that none of the demonstrators had any problems with shoulder flexibility and easily moved into proper position. I agree with another reviewer that other exercises such as dips and pullups desperately need some coverage rather than the endless repetition of the same movements covered. I'm still pleased that I bought this DVD but there's many areas where it falls far short of what it could have been.",1296777600,38,1515,4.921875

This has heped her sort out a lot of form issues and bodybuilding is all about proper form. So if you are stuck with improper form on things like squats this DVD will help.

3797573,4,B001U9FDP2,Great video. All the same great advice as in the book but easier to understand the proper form. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is very long and drawn out. Each exercise is demonstrated by 5-7 people at least 3 times each. Makes the video 2.5 hours when there is about 30 minutes of actual instruction. I guess it could be good if you need the repetition but I found myself fast forwarding quite a bit.,1283472000,6,418,4.2375
3797574,5,B001U9FDP2,"Coach Rippetoe puts on a clinic right in one's living room. The beauty about this DVD is that coach Rippetoe explains and shows the students (10+) the correct movements for the various barbell exercises but he also corrects the students until they are all using the right technique for the particular exercise. He uses beginning and intermediate level students. This mix of students is extremely helpful to one's learning.

The part that makes this DVD so wonderful is that after I watched the countless corrections and hints given by coach Rippetoe to each student, I unexpectedly caught myself correcting the student's technique towards the end of one of the exercise's presentation. I vividly recall one instance where student was showing a subtle up/down rear-end movement causing his chest to drop at the start of his deadlift. I said to myself, 'chest needs to rise up, not drop', and watched coach Rippetoe address and correct this problem shortly afterwards. This DVD is indeed a clinic on barbell training where the viewer is actively learning.

I hope he makes more DVDs on other barbell exercises. Well done!",1283040000,7,1119,5.043243243243243

I'm a huge fitness enthusiast, and have a good sized library of various training resources. Without a doubt this is the single best fitness related purchase I have ever made. If you want to learn to squat, deadlift, bench, press, and clean this DVD (and perhaps the Starting Strength book) is the only resource you'll need. For as long as I can remember I have always struggled with feeling 100% comfortable with the squat. I never felt like I was efficiently transferring my power. Two viewings of this dvd and a few practice reps with a light bar while watching the instruction to ingrain the motor pathway have revolutionized the way I squat. I now feel like the power is being transferred directly through my body, through my heels and into the floor. An unbelievable difference.  Every single lesson has had a huge positive impact on my technique. Buy it!",1275436800,12,1012,4.685393258426966

The DVD uses mutiple camera angles for a clear presentation of key aspects of each lift. Footage of different lifters is integrated to provide a cohesive lesson to the viewer, which adresses many possible form faults in a logical sequence. As a personal trainer, I was most pleased by the opportunity to see Rippetoe correct a spectrum of faults in several different lifters. Very valuable.",1266192000,4,725,5.0
3797578,4,B001U9FDP2,Useful info but worth half the price. Ripp isn't really saying anything new and I feel there could have been more material added. It only breaks down the power lifts and this dvd should have been included with the book imo. Still gets four stars cause I did clean up my form a bit. I would recommend buying either the dvd or the book but not both. In my case the dvd as I am a more visual learner.,1265932800,4,397,4.037974683544304
3797579,4,B001U9FDP2,"I really expected more from this DVD since I was paying $20+ for it and since it is by one of the best strength training coaches. I  probably would of given it 5 stars if I bought it for less, I don't think its worth the $20 but if you get the book then might as well get the dvd right ? Ok about the dvd. I did learn a few things from it so I cant really put it down because of the price. I learned how to breath and do my overhead press properly which is really going to help me out in the future so that alone you can say was worth half of the price I paid. Also learned not to keep my hips so low while deadlifting. I didn't really learn much from the bench press part, I already knew to keep my arms locked, look at something in the ceiling, and keep an arched torso. The bench press part reinforced what I already knew. The powerlift, well I don't do powerlifting so cant say anything on that. The squat I did learn that I should bounce off from the bottom. Overall it was a good dvd. Some things contradict each other like for example when deadlifting make a keep your hips up, bar close to chins, big chest ... yet how can you keep your shoulders behind the bar when your hips are up and the bar is close to your shins ? well I think I need to read the section on deadlift in the book maybe it will clarify it. Bottom line is that I expected more out of this DVD, I guess Keep It Simple Stupid. Well if you are reading this review, do reviews on this or any other products because its what makes this work. I use to get lazy and not do them but I realized that there are people out there that help us by reviewing so the least you can do is help them by doing a review.",1260057600,5,1677,3.9035087719298245

The best way to use the book and the DVD in my opinion is to set it up in your gym and try out the exact movements as described when you are watching it. It also helps to make a few quick check points that can help when you are actually working out.,1256342400,4,430,3.842696629213483
