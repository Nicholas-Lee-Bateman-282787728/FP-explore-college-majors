8516979,3,B007I1Q4QS,"I am a Jim Brown fan and this was a movie I remember seeing in the Saturday afternoon triple feature as a kid. It is not going to be confused with Casablanca, but for a B movie, it earns decent marks from an entertainment standpoint. Some of the cinematography was off because of the age of this movie and maybe because I watched on my Kindle instead of my much larger flat screen.",1433030400,2,381,4.232876712328767
8516980,4,B007I1Q4QS,"Very good B movie about a prison inmate named Curtis (Jim Brown) who is the target of various prison factions and corrupt guards who all want to learn the location of 1.5 million dollars in cash from a heist that Curtis managed to stash before getting caught.  Curtis is fine being patient and doing his time until he finds out that the place he hid the cash is scheduled for demolition to make way for new construction.  With nobody he can trust on the outside to retrieve the money Curtis is forced to quickly come up with a plan for escape.

In the late 1960's Hollywood was trying to turn Jim Brown into a mainstream movie star with vehicles like ...tick...tick...tic... and The Split.  The problem was that Jim Brown had the looks and physique to be a movie star but as an actor was a stiff.  Watching him opposite Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Klugman, Warren Oates and Donald Sutherland in the The Split makes Jim Brown's limitations as a lead painfully obvious.

By 1973 when The Slams was made Jim Brown's status as an A list actor was over and he was relegated to making B movies like Slaughter and I Escaped From Devil's Island.  If you watch The Split (1968) and The Slams (1973) back to back the most striking thing is how much looser and more comfortable Jim Brown is on screen in the latter film--he seems liberated with the demands of being a respectable actor lifted.

The Slams showcases Jim Brown at his best--he is loose, charismatic and genuinely fun to watch.  Part of the credit for Jim Brown's uncharacteristically strong work in The Slams is likely due to director Jonathan Kaplan who later made The Accused which earned Jodie Foster a shocking at the time Academy Award since her career as an adult actress had been going nowhere.

Roger Corman believed that exploitation movies needed to move quickly in order to grab and hold audience attention and that there were two ways to achieve that on a limited budget--move the camera during scenes or use static shots and cut frequently between different camera angles.  Jonathan Kaplan demonstrates a mastery of the latter technique in The Slams, resulting in a movie that is dynamic and exciting to watch and that utilizes Jim Brown so well that for an hour and a half he really does feel like a legitimate movie star.

Someone who reviewed an Amazon Instant streaming copy of The Slams said the quality was very poor.  I watched the Warner Archive DVD-R which should be the same transfer--the version I watched looked nice.  Movies used to have grain in the picture when they were shot, edited and projected on film--some studios have chosen to eliminate grain when creating new digital masters for DVD and Blu-ray to make the old movies look shiny and new but that doesn't represent the way those movies actually looked when they were originally shown in theaters.  I prefer transfers that preserve the original look of the film grain and all but many people don't.  If you watch The Slams expecting it to look like a new movie rather than something shot in 1973 you will likely be disappointed.",1425168000,3,3076,4.6685185185185185
8516981,1,B007I1Q4QS,"Poor video and audio quality. Grainy frames. Distorted, blaring sound. Film credits to the right and out of frame. Black frames - no picture. I became totally disinterested in watching this film as it flopped through the intro, and I'm a big Jim Brown fan. Too bad. Please refund immediately.",1376352000,4,292,4.86
8516982,4,B007I1Q4QS,I really enjoyed this movie. Jim Brown was a cool brother in this movie as usual. Good action and a good movie to watch. Recommended.,1318550400,,133,4.36
8516983,1,B007I1Q4QS,"To its credit, this movie is a pioneering prison flick that may have influenced ""American Me,"" ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and others.  Still, this film had a weak plot and characters for whom I had no sympathy.  The main character is stuck in a catch-22 and I could not care less how he solved it.

This film could make you nostalgic for the 1970s.  It was filled with huge afros and thick sideburns.  After the main character gets some revenge on backstabbers, he shouts out, ""Suckas!""  And yes, ""jive turkey!"" is said a few times.  One character said, ""Slow your roll!"" and I didn't know that was an old phrase that hip-hoppers have revived.  Lurch from ""The Addams Family"" plays a key antagonist here and you may want to see him if you are a fan of his.

The technical quality of this film is sorely lacking.  It looks like some copied a videotape, copied that copy, copied that copy, copied it one more time for good measure, and then put it on DVD.  The cover says, ""Jim Brown goes over the wall to flash with a million $ stash.""  They were too cheap to write out ""dollar.""  On the back cover, it says, ""$1.500.000.""  However, we Americans use commas where other countries uses periods in numbers, so I wonder if this was a crappy DVD transfer done abroad.",1201824000,2,1258,4.484581497797357
