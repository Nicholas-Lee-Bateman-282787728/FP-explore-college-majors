8573441,4,B000TSTZ5Y,"First off, be sure to have an all-regions dvd player or one that will play Region 0 at any rate. This is not for your typical American made dvd player. I like the Bound Heat brand and this is an earlier one. It would certainly be categorized as ""soft"" and the nudity is tasteful with nothing too ""in your face"". I like that they are actually pretty good movies with drawn out ""scenes"". Pretty good movies, that is, for this type of fair. Of course, I always think they could have done better, more, gone further, etc. But don't we all think that of most movies across the board? At any rate, you can see a clip of it at their main site. Hope you find what you are looking for.
