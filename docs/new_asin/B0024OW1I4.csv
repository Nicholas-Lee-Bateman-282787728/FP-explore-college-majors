3847665,4,B0024OW1I4,"I came across this art and architecture guide to Italy, hosted by the London Evening Standard's art critic Brian Sewell, quite by accident, and after giving it a go, I enjoyed myself so much I watched all ten episodes in nearly one go. The idea is to trace the standard eighteenth-century wealthy young Englishman's Grand Tour through Italy, conducted after his time at Oxbridge so as to give him polish and culture; starting at Turin, where he trained in swordsmanship and deportmant, he would then make a progress through the multiple duchies and principalities of the Italian peninsula, learning about the great artists (Michelangelo, Titian, Raphael, Bernini, Canova) and buying things for his estate along the way; he would visit the great architectural wonders of the peninsula (in Rome, Urbino, Bologna, Paestum,  and so on), and also acquire a kind of carnal education in the fleshpots of Siena, Naples, and Venice. The series is beautifully filmed, and while it makes surprising omissions due to time constraints (we see nothing of Tinteretto or Bellini or Giorgione, for example), the documentary also makes surprising stops along the way for Brian Sewell to reminisce about his own experiences on his first Grand Tour in the 1950s and to sample products a Grand Tourist would try in Italy, such as olive oil or Parma ham. Indeed, the greatest wonder the series shows us is not the towers of San Gimignano or the caldera of Vesuvius, but Sewell himself.

Americans will not know Brian Sewell as well as Brits do: it is important to remember from the outset that this is his show (which the director, Christopher Bruce, ingeniously emphasizes), and Brian Sewell is no Sister Wendy. The septuagenarian critic, sporting a full head of leonine white hair and straggly eyebrows, is a tremendous character: opinionated, foppish, erudite, amusing, cantankerous, snobbish, lascivious, mischievous, self-mocking, sentimental, cynical, and always outrageous. He speaks in a kind of Southeast England Received Pronunciation that is so berserkly plummy that perhaps no one else English has ever sounded like him before or since (except perhaps Mick Jagger when he once pretended to be Camilla Parker-Bowles' butler on Saturday Night Live). Often sporting a white umbrella to protect himself from the heat of the sun, or draped in a flannel prudence (i.e. a kind of wrap) to protect himself from the furious winter's rages, he amiably ambles through the Italian townscapes, pronouncing on anything that interests or irritates him (which is almost everything). In almost every art museum or palazzo he finds some famous art object or architectural detail to gripe about, although Bruce very wisely usually balances this by also showing something for Sewell to praise; we also hear amusing and sometimes thoughtful asides Sewell makes in his car along the way. Many Brits find Sewell's erudition and his unreptentant snobbishness incredibly refreshing; Americans may have a harder time with it, but if you can enter into the spirit of the thing and realize Sewell is constantly poking fun at himself, you'll have a terrific time.",1375660800,6,3124,5.17193675889328
3847666,5,B0024OW1I4,"Just loved it - Anthony Blunt's Courtauld protege recreates the 18th century grand tour - a wonderful trip toggling between history and contemporary travel.  For viewers who are put off by big words, eccentric aesthetes and plummy English accents I refer you to the less positive review.  I thought it was absolutely wonderful.",1365811200,,327,5.150943396226415
3847667,1,B0024OW1I4,This is one of the most painful videos I have ever watched.  I do not know Brian Sewell but assume he has some sort of following.  The video is more about him than Italy.  And he rambles forever on random thoughts.  Do not buy unless you want to watch Brian.,1357862400,,258,4.1
3847668,5,B0024OW1I4,"I think this was a wonderful series.  Just watched it for a second time, because it is wonderful to have an Art Historian's view on so many places and pieces of art.

This is more of a personal odyssey than an historical account of the past Grand Tour type of Trek.  Brian interweaves many different things and sometimes offshoots to a different area entirely. He doesn't not hold back with his views and this is exactly what I like about this production.  This is part historical account and travel essay, Personal narrative rolled up into one........

Highly recommend it.

3847670,5,B0024OW1I4,"My favorite type of travelogue commingled with high quality commentary on art and history laced with often intriguing personal takes on the times and customs.  Brian Sewell is the perfect quirkily humorous and curmudgeonly educator and travel companion. The visual treatment of the artwork and the many destinations are as fine as I've ever seen. Whether or not you differ or agree with Sewell's judgments of the art and architecture, it is a grand tour conducted by a grand guide.",1280016000,5,481,5.0125
3847671,5,B0024OW1I4,"This is not your typical art history tour of Italy - it is so much more fun.  Sewell has so many wonderful stories of his Grand Tour as a student while he retraces his steps.  How I wish I was sitting in the car next to him.

If you love Italy, Art or armchair travel in general make sure to pick this up.  I spent a semester in Italy and obviously missed a lot.  I was never bored and wish I had this DVD when I was a student.",1249603200,9,427,3.752808988764045
3847672,4,B0024OW1I4,"BRIAN SEWELL'S GRAND TOUR OF ITALY is grande indeed. TEN episodes show what the upper-teenage British nobility route that might have been taken plus the sights seen. This recreation of a ""Grand Tour"" trek (via car, not carriage) was researched from books and diaries left behind 300 years ago by the young men who set out to finish their education in Italy. The trip took months, a year, or more. It was designed for the gentlemen to see the best art (and purchase some), architecture, experience the Italian culture, learn the language, and experience the female ""freedoms"".

Over 24 cities and small towns are passed through and filmed. Beautiful. Local people open their hearts to the film viewers. Every stop is another historical moment in the lives of the Grand Tourists. Each displays paintings, architecture, and/or artifacts that can be seen up close as well as from a picturesque nearby hillside. IT IS AN ADVENTURE WITH ITALIAN PAINTING, ARCHITECTURE, RAPHAEL, TITIAN, MICHELANGELO, & an intense view of the cities of FLORENCE, ROME, AND VENICE (just to name 3).

Your filmed Grand Tour has as its guide, famous & controversial art critic, Brian Sewell. So why 4 stars, and not 5?

Sewell often rubbed me the wrong way. But he's won reviewing awards; I have not. At times I wished I could pay a few extra Euros and get a new tour guide. Perhaps one as knowledgeable as Sewell is tough finding. Honestly, there is a lot of intellectual wealth from Sewell.

What's wrong with Sewell? Often his personal taste, conservative to the n-th degree, has him putting down much Italian art, architecture, life, wine, food, etc. and using terms as ""It's awful!"", ""Reduculous"", ""Awful"". Sometimes he's wrong, I've been to Italy. Just outside of the Pompeii digs gate is the best pizza in the world (my opinion). Sewell refused to eat Italian pizza, and made fun of most of what he did eat on film. Italians will never buy this DVD set.

At a Renaissance church in Todi, (he nicknamed ""Pepper Pot""), he stated upon exiting, ""Well, dear, oh dear and lawks a mercy. that's a bit of a dog's dinner.  Pedigree chum, but still a dog's dinner."" When Sewell abounds in intellect, he fails in tact.

Perhaps Sewell wants to comically portray the manner and breadth of the Grand Tourist's educational aspect regarding the bird and the bees. It sounds more like he's hung up in some perverted way with classical nude painting and sculpture, fixing on ""buttocks"" and other personal body parts. ""Gosh!"" (his word). And then he's a bit over the top with his gestures, overly dramatic speech, and his white umbrella. Perhaps I'm just too picky nicky. ""Gosh!"" ""Awful.""

Aside from Sewell's quirks and humor bits, this is ""bloody good"" viewing.
The 4-DVD set is really very good, highly recommended. Educational, pleasant to the eye and ear, historically wonderful, and cheap. It costs less than the price of a pair of passport photos.
....Bonus Features add additional facts on Italian artists of the period, explanations of terms and tidbits like fancy dressed ""macaroni"", map, list of what the rich tourists packed, and more.
....THANKS ATHENA FOR THE SUBTITLES. Very helpful for names & places.
....And a Biography of Brian Sewell explaining why my opinion of him is certainly not acceptable to the British.

This is Italy like I've never seen it on film prior.",1247097600,25,3346,4.876760563380282
3847673,4,B0024OW1I4,"This is a fun & fascinating look at the Grand Tour experience of the British aristocracy as seen through the eyes of the decidedly opinionated & droll Brian Sewell.  If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Sewell in action and you enjoy art history, I urge you to check out this series.  I have been waiting years for this release on US-compatible DVD and am eager to watch it all over again; I can't wait to add it to my personal collection!!",1243641600,11,449,4.333333333333333
8350800,5,B0024OW1I4,"Brian Sewell could never fail to be entertaining--seriously so. This is a very personal farewell visit to Italy that sparkles with a remarkable variety of information. At times he indulges a bit too much in what totters into an irritating snobbish bitterness--esp. in Venice. I think he could have avoided the hideous Carnival and concentrated on what he really loved about the city. However, his farewell Grand Tour is a joy that should not be missed, a summation by an unique connoisseur who had so much to share and did it with his signature &eacute;lan. I had the pleasure of an unforgettable lunch with him while I was doing my doctorate at the Courtauld Institute of Art.",1495843200,,677,4.794871794871795
8350801,4,B0024OW1I4,"It is better to be previously endeared to the personality of Brian Sewell before purchasing this DVD.  This is a bad choice for the preparing traveler, but a good choice for the art history enthusiast.
His theme is to view Italy through the eyes of the 18th century ""grand tourists"", his own coined term for aristocratic boys from England who made a pilgrimage in their early adulthood.
He carries this theme to a tedious extent, pointing out to us that these aristocratic brats hated Italian food,Italian wine, and Italians themselves.  He begrudges that modern Italians ride their bicycles beneath a certain arch in Rimini without a thought -- not about the cultural importance of the Roman-era architecture -- but of the 18th century ""grand tourist"". ""This actually looks like a combination of red ink and urine"" he says of a glass of Chianti.  After watching this dvd, I would enjoy watching an Italian travel through England eating bangers and mash in overcast London weather making remarks about English cuisine, wine (do they have any?) and people.

He also has no rapport with the guests of the program.  The Italian opera singer seems eager to get rid of him, an expert on volcanos is not engaged by Sewell's frustration that Mt. Vesuvius has little aesthetic value, and he tells the owner of the Villa Valmarana how annoying it must be to remain stuck with the same artwork on the walls.

I must say, I'm a little disappointed that Sewell seems to lack even the basic tourist's passable Italian, which I would not have expected because in an interview he once said that he aspired to write ""the"" book on Michelangelo. He must have planned to accomplish this without Italian sources.

He is at his best discussing Paestum, Siena, Mantua, and Orvieto.

I remain a fan of Sewell even after this, however.  I'm glad I didn't have to know him, he seems insufferable, but as an art critic he was an entertaining, arrogant British snot in his day.  He knew what he was talking about and he had clearly thought about everything he had to say.  May he rest in peace.",1494979200,2,2067,4.729805013927576

8350804,5,B0024OW1I4,"I really enjoyed the unique and personal perspective of this documentary, which follows the trail of the ""Grand Tour"" taken by aristocratic young Englishmen during the 18th century. Many reviews have panned Brian Sewell, and apparently these reviewers didn't enjoy his eccentricities, so this definitely isn't for everyone. But the entire series is available on Youtube, so you can watch it there first and decide whether you want to see it with DVD quality video.

This is not a travelogue in the usual sense. While the basis of the narrative throughout all ten episodes is the 18th century Grand Tour, from crossing the Alps into Italy, making one's way down to Rome and Naples, and eventually heading back north to Carnival in Venice, Brian Sewell's personality dominates throughout, not only interjecting art history, for which Sewell is famous, but also reflections on his earlier re-tracing of the Grand Tour as a young man, a few asides on cars, of which he is an enthusiast, and a miscellany of other items.",1444435200,,1015,4.970588235294118

8350806,4,B0024OW1I4,"I'm planning a trip and thought DVDs would augment paper guides in choosing which cities to visit & for how long.

I like that he doesn't waste time recommending restaurants, hotels or vendors:  rather, the focus is on the city, architecture, churches and art.  As an Anglophile (lover of BNC and English history) I find his story/ theme of ""what rich Englismen did during their 1700s ""Grand Tours"" interesting.

Let's be honest: we casual Americans will find Brian pretentious to the extreme.  I've had many hearty belly-laughs at his most severe insults (even when he is basically insulting me: ""fat old lesbians"" at Venice costume party).  I like it but not everyone will.

One definite plus is that rather than rushing from here to there to cover 6 locations in 5 minutes before rushing to cover the next city, he spends a good amount of time (with longer, slower camera shots) in primarily churches, museums, and archetectural treasures.  He also occasionally explains why a painting is good (in addition to what story the painting tells).

He clearly favors details regarding sexual improprieties, but not in a ""bleep those words"" kind of way.

If you HATE the history of England's rich people, you might find his storyline an annoying waste of time.

It verified for me WHICH cities to see, which not to see, and added one day trip to my travel plans.  Plus, I'll undoubtedly watch it again, looking forward to the next pretentious insult.  :)",1440892800,,1450,4.845528455284553
8350807,3,B0024OW1I4,Brian Sewell is an eccentric and can be annoying sometimes. He seems to be somewhat of a snob. Less time spent on the tacky masquerade ball in Venice would have been appreciated and more time with the Titians and Tintoretto's.,1425600000,,226,4.675
