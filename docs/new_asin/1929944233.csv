However having such an interesting subject it largely throws away what makes puppetry so fascinating, namely the otherness of the puppet, by making the documentary an exercise in nostalgia. The narrator is too jovial, the music saccharin, the history devoid of any critical aspects; thus it is more of a cuddly survey than anything that would remotely be called a history. To be fair it does have good material on the early days of puppetry in America, and it is particularly enlightening on the first half of the 20th Century. But then, suddenly, it comes to the early age of television and immediately loses all perspective.

In the 1950s puppets become simplistic children's fixtures, nostalgia for people of a certain age (I am nearly that age myself). But the message is clear puppets are exclusively for children and sentimentalists. How wonderful! It doesn't occur to the filmmakers that the puppetry they show from the early half of the 20th Century is far more creative and advanced than the puppets that have to fit into program slots for children. This isn't to denigrate children's puppetry. It's just that the film loses all critical voice. Puppets are there merely to make us laugh and smile. And the Muppets of course are the pinnacle of puppetry. There is a hint at the end that there is indeed more. But it is tossed off.

In documentaries about stage magic the same point is usually made about magic too. Yet early television is always dealt with as a tragedy for the art. And so the great problem for puppetry in America is that, except in a few rarefied climes and locals, for most Americans puppets equal Muppets equals children equals fun. Period. End of story. And that's pretty much the point of this documentary. It does mention the astounding adult puppetry of Remo Buffano in San Francisco in the 1930s (They even produced a version of O'Neil's The Emperor Jones.). But somehow nostalgia and good feeling leave us with the inevitable conclusion that television was the greatest thing to happen to puppetry in the history of the art. What this documentary does prove is that we really need a serious treatment of the subject.

Having said that, because it is the only documentary on the subject I would recommend it for the material it does present. Just prepare yourself for a sugar high in second half.",1422748800,,2512,4.767816091954023
7801371,5,1929944233,"This is about as great a documentary on the world of puppetry as you will most likely ever see. It sure will take a lot to top this one anyway. SOOOO much great footage, photos & info in such a short amount of time. This could NOT have been crafted any better! There is only one way it could have been made better, & that's if it had been made LONGER! I L-O-V-E this film!!!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!! OR, as ""Punch"" would say: ""That's the way to do it!"" :)",1390867200,,451,4.136363636363637

There are also interview segments with many of the notable puppeteers of the 20th century, many who have since passed away.  It also has longer segments of historic puppet performances in its special features.  It was great to see the work of Tony Sarg, Bill Baird, the Rose family, and many other notable performers about whom I had only read.",1268265600,3,480,4.746987951807229

A must for anyone involved in the art, as this will feature interviews and film clips with those who worked with Bil Baird, Rufus and Margo Rose, Jim Henson and so many others. TV favorites such as Howdy Doody, Foodini, Rootie Kazootie and Lamb Chop are here as well. Who better to illustrate the ventriloquist art than Paul Winchell and Shari Lewis?
