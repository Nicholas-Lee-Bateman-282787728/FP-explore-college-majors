5818811,5,B00DIR2PIW,"I came into this film expecting very little, and was simply shocked. A gripping story combines with wonderful acting, and some great cinematography. A must see for sure!",1379635200,,169,5.071428571428571
5818812,4,B00DIR2PIW,"Definitely a great drama piece. After a accident during a mission in space an astronaut is left all alone on a Journey to Jupiter's moon, Europa. He must keep his wits about him on this long journey. He must establish a schedule and routine so that he doesn't lose his sanity. A great study on the mind and how we need other human interaction. Highly recommended!",1379462400,,363,4.515151515151516
5818813,5,B00DIR2PIW,"This is a great film. I am not a Sci-fi film lover, but I loved this film. The acting is great. Khary Payton is alone for most of the film and he kept me totally glued to the screen. I was so immersed in his character. I was really rooting for him. This film is not just for Sci-Fi fans, it's for anyone who wants to see a good (drama) movie.",1379376000,,342,3.8309859154929575
5818814,5,B00DIR2PIW,Great film! Passion of the filmmaker at it's best. A true example of what creativity can create without huge hollywood budgets.,1378771200,,127,5.095238095238095
5818815,5,B00DIR2PIW,"I saw this film and was blown away by how realistically it portrayed the individual, but necessary toll that will be needed to explore space. Anchored by an astonishing performance by Khary Payton ""Astronaut: The Last Push"" did what so little Sci-Fi does, ie make me care about the protagonist without resorting to CGI nonsense. A must not only for Sci-Fi fans, but fans of well-written, character driven drama as well!",1378771200,4,419,4.915492957746479
5818816,5,B00DIR2PIW,"When was the last time you saw a science fiction film that pulled you in and left you wanting more?  I saw this film at the Philip K. Dick Film Festival in December (won best Sci-Fi Drama),and I was impressed by the unbelievable performance by Khary Payton as Michael. He touched my heart and soul.  Writer/Director Eric Hayden gives us a realistic set in Life One and wonderful special effects and his Venus flyby is stunning.  Lance Henriksen, Brian Baumgartner, and James Madio are also along for the ride.  Their roles might be small, but they are memorable. You will not believe this is an independent film.  This will be a great addition to your sci-fi collection!",1377388800,19,670,4.6923076923076925
5818817,5,B00DIR2PIW,"Starts out disturbing when you think you're watching a man slowly lose his sanity. Then becomes uplifting... then profound. I am amazed at what they did with so little and yes, this a real story of exploration, not a single gimmick added. If you have a post millennial attention span then, it's not that you wouldn't enjoy it, but more that you can't... this requires an imagination that can put you in the situation; that can get you thinking how well you would fare. This movie uses mental skills usually required for reading novels.
Brilliant.",1473724800,,546,4.757894736842105

The basket cases get weeded out very early in the training or in the actual flying of high performance aircraft in high stress environments (This guy couldn't even find the right side of a light to turn it off). Sorry, the screenwriter needs a couple of thousand hours in simulators and actual line missions before he can begin to understand the mindset of an experienced astronaut.

5818835,3,B00DIR2PIW,"I can see why the ratings are all over the place.  If yo are a sci-fi fan and running out of movies to watch, this one is worth watching.  I won't need to see it again.  Some of it is a little monotonous.  I didn't see the ending coming and I am pretty sure this is why a lot of fans did not like it.  I would have liked a flash forward at the end.

Eric Hayden has directed many sci-fi films and this is pretty well directed.  In some ways, this film is quite different and deep on some psychological levels.  I gave it 3 stars.  There are some better films out there to be sure, so it didn't get a five.  I took away another star for the ending.  So this film is okay.  I skimmed a couple of reviews and some people took points away because of ""technical stuff"".  I can suspend my beliefs and knowledge for a good tale.  If you can, too, then you won't hate this film.  But do not expect to walk away feeling energetic or excited.  The film is a mood killer as a prelude to any romance with a date.

I can say I have seen it.  Once was enough.  I am neither disgusted nor thrilled.  It's simply a sci-fi tale that may have enough energy to get to distant planets, but probably did not do well enough at the box office to make a profit.

I hope this helps you make a decision.",1465603200,,1277,3.9683794466403164

5818838,3,B00DIR2PIW,Creative writing helps this low budget movie be worth a watch.  While it could use a big more background the story was strong and somewhat realistic of the impact that long term solitary travel could have on a person. I don't know if I will watch it again but I don't regret the time I did spend watching it.,1465257600,,308,4.220338983050848

5818840,4,B00DIR2PIW,"I read many of the other reviews and disagree with most of the criticism. i have outlived most of my friends and view the actor as being quite reasonable and human in his stress and decisions. It is always assumed we can't stand separation but given time he does overcome this as just another life problem to handle. Yes, I like Star Wars but this wins my vote as being realistic.",1464307200,,380,4.366197183098592

I've always said that i would go into space under absolutely any conditions. Even if it meant certain death, i'd still do it. Until this movie i never saw any circumstance that would change my mind.

It doesn't have all the bangs and flash of the other sci fi films and maybe that's what those reviewers wanted. This was a very thoughtful and realistic presentation of a man's struggles while alone in space for many years. I would love to have seen a better ending but the ending as it was....was good. Just not full closure like I wanted.
The pacing reminds me of Silent Running or even 2001. No, it's not like either one but the tone and pacing the film set reminded me of those. A good story well done...not flashy just consistent and well scripted.",1458518400,,642,4.495726495726496

I gave this movie 4 out of 5 (I probably would have given 3.5 if the system allowed). The sets were pretty simple, CGI decent, and the actors performed well. I enjoyed Bruce Baumgartner's role as CAPCOM. The movie deals realistically with a multiple redundancy failure scenario pretty well, as it does the complete isolation of a single astronaut on his own out in deep space. As others have pointed out there are issues with consumables and other practicalities that mean this is not a totally realistic representation of how such a mission would have been handled, but it gets enough right that it is entertaining.",1439078400,,843,4.854166666666667

If one can remember that great film art doesn't necessary mean stunning visual effects and gee-whiz unrealistic images, one can admire and respect this film's stunning realism.

Of note was the triumph of man the explorer. ""Astronaut"" is marvelous tribute to one of the great mysteries of mankind and our spirit--our relentless drive to explore the unknown. Against all odds. Against the impossible. Against reason. The uncanny man goes on away from hearth and home, alone, to wander unchartered territory. In this case, space itself.",1437609600,,837,4.887323943661972

Despite most of the screen time, 90% of it, is spent on one movie set, Khary Payton's excellent acting wrings the most emotional and psychological mileage out of it.  Light / Dark / Hot / Cold / Oxygen / No Oxygen -- the astronaut really is a brave yet fragile organism, so that even the smallest variations in the environment threaten his life.  The same theme drove the Apollo 13 movie, too, but The Astronaut includes a much larger time scale, and the deeply existential psychological journey the astronaut must negotiate brings this audience  right along with him.

I found this movie pointless. I decided (for my own sanity) that he just went crazy and the earth bound folk were sorta sorry for him and maybe feeling kinda guilty, so they sent him on his way with Eliott, and Hamlet and I don't know who all, and just let him live in his own delusional little world.

5818982,3,B00DIR2PIW,ASTRONAUT: THE LAST PUSH is an interesting take on space exploration as it explores what may be the future of space exploration (private industry funding it) and the challenges that might be faced (like sailors faced on long trips across the oceans in the days of Christopher Columbus).  Also it is fair to note that the production deisgn and special effects are great for this low budget feature.  It also is a journey about the human spirit and the need to explore the unknown no matter what the risks are.  ASTRONAUT: THE LAST PUSH is a work of love by writer/ director Eric Hayden.  I could compare this film to APOLLO 13 almost entirely from the POV of the astronaut except for messages from mission control and people wishing Michael a safe journey (and how he inspires them).  Khary Patton manages to carry the movie on his shoulders.  I do think the flyby of Venus has to be one of the most amazing moments in the film.  I do wonder how the film would have played out if it was farther into the journey.  The movie does remind me a little of the movie STRANDED (where a manned Mars mission crashes on Mars).

But there's one science fact they got wrong.  VERY wrong.  And it tarnished the film's story for me a bit.  Several times in the story, discussions are held about using Venus to slingshot around to gain more speed and reduce the time of their journey.  And he does get close to Venus toward the end of the film.

But they apparently were napping during grade-school astronomy class, and never saw either version of COSMOS, cuz Venus is NOT in between Earth and Jupiter.  It's MARS that any crew headed to or from Jupiter would use for sling-shot boost.  Venus is CLOSER to the sun than Earth, NOT further.  NO mission to Jupiter would take the ship anywhere near venus.  That would be like driving with limited gas from St. Louis to New York city via Seattle.  Ridiculous,

In real-life, the only way Venus would be between Earth and Jupiter is if the mission had been launched when Earth was on it's FAR side of its orbit around the sun, relative to Jupiter being on the other side of the sun at the time, and Venus just happened to be in its orbit on the other side of the sun at the same time, but then, NO mission would even be STARTED under those conditions, another huge waste of limited fuel.  NASA would simply wait x-months (up to a half-year) to START the launch of the mission when Earth was the SAME side of the sun as Jupiter, saving them millions of miles of travel in the ship, and which would automatically take them AWAY from Venus no mater where Venus was in its orbit.

This is a pretty basic astronomy error for a film that otherwise is trying to be scientifically accurate to add credibility to the film's story.  This isn't a Sci-Fantasy film like Star Wars.  Or even a highly-science-speculatve kind of movie like Star Trek that uses a lot of (so-far) unproven physics for their ships to speed around our part of the galaxy.  Like the movie ""Gravity"", this film is supposed to be a potentially credible story that uses all of what we currently know to be scientifically accurate.  But this one major planetary error undermines the story for anyone who knows even basic astronomy and NASA-physics history.

I wish I had been with the director when he was first-writing his story to point this out to him so he could simply change the word ""Venus"" to ""Mars"" whenever it occurs in the film's dialog, cuz this is the only serious scientific error in the film that diminishes it's otherwise impressive achievement for such a low-budget movie.

Maybe he'll get it right next time, if he ever makes a sequel.",1425513600,,2745,4.551934826883911

5819014,3,B00DIR2PIW,"Three COMPELLING Stars. Filmed as a documentary-style space event in places and executed at a slow, deliberate pace, ""Astronaut: The Last Push"" begins seemingly the way NASA might film a space odyssey. The theory seems to be well thought out: instead of launching directly at Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, they are using the gravity of other bodies to achieve the faster speeds and the orbital mechanics needed to reach the prize. So they launch away from Europe towards Venus to achieve a gravitational slingshot effect that will take them back past Earth and out to Europa. But, as the world watches, on the journey out disaster strikes the two-man crew and tense coordination is needed to try to save the mission which will test the limits of human endurance and leave the people on Earth transfixed. Starring Khary Payton, James Madio, Brian Baumgartner, Lance Hendriksen (Aliens, Millennium) and directed by Eric Hayden.

5819055,4,B00DIR2PIW,"The distribution of rating stars says that this is a controversial movie in some ways, and the reaction of the reviewers is, I think, important to reviewing the movie. It's all very meta...

I gave it four stars, and they lost a star for a horrible technical mistake that many reviewers noticed: consumables. One generous reviewer tried to paper it over with hand-waving about an unknown future technology, but sorry dude, they lost that star fair and square.

Reviewers also criticized the movie's stilted dialog, but here's a case where the filmmakers got a technical detail right and translated it into good story telling. For most of the movie, the speed of light caused communication delays that meant that the astronaut and mission control were essentially sending letters to each other. Of course the dialog was stiltedit wasn't dialog! But during the brief period of Earth flyby when realtime communication was possible, there were real conversations and the characters could react to and play off each others emotions. They got it right.

I think that good science fiction is about the human experience of extraordinary circumstances, and by that standard this movie was good science fiction. It was a one-man show, a psychological study that took place almost entirely inside a small windowless box. The creators wisely chose not to  resort to standard tropes like cutting to mission control for scenes of frantic activity. They kept the focus entirely on the experience of one man trapped in a box for years, millions of miles from home, kept sane by the thin thread of contact with Bob from mission control, well-played by Bruce Baumgartner.

Finally, reviewers criticized the slow pace of the movie, with many calling it boring. But again, wasn't that integral to the movie? You try living in a 20x10-foot windowless box for years, and I guarantee you that your sense of time will become seriously distorted. Even that worked for me, though I advise you to not watch this movie in the morning after several cups of coffee. It's OK in this case, and not an insult, to say that it's a good bedtime movie. Late at night I could relax into the movie's pace, and float along with it with no sense of impatience.

The challenges that Michael faces on his years-long solitary attempt to return to Earth are fascinating. This movie had me mesmerized.

I loved this because it gave a real feel for what travel beyond our moon could be like.  Sure, there are plenty of space movies with way more action and non-stop excitement.  But they are fantasy.  Space flight by all accounts is nothing like that.

The only beef I have with this movie is the ending.  That's just not going to happen, IMO. But the rest of the movie was good enough to overlook that one weakness.  And unlike other reviewers, I felt that Michael's character was just right.  No we don't have his backstory (as others have complained) because the film is not about him personally.  It's about us!

WOW. First, let me say that this movie does NOT have subtitles, English or otherwise. It was completely in English (except for certain scenes and that was expected).

The dialog has been accused of being speech, but you must understand that this is an effect of the fact that these astronauts live in a fishbowl and the fact that messages are being sent with a time delay--so there's time to compose something.  This same theme of caution is reflected several times in talking about how cautious NASA is compared to the businessman funding this mission, and in how careful mission control is when talking to this astronaut due to his understandable sometime prickliness (haven't you ever said ""bear with me, I'm doing something hard""?) and possible mental breakdown.  And finally, it all builds up to reinforcing the inspiring theme at the end.  I liked the hell out of it even though it was composed neither like written fiction or in the standard movie format.  It used the medium of film to make a unique work of art in it's own style that you will be rewarded to understand.  Then again maybe it just hit the spot for me at the time; I identified with the astronaut in his considering but assertive negotiation with the world, and in his having to decide what to do, well, with his life.

The course to Europa uses planetary orbital position alignment and the gravitational slingshot effect, with Earth as the second planet to be passed (seems strange to slingshot past the planet you started on!), giving an opportunity to abort the mission on leg 2 of 3.  But what if something happens and you end up alone with years to kill in a disabled spacecraft?  That's what happens to one of the astronauts.  I'll save the ending and the details for you.

There's something of a surprise ending -- but also, like Gravity, the film isn't so much about the story as it is about the character.

The film is beautiful, in its own way. Great cinematography: it's a very nice-looking movie. Excellent performances from the actors. I would definitely check out other work from the lead actor and the director.

The problem is that most people in the US audience just aren't up for an atmospheric movie in the vein of the original Solyaris or most Japanese cinema other than chambara (i.e. basically the Japanese analogue to the sort of generic action flick Last Action Hero mocks), and those who are generally need to be in the right frame of mind.  If you're hoping for laser beams and aliens, or at least some good fancy 3D effects of explosions and dramatic what-have-you--if you think those are the things that make scifi work--you're not going to be satisfied.  I'm reminded of oddball, atmospheric, and slow-paced but enjoyable scifi like Moon and Silent Running.

The pace is extremely slow, because it's a story about someone stuck alone in a box millions of miles from home for several months; it's also about exploration, and transformational experiences.  It does a lot of things, but it doesn't do them with explosions, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it very subtle, it doesn't explicitly tell you what the point of a scene or a network of related scenes is meant to be.  It takes some patience and thoughtfulness to appreciate, and we're mostly trained not to bring those qualities to cinema.

Personally, I enjoyed it, simply by viewing it as an atmospheric, existential story.  Despite what some reviewers suggest, it doesn't try to do anything clever or add ""twists.""  The story is always quite clear about where it's going.  The nearest thing to actual twists in the story are when things don't go to plan in what I'd call perfectly realistic ways.  So if you're in the mood for an action-adventure, absolutely move on to something else; if you want absolute scientific accuracy, good luck finding any movie or even a pop-sci documentary that can supply it; if you're in the mood for something you sit back and absorb, though, I suggest you give this a try.",1400716800,,2103,4.83008356545961

Most of it looks like it was filmed inside an Airstream trailor and far too many of those scenes were drawn out and recycled as well.
After one or two waking/sleep cycles it runs out of gas.
The few special effects were also recycled too many times.  I stopped caring about whether this guy made it out alive or not.
Too many stupid things were happening.
The concept behind this kind of space flight is totally ludicrous as well.
Ok, we are going to send a small ship on a mission to Europa with a crew of TWO?
Why do you think the Apollo missions always had three astronauts and only two actually made the landing?
It was so there would be a good chance of at least one survivor able to make it back and tell the story.
It's ok though we will save on food & air by having them in suspended animation...for 6 years, outbound only.
Several problems there alone.  The human body cant stand that much inactivity even with electrical muscle stimulation.
Ok..suppose all those problems were fixed and we arrive at Europa.
The small ship they were using had no mention of radiation shielding.
Even if the crew survived the 6 years of radiation (out and back!)
Once they descended to within 2 million miles of Jupiter (Europa orbits at 416,800 miles) you are deep into Jupiter's intense
'Van Allen' type radiation belts.  A human in a space suit would have a very short life expectancy, about the same as in a beer can of a cheap space craft.
Last and biggest problem, assuming you solved all the previous problems and you got to Europa and did all your research...there is the major problem of *getting away  from Jupiter*.
Earth is a measly 40,320 KPH  (25,000 mph).  To escape Jupiter you need to break 214,560 KPH (133,321 mph)
So, this means you need a bigger, bigger, bigger ship just to carry all the fuel you will need for the endgame.
Getting away from Jupiter.
Dr. Von Braun had the basic concepts right for this kind of trip back in the 1950's.
Send several ships  4-6  and they need to be LARGE and fast to carry everything needed.
If one or more of the ships gets into trouble the others can be there to assist.
(Think Christopher Columbus and he lost one ship in a storm)

5819155,4,B00DIR2PIW,"It seems pretty clear that this small film, which I had not heard of before watching it today, was made by someone with a passion for contemplative science fiction that deals with issues of space travel in a hard sci-fi way--so, no space marines, no engines powered by sparkly blue magic, no alien bugs, and no warping off to the next episode.

Frankly, until Gravity was released in 2013, it seemed like the film industry long ago elected to remove the word ""science"" from the science fiction genre (as well as the words ""art"" and ""intellectual challenge""). I'm a huge fan of space adventure and I like all flavors--from Forbidden Planet to Star Wars to 2001 to Apollo 13 (which qualifies as space adventure, if not science fiction). However, there's been a ""realism"" hole in my sci-fi diet for far too long and I'm a little sick of war and horror films, etc, that brand themselves as science fiction simply because they have stars as their backdrop. You can't just tell a story like Hamlet and say at the end: ""o right, and this whole thing took place aboard a really cool spaceship and Horatio was green""  and, TA DA, science fiction. It kinda has to be about science, right?...alas, I digress.

""Astronaut: the Last Push"" is a sincere, good-hearted, and successful venture to fill that particular hole in the genre. For the most part it makes smart choices, given its constraints, for story and production. The main actors are good and they even managed to wrangle a big Hollywood name, Lance Henriksen (Bishop from ""Aliens""), to bring some weight to the project. And the science behind the flight is sound.

The main story is about the effects of isolation on a person in a confined space over a long period. While exploring the darker parts of life isn't exactly my favorite type of storytelling, it sets up the transition and positive message at the end nicely.

This is a small movie, but a nice piece and I hope the writer/director continues to create more work in this genre.",1395360000,28,1985,4.67621776504298

And then it also transcends them, in a plausible and credible manner.

5819162,4,B00DIR2PIW,"The Last Push is a very powerful and highly realistic portrayal of the problems faced by an astronaut alone in space after an accident kills his companion and nearly disables his ship. It very realistically portrays the psychological problems faced by a person in prolonged isolation which have been long reported by many sources. It is both a fine psychological drama and a conventional one as well as we share with the astronaut his worry as to whether he can get his engine started in time to pull him out of Venus orbit and back to Earth. This is why, incidentally, it is unfortunate that the trailer killed much of that drama by telling us in advance that the engine was eventually started. As well written and portrayed as this film  was, it is very disappointing that a crucial aspect of the plot, the canceling of the mission to Europa, is never plausibly explained. Instead we are merely told that things have changed and later that the dead astronaut needs to be buried and that the owner of the company which sent the astronauts into  space cannot take another death on his conscience. None of these are satisfactory explanations and therefore the canceling of the mission, which is central to the plot, seemed inexplicable and quite frankly stupid when one considers that virtually all of the resources needed for the mission had already been expended at that point.

Don't Watch it:  If you are looking for significant action or plot

Very simple movie and not un-typical in the genre - lone astronaut in space.  I enjoyed it, but it was very thin.  The movie was focused on isolation and how one would deal with that.  There was some amount of effort to play in some ""Apollo 13'ish we have to fix the broken space craft"" but it didn't play out with tension.  I enjoyed it, but I enjoy most anything where there is a spacecraft which implies I'm not a great critic for this segment of movies.  I think most space theme fans will at least enjoy it, but most for most it will fall into a 2 or 3 star category just because there really isn't a compelling plot or tension.  You are just observing someone dealing with Isolation - most of us could almost write the script.

Acting is pretty good - I can't say it's great.  The main character isn't supposed to be some colorful, fun, interesting character - he is intended to be quiet and deep - an interesting choice for what is essentially a solo performance.

I came into this movie seeing that it had been rated four stars, and was about traveling to Europa. I enjoy space travel movies so I figured why not. I had seen Europa Report and thought this might compare, but it didn't come close. Actually I don't know if it did because I turned it off about a half hour in.

The movie just feels awkward right off the bat. The actors and characters are not likeable at all and you don't know anything about their background. In almost every scene each actor makes some grimace and pushes their lips together forlornly as if to indicate they are sad. The main character is just flat boring. Part of this is his fault, but it is also clear that the writing is not helping him. The directing is also quite useless.

This is the first review I have written. I chose to write this because a review of four stars tends to be reliable, but for this movie it is way off.

I think those reviews were written by people with financial gain hinging on people renting the movie.  The reviews were canned sounding and smacked of sales pitches.  Wouldn't be at all surprised if the reviewers created fake accounts just to review this and other stinking bad movies and get the star ratings up so that more people would watch.  They just sounded totally fake.  In the context of now having watched this awful movie, I feel even stronger that the 5 star ratings are bogus.  The movie stinks.  There's just no other way to say it.

This movie was typical low budget, with 1970's technology models, and basically just one set used through 90% of the movie.  The plot was full of holes and unpredictable only in the terms of how low could it go, all except the ending in which, after years of traveling through space, struggling desperately to fix the damaged spacecraft just to get back to earth, (which he is mysteriously able to completely rewire in flight)  the main character for no apparent reason suddenly decides not to go home and be safe and reunited with his family, but instead to go shooting past earth on a suicide mission to resume the original mission plan, with no way to do so, and certain death awaiting him, which made no kind of sense whatsoever.
