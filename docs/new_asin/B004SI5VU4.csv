4462782,5,B004SI5VU4,"We discovered this series sort of by accident but are very glad we found it. George Gently, played by Martin Shaw is a Detective Inspector with a mind of his own who works with a Detective Sergeant John Bacchus, played by Lee Ingleby. Bacchus has a mind of his own as well but is plagued by the challenge of growing up.

Series three is a two episode series and follows Series 2 which has 4 episodes and Series 1 which has two episodes. Additionally there is a one episode pilot which introduced Gently to the TV audience. Although Series 3 makes sense alone it would be helpful to work through the other episodes in order to gain the full impact of this one.

BBC announced its intentions to produce Series 4 in September of 2010. Series 4 will have 2 episodes and features George Gently, Lee Ingleby, and Simon Hubbard as PC Taylor.

The series is good and will probably be enjoyed by those who appreciate British detective mysteries.",1312848000,4,936,4.5266272189349115
4462783,5,B004SI5VU4,"Martin Shaw (The Professionals & Judge John Deed) is like a good red wine - just gets better with age. He plays the role of Inspector George Gently to perfection, with Lee Ingleby as John Bacchus a very good foil.
Set in 60's UK, it evokes that era to perfection ( I lived it, so know it's right on!!) - the cars, clothing, music etc are all exactly right for that period.

If you want to sit down and be entertained by top actors without a great deal of violence or profanity, with plots that are well crafted, get this DVD - in fact, get Series One first and you will be hooked.

The Brits do this type of show SO well - I could list numerous crime series that I have watched and the best are out of UK.",1312848000,3,705,4.0285714285714285
4462784,5,B004SI5VU4,"Was there really only two episodes in series three?  If not,selling this set with only two episodes as ""series three"" is a rip-off.

4462785,5,B004SI5VU4,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""Series 3 continues the adventures of grizzled, no-nonsense Chief Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw) and his jumpy sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). The pair is tasked with investigating murders in 1960s Northumberland, their cases almost always containing layers of twists and reveals that leave them stunned by the end. Two shows on deck this time -- Gently Evil, Peace & Love -- running 90 minutes apiece. I confess I'm not much of a lover of the genre, but these Gently offerings are so well-staged and absorbing, I always find himself hanging on to each minute, up until the usually surprising reveal. The anchor is Martin Shaw, who consistently turns in great stuff as the eponymous inspector. Gently is understated and stern, yet he's doubtlessly a bad-ass and owns every scene he's in. He may not have the martial artistry or gunplay skills of your generic Hollywood Alpha, but everyone fears him and the guy is never wrong. Gently is quick to rebuke his over-eager and occasionally knuckle-headed partner and Bacchus takes umbrage at this. Still, Gently is so legendary, Bacchus knows how lucky he is to be paired with such a stud. Shaw and Ingleby have good chemistry together and despite their character's sporadic friction, there is affection there, approaching a father/son dynamic and it works. Both episodes are reliably strong, though the ""Gently Evil"" is my favorite. The twist was faintly telegraphed but the writers were deft enough to keep the twists rolling until the very end. The result is a tense, upsetting 90 minutes. ""Peace & Love"" has twists of its own, but ends up focusing on the social mores and anachronisms of the '60s. One of the reasons I enjoy the series is that the setting supplements the mystery and doesn't overpower it. Acorn knows how to do Blu-ray and their presentation here is sublime. The 1.78:1 widescreen transfer may be ""merely"" 1080i, but it is absolutely beautiful, razor-sharp and starkly colored. I don't care what the tech purists might say; ""p"" or not, this is as awesome a slice of video fidelity as I've seen in some time. A clean 2.0 stereo PCM provides the sound. No extras.""",1310515200,18,2176,4.915760869565218

4462788,5,B004SI5VU4,"New G.Gently episodes hot off the 2010 shelf. Gently has proven to be a winner with British Murder Mystery fans. This new set is no exception.

George Gently episodes are based on novels by Alan Hunter. This first series showed Commander Gently's wife killed right before his eyes. Through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. Very much like ""Midsomer Murders"" [recommended] without the multiple murdered victims, but with the multi-plots in police, private, and associates lives. Bacchus has a money problem in one of episode from this series. Good writing makes the show. Will the large volume of Hunter novels available for adaptation cause this show to continue? Hopefully!

Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus provides some laughs. Gently's grief, sometimes brings tears. An emotional crime series, mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. Setting is 1966.

Feature length episodes, each carry SUBTITLES.
""Gently Evil""--Gently and Bacchus investigate a brutal murder in a coastal Northumberland village. A BEAUTIFUL location to get bludgeoned. There are signs of a sympathetic nature to this killer of this girl. A birth certificate indicates Satan being her daughter's dad. There is much to uncover yet to get to the bottom of this crime. A dark nature here.

""Peace & Love""--Peace protesting and mob action against the police is due to the arrival of a nuclear sub. A demonstrator's leader is dead. Plenty of university turmoil surrounds the case when the investigation leads to a local campus for Gently and Bacchus. Jarrow is the location and football (soccer) was supposed to be the game.

Not recommended for the kiddies, bloody good murder, and emphasis on the bloody.",1303948800,37,1990,5.284810126582278

4462801,5,B004SI5VU4,"GEORGE GENTLY, Series 3.  This is a British television series that debuted in 2007 on the BBC. The crime/drama/British mystery production has aired on PBS stations in the United States.  The show centers on Chief Inspector George Gently, an old school copper, once one of the few good men at Scotland Yard. On the eve of his retirement, the world-weary cop decides to pursue one final murder case, suspecting that it was committed by a gangster who's already gotten away with the murder of Gently's own wife. So, as played by the sixty-something Tony nominated Martin Shaw, Gently relocates to Northumberland, in the North East of England, tucked in just below Hadrian's Wall, a relic of the Roman occupation of Britain a millennium or so ago. Gently takes on  headstrong sidekick John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY); starts solving murders in a time of profound change: the 1960s. The series is based on Alan Hunter's novels. In DVD format, there is a 2-disc boxed set, running approximately 176 minutes, widescreen format. The entertainment is also available screened. And, praises be, thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles. Or how else would anyone on this side of the pond understand a word of that local dialect?

The episodes are:
Disc 1
Gently Evil

Gently and Bachus are called to a crime scene at a working-class boarding house, where they find a young woman brutally beaten to death.  But her eyes have been discreetly covered  with a white handkerchief. The victim, a good time girl semi-prostitute, carried her daughters birth certificate in her purse.  The name of the childs father was crossed out and ""Satan"" penciled in. As they follow this lead, Gently and Bacchus probe the  awful secrets of a family that seems to suffer from, and harbor, pure evil.  Features Ruth McCabe, (MY LEFT FOOT), Daniel Casey(MIDSOMER MURDERS).

Disc 2
Peace & Love

Young peace protesters from Durham University clash with the police when it is rumored that nuclear submarines will be docking at the local naval base. The next morning, the demonstrators fiery leader, the womanizing faculty member Fraser Barratt, is found dead at dockside. The investigation takes Gently and Bacchus on campus, where big changes in the social, political, and sexual spheres have left little peace in the normally placid groves of academia.  Features Sarah Lancashire (LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX, THE PARADISE) as another young academic, and Warren Clarke (DALZIEL AND PASCO) as the campus security chief.

The first episode is particularly powerful and engrossing, coming to an unexpected conclusion. The second, though it too reaches an unexpected conclusion, and is powerful and memorable, does feel like it is based on slightly dated original material.  Distinguished casts give us uniformly fine acting. Shaw, whom many viewers consider to be the best actor ever to play Adam Dalgleish in the televised versions of P.D. James' crime novels, has the chops and the gravitas to play Gently, and to carry the show. He and Ingleby play off each other with warmth and humor.  Author Hunter set his work in East Anglia, around Norfolk, where he grew up; however, the television series has been set in more northerly latitude, filmed around Durham and in Ireland. The 1960s were, as any survivor can tell you, an energetically eventful era: the tense political climate of the Cold War; then, attitudes and values begin to change as the Swinging Sixties belatedly hit the North East, a process the scripts show in fine detail. The series is shot in high definition; scripts are witty and ingenious, direction is stylish.  Rural Britain - or is it Ireland?--provides a beautiful backdrop for the action.  The production, which has been compared to FOYLES WAR and MIDSOMER MURDERS, is fully-fleshed out, and fully involving.",1403308800,,3809,5.086677367576244
4462802,5,B004SI5VU4,"Oh George! - he's such a great man - has integrity, intelligence, compassion and wit -- and his cohort could have been a Beatle",1399248000,,127,4.333333333333333
4462803,5,B004SI5VU4,"My only complaint about the third season of George Gently is that it contains only two episodes, but what episodes they are. Set in the 1960s and graced with excellent production values that give an impeccable period flavor to the stories, the Gently series also has the benefit of great casting and writing. Martin Shaw is the the veteran Gently and Lee Ingleby the upstart, ambitious Bacchus, and their relationship, oscillating between true friendship and bitter antagonism, very much like a faux father and son combination. the cases often uncover a grim bedrock of hate and prejudice in British society of the time, and the endeavor has a truly gritty tone, both physically and psychologically. Highly recommended.",1395705600,,719,5.153846153846154
4462804,5,B004SI5VU4,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

This is terrible value for money. The shows are O.K. but not as good as Inspector Lynley, Inspector Lewis, Midsommer Murders or Foley's War",1370649600,2,380,4.602941176470588
4462812,4,B004SI5VU4,"George Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is the kind of Chief Detective Inspector that we all would want advising us and working for us in our town. Detective Gently is from the UK and rose through the ranks at Scotland Yard. His wife was murdered in front of his eyes and he decided to retire. However, a case came his way that involved his wife's murderer, and he took it. The case took him to the north of England, Northumberland, near the Scottish border, and he found he liked it. Gently found his new home.

The time is 1964, England is still in the leeway between the conservative UK and the new generation that wants to be free. The bouffant hairdos, the shirt and ties and blue suits. The times they are a'changin', but The Beatles have not invaded as of yet. Northumberland seems to be the seat of drug running and other crimes, and Chief Detective Inspector is kept quite busy. His partner in crime, so to speak, is young Detective Sergeant, Lee Ingleby, aka John Bacchus. Detective Sgt Bacchus
is a work in progress, and Gently has some work in front of him. Bacchus is very young, but determined to be the best detective he can be. He is married to the Chief Constable's daughter, and it appears he married her because she was pregnant, and not because he loved her. We can see trouble on the horizon. We don't know much about Gently's personal life, this is all business, and he is having difficulty while mourning his wife's death.

Gently is a very classy man, and he is a perfectionist. He is also one of the more intelligent detectives, and we learn how he solves a case. He is polite, does not believe in brutality with the people who he arrests or brings in for questioning. Brutality seems to be the right of passage at this time, and it is a good lesson that Gently bestows on Bacchus. The cases they solve are extraordinary and so well written. This is a series that keeps us involved and interested. An intelligent series that appeals to the masses. The mystery series that the UK brings to us are addicting. They are far and above some of the best written shows. No wonder that PBS brings these shows to us. George Gently and John Bacchus become involved in murders at a sex club, with corrupt politicians, gangs, drug running and in-between run into racism. They deal with all of this deftly and rarely encounter violence.

One of the better mystery series from the UK. I read recently that the George Gently series will continue, and we shall see more of a detective series that has become a favorite.

4462815,5,B004SI5VU4,"If you like British police procedurals, GEORGE GENTLY is a delight.  In this third series, George has let his hair grow longer (it's always getting in his way) and Bacchus, his twerpy side-kick. is wearing his hair shorter over last season. He could be one of the Beatles--they use hair to indicate time setting.  Although the series presumably takes place in the 1960's it's not so retro that it's annoying.  There's still some forensics, although most of the crimes are solved with interviewing and intuition.  The characters, George and Bacchus, continually share their perception of the cases they are working on which usually match what the viewers are thinking.  So, it's satisfying.  You believe you are solving them right along with them.

George has taken a fatherly interest in Bacchus's soon to be ex-wife which adds some fun tension to the plots.  Bacchus is his usual insensitive, sexist self with women.  Sometimes you wonder HOW George puts up with him, but they seem to be a good team.  The crimes are original and not easily solvable.

You don't feel like you are watching a show.  It seems like the events are really transpiring and the dialogue is great fun.  Esquire magazine thinks it's a brilliant series.  It just may be, but subtly so.  I'm enjoying it.  Love to watch it while on the treadmill as time passes quickly viewing it.",1360281600,,1353,4.817391304347826

This one is a solid show and it comes from a series of novels. This series is only two episodes long, each a mini movie. The last series was 4 episodes. The next series which is available now is only 2 as well. But the fifth series which is being shown in 2012 is again 4 eps. this show takes you back to the midsixties in northern england. It was a time of change and a time of chain smoking. SO everyone was poisoned by second hand smoke whereever they went. But this is a crime show about a detective and his sergeant who are out to solve murders. The country was much less tolerant than today in many regards and this is a time travel trip back to a long vanished era. The 1960's. The cases are realistic and the show has that drama edge you'd expect. It's not a action show but a detective show and I watch any british detective show I can. THis is a good one acting wise and the stories are fine too. This one features the actor who played the sidekick detective in 'midsommer murders' too, he playes a different type of character totally.

4462823,5,B004SI5VU4,"I thought this series was a bit rough about the edges in its first series.  It was a bit too hung up on being set in the sixties and in the main character's loss of his wife to a supposed murder.  all of this has been put on the back burner by series two and three so that i am avidly anticipating series four.

martin shaw, a wonderful actor seen on other uk tv series, stars as chief George Gently with his cohort Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). These two in combo is what makes this series.  Often the young whippersnapper is just cute in these series but here there is a really delightful screen pairing. Bacchus makes mistakes left and right, both personally and professionally, but his chief guides him through these upheavals. this even includes the younger man's misadventures with the opposite sex despite his being married, something american network tv would never touch.

by this time the sixties are a backdrop to this series but are less obvious in this rural backwater.  we don't get hit over the head with the era every second as we did in series one. one thing i find as an improvement is that the characters are not constantly on their cell phones.  however, they are handicapped by not having computers with crime databases and dna as forensic evidence.

if you haven't discovered this series yet, i highly recommend it.  i just viewed seasons one-three on netflix instant viewing.

8439736,3,B004SI5VU4,"""George Gently"" Series 3 takes place in Durham and Newcastle in 1966, two years after Series 2. The death penalty has been abolished in England in the interim. DS Bacchus has a mop haircut now, like a Beatle, and continues to struggle with the implications of the sexual revolution. He's attracted to a swinger lifestyle but all too aware of what self-indulgence cost him, as his estranged wife Lisa asks for a divorce. In a surprising change of heart, DCI Gently now approves of Bacchus' rough interview techniques. ""Gently Evil"" is an outlandish, sensationalist, implausible mystery, riddled with personal angst and a lot of loose ends. It seems to have been inspired by the stale story ""The Bad Seed."" ""Peace and Love"", in keeping with the series' theme, touches on issues of the day: the underground gay community and the stark choice women face between career and family.

The episodes are:

DS Bacchus is separated from his wife Lisa and frustrated with Lisa and Gently's friendship when the bludgeoned body of Dominica Charlton is found in the bedroom of her flat in ""Gently Evil."" She carried her 13-year-old daughter Agnes' (Natalie Garner) birth certificate in her handbag, with the name of her estranged husband crossed out and ""Satan"" written in its place. Agnes lives with her father Alan Charlton (Daniel Casey) on the coast, and Bacchus insists that Alan killed Dominica, who was mentally ill and prone to dissolute behavior. The investigation is interrupted by the disappearance of a 2-year-old boy from a campsite in the town where Alan and Agnes live. Gently grows suspicious when he learns that Dominica's brother Darren Paige (Shaun Dooley) has been present for a number of child disappearances. This mystery is outlandish and doesn't make sense.

""Peace and Love"" sees anti-nuclear protesters converge on the docks, where a Polaris submarine carrying missiles with nuclear warheads will find its new home. DS Bacchus is among those officers who round up the rowdy protesters and haul them to police headquarters, where Prof. Fraser Barratt (Emun Elliot) confronts DCI Gently without having been charged. Barratt is found dead in the water at the docks the next day, with an injury from a blow to his head and oil on his clothes. A student with whom he argued at a nearby pub, Elizabeth Higgs (Kerrie Hayes), is missing, as is illiterate dockhand David Swift (James Atherton) whom she was tutoring. Gently and Bacchus look to Durham University for answers, where they meet Prof. Mallory Brown (Sarah Lancashire), also an anti-nuclear activist, and head porter Charles Hexton (Warren Clarke) who spies on the protesters.",1505433600,,2639,5.062068965517241
