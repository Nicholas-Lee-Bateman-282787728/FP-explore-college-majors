I can deeply analyse it. Perhaps, it will be a story of its own. That would tell how gracious this movie is.",1494892800,,265,4.32

8689144,5,B00PT61RFW,"I first saw this film during a screening at UC Berkeley in California. It's amazing & very emotional & heartfelt. By the time the movie was over, everyone in the room was tearing up. This film is about a woman's struggle to survive during the Khmer Rouge era. The film's cast & crew are all Cambodian as well, which makes it unique. As most other films about Khmer Rouge are made by French or USA. Like the Killing Fields. The quality of the filming is like a B/C rating. The budget was low, so do not expect box office type of special effects. But the story it tells is captivating in itself. I recommend this movie to anyone whose interested in Cambodian History during 1975-1979.",1418256000,3,682,4.464
