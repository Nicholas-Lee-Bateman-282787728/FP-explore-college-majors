1542444,5,B00005JNU5,"Mex Headroom lasted two seasons in the UK, before it was brought to US tv and quickly dissolved into the waist land of

lost brilliance.  I've found a site that has both seasons

available on DVD-R, but that's not what any of us want.  In

1987 the thought of a future run by and on television and computers must have seemed intolerable and insane to many.  Someone in the

""I'm in Charge"" dept must think that no one would be interested

in seeing this again.  How wrong those in charge can be.  sounds a little like what Max was all about doesnt it?  Make us happy for a change and bring this back.  Who knows what could happen?",1150934400,15,630,4.245762711864407
1542445,5,B00005JNU5,"It's hard to say what was best about Max Headroom -- it's dead-bang accurate, Postman-esque assessment of the media industry -- its prophetic extrapolation of 21st century realities -- or its hilarious dry-ball humor.  Memorable quote from the show --  Edison yells at Murray, ""Since when has the news been entertainment?""  Murray, puzzled, pauses and replies, ""Since the beginning?""

Max had it all, and America was not ready for this in 1987.  But in this age of media elections, televised terrorism, and cyber-privacy invasions, Max is more relevant than ever.  The studio needs to quit stalling already and release the entire short-lived series on DVD, not just the pilot ep.  ""20 minutes into the future"" is NOW and Max's fans are STILL WAITING!!!",1149465600,22,752,5.065040650406504
1542446,5,B00005JNU5,"...and I don't mean Amazon!  This is for you, TV Powers-That-Be.

When Max Headroom came out we watched it devotedly, because we knew good and well that you'd get rid of it as soon as you figured out which switches to throw.

Here it is over 20 years later, and you still haven't figured out that there is MONEY TO BE MADE off this thorn that is still in your sides.  People want to buy this show.  They WILL buy this show.  You can have a tidy little income coming in continuously off it, and you can laugh yourselves sick because when it comes in, most of us will be watching it on--you guessed it--television.

So load it up with commercials (not Blipverts, please!) or do whatever else you have to do, and get it on the market.  We're w-w-w-w-w-aiting!",1148083200,90,756,4.35
1542447,5,B00005JNU5,"While I'd love to see this on DVD, I'm not holding my breath.

If Max Headroom proved anything, its that Television doesn't like mirrors.  This show lampooned the Television industry, taking all of its flaws and peccadilloes and writing them large across America. Max' version of television in the 21st century hit way too close to the mark. The last thing the TV industry wants is viewers to start *thinking*, particularly about itself.

Does everyone remember David Lynch's ""Twin Peaks?""  I thought so. Now, who remembers the series ""On the Air"", by Lynch and his partner Mark Frost, set in a 1950's era live television studio?  I'm not surprised - it was cancelled after 2 episodes, which were scathing send ups of the TV business.

Predicting a 500-channel smorgasboard of channels, reality television and webcams, MH was clearly ahead of its time.  Let's hope we get a DVD soon, complete with clips from the original broadcasts, and even the entire made-for-tv movie by Channel 4.

1542839,4,B00005JNU5,"When he first appeared, Max Headroom was a phenomenon. No one had seen a character quite like him and, as viewers, many of us were captivated not only by the visual impact of the series but also by its dystopian look and feel.
Back then we felt, many of us, that it correctly forecasted the increasing dominance of television in our lives and the ever-growing, greed-driven meddling of network executives who kept downgrading electronic journalism until it was little more than gossip and thinly disguised advertising to boost revenues.
The producers got it wrong.
So did we.
Television has become all but irrelevant today at a time when our cellphones have more computing power than NASA had when it put men on the moon. Cellphones, laptops, and other electronic devices now allow us to watch movies, play games, search for information, take photos and film events, or just buy an eBook and read it while having a latte in our favorite cafe. We no longer need to sit in the living room watching a favorite television program as it is constantly interrupted by companies that are trying desperately to sell us things we probably don't need. Instead, we can buy a commercial-free DVD and watch it on our laptops, or stream a program live on a tablet. We don't have to rely on overpaid television ""journalists"" who were chosen more for their looks than their expertise to tell us what's going on because we can watch videos of events shot by people just like us. If we want to know what's going on in the world today all we have to do is tune into YouTube or wait until someone from one of our social networks forwards a video to us, complete with commentary that we can interact with.
That said, there is still a lot to like about Max Headroom, the alter ago of erstwhile television reporter Edison Carter (played nicely by Matt Frewer.) Max and Edison have something that is lacking in many television programs today; a social conscience. They stand up for the little guy who has been manipulated and abused by powerful interests with their own agendas. They take risks and they speak out when the rich and powerful overstep their boundaries. Produced at a time when Ronald Reagan and his cronies were cutting social programs left, right, and sideways while spending billions on defense; reducing the tax burden of the wealthy by shifting it to the middle class; ""borrowing"" billions more from Social Security (which they never intended to pay back - and still haven't); and giving Wall Street free rein to pillage the economy Max and Edison were unabashed defenders of the average person being squeezed unmercifully by the wealthy.
In my opinion, it's worth watching this series for that reason alone.
The special effects that were so groundbreaking when Max first hit the airwaves are no longer. In plain point of fact, they're kind of cheesy today. Despite that, it's still fun to watch Max make network executives uncomfortable as he trashes sponsors in his stuttering outbursts. The dystopian look and feel of the show still holds up and though the scripts are not always brilliant they are still, at their core, on-point social commentary that is - if anything - even more relevant today.
All in all, Max delivers and it's a series I have no trouble recommending.",1461628800,6,3269,4.777385159010601

PROs
 Over a quarter-century later, this serial is *still* worth watching, despite its inclusion of some of the most atrocious pitfalls of 80s TV. If you are unfamiliar with 80s television, this series gives you a legitimate reason to delve in.
 anti-establishment; cyberpunk; prescient; subversive. These are just a few of the designations commonly used to describe it... how often do you hear those terms describing network programming?
 Simply put, it is a unique program in the history of television; this alone merits an audience.
 The wit of the show's fictional artificial intelligence (Max) holds up pretty well today, more due to the actor's expressions coupled with clever manipulation of the audio/video rather than the dialogue itself. If you weren't around in the 80s and haven't seen it previously, it might be particularly humorous.

CONs
 The acting was deplorable, even by 4:3 era television standards (and yes, the 4:3 aspect ratio is retained in this DVD set). The exception to the bad acting was of course Matt Frewer doing Max.
 The pace is somewhat sluggish (par for the course in 20th century shows), and the script doesn't meet 21st century standards (although Max is consistently good).

Put this series on your bucket list.",1437177600,6,1527,5.100401606425703

They also predicted the ""reality"" show genre as well as the public's fascination with trials.  With Max's generation--all trials are game shows and commercials have a huge influence on the unsuspecting public as well as TV ratings because they determine what people buy, eat and accept as real (funny to recognize Bill Maher as one of the villains).  One of the only things that hasn't come true is the way Max's gen disposes of their dead--the body banks, etc--although there are people out there who have sold body parts it's still illegal in some form or another!!

1543489,5,B00005JNU5,"Lots of TV shows don't age well, and watching them years later a person can wonder why they ever wasted time on it originally.  I just watched the whole series over a weekend and it was just as good as I remember and still seems fresh and relevant.  One thing I did miss was the ability to turn subtitles on.  Doing that makes it easier to watch in a noisy room and makes it easier to catch all the dialog.  Otherwise I have to focus on it too much.  Given this originated in the UK in the '80s, it may be that they didn't have that then, but it sure would have been nice to have added it.  The portrayal of Zik-Zak definitely reflects on how the Japanese were viewed in the '80s.  That was about the only thing that made me reflect that this was an '80s show.  For those who complain about the image quality, I wonder if you are trying to watch it on a big screen TV or something?  I just watched it on what used to be considered a normal size TV and the image and quality sound were fine.  It's ironic to excuse the producers of this show for not imagining big screen TVs given that so much else was anticipated.  Some things I hadn't remembered but had an Oh, wow moment again, was when blank Reg was put on trial for Network zipping and the trial was a game show called 'You the Jury' in the Academy episode, or the leader of the White Brigade saying his was the first terrorist organization to realize the full potential of merchandising in the War episode.  If you are too young to have seen the series when it was first aired, try it out. It's too bad it got cancelled so soon after starting since you can start to see more character development in the second season, but then again it is amazing that this subversive show ever got on U.S. network TV, especially in the 80s in the midst of the Reagan years and each episode is pretty much about Edison Carter fighting the good fight against the evils of the networks, including Network 23, the hand that feeds him.

I used to watch it on TV when it was broadcast in 1987....
Groudndbreaking and WAY ahead of its time!!!!

So the good thing is that we FINALLY got it on DVD....and that's basically it...

Now, the BAD things are:

-the transfer is almost Laserdisc quality; I know it wasn't sourced from them cause I have the ONLY ones that were released(the 3 Japanese discs with the first 6 episodes that had a screwed up soundtrack; dialogues on both channels , music on one side and sound effects on the other side...quality control, ZERO!!! ..and they were Japanese!).

it's grainy and below par at best...the original source was FILM, not video, but it seems that it was sourced from a UMATIC(video) from the film....

-the soundtrack is ONLY STEREO (HELLO??? ARE WE STILL IN 1985?), there is NO surround mix of this... at all...cost cutting at its extreme...

-THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES AT ALL!!! COME ON!!!!! this is the least we could have got!!!!

And for the price , it's way overpriced..this is $19.99 pricetag; tops, not $40.00 material...we only get a measly 5 DVDs...it's quite a ripoff...
Trust me , I am VERY benevolent when I rate but this is TWO star material...ONLY BECAUSE WE GOT IT ON DVD!!!!
(and let's not even count the fact that amaz*n does NOT offer the ""lenticular"" picture cover, just a normal cover...very bad value from amaz*n)",1358640000,2,1388,4.663934426229508

The odd thing about this series is just how close it seems to be when you look at the subcontext of what's going on in the shows. People generally aren't living life as much as they're watching it on tv --and being amused by the antics of Max when he decides to break in. Where the show says ""20 minutes into the future"" it really could say ""This afternoon, today.""

That being said, I still am enjoying watching this show from front to back. I would also like to see this updated and remade today--just to see how it could be pulled off. Sure couldn't be worse than 'reality' tv..",1351468800,,817,4.203821656050955
1543576,4,B00005JNU5,"""Max Headroom"" was by far and away the coolest, most intelligent show to come out of the 1980s. Seeing much further than merely twenty minutes into the future, the writers' vision has proven prophetic in many ways; the whole world plugged in and ""hyper-connected,"" 24-hour news networks seeking ratings as the ultimate bottom line--truth be damned, the incestuous relationships of corporate media with politics, religion, and--most chillingly--law enforcement, data-mining, artificial intelligence, subliminal advertising, fertility clinics dabbling in eugenics, as well as the yawning economic and cultural divisions in an increasingly stratified and resource-strapped society. Dont get me wrong, this show is also great fun to watch, with lots of campy humor and comedic gestures to maintain narrative buoyancy. The look of the show may best be described as a kind of retro-futuristic with elements of '80s punk and classic dystopian sci-fi thrown in for good measure--think ""Blade Runner"" meets ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" The acting is surprisingly good, too, with the wonderful Matt Freuer in the dual role of TV-journalist Edison Carter and his wise-cracking cyber alter-ego Max Headroom (who was doing Jim Carey's schtick better than Jim Carey ever did long before ""In Living Color""); and strong supporting work from Jeffrey Tambor, George Coe, and the lovely Amanda Pays, not to mention a whole raft of interesting, then up-and-coming talent like Charles Rocket and Bill Maher.

1543579,4,B00005JNU5,"This is the short lived 1987 science fiction TV series called Max Headroom. The TV series is set in the future where TV networks are at war with each other for ratings and where as a result of that war, TV's can't be turned off for any reason. The TV stays on day in and day out even when people are sleeping and also, people who are homeless also have access to TV.

In the series, the main network, Network 23 is always in search of things to do exposes on. Their main reporter Edison Carter(Matt Frewer) is always hot on the trail of a story, but one night, he gets knocked out with the last thing that he sees is something that says ""Max Headroom"" before losing consciousness. Computer genius Bryce(Chris Young)creates a computer generated alter ego of Carter's and the end result is a digital likeness of Edison Carter that keeps saying ""Max Headroom"" repeatedly, which is how he got it's name. Carter always continued getting to the bottom of things despite the objections of his producer Murray(Jeffrey Tambor), whose only thing is that he only wants to please the network executives and also, at the same time, tries to balance his job and his relationship with Edison, and his co-worker Theora Jones(Amanda Pays), who is a pseudo love interest for Edison though she really isn't that interested in him for that type of thing. The other competing TV networks and their allies try to stop Edison Carter every time, but Edison always stays one step ahead and even when he is down and supposedly out, he comes back with a vengeance to see that his stories and exposes make it to Network 23 and it's viewership despite the objections of Network 23 executives and the executives of all the other competing networks. Along the way, his computer generated alter ego Max Headroom also aids and abets Carter when it comes to getting what he needs to get done and is also Edison's staunchest ally when the going does get tough. Plus, Max is what Edison might be personality-wise as he stutters, makes cracks about the shows that the networks, including Network 23, show and also, all the things regarding TV. But, at times, Max also got on Edison's nerves and was also a pain in the neck to Edison during those times, especially when Max interrupted the live transmission of Network 23 by making cracks about sponsors and making fun of network business. Plus, in this fictional future, we see that that there are many barbaric themed TV shows with violence and other meaningless imagery. The show was always action packed and always kept you guessing until the bitter end.

This show was launched in the wake of it's 60 minute British produced TV pilot that was called ""Max Headroom:20 Minutes Into The Future(called The Original Story for VHS home video release)"", and also, all the Coca Cola TV commercials that Max Headroom appeared in advertising the soft drink that were shown repeatedly from 1986 to 1987. Max Headroom, despite being a digitized ego of actor Matt Frewer, actually became a sex symbol for that brief time that he was in the world's spotlight. The series premiered on the ABC network and though British TV producers did produce the series, the vast majority of the actors were all US born. They simply asked Chrysalis Video and Lakeside Productions to produce an American form of the series for US television and they delivered. The show was a mid-season replacement for a show that ABC cancelled from it's schedule and the ratings were good enough to renew it for another season, but the ratings dropped because the show was in competition with other popular TV shows of the day, such as Dallas and Miami Vice. A total of 14 episodes were produced.

I used to watch this show religiously back in the day when it was first running on the ABC network. I had become a fan of Max Headroom seeing all of those Coca Cola commercials that he appeared in constantly running on TV on all the major networks. I watched the show until the final episode was shown. It was a disappointment that this show didn't really get the chance that it truly deserved as it was one of the most original and most innovative TV shows ever created for the small screen. Again, it was a terrific show and was never dull.

This DVD set has all 14 episodes of the series on four DVD's. There is also a fifth DVD of special features.

PROS: The episodes of the TV series look as fresh and new as the day that they were originally broadcast. The episodes look very colorful and the audio sounds wonderful. The special features include six behind the scenes featurettes that includes interviews with the cast and crew talking about their experiences working on the show and how they all made it work. There are also talks with the writers and those who developed all the technological aspects of the show. There is also a small featurette, which features producer Brian Frankish sharing his reflections on being a producer for the show.

CONS: Matt Frewer does not participate with the rest of the cast and crew in the featurettes on this DVD set. There are also no Max Headroom Coca Cola commercials as a feature, which would have also made this worth owning as well as it would have been a trip down memory lane back to the 1980's.

Still, it is on DVD and that is wonderful and despite the shortcomings, it's still worth owning if you were a fan of Max Headroom.

Overall, the Max Headroom TV series is worth revisiting if you were a fan of the series when it ran on TV. It is also worth revisiting if you were a fan of Max Headroom in general if you also enjoyed all the Coca Cola TV commercials that were always constantly being shown on TV when least expected on all the major networks. The point is that no fan of this series or even Max Headroom himself shouldn't be without this DVD set in their DVD libraries.",1327104000,3,5806,4.586705202312139
1543580,5,B00005JNU5,"Watching the series again was an enjoyable experience. Others have made comments about the video quality was not the greatest, well quality was as I remembered. It was produced in the era of saving shows on to tape not the more expensive film. The show was set in a ""Dark Future"", so the original source video was not as vibrant as other show of the time.

Over all I think the quality and sound is good. It reminds me of the 80's, before we had great cable signals, digital channels, or DVDs.

If you are a die hard fan of the show, check the price. I bought mine when it was $25. A great price, but I had mine wish-listed for awhile...",1327104000,2,637,4.213114754098361

1543712,4,B00005JNU5,"from my review here:[...]

This past summer, a (nerdy) classic from the past was finally released on DVD - the complete '87-'88 TV series of Max Headroom.

In complete disclosure - I only caught a few episodes of this the first time around but remembered how it was fairly cutting edge, so was curious to watch it again. In most ways, it still holds up, really. The challenge of course for highly technical, future-predicting shows like this (and say, movies like 2001 and Blade Runner) is that they will just get it wrong, or that they are too much a product of their time and that ends up biasing their predictions considerably, or that many things we take for granted in looking back simply didn't exist at all - hence fairly impossible to predict them.

On the cool side - this show either takes for granted or predicts many things that are far more prevalent in today's society, to wit:

- the even greater income/lifestyle division between haves and have-nots (the `fringe' depicted in nearly every episode where the `rabble' of society don't do much beyond sit in their shantytowns and watch crappy TV, is reminiscent of Gibson's cyberpunk Sprawl Trilogy of the same era);

- the ability to track nearly anything/everything via satellites and computer monitoring - Theora monitors and assists Edison from Network 23's HQ while hacking any computer system they need to - the animated views and her constant directions/descriptions to Edison also predate The Matrix by about 20+ years too for that matter;

- government information control, censorship and the notion of `pay to play' - certainly the first two have been with us since Orwell and earlier, but Max Headroom put a new spin on it in a more Huxley vein - the information consumed daily by most viewers is mostly `infotainment' done to beat the other networks for ratings above all else;

- along the lines of the point just made, the dumbing down of broadcast content with malevolent purposes behind it (anyone ever watch Fox ""News""?);

- identity theft and the ramifications of becoming a `nobody' despite needing a real identity to survive in modern society. Here the entity responsible is a computer/AI, however, not simply computer `burglars' as typically seen today, but the problem is remarkably the same;

- a TV courtroom where justice seems largely arbitrary and (again) done for ratings - not to discover truth;

- corporate sponsorship and ultimate control over broadcast content. This has been a problem since there was advertising, radio, TV, magazines, etc. so Max hardly predicted it - BUT - the extreme examples of it seen here in at least three different episodes demonstrate the extent to which corporations may seek to effectively take the law into their own hands when given the opportunity (or in the absence of rules/laws otherwise);

- TV-based elections where the outcomes are unpredictable and in some cases, suspect or simply a means to an end for the behind the scenes players;

It's true that despite Edison's constant use of on-the-spot reporting and communication over videocam - today's cam would be a heck of a lot smaller, possibly very miniature and unnoticed by the casual observer. Theora's computer also owes a bit to Terry Gilliam's Brazil when you see her typing on it (think ancient manual typewriter connected to a modern computer terminal, just like they had all over the place in Brazil as a style cue). The animation used is more than a bit dated - but then again, Fry's (also known as Mecca for nerds) still uses a DOS-based inventory and point-of-sales system, so if it works, why mess with success?

Now it's also true that in some cases, the **idea** behind the episode is the revolutionary part - the execution is sometimes left wanting. While the main characters (Edison, Murray and Theora) are generally believable - most of the `executives' at Network 23 are little more than talking heads with pretty inane dialogue. This was a recurring gripe of mine with Babylon 5 - while the concepts and ideas were pretty cool - seeing Bruce Boxleitner yell `get the hell out of our galaxy' to the Shadow aliens was pretty cornball when you watched it. Oh Tron, what a wicked web we weave. :)

Charles Rocket (RIP) does a great star turn in the first episode as the head of Network 23 - then reappears as a rival network villain in three later episodes. And Morgan Sheppard is great as Blank Reg of Big Time TV - despite looking like the oldest punk in existence the way they have him made up (all but Johnny Rotten's dad in appearance).

On some of the predictions they got wrong - Well, TV networks do not control the earth; Most of Earth's population does not live in a burned-out slum - yet; We don't spend all our time watching TV (that's what the Internet is for, after all :) ); and we don't have `body banks' with people roaming the streets, kidnapping you for organs (or do we?).

But what about Max Headroom himself? He was effectively a computer copy of Edison Carter, the crusading reporter and central character of the series. There are episodes (certainly the first of course) where Max is directly involved in the plot - there are also several episodes where he is largely window dressing and only makes a few sporadic quips or jokes here and there between the main action of that particular story. I'm not sure if they intended that, or if it simply worked out that way in trying to come up with enough cutting edge stories without having Max kind of lampooning things midstream. It would have been neat to see them explore more of Max's personality in depth - they hint at it from time to time but usually veer away back to the main story involving Edison and the other main characters in most episodes, unfortunately.

The entire series is only 14 episodes - on the DVD there is one that never aired in the US but did later in AU. So it's not like sitting down to watch the entire run of even the original Star Trek (79 episodes) - they were really just getting started when the show ended. There is also a bonus DVD included in the set with writer/producer and cast interviews. Unfortunately the star of the show, Matt Frewer, is not among them - but you can see at least one interview with him on YouTube if you look.

All in all, this series is definitely worth checking out - more so if you are a nerdy or sci-fi enthusiast. Max, we hardly knew ye.",1290643200,6,6377,4.673505798394291

Not only is the technology astoundingly prescient -- with a few exceptions, the characters are using things that were only imagined then but are part of our daily life now, in the way they predicted -- the social and political issues the characters do battle with have come to pass or are looming on our horizons. If ""24"" was written by Jon Stewart (of the Daily Show), it might turn out like this; rapid pace and interlocking plotlines, spiced with perceptive humor, delivered by intensely human and oddly believable characters.

It's true that the USA pilot is a retelling of pretty much the exact same story so the BBC movie is a bit redundant, but if you're putting out everything else associated with the show, it seems a shame not to include the actual basis for the show.

But where I had hoped for all the quirky Max Headroom smart-alec remarks as the show went to commercial and unbelievably not even the Farwell Address were to be seen. They've given us the best digitized pictures of the official episodes, but that's it. The Bonus Disc is okay, good to see the partial cast reunion, they were amazed to see each other after all these years. The host really sits back most of the time and lets them talk which made it very personal. The absence of Matt Frewer is glaring to say the least, but getting some input from the writers and directors and producers provided some interesting insight. I am glad I still have the VHS tapes I made all those years ago and saved all these years. I'm not the most ardent Max Headroom fan and I'm almost wishing now I hadn't bought this set with these omissions. I must say, I don't really recommend buying it unless you really are a deeply connected fan. Borrow it from someone you know who has it if you just want to see it.

As for the show, the best word I can use to to describe it is prescient. The core ideas behind the show are brilliant, looking back over the past 23 years it hit upon some really good questions. But the show was saddled with being rushed into production to make money NOW and just did not allow for the ideas to be properly analyzed and presented. The writing was mostly bland and faded to downright horrible in the end. I don't fault the actors, they did what they could with it. The show just needed more time to be discussed and logically thought out. The seeds were there. It was brilliant lambasting of network TV and society that could have been so much more. The script writers just didn't really click, they were not ready for what this show should have been. Ah well, what could have been...

True, the set does not include every single item that a Max Headroom fanatic might wish for. The original UK movie is absent for example, as is the music video for the Art of Noise's 'Paranoimia,' and those are genuine disappointments. Both of them would have greatly added to this DVD set's value.

The 'New Coke' commercials are also not included; but for those of us who truly loved Max Headroom, those commercials were a grotesque and venal abomination anyway.

Never mind what the set does NOT include, though. It DOES include every episode of the TV show, and that's really all ""The Complete Series"" means, yes?

All things considered (and putting aside the aforementioned omissions), I have only two minor complaints with this DVD set: 1) The TV show's 23-year-old video quality really would have benefitted from remastering, and 2) Assembling ""Members of the Cast"" for a round table discussion to stick into the Extras is almost meaningless when you omit the STAR of the show, Matt Frewer. The man's not dead. Why couldn't they get him to participate?

However, neither of those complaints is significant enough to make me regret my purchase. I loved Max Headroom when it was new, and this DVD set fulfills all the demands of my Nostalgia.",1283731200,4,1439,4.786290322580645
1543983,4,B00005JNU5,"It is 20 minutes into the future and this is the world as the series Max Headroom sees it. A medium that has often been called a ""vast wasteland"" is now the very thing that populates and dominates this vast wasteland of a world. It is a post-apocalyptic like world where everyone and everything is ruled by television and the interference of a transmission is a worse transgression than even murder. Every man,woman and child has direct access to a set,which has become the opiate of the people. Consumerism rules and television dictates their tastes,what they wear,what they eat and what they can do. Although there are rebels(more often than not called"" blanks""),off switches for the medium are illegal. Network 23 dominates the airwaves with it's big Japanese backed sponsor the ""Zik-Zak"" Corporation.
To illustrate just how dependant people are on television in this world there is an ep in which a huge apartment complex collapses. The thing most of the survivors cherish out of all their possessions is their tiny sets. Stock markets have been superseded by Ad markets where the big networks vie for sponsorship and money. Out getting the stories and hopefully boosting the ratings(which are monitored by all networks constantly)are the reporters and the most well known is Edison Carter(Max Frewer) of Network 23 with his vid-cam. His boss is Murray(Jeffrey Tambor)and his invaluable assistant at the other end of the camera is Theora(Amanda Pays).Mr. Cheviot(George Coe)is the top boss of Network 23 while Bryce(Chris Young) is the boy genius that created the shows namesake. Max Headroom was a computer generated construct Bryce created from the mind of Edison Carter after he suffered a serious head injury while trying to escape from the scene of one of his stories. Edison was fleeing on a motorcycle and his head struck a lift gate with the words""maximum headroom"" on it;thus it got shortened to Max Headroom. Max comes and goes on screen at will and coupled with an innate ability to adapt and learn,he makes a formidable but humorous presence on the Network airwaves with his many jibes and jokes;often at Network 23's expense.
Also inhabiting this future world is Blank Reg(William Sheppard)and his assistant Dominic. They run their own small version of a television network with their ""Big Time TV"".They work with a low wattage and transmit out of a pink bus. Reg looks like an old punk rocker but he has an on going and mutually beneficial relationship with Edison and company.
Max Headroom was certainly cutting edge stuff back in /87 and with a jaundiced 22 year look back we can easily overlook those floppy discs that pop up now and again as representing ""high tech"",those obviously 80s inspired get ups and the early work in animation,CGI and small models. But all in all this show still works tremendously as its' entire philosophy of people's obsession with television,the greed of networks,sponsors and their precious ""ratings"" which rule them and what we see,and the need for the real ""truth"" instead of all the spoon fed drivel on the airwaves;all are as valid today as they were in /87...even more so. Max Headroom was a huge presence on early MTV in the 80s and in commercials. I watch Max today(or should I say Matt Frewer) and I still find myself mesmerized by the effect. It may be comparatively old stuff now but Max still works beautifully and can still be absolutely hilarious,in a smart way.
Technically this set has NOT been remastered. The Shout Factory isn't the only ones releasing non remastered TV shows(all the majors are doing it unfortunately),but Warners who owns the series seems to have provided Shout with decent prints so over all I can say I like it. Everything from picture to sound is generally good to very good. On top of the entire series on four DVDs the entire fifth disc is filled with featurettes on the story of Max,a couple of roundtables with some of the cast,and a look at the writing,the set rigging and animation creating of Max. The one person who is quite conspicuous by his absence is star Matt Frewer. He is not on any of the featurettes and the  11 page booklet that is included with this set doesn't even mention him by name(!).I find this strange to the nth degree. It is obvious Mr Frewer wanted nothing to do with the production of this set but I'll leave the ""whys"" to your imagination.
Even though it was a long time coming this is one series that was highly anticipated by this fan and well worth the wait. It's cancellation back then still has me burning today. The last ep was aired about seven years after the series was cancelled so the last ep(that would really be second last)aired during its' initial run(""Lessons"")in North America is probably the most appropriate to have ended with. It is a scathing attack on the ratings system and as you watch it you can easily see its' creators giving ABC the middle finger through their tried and true mascot Max. This is a highly recommended DVD set and show.
As an aside:look for two well known original series Star Trek actors in the 2nd show""Raking"" and one very well known Babylon 5 actor in many of the later eps(hint:he works for Network 66).",1282608000,9,5175,4.801569506726457

1543985,5,B00005JNU5,"It's ironic, but Max Headroom is so... retro!

Don't get me wrong, I loved this series. It was even better than I remembered it. The media commentary and social satire are more relevant today than they were in 1987. And the science fiction elements are still as I recall them, somewhere at the intersection of William Gibson and Larry Niven. But funnier. And back in 1987, I found Max himself to be annoying, because of overdose: New Coke commercials, his own talk show, and more. But today, with a fresh eye, I really liked Max as a program trying to understand what it means to be sentient and how to find its place in the world. Really, really good!

And the stories had real depth and maturity. I recall when the show was struggling, there was an article that said the scripts were too idea-packed for network TV. They said a typical one-hour TV script was about 60 pages, but a one-hour Max Headroom script was 72 pages. Some of that, I'm sure, was scene description for this fantastic world; but some of it was deep characterization and story development. These scripts would've fit better into the Joss Whedon/J. Michael Straczynski era of complex, evolving characters and extended storylines. And Edison Carter, the putative hero, was nicely flawed and believable. One episode really struck me. Edison's boss, Murray, chewed him out for going over the line. In a typical 80s script, that would be the midpoint of the episode: the hero would come back from his mistake, win his boss's accolades, and probably even prove he was right all along. Nope, not Max Headroom. Wham! That was the end of the episode. Edison screwed up. He knows he screwed up. And Murray, the stereotypical unreasonable boss that the hero has to work around, was dead right. That didn't feel like an 80's story at all.

But in a lot of ways, the technology is so retro. Yeah, they have real time security camera hacking that's still futuristic; and Max himself is still beyond our technology. But the rest? Nobody has cell phones. Everybody has a TV, and often carries them around; but these ""portable"" TVs are bigger than a shoe box, far bigger than today's smart phones. Many of the computers have typewriter-style keyboards, even manual typewriter keyboards (I think these were an intentionally retro choice by the set designers). And the computer technology itself? At one point, Bryce says (paraphrased), ""Only someone as powerful as Network 23 has that much computing power. You'd need BILLIONS of bytes!"" Many of you reading this review are using a machine with billions of bytes.

The extras are kind of long and talky. You really have to like TV production to sit through them. Either that, or you just can't get enough Max. In my case, both were true, so I did watch them all. I learned a bit about 80's special effects; and the stories of how they fooled the network censors were were pretty funny. Those come late in the first extra, so you'll have to sit through a bit for them.

I'll watch this again, many times.",1282176000,7,3007,4.698292220113852
1543986,1,B00005JNU5,"I have waited long and hard like everyone else for this. I saved decaying Betamax tapes for years and finally found a homemade set complete online ""somewhere"" which was of decent watchable quality. I figured I would lose them when this came around.

I think I will keep them. They contain the ORIGINAL pilot film which was reshot for the American series and this long-awaited collection of the ""COMPLETE"" series does not have it. NO mention of it. NOTHING.

It has become canonical that the original often unaired pilots be included (Star Trek, Lost In Space and Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea ALL include them) in the ""COMPLETE"" collection of a series.

Not here.

About as disappointing as finding the Tales From The Crypt/The Vault Of Horror DVD contained edited santized versions of 40 year old horror movies which were rated PG to begin with.

1543987,4,B00005JNU5,"After a very long wait, Max Headroom is finally available on DVD. The episodes stand up to the years and are still 20 minutes ahead of their time.

Alas, the DVD edition is not everything it could have been. The first and biggest problem is that it's a dub of the original 1980s video transfers to DVD, not a new transfer. It's not even state of the art standard definition video let alone HD; the first six episodes only look slightly better than the twenty year old Japanese import laserdiscs. Max Headroom was mostly made on film, so if the original film elements exist a high definition transfer should be possible.

Another problem is that there is material that should be here but is not. The ""next episode"" teasers are not on the discs, nor is the ""this was Max Headroom's finest hour"" speech that appeared at the end of Whacketts in place of the teaser when it was broadcast on ABC. There was also room on the discs for the British television pilot of the first episode, but you'll have to hunt that down on VHS.

One effect that was seen in the broadcasts of the second season episodes is missing; just after the credits ended you would briefly see a letterboxed widescreen image which would then zoom in on the scene. That suggested that those episodes, at least, were originally shot for widescreen television and then cut down for 4:3 -- if so, I would like to see a widescreen edition of Max. Blu-ray, anyone?

On the bright side, disc 5 has an excellent collection of supplementary material (about two and a half hours) which are filmed in widescreen. Go figure.

Perhaps it's the way the series was originally shot, but the discs suffer the same fate as those comprising the Star Trek The Next Generation seasons sets in terms of low def video quality. It is obvious this Max was mastered off of video tape and not film, as virtually every shot borders on blurriness, and one can see the horizontal scan lines quite often. Sometimes, too, characters or objects throw off auras. My guess is that it would probably show better on an old CRT TV. Max Headroom, though, was a breakthrough series that costarred Amanda Pays, who later graced the similarly ahead of its time (also short-lived) the Flash.

1543990,5,B00005JNU5,"I've been eagerly anticipating Max Headroom on DVD for the longest time.  I bought a Max Headroom DVD set from Amazon (from a 3rd party vendor) a while ago.  But when I got the DVD, the quality was crappy, and you could tell it was recorded by pointing a camera at the TV.  It even had the TechTV logo on the screen, and all the episodes were just strung together.  Totally bootlegged pirated copy!!!!  I want to know if this is an official high quality DVD with a menu system that is typical of professional TV show compilations?

I just want to follow up on my above comments.  I ordered this from Amazon and received it last week.  w00t!  It's a genuine high-quality professionally-made DVD set released by Shout Factory and Warner Brothers with all the bells and whistles you'd expect of a TV series released on DVD, such as interactive menus, behind-the-scenes stuff, and interviews.  Sadly, they only made 14 episodes of Max, and it would have been nice if they had put more stuff on the DVDs (like the music video stuff, all the Coke commercials, and whatnot), but I realize there are copyright issues that prevent that.

So anyway, I trashed that bootleg set that I bought from Amazon a few years ago.

Now, if only they'd release the original pilot movie on DVD (it's available from Amazon on VHS, but do they even make VCRs any more?).",1281744000,,1345,4.535269709543568

1544072,3,B00005JNU5,"Ok...I got the Max Headroom DVDs and played them through my 1080P TV.  Yes, what a disappointment. BUT...WAIT!  Let's venture to the basement and find that old 1986 $2,000 Toshiba 30"" CTR TV I use to play my laser discs through. I connected the TV to the analog outputs of my DVD player. I sat down and started to watch episode one.  It was...clear, about the same as the regular TV channels seen through a converter box. But, the question remains, could it have been clearer.

A video recorder VAR in Burbank (1970-1980s) did modify Bosch BCN??? video recorders for 24-frame at 10 MHz bandwidth, with twice the standard maximum 525-line NTSC resolution, equaling 1050 vertical lines of resolution.  So, the question is, was Max Headroom shot with such a system in the 80s?

Note, interspersed in the shows are actual video tape recordings from various portable cameras, not possible to transfer from 30 FPS to 24 FPS.  You can clearly see that this footage is 30 FPS.  So, they probably shot the regular stuff on film and then edited it all onto 525 line resolution Video tape.

What we got on DVD was transferred from 525 NTSC second or third generation copy video tape...a poor copy.  It's not even as clear as my BetaMax.  Yes, I found a copy of one of the shows I recoded in the 80s when it was originally broadcasted.  Maybe they lost the originals.

I'm sure that to recreate...or create a higher def (720 DVD - 1080P Blu Ray) versions will take a much greater following.  This would necessitate reconstruct the series...providing they still had all that stuff.

When they made these shows, 525 was all anyone had.  The same is true for the Norman Lear stuff like All in the Family, and other shoes like Night Court plus all the other straight video recorded TV shows.  Every one of these shows I saw was fuzzy on HD.

So, I'll give Max 3 stars.  Yes, it's better than the bootleg copies.  No, it's not as good as it could be.

You-know, I had to wait ten years for Granada Television to redo Sherlock Holmes.  I hope I don't have to wait as long for Max.",1281657600,10,2062,4.501347708894879

Example: ""Have you any idea how successful censorship is on TV? Don't know the answer? Hmm. Successful, isn't it?""

I watched the extras last night. It was great to finally get some behind-the-scenes info. I enjoyed their talking about the creation of Max, all the way back to before the first British/HBO version. The roundtable session was cool. Seeing Chris Young, Amanda Pays, Concetta Tomei and Jeffrey Tambor together, reminiscing about the show. -- But it was sad to learn how abruptly they had cancelled the show, and it had never occurred to me how brutal canceling a series would be on the cast and crew. After all that time and effort spent together as a group, to just suddenly end with basically a ""don't come back tomorrow"".

Between film shoots, I remember talking to Chris Young about how awesome I thought it was that they were making Max into a TV series. He said that it was a midseason 6 episode show to possibly replace something on ABC's lineup, and that it may not even get on TV, and if it does, it may not continue in the fall season. He said he hoped that it would! It was excellent watching the first 6 episodes, and It was very promising when season two started, but not so good the day that it ended. I remember seeing the previews for the following week's episode, and how bummed I was the next week when it wasn't on. I thought that this was going to run for at least 4 or 5 seasons.

 I think that this series had definitely reached cult status a long, long time ago, and it holds up even better today. It is nice to finally have the complete series on DVD, my crappy copies have seen better days.

The packaging is good, there's a pamphlet with a couple of short essays about the show and a concise episode guide.
I found the extra features, in particular, really interesting.  I love the behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's a LOT of it here.  The only disappointment was the absence of Matt Frewer.

1544075,4,B00005JNU5,"Watching the 1987 production today is truly revealing. Some elements are laughably dated (the computer graphics, bulky electronics, and wardrobe especially) but the issues raised are remarkably prescient. A recurring theme of the series is the meaning and value of identity and the intriguing possibility of discarding it to become a ""blank."" Other pertinent topics tackled include biomedical technology and bioethics, censorship, and the role of corporations. Throughout, the series challenges our assumptions of the role of individuals in a world of corporations.

Although an obviously-limited production budget makes it feel somewhat tinny and empty today, it holds up remarkably well. The cast of Matt Frewer, Amanda Pays, Jeffrey Tambot, and the rest are solid if not as consistently-brilliant as W. Morgan Sheppard as Blank Reg. The pre-CGI models used for establishing shots are charmingly trashy, and the use of actual CGI was groundbreaking at a time when the Amiga ruled the world. The cyberpunk props seem ripped from the pages of mid-1990's issues of Wired, but of course the inspiration runs in the opposite direction. Despite some retro feel, Max Headroom delivers solid entertainment and real intellectual meat.

The video quality is probably as good as the (videotaped) source material would allow, and the vintage synth soundtrack is crystal clear. The episodes appear to be presented full-length (TechTV mercilessly chopped them) and the full opening and closing credits are intact. Even Max's post episode monologue is presented.
ABC split the series in three parts, airing six episodes in the Spring of 1987, five more in the Fall, two more the following Spring, and leaving one unaired. The DVD presents the episodes in this original air order, but I suggest following the production schedule instead. It resolves some odd questions (when would Theora have had time to tell Bryce about her brother?) and results in a more-satisfying arc.

Sadly absent from this DVD release is the original British Channel 4 TV movie, Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. It presented an even-darker view of the first episode before the series was produced, replacing much of the cast. Shout! Factory, producers of this DVD set, claim that the original film elements have been lost and a DVD produced from the standard-definition tapes remaining would not have satisfied fans. I will continue to treasure my own DVD copy!

I've got a more complete review on my site: [...]",1281484800,6,2482,5.244332493702771
1544076,4,B00005JNU5,"I received my set yesterday and watched the first two episodes along with all the bonus features.

I think people are being a little too harsh on the image quality.  Part of what I remembered about this series is the soft, but gritty look.  The soft grittiness contrasts well with the video segments that are super-imposed into the show and gives it a very distinct style.  In fact, the video portions look very sharp.  If the overall image was any sharper, you would be able to detect the imperfections in the sets and the costumes...along with the shots of Network 23 in the cityscape that is obviously a model.

The image is definitely an improvement over the VHS rips that have been on the internet.  Also, the versions that people captured from TechTV are edited for time...so at least these DVDs are the full versions that originally aired on ABC.

The extras are pretty good...except for a few holes. It's interesting that they talk about the making of the original UK mini-movie, yet it isn't included in the set...that seems disappointing (I still have the original on VHS that I bought in the late 80s).  Also as many people have stated, Matt Frewer is absent...but from the vibe I was getting in the round table with the actors, he seems like he ended up  bitter about the entire Max Headroom persona.  There are no segments from the Max Headroom video show and none of the New Coke commercials.  So anyone looking for a super complete Max Headroom retrospective are going to be disappointed.

The segment on the making of the show features interviews with the people who invented Max Headroom along with the writers and the producers of both the original UK movie as well as the US TV Show (they actually brought most of the creative talent to the US to help).  It's interesting that the went to such great lengths to create a back story for a character that wasn't going to do much more than introduce music videos.

The round table interview is OK.  Amanda Pays sounds like she just drank a few Red Bulls before they started shooting...and Chris Young doesn't really say too much, but is pleasant enough and it's always nice to see a child actor who actually turned out ok. I think Concetta Tomei (Blank Dominique) and Jeffery Tambor (Murray) offer the most insight about working on the show.  Both seem genuinely sad when they talk about the last day when the show was canceled.

The rest are just segments that seemed removed from the first two features that focus on specific topics.  I did love the little talk between Concetta Tomei and Morgan Sheppard as you can see a genuine friendship that blossomed on the set of Max Headroom and continues on to this day.

In the end, it's really about the original TV show.  Max Headroom has aged extremely well. Sure, we still get a few punks who look like Pat Benetar fans that escaped from Flash Dance with their cut-off t-shirts.  It also has a bit of the early MTV/Cyberpunk look (notice the live statues in the bar in episode 2) but the good news is, it really doesn't scream 80s and feels timeless. This show would have been just as acceptable if it was created this year.

Highly recommended.",1281484800,28,3159,4.601785714285715
1544077,4,B00005JNU5,"Max Headroom was a TV show so far ahead of its time it was scary. I loved that bizarre-but-prescient show and couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD.

Twenty years after the show first aired, my wait is over.

I'm watching the Max Headroom DVDs as I type this. (Our local Barnes & Noble put them sale this week, ahead of street date.)

I have good news and bad news.

The good news: I'm watching Max Headroom on DVD. That, alone, deserves a hearty hip-hip-hooray! I can finally throw away the VHS tapes of the show I recorded from TV some 10-12 years ago. Those tapes have been through a flood, boxed in an outdoor storage unit during winter's frigid temps and summer's scorching heat, and endured so many playbacks that the images became thin as ghosts.

The bad news: the picture on these DVDs is VHS quality. The colors are muddy. The color is grainy and seems overexposed to the point of harshness.

The sound is fine, thankfully. But the images look just like they did on my VHS tapes, or when they were first broadcast on network TV.

Granted, I'm viewing these episodes on a 42"" Philips flat-screen TV with 50,000:1 dynamic contrast. It's the sharpest picture possible. But other TV shows I own (Lost in Space, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Hawaii Five-O, Miami Vice, The Bob Newhart Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, etc.) look great on my TV.

The difference is those shows were remastered. It's obvious Max Headroom was not.

That bugs me. A lot. For a show this groundbreaking, this important, you'd think the people who own the rights to it would have spent a little money to clean them up. If any show deserves to be remastered, it's Max Headroom.

Alas, that's not the case.

Another problem: The cuts from what used to be commercials is sometimes sudden. The screen doesn't go black and then come up on the next scene, smoothly and tastefully removing what would have been a commercial. A time or two, the cut was noticeably sudden.

Another problem: The round-table discussion (on the special-features disc) with the cast doesn't include Matt Frewer, the star of the show. The round-table discussion is somewhat inane, even though it's cool to see the actors again. They said they hadn't been in the same room with each other for 23 years. They look like they're having fun being together again. Still, where's Matt?

All in all, I'm glad to see Max Headroom again. I'm glad it's on DVD, a format that won't turn ghostly with repeated viewings.

Unfortunately, it looks ghostly right off the bat, and -- thanks to the digital age -- will remain so forever.",1281052800,17,2575,4.5816993464052285
1544078,3,B00005JNU5,"They had this at my local DVD Planet a week early so I picked it up.... I enjoyed this show on its first run, and I do like science fiction.  To answer many of the speculations...it doesn't look that great. Most shows in the 70s were shot on FILM but alas the 80's brought on the video age and these shows that were shot that way suffer greatly when they come  out on DVD...which seems to accentuate their soft, poor color saturation and poor contrast...which make most of them barely watchable for me. I had just watched an episode of Mannix (from the late 60's) on DVD before sticking the Max DVD in and it was like night and day..sadly.

Many have asked if ""20 minutes into the future"" is included...it is NOT.
the 5th DVD is a bonus disc which contains..
1) an hour making of ....featuring the behind the scenes/camera/creative folks
2) Looking back at the Future...a 35 minute ""round table""discussion with a some of the cast members , Tambor, Pays,Tomei, and Chris Young...(NO Frewer)
3)The big Time Blanks...Tomei and Morgan Sheppard chatting for 12minutes
4)the science behind the fiction...one of the creators discussing the science of the show 12 minutes
5)The writers remember....11 minute interview with a couple of the writers
6)Brian Frankish discusses ""producing"" the show...8 minutes

I usually enjoy watching the behind the scenes on most DVD sets....these were pretty tedious and seemed inflated....of course they could not resist playing with graphics , sound and textures to try and make them appear videoish from the old 34......
but I can't imagine watching any of these features...ever again.

its curious that the star of the show was absent these 2hours of extras and even more interesting that SHOUT factory says on the back cover ""members of the cast"" are in the bonus content instead of listing them so that folks would assume that the star would be involved?
None of the coke  commercials are included
Not using the art of noise music video
Not included: the telefilm ""20 Minutes into the future""
Not included any of  the other Max Headroom clips from Muppets to the interview show on Cinemax.

If you are a big fan of the show you have the 14 episodes from ""Blipvirts"" to ""Baby Grobags"" most likely as good as they ever looked.. and for those of you crying about the lack of a Blu Ray release...I'd say WHY? this is cheap video....and boy does it look it ....Blu Ray would only make it look cheaper.

All that said...I liked  and still do ...some of the ideas presented and some of the characters. I do feel that SHOUT has put a pretty high price on essentially a 4 DVD set....and have deducted my stars for the lacking bonus features and for the heavyweight price...not a great value for money in my humble opinion...at $29 its a 5 star set....and the lack of more creative extra features or even the star of the shows participation understood...but at 50 bucks....I expect more.",1280966400,190,2909,4.719921104536489
1544079,4,B00005JNU5,"As many have said before Max Headroom was ahead of its time in a lot of ways. I believe this was the first, dystopic cyperpunk styled television series to be released on either side of the pond. And not many came after that. In other words all you William Gibson/Blade Runner fans out there should take note. This show was dark, gritty, and with loads of tech goodies. It delved into the same Gibson-type themes like class warfare, dependence on technology, the rise and domination of major corporations, and more. In many ways it takes on this material better than most cyberpunk movies did at the time.

Max Headroom started off as a fictional computer construct that had his own show. Of course back then the technology wasn't there to make a decent enough computer generated image so the character was portrayed by Matt Frewer (Honey I Shrunk the Kids) with a lot of make up and video editing effects. The Max Headroom Show was essentially a music video program with Max as the host. The concept was Max was an artificial intelligence. People loved it. He also did Coke commercials, specials and even was featured in some songs. Then a TV movie called Max Headroom and 20 Minutes into the Future came to be. From there this television series was born.

Building on the A.I. concept the show gave an origin for Max as the digital alter ego of a prolific news reporter Edison Carter from said dystopic future. In this future government is put to the side in place of big business, and the biggest are the television stations. So Edison goes around finding great exposes for his relatively benevolent TV megacorporation Network 23. So that's the premise in a nutshell. Lots of great ideas came from that including commercials that can fry your brain, pirate tv channels run from mobile vans, subliminal mind control, dream recording, and other crazy stuff.

The Max Headroom series was really ahead of its time in a number of ways. A part of Edison's crew includes a ""controller"" that can access various public and security cameras as well as hack into security access and other subsystems rather easily. This controller also can pull up just about any information Edison needs from whatever database she accesses (Internet anyone?). Max himself seems to be able to talk to and get into just about any computer, television or other network device available. There are episodes that deal with gene manipulation on the fetal level, conspiracies to gain attention through false terrorist acts, people not acknowledged because they are not on any database, apocalyptic religions. This all may seem old hat these days. However television didn't really touch on a lot of these subjects in those days.

So yes, Max Headroom is cool if you like this kind of stuff. Now this DVD has been a long time coming. All 14 episodes (that includes the one that didn't aire in the U.S.) are already slated. As for there being a Blu-Ray release it likely won't happen anytime soon. Shout! Factory hasn't had a Blu-Ray release yet. I don't think they have the resources for the remastering and touching up that is involved. Oh well. Maybe we'll see it 20 minutes in the future.",1280361600,7,3157,4.76599634369287

So, I've been watching Max again. And boy, does this show hold up! It's a precursor of so many TV shows and movies it isn't funny. Way ahead of its time.

1544174,5,B00005JNU5,"We've been waiting for this for years.  Max Headroom was so prescient; it foresaw ""instant ratings"" (which is exactly what Internet video gives broadcasters), shows clearly the brainwashing impact television has (e.g., Fox News), and was generally so on-the-money that I swear the networks are the reason it has been held off the market for so long.  We also bought a DVD set made from VCR recordings pirated off TechTV; the programs were edited to insert more commercials (self-fulfilling prophecy) and even had some of the commercials left in.  But at least we could watch the shows again.

if there is another set released in the future i will certainly be ready to buy
it! of all the sci-fi tv i've seen over the last twenty plus years, this is my all time teen years favorite.

And it first exploded onto television in the form of ""Max Headroom,"" which focused on the adventures of a crack reporter and his digital doppelganger. It has a few flaws (all those clunky TVs!), but it also has some sly wit and plenty of jabs at an increasingly media-obsessed society.

Network 23 has mysteriously been pulling top news stories -- including a man who mysteriously exploded -- and their top reporter Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) is determined to find out why. But when prowling around a ""secret"" floor of the network's building, he ends up running for his life.

In an effort to see if Edison has learned too much about the secret ""blipverts,"" the network's corrupt boss orders teen genius Bryce (Chris Young) to make a digital duplicate of Edison's mind, who is dubbed Max Headroom. But not only does Max develop a mind of his own, but Edison is still alive and well -- and determined to tell the world about a deadly new ad campaign.

And Max continues to come in handy when Edison and his new controller Theora (Amanda Pays) investigate a deadly new sport, a corrupt security company, a terrorist group on a rival network, the defiant Blanks, organ-stealing bodysnatchers, a corrupt telereligion, a friend accused of a deadly crime, a strangely addictive TV show, a deadly dream-hijack, babysnatchers, memory manipulation, and more in-network politics...

I watched Max Headroom as a very, very small child, and I only have a few vague memories of it. But it was enough to make me nostalgic about this series, and send me scuttling to rewatch it once more -- while the technology is pretty dated, it has a wonderfully glitzy dystopia divided between the luxurious world of TV and the bleak, grimy punk world of the Blanks.

Every episode has a solid mystery to unravel, or a problem that somehow has to be picked apart with computers (ie Max). But what really makes the writing stand out is the clever jabs at commercials (""We make everything you need and you need everything we make!""), politics, big corporations, big corporations in bed with politicians, and a world increasingly ruled by money and the media (""Credit fraud? My God, that's worse than murder!"").

And therein lies the wit of this series. Every episode sticks another needle in the media-saturated world and pops its bubble (""Without television, this city would be ungovernable!"").

Matt Frewer does a brilliant double turn as both Carter and Max. Carter is a steely-eyed, brilliant reporter who pursues the truth at all costs, and Max is a deliciously irreverent, stuttering CGI head who unveils all Carter's deepest thoughts. Pays does a good but not brilliant job as Frewer's love interest/coworker; Jeffrey Tambor has a nice smaller role as Frewer's overstressed boss; and W. Morgan Sheppard is awesome as the grizzled rebel Blank Reg.

This series was one of the most cutting, cynical, brilliant and prophetic SF series to be made -- and surprisingly a lot of people don't seem to be even aware of it.
Unlike the couple of ""interview"" shows or the coca-cola commercials with Max, ""MH:  20 Minutes into the Future"" actually had a plot.
Matt Frewer played Edison Carter, a reporter for Network 23, an investigative reporter with a conscious (what a thought!).  While reporting on the Blipverts scandal (blipverts being ads that can kill the consumers watching them) he's in an arranged ""accident"" that nearly kills him.  His last conscious thought is reading a warning sign that says, ""Max Headroom .. inches"".  The computer-generated Max is a compilation of Edison's thoughts and memories.
Edison, however, survives the crash... and breaks the story.  Amanda Pays is his ""controller"", who stays at Network 23, feeding him information from traffic cams, etc.  Jeffery Tambor is their boss -- on the edge between trying to get actual *news* on the air, and pleasing his ratings-seeking bosses.  Sound familiar?
George Coe runs Network 23.
Max Headroom dealt with all sorts of issues -- the clash between security and freedom; auto-payment systems; all-prevalent computers; all prevalent television; ratings; televised violence; etc.
And the entire cast was BRILLIANT!
And the writing was also BRILLIANT - in a snarky sort of way.
Here's a few examples:
""We are the unlucky generation, we are the children who have to play in the poisonous back yard our parents decided not to tell us about."" Edison Carter (o.s.- as part of his ""I Want to Know"" show)
""In today's world your inalienable rights are: consumer credit, unlimited television, and personal security. In your home, in your place of work--you can count on Security Systems. Security Systems wherever you go, there we are."" --Security Systems commercial on Network 23
""Security Systems is the largest and most powerful corporation of its kind in the world, it has access to more privileged information than any single government, and in the wrong hands it could be used to destroy businesses and lives.""- Edison
And that's just from a couple of episodes.  The entire SCRIPTS were bright, funny, intelligent, witty, AND made you think.  Hum... when's the last time TV did that?  On THIS side of the pond, I mean.
Seriously, the DVD really needs to be out.",1271289600,12,2496,5.002415458937198

Los Angeles, CA - Shout! Factory and Warner Home Video, a division of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, Inc., announced a multi-property alliance to bring the highly anticipated Warner Bros. television series Max Headroom and The Norm Show to the home entertainment marketplace. Under its multi-year agreement with Warner Home Video, Shout! Factory will be the exclusive media company to distribute Max Headroom and The Norm Show DVDs for home entertainment releases in the United States and Canada. The announcement was made today by Shout! Factory founding partners Richard Foos, Bob Emmer and Garson Foos; and Jeff Brown, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Non-theatrical Franchise Marketing for Warner Home Video.

Production has begun to develop a wide range of bonus content for Max Headroom: The Complete Series DVD box set, as well as re-transferring the episodes from the original elements to provide the highest picture quality.

""Max Headroom is a uniquely sought-after television property, boasting a large fan following and consumer interests. We have been pursuing this property with Warner Bros. for years, and we're thrilled that it's finally coming to fruition,"" state Shout! Factory founding partners. ""We're pop culture fanatics at Shout!, and both of these shows are loved by fans of TV and are highly requested. We'll do them justice with great extras and packaging.""

""It's a privilege to partner with Shout! Factory, and we look forward to combining our efforts to bring these two highly-regarded television programs to the home entertainment audience,"" said Brown. He added, ""We look forward with anticipation to the opportunity of creating a series of releases that will be innovative, original and stand out in the home entertainment market place.""

Starring Matt Frewer, W. Morgan Sheppard, Jeffrey Tambor and Amanda Pays, the U.S. television series Max Headroom, inspired by a British made-for-television movie 20 Minutes into the Future, aired on ABC from 1987-1988. Hailed by critics and fans as one of the most innovative science fiction series ever produced for American television, Max Headroom is considered to be the first cyberpunk television series, bolstered by its innovative premise, brilliant writing and fast-paced visual style. Unafraid to explore any subject, no matter how controversial, the series cynically tackles topical issues from the general television industry such as the exploitation of the TV ratings games, political advertising, tele-evangelism, news coverage and commercials. The world of Max Headroom is a satirically funny look at television of the not-too-distant future. There are 4,000 TV channels, cameras are everywhere, television sets can't be shut off, ratings have been perfected to the point where programming decisions are made minute by minute, and Network 23, the ratings leader, is headed by a man who would literally kill for ratings. Enter investigative reporter Edison Carter and his alter ego, the first computer-simulated multi-media star, Max Headroom, played by Matt Frewer. Max Headroom is a production of Chrysalis/Lakeside in association with Lorimar Telepictures.

I have a nice collection of DVD's already, thank you very much. My brother liked MH and managed to (VHS) tape ""Blipverts,"" ""Rakers,"" and ""Body Banks."" He has the rest somewhere but couldn't find them last time I bugged him (years ago). Wikipedia has a nice breakdown of the show with episode guide, I just checked there today. The show was on in the summer and I remember seeing only bits of it (too busy). After watching his taped episodes a few years later, I was amazed. This was a very pretty insightful and stinging show and I loved it. In the past, my focus had been on Max (the alter-ego) since I came in halfway throught most shows so I had no other point of reference. After seeing the whole story, I couldn't wait to see the next taped one. Guess I am out of luck there. MGM and Nickelodeon are also being sticks in the mud about putting old shows on DVD. I finally bought a bootlegged copy of the complete ""You Can't Do That on TV"" show a few years back, out of pure frustration. The sound is good but the picture quality is grainy (or worse) at times. As a result, I would recommend people share their original taped copies of shows, like my brother, for the best quality but how people can do that when VHS is supposed to be ""dead,"" I don't know. In the meantime, I still have a working VHS player in my ""old"" analog (gov. converter box adjusted) TV and can still watch some MH until the tape, TV, or VHS component of the TV dies.

I have contacted Channel 4 about the possibility of a re-screening; no chance.  A quick check through the web unveiled that the UK movie was licensed to a Japanese company and a few clicks later I found the DVD (NTSC Region 2) readily available.  I ordered it and it arrived from Japan a few days later.  Every bit as good as remembered......shame it's NTSC rather than PAL but that doesn't diminish the impact.  It is the original British production (much harder hitting than the softened up USA movie; sorry about that, cousins).

They were also on the money in terms of the divide between the rich and poor. The middle class is disappearring swiftly and as so many of us end up in poverty, there is nothing fictitious about the ""Haves"" and ""Have nots"".

Frankly, I could have totally done without Max Headroom himself. I was never impressed with him. I watched this show for the real people. I watched it for the plots.

I do wish they would put it out on DVD. I have most of the shows on VHS tapes I recorded off ABC back in the late 1980s. I hope they haven't disintegrated by now!

It was like seeing ""Road Warrior"" or ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for the first time. It was refreshing and different and most of all not afraid to be that way. Clever writing and good acting sustained the show, afterall as fun as Max's head was it couldn't have carried the show on it's own. And of course that is why it failed as well. It seems networks somehow lose sight of giving good new SciFi shows much of a chance. Recently case in point ""Threshold"" was a wonderful brilliant new series, but like Max it was pre-empted for everything but your brothers bathroom breaks. I am afraid although I understand Baseball or some sport may appeal to alot of viewers you should just move the great SciFi show to another time slot.

1544290,5,B00005JNU5,"First, the most important point: tvboxset.com has a boxed set of fourteen Max Headroom episodes on DVD available for a little under $50.00. They don't say whether it's the UK or US version, and personally I thought there were more than just fourteen episodes, but it's a start. Go get 'em.

Second, a small brag and a comparison: I have a VHS of the original British pilot, which to my amazement I found about seventeen years ago at a video store's going-out-of-business sale. I was so stunned that I actually asked the proprietor ""Do you know what this is? Do you know what you have here?"" ""It's a used rental video, lady,"" he said, and charged me $3.50. He had his chance, but I still walked out of there feeling like a bandit. Now, that British pilot is something that really needs to be on DVD. My VHS copy was old and used and beat-up when I bought it, back when herds of stegosaurus roamed the earth, so the quality is patchy, and that's a shame.

I saw the US version of this pilot, and it was weird. The script is very similar, identical in most places, but there's just something a little... off about it. As you know, MH isn't just about the entertainment industry; it's about politics and group psychology and semiotics and economics and class systems as well, and I think that the way we do all those things in the US is different enough from the way they do them across the pond that the whole vibe of the show had to change in order to be readable. (I saw the same thing happen to La Cage Aux Folles when it got re-made as The Birdcage. US politics is so different from French politics that that part of the movie simply didn't translate.) The network execs madly dancing to ZikZak's tune came across fairly well, but the Bryce character was a shock. A geeky American refugee from the gifted program at PS 184 is simply not the same thing as a snotty young upper-class Etonian, and this makes a huge difference to the show. I mean, who else would be in control of what the plebs watch? Right? The leisured unquestioning assumption of aristocratic entitlement and unthinking privilege of the UK version's Bryce was a crucial element of the show's message, whereas you could easily imagine the American Bryce dumpster-diving and tearing up his mom's lamps and radios for parts just as Blank Reg might do. This changes who Bryce is and why he's there, and it might be why the American Bryce rapidly became one of the Good Guys, while in the UK pilot he was definitely part of the dark side.

Well, anyway. It can be said that MH is overdesigned and self-indulgent and slickly manipulative and panders to every mid-80s cyberpunk MTV Rim-tech Gibsonesque sf cliche imaginable, and I so do not care; it works and it's a fine fine beautiful thing for the world to have. If Warner Bros. has the rights (Lorimar being long defunct), the whole damn thing, US and UK versions, plus additional material like the contest announcement on my VHS tape, should be immortalized on DVD.

This pilot movie and the TV series it spawned was absolutely brilliant. It pulled very few punches and had actual content. So hard to come by these days. In many ways, it was incredibly prophetic... although at the time, the writers and producers were taking a stab at the media and television news by taking it to extremes, I would argue that in some ways, reality has only come closer and closer to the show...

1544371,5,B00005JNU5,"Given some of the stuff that's made it onto DVD, I'm amazed that we've yet to see ""Max Headroom""  appear.  Heck, the original UK TV movie must be approaching the age where the rights revert to creators - in the UK at least, they didn't sell their soul to Coke.  What I'd like to see most (and what I think is most likely to make an appearance first, probably as a PAL DVD) is the original UK TV movie.  It's basically the same plot as the US pilot but doesn't pull its punches quite as much, Bryce gets his just desserts, and it's generally got a grittier, darker feel.  Oh, and it also benefits from an excellent soundtrack by Midge Ure and Chris Crosss of Ultravox, which I wouldn't be surprised to see as an audio-only release of this appear before any DVD, since I'd be pretty sure that the rights belong to Ure/Cross again by now.  The fact that Rocky Morton and Annebel Jankel were behind this one contributes at lot - and explains why Max turned up later on an Art of Noise video.

Me, I'd be happy with just the original UK movie and the soundtrack, but it'd be interesting to see the US series released on DVD - most were aired in the UK much later and while there's a large cast overlap, they just weren't the same.

The third thing that'd complete the set is, alas, unlikely ever to see DVD.  That's Max's UK TV series, also aired on Channel 4, which was shown in the UK before the US series and after the original movie.  It didn't run for very long, and was only 30 minutes or so, run at something like 11pm on Channel 4, which pretty much doomed it to falure, but it was an interesting mix of ""Interviews"" (i.e. Max briefly tolerating the presence of celebrity guests, who he proceeded to interrupt and talk over,  These alternated with an interesting and often eclectic mix of music videos - stuff like Jean-Michel Jarre's ""Zoolook"" video.  If anyone's got a list of all the videos shown on this show, I'd love to see it.

However, the likelihood of this ever appearing is near nil, just because of the rights issues involved with all of the music videos.

So, a DVD release of the original UK movie and a box featuring the US series would do very nicely.  I'd accept both in the same set, but would be very disappointed to see the UK original tacked on as a ""bonus"".  The US series had already been toned down for the US audience (by making Bryce one of the good guys - I can just see the network exec saying ""Can't we make this characer more sympathetic to increase popularity with the teenage demographic?).

Oh, and the original deserves a good quality digital remaster - I hope it was originally recorded on film rather than tape - since while the Max graphics themselves show their age, the rest of the ""computer graphics"" have withstood the test of time for the same reason that the computer graphics on the BBC ""Hitchhikers"" series did.  The reason?  Like the HHGTTG graphics, they're not computer graphics, they're all conventional animation courtesy of Peter Lord.",1169337600,74,2989,4.4513761467889905

Max was like 1984 on drugs, but much funnier, and ultimately more accurate.  1984 was about the oppressor keeping information away from the people.  Max was about the oppressor blasting us to death with information.  Brilliant.",1161648000,8,381,4.890625

1544375,5,B00005JNU5,"My wife Kathleen & I just watched the Video Tape version for the 1st time in maybe 10-15 years, and we were really surprised at how well it holds up; really much better than I remembered, and I thought it was pretty fantastic back then. I had watched it perhaps half a dozen times in the 1980's.

The other remarkable thing is - there is so much from The Matrix that was 'borrowed' from this production - a controller surrounded by CRT's in communication with and directing the actions of Edison Carter, telling him when to pass through corridors, monitoring the bad guys (agents) - even fighting someone else for control of the ""system"".  And then an actual 'Matrix' with Bryce's code figures in the story (only called 'The Matrix' by Max during the promo contest announcement at the end of the video.)  The world outside Network 23 looks so much like the 'true world' Morpheus shows Neo - it is all here.

But Max holds up just fine on his own.  Max has Blank Regg, and Edison has Theora.  They do not make them like this anymore.",1153353600,62,1032,4.462765957446808

7941160,5,B00005JNU5,What can I say - I Love It!!  I felt like I was transported back to 1985 watching on my 21 inch Mitsubishi TV. There is something to say about leaving iconic shows in there original form.  I wouldn't change a thing.... 20 minutes into the future........,1515196800,,253,4.361702127659575
7941161,5,B00005JNU5,"You know this show is from the 1980's and echoed ""Blade Runner"" and ""Mad Max"" w/Mel Gibson).  Extra content is included and this would probably be considered ""ground breaking effects"". Max Headroom is the real star of the show, but the other's put in their 2 cents. Matt Frewer  was both Max Headroom and Edison Carter(roving news reporter). The beginning can be  hectic but the stories improve as the shows gets going. There is one episode called ""Dream Thieves"" that have held my attention for many years after this show left the tv network. It truly makes you wonder, ""Would this kind of thing happen to me?""",1511222400,2,611,4.691588785046729

7941163,5,B00005JNU5,An amazing nostalgic show. It has a lot of campiness so be prepared for that. Tte pseudo cyberpunk dystopian plot is what I liked. I as m really sad it didn't have more seasons because it was alot better then other shows of this time period.,1504396800,,241,4.260869565217392
7941164,5,B00005JNU5,I love Max Headroom. It's so campy and dated but such a fun show to watch. It covers a lot of different Sci Fi concepts but doesn't take itself tooooo seriously.,1500595200,,161,4.225806451612903
7941165,5,B00005JNU5,"I vaguely remembered this show from when it was originally on and my memory was of a cutting edge, futuristic show with a bit of a sense of humor about it.  I especially remembered the ""blip-verts"" and the exploding head of the guy watching them.  I'm glad they didn't cut that scene for some stupid PC reason and the show is still edgy even today.",1498867200,,348,4.338461538461538
