8410411,2,B003ZJ94YQ,"Blood Oath starts off great just like the older 80's Slasher flix, but after that falls kinda short for me, yeah I agree with a couple other reviews that it's a good midnight movie and yeah the actors in fact did appear to be having a good time during filming....however my issue is that the beginning grabbed me in with two on camera kills but after that you really didn't catch any good kill action, some swings of a blade and some blood but never seeing the contact point of injury, the three girls camping tent scene would have been better to me if I could see more of the gore..don't get me wrong I mean I don't mind ""some"" off camera kills but this one just didn't deliver enough for me. All in all Blood Oath is an OK Slasher flick.",1333411200,5,739,4.211267605633803

If you're requirements for a horror film are blood, gore, death and gratuitous nudity, then Blood Oath might be the kind of horror film you can sink your teeth into...

8410413,3,B003ZJ94YQ,"Blood Oath is a slasher movie that has good gore, a Tiffany Shepis cameo, some nice t & a, and little else. The acting and the script for the most part are below average. But hey, this is a slasher flick, not many people be watching this for the acting or dialogue.",1303862400,5,265,4.115384615384615
8410414,3,B003ZJ94YQ,"As somebody who enjoys independent horror movies, this recent release is no exception. In a world where horror movies look more predictable and ""serious"" and leaves viewers more confused with plot than after watching an M. Night Shyamalan film, Blood Oath achieves something more substantial and meaningful: a throwback to the classic horror movies that die-hard fans love, and give reason to why people wouldn't want to camp alone or might consider booking a motel. Instead of creating formulaic out-of-this-world plots on million-dollar Hollywood studio budgets, Blood Oath brings a familiarity to the horror movie scene in which people would want to see if the pretty buxom blonde would be introduced to the killer's flesh-ridden knife, or other staples that make the horror movie genre a favorite among movie goers. Over all, it looks like the filmmakers, actors, producers, and director had fun making this movie, as much as people would enjoy watching it...with hopes of anearby nightlight while sleeping.",1302652800,6,1011,5.325
