8693523,3,B00R02FDV2,"This Donnie Yen vehicle is a passable action flick for when you want to see some good fight scenes.

A brief synopsis of this film would be that a martial artist born with some physical limitations has become obsessive about his training and wanting to be the best. And to be the best he feels the need to track down martial arts masters and kill them in fights to the death. Donnie Yen, a martial arts master serving a prison sentence (something to do with killing someone in training?) realises he knows the killer when the first murder is mentioned on the TV in the prison. Unable to get the guards to allow him a phone call he beats up some nearby unpleasant prisoners to get their attention!

Anyway with his help the police try to play a game of catch up with the killer who is always seemingly one murder ahead of the police. There are some great fight scenes (alas my disc was not in great shape and one fight is not viewable for me) and that is the main reason to buy this film. The plot  while simple  allows for the fights to actually mean something which instantly makes them more relevant for the audience. Gradually the police catch up with the murderer as he is on his way to yet another target and the two of them take part in quite a good fight scene where passing traffic plays an important role.

The movie wins by avoiding silly romantic sub-plots of getting bogged down in too much psychobabble about the culprits motives. Its just an out and out martial arts movie with enough of a plot to give meaning to the fights. As opposed to the zillions of very poor martial arts flicks where nobody really cares and the fights go on for half an ice age.

Downsides are the fact that outside the great fight scenes there really isn't much here. And for an English speaking audience the subtitles are horrific. Not in that they are impossible to see (its not a black subtitle on a black background or similar issue) but its just that whoever did them obviously had no idea about the English language. Its as if they used some sort of online dictionary to just translate things word for word rather than look at the meaning of the sentence in any way. You really have to concentrate on them and quite frankly they are at times gibberish.

Furthermore there probably isn't enough general action for this to qualify as an action movie. Its a martial arts movie, which instantly downsizes its utility.

Final downside would be the fairly standard level of acting. A few of them seem to know what they are about in this department but the plot doesnt give anyone much to work with and the dialogue  going by the translations at least  isn't exactly cerebral stuff. Just string together enough sentences to explain the plot and you're on your way.

Production values aren't bad, this doesnt look like it had much of a budget but they certainly had enough to get the job done well.

All up this is far from the worst martial arts flick you could rent. While the plot is fairly slim it does hang together. The acting is fairly average for the most part but certainly not actively bad. The film looks better than many of its competitors in the genre. For the fight movie fan this is a good option because really.. these fight scenes are darn good. If that is all you are after this is a four star movie, perhaps even five stars within a very limited genre, but as an overall movie its a three star affair.",1459036800,,3408,4.426517571884984

8693528,3,B00R02FDV2,"What do you get when you cross a Law & Order-style police drama with the fast-paced Wing Chun martial art popularized by Donnie Yen? You get Kung Fu Killer, a cop film about a crack unit's quest to track down a serial killer. Really, it's just a barebones excuse to have Yen put on a ""kung fu clinic"" on his foes, and fans of Hong Kong action movies will appreciate that more than the procedural aspects.

Yen plays Hahou Mo, a former martial arts instructor (oh, you thought he'd be a chemist or something?) in prison for accidentally killing a rival. After seeing a news report about the murder of the best boxer in Hong Kong, Hahou somehow realizes this is all part of some grand master plan to wipe out the world's top fighters by using their own styles against them. After forcing an encounter (meaning he beat up fellow inmates) with the lead detective (Charlie Yeung), Hahou joins in the investigation, which mainly amounts to following a step behind as the killer brutalizes his opponents with obvious glee. Good thing he's nice enough to leave a ""calling card"" behind letting the cops know he was there.

Fans of Yen may be disappointed that he doesn't actually take center stage in most of the fighting. Instead it's Baoqiang Wang as the villain who stays busy, and his crazed performance is perhaps the movie's greatest surprise. The killer turns out to be a total psychopath, and flashbacks to his past reveal the pain that steered him towards murder. What it doesn't explain in enough detail is why he feels the need to best his opponents in such a specific manner, but then again expecting too much backstory in a film like Kung Fu Killer is foolish. All anybody will really care about are the fights, and there are plenty of them done with a beautiful, graceful complexity. Yen, along with director Teddy Chan, have been taking a few cues from The Raid and the new breed of action flick. Combining an edgier brutality with the balletic-style Yen is accustomed to makes for a deadly awesome combination. The set pieces are creative, as well, including one fight that takes place on the top of a giant fossil. However attempts to include CGI into the mix, such as a ropey battle set in the middle of rush hour traffic, are so ineffective they become a distraction.

There's really no drama to be found here as we know Yen is the guy who will end up facing the killer in the end, but again it's not likely anybody goes into a film like Kung Fu Killer expecting an intricate plot. This isn't one of Yen's stronger films, but it has enough action to keep his legion of fans satisfied until the next time.",1429833600,,2614,4.5574468085106385
8693529,2,B00R02FDV2,"Donnie Yen is not suitable for emotional scene.  For example, the scene where, after getting out of jail, he embraces his girlfriend, he looks puzzled not emotional as he should.

The fighting scenes look choppy,  not as smooth, exciting and threatening as other movies of his. I prefer Iron Monkey, Kill zone and Flash point.",1429833600,,326,4.890909090909091
