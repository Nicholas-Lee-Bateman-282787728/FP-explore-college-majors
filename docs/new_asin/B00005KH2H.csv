1619895,1,B00005KH2H,"I was very excited to get a bunch of MTV videos but upon opening the nice looking DVD case of 4 DVD's and playing every single video... I felt like throwing them in the fireplace. They are the WORST videos I have ever seen from the 80's (except maybe a handful). I cannot beleive MTV would release some of their worst videos as their hits. Someone at MTV needs to be fired. And on top of that, the audio is horrible. I mean horrible audio. DO NOY BUY THIS. I will ship it to you for 10 bucks and they are brand new. Viewed only once and will never be viewed again. I am embarassed for MTV.",1107302400,18,589,4.042735042735043
1619896,4,B00005KH2H,"I think this is a fairly low price for the number of videos you get.  My feelings about the selection of videos are mixed.  There are plenty of songs/videos I like here; there are also plenty that have the power to make me change the station when they come on.  The really nice surprise, though, was the Jungle Brothers video.  My husband, my brother and I weren't familiar with the song, but we loved the video--it was vastly entertaining.

I think most people can find things they like about this collection and things they don't like; I also think we can all agree that getting four decent DVDs for approximately the price of one or two is a pretty good deal.",1103587200,7,662,4.43801652892562
1619897,4,B00005KH2H,"I really like Tears for Fear and Pink Floyd ,so for me it was worth getting. I was hopping for some of the older genesis songs so I was a little dissapointed when they were not there.",1062201600,3,183,3.972972972972973
1619898,4,B00005KH2H,"ok , well when i first got this collection i was a little bit disapointed. i thought there would be more videos that really had a impact on mtv and its audience. i mean they didn't have the bugles , the didn't have micheal jackson or guns n roses or anyone else that really had some good videos for mtv but overall the collection was good and it grows on you. the pop disk is about 4 stars, with some classic new wave hits and works it way up to modern hits for mtv. the rock disk is about 3 or 4 stars, it was missing some really good videos they couldve put in there but was still pretty good. i mean they have cake and monster magnet and the cult and soundgarden on that disk. and the 3rd disk is jams, which chronicled the old school rap videos till today. and the 4rth disk is beats , which has more electronica music on it but only 5 or 6 videos. it has stuff like moby and chemical brothers. all the disks are about 4 stars and they have the old school commercials and pop up facts from mtv on it also and band statistics and bios.i would recomend this collection to anyone cause it basically covers it all almost and is good if you are looking to collect some good videos. the picture is excellent but the sound is ok. on the dvd player it sounds good but in the computer the sound is bad. but if you really like collecting videos get this.",1050883200,17,1348,4.090566037735849
1619899,4,B00005KH2H,"4 DVD'S for that price this is a very good deal, the videos are great and if your Tv have close caption you can see the lirycs during each video to sing along, and not miss any single word of all these great songs.",1044316800,4,214,3.8863636363636362
1619900,5,B00005KH2H,I owned the DVD's and as a dj I think thier really good because most of the time when you wanna show the vid. you have to get blank tapes and you and to fast forward and rewind but with DVD's you can get to the song and thats why I like the Mtv 20 Years of music.,1031184000,5,263,3.5517241379310347
1619901,3,B00005KH2H,"Whether or not you should buy this is really determined by your gut reaction to the concept. If the thought of owning some of your favorite videos from years past puts a smile on your face, go buy this immediately. If you hem and haw, or are unsure, pass it up. Unless you can think of a few videos on each disc that you would love to own, you are probably better off just buying your favorite disc, as the bonus DVD is rather sparse.
The videos in general are in great quality (the more recent ones look pristine), and the sound quality is fine. The little video interviews are completely forgettable however, and the 'bonus' disc really could have used some more fleshing out.
DVD is really the ideal medium for video retrospectives like this because you can skip past the ones you don't like in the blink of an eye. My one beef with the set is that you are left wondering why they didn't fill these discs up a bit more. DVDs can certainly fit more than 15 or so videos per disc, and it gets you to thinking about what deserving bands got snubbed by this retrospective.",995328000,24,1071,4.333333333333333
1619902,4,B00005KH2H,"I always have liked how music sounds in Dolby Digital 5.1. My 1st generation DVD player came with a sample disc that contained a few music videos. When I heard that Image Entertainment was teaming up with MTV to produce a jam-packed set of some of the top videos of all time &#8211; I was very excited.
The three main disc (Rock, Jams and Pop) contain a good mix that should satisfy just about every music lover. Each of those is also available seperatly. The fourth disc called Beats is only available in the set and includes a few songs like &#8220;Pump up the Jam&#8221; and &#8220;Jump Around&#8221;.
The only thing that I was really worried about was the quality of some of the videos &#8211; but rest assured, they all look pretty good.
Full track listings are at the very bottom of the review.
There are some very big standouts in this set. Counting Crows fans will love the quality of Round Here &#8211; it has never looked better.
The video is presented in full frame or letterbox depending on how the video was produced. Like I said, overall they all look pretty darn good. Of course the newer videos really shine on DVD.
The audio for the videos has been remixed in 5.1 &#8211; or so the box says. It's actually mixed in 4.1 because no sound comes out of the center speaker. Basically the sound mostly comes out of the front left and right speakers and also out of the surrounds and sub channel. It took a few minutes to make sure my system wasn't busted because you can tell no sound comes out of the center. But don't let that stop you from getting these discs. They really do sound very good. A 2.0 track is also provided.
Extras in the box set of course include the 4th Beats disc as a bonus. Also included on the main discs are very short interviews before each video, short biographies, and some commercials. There is also a sort of &#8220;Pop Up Video&#8221; selection that you can turn on where little tibits of info will appear while watching the videos.
Overall, this is a good mix of videos and pretty good quality wise. Highly recommended.",994809600,5,2062,4.486702127659575
