Instead, I could find more interesting stuff on the internet.  This reminds me of one of those boring movies they play in school that just plain put you to sleep.  I wish I could get rid of this and I regret buying it but i don't know a soul who would want it.  Do not waste your time or money!",1041724800,5,412,4.1
