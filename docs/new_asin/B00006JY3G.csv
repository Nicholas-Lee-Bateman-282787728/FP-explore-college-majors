7970854,4,B00006JY3G,"Harold Pinter has just died, unfortunately. Which led me to look up this movie based on his play.

This film's date is 1963, not 1967. I saw it at the MacArthur theater in D.C. around 1964, and thought it was mesmerizing. In particular, there's a monologue in the middle by (then unknown) Robert Shaw that took me by surprise--both the monologue itself and its striking, unique actor (soon thereafter to be seen in ""From Russia with Love""). Shaw was an accomplished novelist, incidentally.

Sure wish someone would make this movie available on video in a USA-friendly format.",1230163200,4,575,4.917525773195877
