The format is DVD-10 and some people called this older format ""fippers"" as when you reach the middle of the movie, you are actually at the ""end"" of the first side of the physical DVD, and you need to eject and ""flip"" the disc over to the other side to finish the rest of the movie.. Yes, both sides are read,  as it is an older DVD, 90's style. ;-)",1533945600,,485,4.0
