8013139,5,B0001I54M0,"This dvd features renowed percussionist Cassio Duarte from Brazil as the instructor. He takes the viewer on a tour of more than 12 different Brazilian percussion instruments and explains each one while teaching the viewer a simple pattern. The patterns that he teaches allows the viewer to learn three different tradition rhythms which are pagode, baiao and batacuda. He also explains call and response. The video section is very clear the instruments sound very good. Cassio goes slow enough for the begginner and at the end the rhythms are played at actual speed so that the viewer can play along at the correct speed. If you don't have the exact instruments you can substitute some of them with a drumset or marching band drums in order to practice. For example the Tom can become the Repinique. The bass drum can be the Surdo, etc.
All in all this is a very good dvd video aimed at the beginner.",1080604800,19,899,4.69620253164557
