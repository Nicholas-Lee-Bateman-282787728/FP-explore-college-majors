8251341,5,B0013JWDG6,"I'm a huge Mads Mikkelsen fan, and have been collecting his movies. This Danish thriller is great fun, with the added bonus of not following the American thriller formula. Some nice twists and turns, and an intense performance by Mads Mikkelsen, as well as a very young Alexander Skarsgaard. Just a reminder, this is a region 2 film, so it will not work on American dvd players.",1400976000,2,378,4.656716417910448
8251342,3,B0013JWDG6,I love Mads and Alex but this movie didn't seem to have any directions.  Mads and Alex didn't seem in sync.  This is only a Region 2 DVD and didn't feel the quality of the DVD was great.  My DVD's from Europe are usually in very good condition.  Don't recommend paying the extra taxes unless you love Mads.,1390694400,,306,4.224137931034483
8251343,5,B0013JWDG6,"What can we expect from the Palm D'Or recipient in 2013!
He is superb in anything he does.  He is a professional chameleon.
He can play whatever character he encounters in his career.
He is on the Big Leagues. Just watch Hannibal. He doesn't need to talk.
It is amazing acting. I'm glad I am a witness of such an acting career.",1389225600,,327,4.274193548387097
8251344,4,B0013JWDG6,"Fans of Mads will love this film for his performance.  I wish it was available in USA format, but I viewed on the computer.  The film as a whole isn't as good as the acting, but the cast gives it their all.",1388016000,,206,3.880952380952381
8251345,4,B0013JWDG6,"This is another re release of a film, this time from 2006 starring the highly rated Mads Mikkelsen as Thomas Skepphult a Swedish businessman and a successful one to boot. We are shown a very dark happening some years before and that is left hanging, until that very incident comes back to haunt Thomas. This is as his partner is about to retire and leave everything to him.

But as in all good thrillers all great plans go to pot this time due to third party intervention and the pesky cops who always get it wrong. Then people start to die and Thomas is implicated. This develops into a thriller where Mr Mikkelsen has to prove his innocence, find the guilty party and protect his family whilst paying trusted confidantes oodles of cash to help him. Oh and trying not to be killed at the same time.

So is it any good? Well I really enjoyed it but this was an adaptation of the book by Jasper Karrbrink and it is hard to condense a complicated plot into 100 minutes of screen time. It is however, gripping in places and the suspense is palpable. The acting is all very good as is always the case from Mads Mikkelsen he is excellent. It might be cynical of me but I think this has only had a re release because of his recent success and concomitant popularity.

All that aside this fits in well with the ever growing catalogue of Nordic Noir and I must admit I am a fan so as I missed it first time round, it was nice to get it brought back to my attention. A good solid film , with good direction and acting that may leave a few loose ends but you do ultimately feel that you have seen a rewarding piece of cinema - recommended to Nordic noir fans and if you like a good thriller.",1374537600,4,1681,4.230529595015576
