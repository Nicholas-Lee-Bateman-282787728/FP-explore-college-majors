8573096,5,B00BRI969U,"Many of us have experienced the big sounds of late 80's glam and its transition into the various musical revolutions of the 90s. Glam band, Nova Rex, takes us through a hilarious account of what it was like to be a part of the action during this time period. Groupies, former rockers, and fans will experience a lighthearted nostalgia through the band's personal accounts, video footage, and snippets from photo albums and live shows. It is a time period many will remember and enjoy reliving through this hilarious documentary.

I found the interviews very interesting and it was all entertaining, light, and fun. It really captured the essence of music at that time and the prevailing rock band culture. What happened to the band when the shift in popular musical genre occurred? The documentary spares few details as they recount party nights, hyped up shows at big venues, and the inevitable crash of the band. It is so awesome that they are able to take away the good from it and focus on the overall music and time period- not just sorrow over a washed-up band. It is a truly unique perspective that music lovers will surely enjoy. Anyone who enjoys this genre, is familiar with the band, or lived out similar experiences in this time frame will love reminiscing and laughing with the musicians. Very well done!",1377648000,2,1317,4.776315789473684
