The film is entertaining, the plot is told in a non-linear way. Time shifts occur frequently, aptly revealing in retrospect the circumstances which lead to decisons being made and actions being taken by the protagonists. Concerning the visual style: If you compare this film to ""Helter Skelter"" (same main actress, similar topic: rich young woman) it becomes evident that the latter is a formally very daring and lavishly shot movie obviously created for the big screen and an adult audience while Akujo ni tsuite is a harmless TV drama that doesn't offend anybody. So don't expect any scandalous scenes here. Performances are solid but the whole picture didn't move me very much I must say. Perhaps this has also something to do with the English subtitling:
I'm not satisfied with the English subtitling. I know there's a broad range of quality to be found concerning English subtitles when you have watched many DVDs. There are those subtitlings that are just flawless (Criterion releases for example) and others that are completely useless and unreadable. On this DVD it's somewhere in the middle. Not very bad and not very good. Timing is OK, spelling is often right, but about two thirds of the sentences make little or no sense because words used don't fit, due to either the use of a bad automatic translation program or a subtitling team that ought to take some more English lessons. In order to follow the film's plot it really helps if you understand at least a little of the spoken Japanese.
Strangely the English subtitling of the ""Clock Store's Girl"" DVD (same company) is perfect (I wrote a review on that).",1430352000,,1893,4.827692307692308
