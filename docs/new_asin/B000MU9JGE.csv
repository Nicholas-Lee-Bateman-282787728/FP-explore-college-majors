8172442,5,B000MU9JGE,The words are Italian but the story is universal (and thankfully it has English subtitles.)  Husband ignores wife.  Wife goes on an adventure.  The actors are all terrific and the scenery - Venice - has its charms as well.  I love this film.,1397606400,3,241,4.534883720930233
8172443,5,B000MU9JGE,"The main and secondary characters are all excellent.  We enjoyed the whole journey--great mix or reality, humor and romance with some quirky characters you grow to enjoy--no high speed chases, murders or outrageous special effects.  We have watched this repeatedly.  If you get the version without english subtitles (we have one with and one without) they are not really necessary.",1362268800,2,381,5.316666666666666
