Not only is there footage missing from the original but nearly all the original music and car sounds are gone and have been replaced with generic sounds instead. Like for instance there is footage missing during the diner scene and when he races the mustang and civic the sounds of the turbo integra have been changed from the original sounds they had from the original version of this movie, then the biggest disappointment was at the end when he races RJ de Vera in the S2k, he was originally supposed to be listening to ""Elements of life"" by Alice Dee Jay, not that crap on this movie. Oh and don't even get me started on all the sound hacking they did on the max boost cartoon preview, they ruined it. I'm one of the few people that remember the real version of how this film was supposed to be and I'm extremely disappointed in what was done here. I don't reccomend this to anyone as it's been altered and hacked.",1381449600,,999,4.376344086021505
