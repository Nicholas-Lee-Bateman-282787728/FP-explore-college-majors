7810271,5,6301071387,"I wish that Filmation released all of these classic 1967 episodes on DVD.  It was rare to see such a good animated adaption of these comic heros.  My favorite was Aqualad.  I loved Tuskee the Walwus and of course Aquaman's gal Mera.
The animation studios will never make them like this again and it's a rare treat to see them on video.  This one is good for fans old and new alike.  It's worth the price to buy this one.",1029542400,11,420,4.2

Aquaman, who with his teenage allie, Aqualad, guards and defends all that lives in the sea against the forces of evil.  Aquaman!  King of the 7 Seas!""That is what you would hear at the beginning of each Aquaman cartoon during its original run in the late 1960s.  This collection is the only way to get Aquaman cartoons in any form right now.  I also recommend the other 3 ""Super Powers"" collection videos: Batman, Superman, and Superboy for more fun, classic Superhero action.
The ""8 Aquatic Adventures"" included on this video are:
01. Where Lurks the Fisherman - The Fisherman and his hammerhead men attack Atlantis with dangerous torpedoes and try to ""catch"" Aquaman on a big hook!
02. The Microscopic Monsters - The Black Manta kidnaps Aqualad to get closer to Aquaman's growth ray, but Aquaman's fishy friends don't like it!
03. Mephisto's Marine Marauders - Mephisto, a guy in a devil costume, attempts to take over Atlantis by putting sleep gas in their oxygen supply, but Aquaman has had a nap and is on to him!
04. The War of the Quatix & the Bimphars - Aquaman, Aqualad, and Tusky the Walrus go to an undiscovered ""all water"" planet and find that two races of fish like creatures are at war.  Aided by a giant Squid, Aquaman gets the Quatix & Bimphars to shake fins.
05. The Onslaught of the Octomen - Orange Octopus like men things have created their own power generator and have trapped Aqualad in some big suction cups in order to lure Aquaman to their lair and steal his secret of telepathy with sea life.
06. Treacherous is the Torpedo Man - Shape-shifting Torpedo Man has been hiding out in an abandoned pirate ship, but its all a trap to trap Aquaman in a little trap!
07. The Trio of Terror - Black Manta, the Brain, and Vassa - Queen of Mermaids band together to attack Atlantis and get revenge on Aquaman for all the crap he's put them through over the years
08. To Catch a Fisherman - The Fisherman is bored and decides to imprison Tusky the walrus and the Old Man of the Sea in chains.  He also manages to trap Aquaman in a mound of hardened lava because he doesent like him.  Its up to Aqualad to set them free so Aquaman can kick the Fisherman in his tackle!",1017273600,18,2285,4.475961538461538
7810273,5,6301071387,"What can I say... This toon was created by Filmation Studios in the late 1960's, and it rocks! Please release more Filmation cartoons!",1011312000,2,134,4.869565217391305
7810274,4,6301071387,"Filmation did three superhero series in the 1960s - Superman, Aquaman, and Batman.  1967's Aquaman, like his airborne Kryptonian counterpart, remains a splendid series, combining outstanding voice performances, lush graphics,  and stirring music scores.
The music of John Marion and Gordon Zahler is  even more elaborate and powerful here than with their earlier Superman  series.  They feature a larger orchestra and extract some downright  stunning performances, none more awe-inspiring than a cue in the cartoon  Treacherous Is The Torpedoman; Torpedo (voiced by Ted Knight with great  echo effect) is an armored villian capable of tremendous speeds underwater.  He surrounds Aquaman (Marvin Miller) and Aqualad (Jerry Dexter), leading  the youngster to comment, ""It's like there's ten of him!"" The  music cue for this scene thunders forward and almost drowns out dialogue,  and leaves the viewer a bit shaken.
Some of the writing is quite good,  as in the antiwar drama The War Of The Quattix And The Bimphabs.  The best  scene comes when Aquaman and Aqualad haul the two warring leaders together  for an impromptu peace conference, but are then taken by armed soldiers  from each side.  Aquaman then plays his trump card - a monster squid who  seizes the warring leaders and forces them to settle their dispute  peaceably.
The only disappointment in the tape is that there are only  eight such cartoons.  In any event, it is an entertaining tape well worth  purchasing.",926553600,15,1474,5.205128205128205
