8320644,2,B001M6SHVU,"I am disappointed with this purchase. When it arrived, I could hear the discs rattling around in the case. They must have broken loose from the case during shipping. I didn't notice any scratches when I initially opened it up, so I went ahead and gave it to my son for Christmas. Most of the discs freeze or skip during playback. A closer look at the discs revealed scuffs/scratches. I should have looked more closely at the discs the first time and returned them. Lesson learned.",1420588800,,480,4.593023255813954

8320646,3,B001M6SHVU,"As an adult this show is somewhat annoying, and the science is ridiculous, but my 2 and 4 year old like it. I prefer something at least semi educational, the physics in this reality are laughable.",1408320000,,196,4.472222222222222
8320647,5,B001M6SHVU,My grandson really enjoyed getting this for his birthday.  He likes being able to see his favorite episodes any time.  Thank you,1407542400,,128,4.7727272727272725
8320648,5,B001M6SHVU,Love this show. My son at the time was 3 and loves it still. They stopped carring it in Netflix so we opted to get it through amazon for his kindle. Its very much like bob the builder but much better quality. Also for some reason my son loved this while only kinda liking Bob the builder.,1407283200,,288,4.0701754385964914

8320651,5,B001M6SHVU,My son is three and loves this Lunar Jim set. Lots of episodes with age appropriate lessons. Characters are cute and not too annoying. We'll be buying the next season set soon.,1367539200,,176,4.53125
8320652,5,B001M6SHVU,"Very good claymation children's show about a lunar colony. It is in Spanish on television, and my children, 5 and 7, watch it and like it anyway, I thought it might be a good way for them to pick up a little Spanish. I thought it might be nice for them to see it in English so I got it for them for Christmas, and yet they still like to watch the Spanish version when it is on. I highly recommend it for kids. It is also one of the children's shows that are enjoyable to watch with your children.",1295222400,3,496,3.97
