8368508,3,B002EZLO54,I purchased the video after seeing it on PBS and as a memory to my trip to Turkey.  I thought the video was very well done.  It was educational and informative.,1391472000,,160,4.129032258064516

8368510,3,B002EZLO54,"But that's no compliment.

The disk is divided into two parts: Istanbul and the Turquoise Coast. Both were competent presentations, but the constant video presence of Rudy Maxa was irritating (he comes across as being vain and slightly silly).

The Istanbul portion included all of the major sites. The descriptions were better than average, although it appeared that one hotel (the Ciragan Palace) had bought its way in; it is not the top luxury hotel in Istanbul; try the Four Seasons Sultanhamet instead. There also were numerous plugs for individual merchants in the Grand Bazaar. Again, shades of Rick Steves.

Similarly, the portion on the Turquoise Coast was well presented, although one tires of the constant visual presence of Mr. Maxa.

I would have given this video 4 stars but for the fact that irritating advertisements from Preferred Hotels and other advertisers kept cropping up throughout it.",1264032000,6,908,5.156462585034014
