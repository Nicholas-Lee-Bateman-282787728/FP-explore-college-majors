8427144,5,B004EL5NKS,"This movie has some very interesting aspects concerning Indian mentality towards racism or humiliation, which is (or was?) a basic problem. The movie had a very well done plot and good ideas. This film is something completely new. Now the movie was not about the fights, it had a very interesting message, which is something like: if you really want something to happen, and you have a strong will, it will happen. This film is perhaps also to provoke some kind of basic change of attitude towards humiliation and racism. (Which, by the way, does not goes towards violence, but a better awareness of the own dignity, self-respect and a stronger will, maybe.) It luminates also other basic problems, for example how easily racists can get the upper hand: ""divide and rule"". All in all the movie tries to bring a more clear idea of the whole theme of racism against Indians and to provoke a better awareness of everyone (for Indian AND British or generely whites).",1301097600,,962,4.766467065868263
