8055329,1,B00081U76S,I did not like it.  It was boring and more a documentory than a movie.  I was under the wrong impression it was like the other canon ball car races that were funny and entertaining.  It had some humor in the beginning but the whole thing just pooped out as far as I was concerned.,1368403200,2,280,4.054545454545455
8055330,2,B00081U76S,"Very disappointing DVD, just a bunch of drunken yobs, (hardly makes me proud to be British!)...the original Cannonball runs were tongue in cheek movies, obviously Hollywood suspend belief/fantasy movies, not this group of morons.",1308182400,,229,5.764705882352941

8055334,4,B00081U76S,"This not like cannonball I and II but its nice to see the spirt of cannonball is still alive, but a better title would be Gumball Rally 2004",1128729600,9,140,4.035714285714286
