This particular edition, DESERT, provides one more valuable lesson-that ANYONE can make a mistake. Kids too often believe everything they see in a documentary and the laughable error presented in this one, something that any southwestern US kid can tell you is WRONG, helps remind viewers to question supposed authorities.
About 15 minutes in, the narrator says that tumbleweeds are able to get the water they need to survive as they roll along. Whoever prepared the script seems to have not realized that someone was pulling their leg and did not check the science before including it in the show.
For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of trying to uproot a tumbleweed in the growing season- the are FIRMLY rooted in the ground, they get water through their roots and are a formidable foe-they are very hard to pull up (easiest if you soak the ground to the depth of their long tap root). It is only in the Fall, when the plant dies, that it lets loose its strong hold on the Earth, and the wind eventually sends it rolling across fields and along highways. When a tumbleweed is in the tumbling stage of its life, it no longer needs water, because it is dead.
Teachers, ask your kids to watch this dvd and tell you if they can spot the error in it. Helps develop critical thinking.
The same mistake exists in the video and in the dvd- it wasn't corrected before reissuing it on dvd.",1363046400,,1521,4.637037037037037
7864258,4,6304165234,"I enjoyed Eyewitness desert. But it was perhaps a fraction less interesting than the other Eyewitness videos and this is why I rated it down one star. In EW-Desert, several pertinent facts about deserts are discussed: where they are, how people (and animals) live in them, and the historical significance of deserts.
Unfortunately, there seems to be a HUGE amount of time spent discussing camels rather deserts, and there appeared to be almost no discussion of the origins of deserts. Still, EW-Desert was interesting enough to view, at least once. My favorite all-time EW videos are: Eyewitness Plant (this is surprisingly good), Eyewitness Monster, and Eyewitness Dog. IF you like Desert, give those a try as well, you won't be disappointed.",1056412800,3,743,5.148760330578512
