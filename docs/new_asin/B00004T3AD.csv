1349025,3,B00004T3AD,"I haven't watched many of the episodes presented on these DVDs, but most of those that I did watch had little to do with ghosts. I wouldn't recommend these DVDs to those truly interested in the spirit world, but their entertainment value isn't bad.",1247011200,,248,4.659090909090909

1349027,2,B00004T3AD,"This set is pretty disappointing compared to what I expected.  And the reason is not so much the story lines (they're mostly pretty good) -- it is the campy, extremely stilted, amateur acting. . . I mean it's consisently bad across every episode we've watched so far. .  now I admit I'm only halfway through the episodes (so we're on disk 3).  The acting is so bad it is nearly painful - it's like watching people who've never acted standing up with scripts and just reading awkwardly with either no, or too much, expression. . . .  I keep expecting their ""acting coach"" to step in and correct them.  And keep in mind when reading this review, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular . . I figured this series would be along the lines of the old Friday the 13th TV series as far as quality of acting, script, production etc., which would have been just fine...but this is just . . well...bad.  Even for the price.",1226534400,,913,4.469879518072289

1349030,5,B00004T3AD,I have enjoyed watching these ghost stories.  They are entertaining and best of all the whole family can watch them.  There is no bad language or anything to worry about.  I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.,1208649600,2,235,4.5476190476190474
1349031,4,B00004T3AD,"If you're a fan of Creep Show you'll love these DVD's.  Many many entertaining stories.  There are 40 episodes and many hours of ""visits from beyond the grave""",1208217600,2,159,4.642857142857143
1349032,5,B00004T3AD,"I was pleasantly shocked with how great these stories were!! They are quite entertaining, many are creepy, and the great majority are creative.  How great is it to have that many creative story plots in a relatively unknown dvd set when many big hit movie can't pull a new idea out of their you know what to save their life.  Also, don't listen to anyone that says the acting isn't good.  It is very impressive for a group of unheard of actors.  All in all, I loved this dvd set.",1205366400,3,479,4.288888888888889
1349033,3,B00004T3AD,"I don't know why they call this series Ghost. I equate ghosts with hauntings. To me this is more like the old Tales From The Darkside series. This 5 DVD pack contains 40 short thriller/chiller/bizarre stories. The set I have does not have menus or titles to navigate through. Overall, I'd say the stories are too bad though.",1205366400,,324,4.603448275862069
1349034,5,B00004T3AD,one review says the stories you cna figure out easliy i agree the the way they do it make it so fun to watch plus the price is a steal,1194566400,3,134,3.5
1349035,1,B00004T3AD,"Really dreadful. The only interest being generated while watching this dvd would have to be created by the viewer themselves. The stories are weak, and the direction is childish and cliche and the endings are unbelievably easy to predict.

The result is a very poor, unsuccessful ghost story collection. I suggest hiring a ghost to watch it with you if you are wanting to feel scared or on the edge of your armchair, otherwise save your cash. one star for making me laugh out loud, all be it sarcastically",1188172800,5,505,4.674157303370786
1349036,3,B00004T3AD,"A ton of episodes! Many dull and poorly acted. If you like campy TV this will be right up your alley. Not awful, but it takes significantly more to WOW me. B rated TV.",1187136000,3,167,3.9411764705882355
1349037,5,B00004T3AD,"I had seen a few episodes when it aired on television and then I received this set as a present.  I was overwhelmed with joy when I watched them and it dawned on me that this was the series I saw years ago.  After doing some research on this series, this DVD set has all but four episodes.  The series only lasted one season...so in all, this is almost the complete series.

What is Ghost Stories like?  Don't get is confused with the other series also called ghost stories with the english dude, which is kind of dry and boring.  This series is very much like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside in that each episode is self-contained and originally ran for 30 minutes.  There is a warning label on the DVD set that it is not suitable for those under 13 basically for suspense and some minor gore and grizzly makeup effects.  Anyway , if you love Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Outer Limits but wanted more of that supernatural/ ghost story edge, this is the series for you....and 40 episodes to boot : )",1112486400,38,1019,4.382978723404255
1349038,5,B00004T3AD,"This item should be on everyones must get list.  I bought it over halloween because it was really cheap .55 cents an episode (you do the math).  Just like the other reviewer, I figured it's be pretty lame, but that there might be a couple worthwhile stories.  Boy was I wrong, I pretty much like every story.  True there not all Oscar winners (then again look at the movies that are nominated - maybe it's a good thing there not).  Anyways, I can guarantee this will be one of your most prized collections and that whenever your friends check out your DVD's you proudly have displayed, this will be the one you'll talk about the most.

Trust me, this is the best.",1107129600,25,663,4.39344262295082
1349039,5,B00004T3AD,"I was at (...) when I happened upon this box set in the temporary Holloween horror DVD display. I liked the price, so I purchased it. On the (...) I decided to open the set to find out just what I had. I thought this set would contain bad acted trash that I could laugh at.
  In fact, this is actually an amazing series. The actors are completely competent, the locations are perfect for ghost story affect, the music is Mark Snow eerie, and the violence or horror or intensity is haunting. The show has a ""Dead Man's Gun"" air to it. Rip Torn is the narrator. He has a Kris Kristofferson affect that sets the mood.
  These are ghost stories. Someone is murdered and he, or she, comes back from the dead for revenge. Or, someone longs for peace from a miserable life, only to find it in the arms of ghostly irony. Or, much more.
  I did some research on this series. There are 44 episodes of this show. 40 of them are in this 5 disc set. At 30 minutes each you are talking 20 some hours of content. For (...), this is the best DVD value purchase I have ever made! I like this show that much. Even the packaging is good. The outside is cool and each disc has it's own holder. Snapshots from the series adorns the inside of the jacket. You can even choose individual episodes with ease off the discs.
  This show was origionally aired on FOX family network. I can not imagine how or why that happened. This stuff is intense, very violent, very scary, sometimes extremely freaky, and will give young children nightmares. I am 45 years old and I have a 12 year old boy and I will not allow him to view this set. There is tons of cigarette smoking, much alcohol abuse, adult language and themes, and shocking scenes - example, the very first episode has a woman being run-over by a truck. She is then placed in a container and pushed into a lake. She is still alive and screaming for her life as the container sinks sending her to ""Ghost Story"" revenge land. I can hear those screams right now.
  I LOVE IT! But, this is not for the kids.
  I say buy this box set. ""Ghost Stories"" is ten times better than the last ""Twilight Zone"" incarnation. And it cost me less than half as much.
  Enjoy!

1349040,4,B00004T3AD,"These videos give a good start to anyone who is beginning to learn about ghosts and ghost stories, not too in depth, but good to start with on a spooky, stormy night",1069632000,,165,4.1875
1349041,4,B00004T3AD,"If you're intrigued by the paranormal, you'll enjoy this collection of documentaries.  I bought mine from an e-Bay seller, who advertised that these stories will give you the chills.  I was intrigued and entertained, by these stories didn't keep me awake at night.  Most of them take place in Texas and Arizona, while a few were in the midwest and California.  They also talked about the Native American and Asian customs concerning the spirit world which I thought were fascinating.  I was surprised that there was no coverage of the eastern seaboard, which is teeming with all sorts of spirits, ranging back to the colonial and Civil War periods.  Perhaps the original show was cancelled before they got the chance to seek out these places.  At any rate, I think you'll enjoy the stories on these tapes.  The reason I give this product a 4-star review instead of a 5 was the quality of the tapes.  I had problems with the second and sixth tapes jumping all over the place before my VCR adjusted them.  Still, I recommend this video set.",996278400,7,1038,4.685082872928176
1349042,3,B00004T3AD,"This is a collection of neat horror tales. It's NRated but I'd slap an R rating on this fun batch of haunts. I always passed on this at the video store, but in desperation I gave it a try. It's nothing you haven't ever seen before, but non the less it is a sure bet and entertaining. I really liked it and I'm hard to satisfy.",983750400,,326,3.9545454545454546
1349043,4,B00004T3AD,"This is an entertaining series.  Done in a news magazine style each tape  takes a look at a different region or different type of haunting.  Since  each tape covers a wide range of hauntings, only a few stories are with any  sort of depth on each tape.  There are a few stories that I wish that they  would have delved deeper into and that is one of the reasons I took off a  star and because of the last tape.  The last tape in the series is a  historical look at folklore all over the world and seems really out of  place.  I think serious ghost hunters might be disappointed but someone  just starting out getting into ghostly legends and stories will really  enjoy it...just skip the last tape.",968284800,8,698,4.310077519379845
