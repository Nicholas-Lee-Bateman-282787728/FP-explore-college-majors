It was just a bunch of clips, with little or no user-friendly point & click options.  Let's face it, I bought the product for its historical value; what I was hoping for was a little more time in editing to merge one topic into another.  A smooth transition would have been nice.  It was clear those in possession of these clips simply ""threw them on a disk"" and said ""pack it and ship it""

3 stars because it was ""OK"", but I've seen other WWII documentary specials that made these cd's look like a high school project who scored a ""C minus"".",1258243200,,721,4.311111111111111
8121459,2,B000FEB91U,"As a World War II buff, I was somewhat disappointed in this DVD set.  I purchased the set based on other reviewers.  As stated by others these DVDs are government recorded ""movies"".  The DVDs are not intended to give a historical view on WWII but rather the govt. view on various topics.  Examples include: ""How to wash and remove war gas; How a portable radio was constructed; Interment of Japanese-Americans and how they lived their lives there. The quality varied greatly but were satisfactory.  The DVDs themselves look a little homemade but again satisfactory. I must state that I have not seen all of the DVDs and not sure if I will.  I think that the set is too pricey for what you get.",1248739200,,693,4.548387096774194
8121460,5,B000FEB91U,"It took me about three weeks to get through all of the films here and there are some I want to go back and watch again. The reason is that each of the movies (there have to be at least 40) tell you the history of World War Two from a differnet perspective, so things I thought about during my first viewing will seem different after seeing other films. The film quality varies from film to film, but all of it is fairly well restored. The really good clips are outstandingly well preserved and even the others are all very watchable and you have to expect a little bit of grain with older films like this that were not meant to be preserved.",1148256000,10,641,4.219512195121951
