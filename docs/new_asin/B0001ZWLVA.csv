2049484,5,B0001ZWLVA,Tour of contemporary American visiting sites with reenactment of important evens.......interesting perspective.  Recommend this video.....provides the perspective from British Point of View.,1371340800,,190,7.636363636363637
2049485,2,B0001ZWLVA,"According to the British historian who narrates (and presumably wrote) this documentary, Britain didn't do anything to ""lose America"", we broke off because we were greedy capitalists and were too churlish to pay British taxes anymore (I guess we weren't ""patriotic"" enough).  No mention, let alone discussion, of the issues of representation and self-government that taxation involved.  No engagement whatsoever with the beliefs of Americans of the time as to what they thought their ""rights as Englishmen"" were, or the ideals of liberty and philosophy of government expressed in the Declaration of Independence, i.e. that legitimate governments govern only with the consent of the governed, that the people have the right to alter or abolish any form of government they feel no longer is securing their freedoms - ideals which helped inspire the French Revolution - zero, zip, bupkiss.  Having dismissed any analysis of the larger meaning of the Revolution, he spends 90% of the documentary on a very pedestrian and superficial narration of the military campaigns.  There are other documentaries which do a much better job of that.

Well, evidently this is the British view of the Revolution. Don't waste your money on it.",1350777600,3,1223,5.251282051282051
2049486,3,B0001ZWLVA,"I saw ""Rebels & Redcoats"" in my library, checked it out, and watched it a few days ago. I liked it enough to buy it, especially at such a low price. However, I do not recommend it without some caveats.

I've been mulling over the presentation for several days because I needed to give it a fair chance: my own bias was suspect, to say the least. As a United States citizen, it was difficult for me to watch such potent iconoclasm.

Now that I've digested the presentation and my reaction to it, I can say two things: it represents a point of view that everyone interested in the American Revolution should hear; and it has nontrivial flaws.

The narrator's tone is just a bit too shrill to be taken as unbiased. He has an axe, and by gosh he's going to grind it. He wants to convince us that each and every colonial revolutionary fell into two groups: rich, self-interested ingrates and their poor, deluded puppets. He leads us to think ourselves naive for suspecting that a single one of them had a legitimate grievance. This absolutist thinking strikes me as suspect.

Another big misstep the narrator makes is to make emotional entreaties for us to dislike Washington. He constantly reminds us that Washington's ideas about liberty only applied to white males. Yes. Thank you. I understand. I also understand the need to see a historical character from the point of view of his own culture. It's easy to take potshots at almost anyone if we indulge in seeing them through a self-satisfied modern lens, but when we do so we jettison our chances of seeing that person clearly. The narrator asks us to make that mistake, rather than take the more challenging and rewarding road of seeing Washington from a contemporary perspective.

The most telling piece of axe-grinding comes during the bit about the southern campaign. The narrative goes to great lengths to establish absolute moral parity between the Brits, loyalists and Hessians on the one hand, and the revolutionary colonists on the other: he wheedles that, though the former group committed atrocities, the latter committed just as many. Big mistake. I know a bit about this subject because I've read a fair amount about the New Jersey campaign of 1776. Before the British forces followed the Continental Army across New Jersey, most of the state was loyalist. By December, ratio had flip-flopped, and the colonists had nothing to do with that. The atrocities committed by the British and Hessian forces had enraged the populace so much that local militia groups were cropping up independently of Washington's forces and beginning to be a serious problem for Rall. If this doesn't convince you, then look at the Hessian response to their treatment by their colonial captors after Trenton and Princeton. Contrary to their own expectations, they were treated with dignity -- per Washington's orders! Conveniently, the narrator never mentions any of this.

Again, this presentation is valuable as an opposing viewpoint. Just don't be duped into thinking that it is without flaws.",1290297600,4,3035,4.906432748538012
2049487,5,B0001ZWLVA,"Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America provides the British perspective vis--vis the American Revolution. Professor Richard Holmes does an excellent job of shedding light on little known aspects of the American War of Independence thus providing a more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the 1775-1783 conflict than what has been generally shown to-date. The documentary is divided into four parts dealing with as many aspects of and visiting as many geographic regions of the conflict as possible. Subsequently, the documentary provides valuable insight into a very important period of English (American and British) History.
Specifically: We get a taste of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war along with their wavering support for one side and the other (the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English respectively).
Moreover, the documentary presents the clash within the British side (i.e. the personality clashes-Clinton vs. Cornwallis, the admirals, etc.).
In addition, one truly recognizes and appreciates the involvement of French King Louis XVI (beginning in 1778) and the French contribution (who along with the Spaniards in 1779 and Dutch in 1780 entered the war in opposition to Great Britain, and tipped the scales against King George III.
Furthermore, there is special mention of the 100,000 American Loyalists that were forced into exile as well the Continentals' treatment (or mistreatment) of slaves and Indians alike.
As a result, Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America is a daring documentary, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the American War of Independence, and provides for accurate, valid and often unpleasant or painful historical truths.
In short, Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America is a documentary definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, along with films such as Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor (Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer), The Crossing (Jeff Daniels), and Revolution (Al Pacino). 5 Stars",1248393600,10,2180,5.589123867069486

2049489,4,B0001ZWLVA,"Richard Holmes does a nice job attempting to show the British perspective of the Rev War.  Perhaps one of the surprising views expressed is the notion that he believes the Revolution was more a Civil War.  This is a view somewhat debated now by some newer historians.  The verdict is out on that one still in my opinion.

The documentry provides a contempory look at many of the Rev War sites which gives it a nice contrast to other similer works.  One suspects that the intent was to give a different, almost travelogue quality to the production. At times it seems like we are on a road trip across the North East of America!

This is a small scale production, so those looking for something like LIBEERTY or THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION documentries will not find that here.  Ample use is made of re-enactors, even though some could have looked the part better.  Some of the local Park Rangers and weapons experts provide a folksy addition to the discussion.

Despite being almost 4 hrs long, there are still notably gaps in the coverage of the topic.  Not much is said about the Hessians, and after Trenton, the battle of Princeton is completely over-looked.  The same pretty much for Valley Forge and Monmouth battle in 1778.  Richard Holmes tries to show that the British worked against many odds to fight the war as they did.  Still, he could have emphisized more how well they did adapt to fighting in North America.  No other power of the day could have sustained such an effort acorss the Atlantic.  The constant Viet Nam comparisons worked part of the time, but a little too much was made of this.  Some of the discussions with Americans in the South was intended as humor more than anything else.  One wonders if this production was shown in the UK!

Over all a decent production, with some different opinions which might be new to some viewers.  Richard Holmes is engaging and pleasant, and the whole production comes off almost like a road trip across the Eastern Coast to track down the Rev War battle sites.  It rates four stars because it was not as comprehensive as I would have liked.  Still, a worthwhile production.",1240876800,3,2130,4.641711229946524
2049490,1,B0001ZWLVA,"This definitely has a British slant and mostly sides with the British....the title itself says it all....

""Rebels and Redcoats""......Rebels meaning criminals, non-conformist and trouble makers while Redcoats meaning ""brave British army""....",1223164800,5,241,6.53125
2049491,1,B0001ZWLVA,"I rented this from my local library because I thought it would provide a British perspective on the American Revolution.  Apparently the British perspective includes historical falsehoods and absence of key information, but that's not all that's wrong.

First, let's start with the technical issues.  This is a documentary, and maybe I've grown accustomed to the Ken Burns style, but I have a hard time taking seriously a documentary that just has one commentator (albeit one with a British accent).  Are the views in this documentary just his?  Did they not want dissenting or collaborating views?  Is he a mouthpiece?  Why not have other historians involved?

Second, if they were going to talk Britain ... how about talking Britain?  Parliamentary debates.  Burke.  Chatham.  North.  George III.  What's happening in London?  What's happening in New York City?  You won't find out here, I'll tell you that much.

Third, there are some serious historical issues herein.  The Royal Governor of Virginia issues a proclamation freeing slaves that join him to fight (oh the irony!  those preaching liberty are upset he does this! -- more on this below) ... yet fails to mention he shortly thereafter sold them back into slavery.

Then, there's the issue with the American style of fighting, especially in the Carolinas.  Yes, the Americans are better at sniper fire and fringe attacks.  But the British developed their own light infantry after they encountered a similar situation in the French & Indian War -- this wasn't new to them.  If you go by the documentary, you'd think the British were incapable of responding to military innovation.  What's worse is that the three battles that immediately follow this discussion: King's Mountain, Cowpens, and Guilford Courthouse, contradict what he just said!  King's Mountain was largely a battle between two militia groups, and thus both were capable of fighting under cover.  In Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse, the Americans used traditional lines to fight the British regulars.  So what was the point of the previous digression?

In the same sequence, you have a complete falsehood: if you believe the narrator, the British fought Greene in Guilford Courthouse after a forced march through Carolina with a minimum of food and equipment.  Well, yes and no: Cornwallis chased Greene through North Carolina, but after Greene got across the Dan River, Cornwallis retired to Hillsborough to resupply!  Obviously the writers of this documentary thought it'd sound better if the battle happened while the British troops were dead on their feet ... who needs historical accuracy when a tailor-made excuse for a substandard showing can be made?

Another fun sequence is when Tarleton's massacre at the Waxhaws is glossed over (who cares about the hundred of accounts of the massacre -- including Tarleton's -- the documentarians find room for doubt anyway), and then discuss the Loyalist militia massacre in North Carolina.  Now, is it possible this massacre was an unnecessary retaliation?  Yes.  Did General Henry Lee order the massacre?  Hmmm ... well, historically there's no proof either way.  Lee in his memoirs says that he tries to get the militia to surrender and that his men (South Carolina men, related to victims at the Waxhaws) fired on them.  You won't find that information in this documentary, though, because they want to make Lee look worse than Tarleton.  Granted, Lee could've been trying to make himself look better ... but that doesn't explain why he would've put himself in the line of fire when the massacre happened.  Regardless, good history allows for possibilities; it doesn't force its own decision on its readers/viewers.

Now, to the crux of the issue: it's obvious what the intended goal of this documentary was: to point out the hypocrisies and ironies of the American Revolution.  And this is not a bad subject to tackle; the issue is that this material is out there already.  The founding fathers debated the slavery issue during the war; there were atrocities committed against Loyalists; and Abigail Adams even wrote her husband John a nice letter about the rights of women.  There's a good opportunity for these issues to be addressed intelligently and with proper respect for history.  But not here.  This is just blind agendizing with no real historical merit ... except for maybe documentary historians who are interested in the 'defeats' of their genre.",1195776000,17,4436,5.125523012552302
2049492,2,B0001ZWLVA,"The historical presentation in this documentary is quite good. What is strange is the mixing of 18th century history with modern day images.
For example, after explaining about Dorchester Heights and its role in the seige of Boston, they show a kid throwing a tennis ball against the monument on D. Heights. WHAT? Everything is presented from the British point of view, which is OK, but I have a few issues with that. They insist on calling it a ""Civil War"" which I'm not completely convinced the term is appropriate. Also, there are many innane references to the Vietnam War. The interviewing of people on the bus about the history is funny and seems SO out of place for the seriousness of the film.
After watching 3 of the 4 episodes, I won't be finishing it. I've seen enough.
In so many ways, this documentary just misses the mark.",1172188800,3,835,4.610738255033557
2049493,5,B0001ZWLVA,"I've read some of these reviews and I will sympathize. It's very hard being told something completely  contrary to what you have been taught all your life but lets face facts... this isn't biased. Reality is brutal, complicated and down-right messy. You would be naiive to think that the Colonial Rebels were fighting for a just cause of liberty and fairness for all men. For the most part, like the documentary states, it was stirred up by a small group of men who didn't much like not being able to stroll into Native American territory, steal it and then kill everyone. Tax barely had anything to do with it, the Colonials were not being taxed heavily. After the French and Indian War when Britain defeated France, the Colonials were rejoicing in their Britishness, they were proud to be a part of a glorious Empire. It all went the other way in the flick of a switch.

The war opened up with the British giving the Rebels a serious mauling. The Mauling continued right up until Yorktown when French back stabbing saved the Revolution from disolving into nothing. I am more inclined to believe a British perspective because shortly after this war Britain went on to create the largest Empire the world had ever seen and believe it or not, the American Revolution helped it so there is no reason for British historians to lie.",1151539200,8,1328,4.670940170940171
2049504,2,B0001ZWLVA,"As an American Revolutionary War enthusiast and a historical re-enactor, I have to say that this film was disappointing. I do like the theme- A British Perspective, but I excpected better from a respected historian. Although the host of the show does make some good points such as how propaganda was used to start the rebellion and how the whole idea of ""Liberty"" applied to only a select group of people, he gets some key things wrong. For example, he says that when Lord Cornwallis surrendered he had his second in command do it because he was sick. That's not true. He was in fact too humiliated. I also didn't like the re-enactments at all. For one, some of the re-enactors had beards which you would never have seen in the 18th century. Also, I saw very clearly during the battle of camden scene a continental soldier firing at the redcoats with a percussion rifle. These guns were not invented until the 18oo's, well after the revolution. Also, in the battle of king's mountain scene, when the charachter of Patrick Fergisun is riding on his horse you can see in the background parked cars. The battles in general are also dissapointing. The clothes just look too neat. It looks like the soldiers had just been dressed from a theatre's prop room. The battles were small and unconvincing. The host also fails to highlight any of the major idealistic success of the revolutionaries. So, in conclusion I do like the theme of the movie and I am always happy to see a show about the revolution, but it's not well researched and its just a second class documentary.",1150848000,5,1565,4.653429602888087
2049505,3,B0001ZWLVA,"I am a college composition and literature teacher who has found Redcoats and Rebels to be a superb teaching tool for my critical thinking class. I use it the day after they have read the chapter on various kinds of slanted language.

 In the opening sequences and in most of the presentation, the use of slanted language (such as ""agitator"" for Paul Revere and Sam Adams, association with communist theorists, calling our version of the Revolution a ""myth"") to demean Americans and make Britain seem to be the upholders of morality in the American Revolution is just fantastic.  If students have studied American history at all, they can pick up on the 97% British point of view.

I think it is a terrific teaching tool to show that two sides can be made quite persuasively as long as the truth can be skewed by language.",1124323200,6,821,4.641379310344828
2049506,5,B0001ZWLVA,"Though not perfect by any strech of the imagination, Rebels and Red Coats cuts through much of the mythological marlaky about the American rebellion that has been concocted by our self-serving, narcisistic culture.  And it does it in an entertaining and non-preachy sort of way.  It just tells the story in a more objective way -- even if Brits do the telling (they have gotten over the loss!)

A few points R & R gets dead right:  1) English rule of its American colonies was NOT oppressive, 2) the improbable American military victory depended on French interference and English ineptitude more so than upon General Washington's admittedly resolute, resourceful, tenacious, daring, and at times ingenious conduct of the war, and 3) the long-term value of the rebellion for Americans is quite debatable to say the least -- indeed, have we not evolved into the proud, parochial, pseudo-imperialistic nation of ""Blue-Eyed Tartars"" that Edmund Burke predicted?  Have we gained, in the bargain, any material rights, privileges, or immunities not enjoyed by Brits, Canadians, Australians, etc, which we would presumably now enjoy had we not rebelled? (R & R does not dwell on this point, it just subtly implies it at the end for the consideration of open minded viewers).

In any event, R & R and enjoyable and accurate, proportional account of the American Revolution without a bunch of jingoistic nonsense.",1121904000,12,1404,5.082608695652174
2049507,3,B0001ZWLVA,"When I first watched this I thought it was one of those amazingly subtle satires the Brits are so good at.  After futher viewing it appears that the narrator actually believes his own pablum.  This film 'dispelled' many myths IE - America actually didn't win the revolution (because Britain left before it was over and we ended up  with an oligarchy instead of an instant, perfectly formed democracy).  Another example - it was apparently a myth that the Brits had any intention whatsoever of ever taxing anything except tea; that's why they sent a ship with their best tea at below-cost prices.  So, I guess we didn't have any real complaints about King George after all; that was all propaganda.

I especially liked the interviews on the public bus.  How did the narrator manage to keep a straight face?  I certainly didn't.

I'm giving this 3 stars basically because I like the format, even though the presentation of 'truth' was rediculous.  They visited many battlegrounds and showed what they look like today, and I thought that was a nice touch.  It was also a large amount of content for only 1 disc.",1121212800,7,1108,4.71875
2049508,3,B0001ZWLVA,"Despite the previous reviewer's statement, the British attempted to surrender to the French at Yorktown for two good reasons - 1.) the battle was largely won by the French (French naval blockade and Rochambeau's sizable troop and seige material contribution) and 2.) it was part of the larger war between the French and British at the time.

Since the French suffered twice the deaths and provided the major effort for the siege, it would only be natural to call this a French victory - or at least a joint Franco-American victory. But in the revisionist view of American history, this French contribution must be downplayed.

""Freedom Fries"" anyone?",1098316800,15,650,5.0092592592592595
2049509,1,B0001ZWLVA,"This can be an interesting show to watch for the re-enactors and views of the various revolutionary battlefields, as well as many unique comments from Washington's (and other prominent characters) diaries. However Richard Holmes can be hard to listen to when used as a cameo in other historical documentaries, seeing him give his usual Pythonesk monotone for over half of the documentary's runtime got to be seriously annoying. Then for him to be constantly buzzing around in his mustang gives you the feeling he was on holiday and the film was just a tax write-off. Supposedly this was going to show the American Revolution from the British perspective, but as another reviewer already noted, he gave almost nothing to explain what was going on in Britain. Calling this a ""civil war"" ignores the fact that the Americas were colonies, that was one of the primary reasons for unrest, the colonists had all the responsibilities of being British with none of the advantages in rights such as tax representation.

Its easy to see how so much of ""real"" English history disappeared, if this really is the British view (and I don't believe it is) since Holmes leaves out so many pertinent facts. He explains how Washington ""brilliantly"" fakes the British into thinking they will invade New York, Then marches on Yorktown and, with vital French help, defeats the British. Then goes on to describe the French commander's ""embarrassing"" refusal of Cornwallis' sword, since after all, it WAS a French victory. How could anyone think it was a french victory? If Cornwallis had won, do you think he would want the French sword? Cornwallis sent his second in command to give his sword to the French as an insult to Washington, whom he hated. The French commander knew this and deferred the sword to Washington, who then directed the British officer to HIS second in command. Holmes describes none of this and ignores many other vital facts, which perhaps may give the viewer a good idea of what the ""official"" history would look like if the colonists had lost their revolution.

I still like to watch it when PBS shows it from time to time. A musician enjoys all types of music, but will appreciate some types more than others. As an historian, I enjoy everything relating to history, I just appreciate some things more than others, and unfortunately this rates somewhere near the bottom.",1093824000,26,2374,4.88833746898263
2049510,3,B0001ZWLVA,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD on the American Revolution.  On the positive side, the use of reenactors was good. Generally, PBS does uses reenactors much less than A&E (and its sister companies)and Discovery.  This DVD was quite refreshing in that respect. I also very much enjoyed certain characters talking to the audience.  I like this technique in historical documentaries.  It cuts up the monotony of listening to a narrator and makes history come alive.  Great job here.  However, the battle scenes were small--only a handful of reenactors showed up on filming day, so we see the same few guys again and again. Also, the use of guys with beards seemed odd. Nevertheless, you work with what you have.

As far as the presentation goes, the narrator is the star of the show.  He is on screen way too much.  It's 'interesting and valuable to see how some of the old sites, e.g. Breed's/Bunker Hills, Old North Church, etc. look today, but I really don't care to see the narrator traveling around in his car, playing with his radio.  I felt that the film crew just followed this guy around on his vacation with a camera.  And I cared even less to see MODERN New Yorkers (I think they were) going about their business.  At least show me some painting from the 18th century.

On to the content.  This DVD is supposed to be from the British perspective.  This is a welcome idea.  I felt that it was very balanced, but too much so!  I didn't get any sense of what the British, in 1776 or now, thought/think about the American Revolution (of course, there is the usual ""loudest yelps of freedom from slavedrivers"" quote, but so what?  That really doesn't tell us much).  I also didn't care for the narrator interviewing random people on a bus.  That looked more like something from Leno's ""Jaywalking"" segment.

Well, why did the British lose the war?  The only thing that came through was that they ""didn't win the hearts and minds of the people.""  Well blow me over with a feather!! I want to know what policies and practices, both from the generals and in London, led the British to defeat.  What could they have done differently?  Who was making the policy in London? What forces influenced his decisions? Could we have spent a few minutes watching a reenactment of a debate or council or the Prime Minister even working out things in his own mind?  That would have been made this a great presentation.

Quite honestly, there's not much new here.  I would recommend A&E's or Discovery's Revolution sets (not PBS's Liberty, though).  They go into much more detail. This set could be cut by half and we wouldn't miss anything.  I've criticized a lot, and my criticisms are valid. However, the show gives good information, but it could have been a whole lot better.

2049511,5,B0001ZWLVA,"I am a Revolutionary Reenactor.  This film is a ""British perspective"" on why they lost.  As such it often refers to the ""American patriots"" as ""rebels.""  It brings forth a number of ironies regarding the Revolution such as the proslavery attitude of Southern patriots. It equally notes atrocities committed by both sides.  But despite the fact this movie is focused on the mistakes of the British, it also offers praise to the ingenuity, perseverance, and motivation of the patriots.
Judging from some of the comments in the review section, there are a number of people who do not like the fact that this film is pretty balanced for a movie presenting the British perspective.  The assertions that this film highlights American atrocities and ignores British atrocities is simply inaccurate.  It portrays British brutality and American brutality on an equal basis.  It shows not only how blacks fled to the British in large numbers, but also how many of them were betrayed by Cornwaillis in the end.  This film is the perfect complement to most of the American documentaries filmed so far.  If you want a fantasy film where the patriots are always the good guys,  go watch ""the Patriot.""  If you want to learn the good, the bad and the ugly about the American Revolution and have an expanded knowledge about it, see this film.
On the down side, the uniforms and equipment were a mixed bag.  A crisp line of redcoats is sort of ruined when there is a guy with a goofy bicorn hat and long sideburns in the middle.  There is a lot for reenactors to criticize in the recreated scenes.  My advice is simple, resist criticizing the trees and enjoy the woods.  This film does an incredible job at reproducing the flavor of the battles and experiences of the troops from the brutal storming of Breeds Hill to redcoats slogging through southern swamps in waist deep waters.  This documentary shows British troops with uniforms adapted for regional campaigns and does an excellent job of recreating battles on what appears to be (through what I suspect are computer effects and clever editing) the actual battle sites.  It's just too bad, they didn't go a little further on keeping the uniforms and gear accurate.
A final criticism is that the narrator makes some bizarre political comments at the very end of the program which I am sure will inflame some.  Also inflaming are some comments by a goofy American who claims America would have been better off in the long run under British rule.  But these comments are offset by others, especially George Neuman talking about the American spirit.  I think Americans can judge for themselves how successful or unsuccessful the Revolution was in obtaining its goal of liberty.  I think we did pretty good considering the imperfect world we live in.",1089244800,47,2784,4.831223628691983
2049512,2,B0001ZWLVA,"I have really enjoyed Professor Holmes work on the History Channel, so I was looking forward to this series. It turned out to be a mixed bag. Professor Holmes style is always entertaining, and I like the way he tours the modern ground while explaining the action. However, he is VERY biased in his viewpoint. I wouldn't mind this so much if it were a BBC production, but as it was produced by an American company that receives US public funds, I would have hoped for a more balanced picture.

The bias is less pronounced in the first two installments (out of four), but it is there. Holmes understates the American reasons for going to war and instead plays up the provocative actions of Sam Adams and the Sons of Liberty. He does not, however, mention how the Coercive or ""Intolerable"" Acts passed by Parliament in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party illegally revoked the Massachusetts charter, placed the colony under martial law, and closed the port of Boston for a relatively minor offense. This united the colonies against Britain NOT because, as Holmes implies, there were a lot of young Americans who wanted to expand their trade, but because of the fear and outrage the remaining colonies had of the now completely arbitrary rule being exercised by England over the colonies.

Holmes also characterized the battles of Lexington/Concord/Battle Road that began the Revolutionary War as an ""aggressive"" American action. He paints a picture of British generals who hoped to ""avoid war"" by taking the colonists' gunpowder away. He again does not mention that the colonists had every right at that time to stockpile weapons and ammunition under the colony's militia laws, and that once again the British were exercising arbitrary rule by attempting to take the arms away. Indeed, it is should be self evident that the British troops marching into the countryside burning towns were the aggressors who provoked the confrontation.

Holmes says the battle of Bunker Hill ""is often characterized as an American moral victory"" but it was really ""a British tactical victory won at great cost."" While he is correct that the battle was a British tactical victory, it was also UNQUESTIONABLY an American moral victory. The Americans lost the field, but only barely, and they inflicted far more casualties on the British than they received. Even a cursory reading of literature of the era quickly reveals how the battle inflated American morale and correspondingly depressed British spirits.

Holmes made several outright factual errors when discussing the role of the British and the cruel and inhuman institution of southern slavery. Holmes made it sound as if slavery was purely an American institution and that the British were going to liberate the slaves if they won. This was not true. I don't have the space to go into rebut all of Holmes statements in detail, but it needs to be noted that American slavery existed because of British laws that permitted and encouraged it. Of course slavery was exercised in other British colonies like Jamaica, but the British did nothing to end the practice where they had power to do so. In fact, southern Loyalists and some British officers sold many of the slaves ""liberated"" from southern Patriots to other British colonies in the Caribbean.

Holmes also makes it sound as if the Americans were completely incapable of battling the British with regular troops on open fields of battle. He instead mischaracterizes Americans conflict as guerrilla war comparable to Vietnam. While this view is not completely without validity, it is a vast oversimplification that completely ignores the fact that Washington and the leadership of the American cause fought hard to create a regular army that could face the British on equal terms. It was not a guerrilla army that fought the British to a draw at Monmouth Court House, a battle that was a strategic victory for the Americans that essentially ended the war in the North. Partisan actions had their place and were important to winning the war, but partisan actions by themselves would and could not have won the war had there not been a regular army that was able to take on the British on equal terms on the field of battle. The Americans won two huge victories at Saratoga and Yorktown, where they captured large British armies; and the Americans managed to chase the British from Boston and essentially bottle the British up in New York for most of the war. The North Vietnamese never won comparable victories to these against the Americans.

So, to sum up, the series is entertaining, but biased. Those who are not very familiar with the war would not be served well by viewing this because of the lack of balance and some of the factual errors. For those who are familiar with the war, Holmes provides a interesting, if sometimes flawed, perspective.",1088726400,10,4841,4.933742331288344

8019194,2,B0001ZWLVA,"Though overall a valuable indicator of modern British perspectives on the American Revolution, it fails in key aspects.

In the first, the historian Richard Holmes (though widely respected in academic circles and undoubtedly a professional military historian) misleads in such shockingly bold ways as to border on lying. In one episode, he claims that an American minuteman plucked out the eyes of a British regular, cut off his ears, and pulled out his brains. The historical truth is that these were propagandist exaggerations of an actual atrocity: a scalping. Notably, the soldier survived his scalping.
Re-watching the scene, Holmes never says that this event actually happened, but phrases it in such a way as to make it sound like it did. He's repeating the propaganda in a tone that suggests it was real. This is especially hard to swallow after his lambasting Samuel Adams of his propagandist approach to the Boston Massacre. Glass houses and all that.

There are a few uncomfortable scenes in which he corners experts with loaded questions (he even says ""An unfair question, I know..."" to preface one of them), and an oddly out of place sequence in which he interviews random people on a bus about their thoughts on the Revolution.

Again, a good gauge for the modern British perspective on the war, but historically flawed and unreliable.",1422057600,,1349,5.040358744394619
