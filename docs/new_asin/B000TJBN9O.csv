8209891,3,B000TJBN9O,"2 of the 3 DVD's were not so good for younger viewers.  Concepts and format were more for 2 - 4 year's.  For littlies, stick with Barney's House (the Best), Lets go to the Zoo, Barney's Beach Party and Barney Fun and Games etc.

The jungle adventure part of the Land of Make Believe is very good, linking animals to parts of the song.  Weseem to enjoy that particularly.",1198540800,4,370,4.318840579710145
