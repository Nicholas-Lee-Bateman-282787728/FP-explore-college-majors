3953245,5,B002N1AEWS,This is really funny and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I would recommend this DVD to any fan of Robot Chicken.,1265760000,,115,4.043478260869565
3953246,5,B002N1AEWS,"Yet another edition of Robot Chicken, if you've enjoyed the other releases, you'll love this. I even saw a few I had missed. Also has nice extra features.",1263859200,,154,4.535714285714286
3953247,4,B002N1AEWS,"This season was much better than season 3 which I thought sucked. One problem I see is the increasing similarities of spoofs between RC and Family Guy. If you do not watch Family Guy then the jokes are original but if you do I can't get over how Seth green, McFarlane copy each other's jokes, it's to the point of plagiarism. There is a spoof about McFarlane in this season so I'm sure they share material. Other than that the lohan and the hills jokes were the funniest IMO.",1263772800,2,475,4.348314606741573
3953248,5,B002N1AEWS,"Beginning where it left off, Robot Chicken continues to amuse. I watched the whole season in one day and my only complaint is that it ended all too soon.",1261958400,,153,4.310344827586207
3953249,5,B002N1AEWS,"The fourth season of Robot Chicken finds Seth Green and co. changing things up a bit...okay, that's a flat-out lie, but be glad that it is because Robot Chicken is still as demented and hilarious as it always has been in its fourth season.  Included in the chaos to be found here for this season are the revelation that Tila Tequila is really a cyborg, PaRappa the Rapper (anyone else remember him?) finds himself in court, a woman wanting her husband to role play being Jack Sparrow gets more than she bargained for, another Terminator comes back in time in a very different form, the spirits from Raiders of the Lost Ark try to get Indy to open his eyes, Jazz is still alive at the end of Transformers, Stephen King and Dean Koontz have a face off, and there's a fantastic Yellow Submarine spoof as well.  There's also the usual skits involving G.I. Joe, Batman, Iron Man, and more besides; and there's so much perverse comedy to be found that it's just hard not to love Robot Chicken for all that it is.  There's another slew of voice talent to be found in the fourth season as well, including Seth MacFarlane, Battlestar Galactica head honcho Ronald D. Moore, Joss Whedon, Katee Sackhoff, Breckin Meyer, Milo Ventimiglia, Tila Tequila, Sebastian Bach, Alex Borstein, Mila Kunis, Zac Efron, Ron Perlman, Donald Faison, Joey Fatone, Amy Smart, Billy Dee Williams, Christian Slater, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lee Majors, Jon Favreau, Hulk Hogan, Mark Hamil, Stuart Townsend, Nathan Fillion, Triple H, Jean-Claude Van Damme, David Hasselhoff, Neil Patrick Harris, Simon Pegg, Rachel Leigh Cook, Sandra Oh, and James Marsden among others.  All in all, four seasons in and Robot Chicken is still one of the best things to ever grace Adult Swim's lineup, and here's hoping that Seth Green's brainchild never, ever goes off into the sunset.",1261094400,13,1833,4.84664536741214
3953250,5,B002N1AEWS,I have already reviewed the past 3 seasons of this incredible show. There really isn't more to say. Robot Chicken is one of the most origonal shows in the history of television. It's so funny and there is never a dull moment. This volume is just more of the madness that has been given to us for the past 5 years! The best thing to say is because of this shows success Seth Green has created another marvel. So buy this dvd and enjoy and let's home Titan Maximum season 1 hits shevles soon!,1260921600,3,490,4.223404255319149

3953259,4,B002N1AEWS,the show is awesome for all of us that grew up starting in the late 70's through the 80's 90's and today. the writers keep creative with a lot of classic characters,1353542400,,164,4.15625
3953260,5,B002N1AEWS,"Robot Chicken remains one of my favorite Cartoon Network shows of all time. It's smart, funny and constantly pushes the boundaries of your knowledge of pop culture. The DVD is a must have for any fan of the series. Season Four was great!",1347494400,,237,4.534883720930233

3953264,5,B002N1AEWS,Damn funny sketches and special features. Only problem for me is that you have to play the episode commentary tracks one at a time.,1293494400,,131,4.5
3953265,3,B002N1AEWS,"the show still has it's funny moments, but as with most shows of it's kind, it has certainly lost is cometic edge, and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, fan or not, unless they truly lost puppet/clamation involved adult humour.",1284336000,4,228,4.725
3953266,5,B002N1AEWS,"As always, sellers associated with Amazon.com are exceptional in delivery time and products being exactly as advertised.",1281225600,,120,6.117647058823529
3953267,5,B002N1AEWS,"If you've enjoyed any of the previous Seasons of ROBOT CHICKEN, this purchase would just be another spot in your DVD/Blu-Ray cabinet.  I own the previous seasons, so it was a bit of a no brainer for me.

Just as funny and SO many extras.  The extras are well worth your time and money.  From the guests dropping by to offer voices to Nathan Fillion going all Commando on Seth Green with a Nurf Machine Gun.
No big surprise here... order it if you enjoy others.",1278374400,,460,4.313953488372093
3953268,1,B002N1AEWS,"even in the comedy graveyard that is adult swim, i don't think there's a less funny show than robot chicken. it's like one of the writers is just screwin' with us by intentionally making the comedic timing as stilted and/or nonexistent as possible, and letting the worst sketches drag on for minutes at a time. the accuracy of impressions and iconic music renditions that are just off-key enough to avoid legal troubles seem to be higher priority than comedy.",1268697600,7,459,4.822784810126582
3953269,5,B002N1AEWS,"Amazing show, I can't wait till season 20 comes out cause it only seems to get better.

My only problem with it is the fact that it is....or at least it seems, to be short.  It took me roughly 2-3 hours to get through it.  Worth it, but I always want more.",1268352000,,256,3.8846153846153846
3953270,4,B002N1AEWS,very funny...if your a fan of this show then you will love this...the extra features are fun also,1267660800,,97,4.444444444444445
