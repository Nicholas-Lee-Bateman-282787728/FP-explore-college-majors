8483084,2,B005QBN03M,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn a lot more about Audie Murphy.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  Only at the very end is there a short PSA featuring Audie selling War Bonds.  Save your money if you're wanting a healthy dose of Audie.  It's a Newsreel of WWII, which you can probably watch on YouTube.",1376352000,2,290,4.415094339622642
