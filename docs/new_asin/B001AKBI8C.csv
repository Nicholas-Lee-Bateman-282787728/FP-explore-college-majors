8277847,4,B001AKBI8C,Nicely put together...Gives the viewer an opportunity to explore an open mind,1449878400,,77,5.5
8277848,5,B001AKBI8C,"Many in the AA program have a stumbling block when it comes to understanding God.  Many have resentments towards God or think God has not been working in their lives.  Through Step One the newcomer admits they are powerless over alcohol, and in the Big Book of Alcoholic Anonymous hopefully they find a POWER that will keep them sober.  That POWER we call God, regardless of the description of that God power.  This DVD gave many descriptions of the God issue through interviews with recovering alcoholics.  Very well done DVD.",1363219200,2,527,4.811111111111111
8277849,4,B001AKBI8C,I use this for inpatient treatment groups. Very helpful for clients. Very informative in explaining things in an understandable way.,1361836800,,132,5.65
8277850,1,B001AKBI8C,"How disappointing. Don't waste your money.  This is not worth the time it took to watch it. Awful. A long time member of Recovery groups, I would keep this away from them... I'm guessing it's self published.",1356134400,,207,4.594594594594595
8277851,5,B001AKBI8C,"Really enjoyed the documentary. Gives a very open-minded look of Alcoholics Anonymous. Great tool to have in the ""tool bag"" for Recovery work. If you are BIG into recovery or Spirituality, this a definite MUST-SEE!",1295913600,3,214,5.142857142857143
8277852,5,B001AKBI8C,"This DVD is simply fantastic. It costs next to nothing, answers every question we get about AA and spirituality, honors all the 12-Step programs, and includes every perspective imaginable, all in a fascinating and compelling format. I have watched rooms full of clients of all shapes and sizes(and levels of motivation AND amotivation) sit in front of it, spellbound. I couldn't recommend it more.",1281398400,7,397,5.21875
8277853,1,B001AKBI8C,"Ordered, received damaged, returned, and received the wrong one back, returned, never got the right DVD back, so I can't review.",1254096000,,128,5.142857142857143
8277854,3,B001AKBI8C,"I think it the video was well done and stayed true to the topic. If you are struggling with the 2nd step of Alcoholics Anonymous, this video may be worth seeing.",1231286400,3,161,4.225806451612903
8277855,5,B001AKBI8C,"After having viewed this video (God As We Understand Him), with participants in our outpatient community recovery program, I am happy to say it is a great step in breaking the chains of prior rumor, suspicion and misinformation regarding Alcoholics Anonymous and how it works.  Thanx for giving us a wide angle lense that can ease a newbie into taking the risk of walking in the doors of a meeting or coming back for a second look after a brief but possibly negative ""look see.""  I recommend this video for drug/alcohol recovery programs, alcoholics, and their families, or anyone who might want to know more about A.A. but may be fearful of attending in person....yet.
Sincerely
Lee Gibbs, active A.A. member,
25 yrs continuous sobriety",1229040000,13,737,4.888
8277856,5,B001AKBI8C,This documentary film is a wonderful tool for those of all faiths and no faith in understanding the spiritual and religious element of alcoholics anonymous.,1214092800,11,156,5.28
