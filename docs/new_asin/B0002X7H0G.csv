2131907,5,B0002X7H0G,"Little Men is a wonderful series about family life and family values in the 19th century.  It is based upon the novel, ""Little Men"" (also titled ""Jo's Boys"") by author Louisa May Alcott and is a sequel to the highly-acclaimed ""Little Women"" by Ms. Alcott.  This television adaptation makes some changes to the story: Fritz Bhaer has passed away in the series and they added character, Nick Riley, as a love interest for Jo.  If you liked ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"", you'll love ""Little Men"".",1202860800,,492,4.764705882352941

2131909,3,B0002X7H0G,"I also received the defective version, but I don't mind. I understand what's going on anyway! The shows on this set kind of sucked I wish they would release the other episodes! Hopefully people can stop selling the defective version!",1137542400,2,233,4.85
2131910,2,B0002X7H0G,"I love this series which I would certainly recommend.  I would not recommend this dvd release however.  I just ordered 2 copies of this from amazon only to find out that I received the defective versions. These have the first 3 minute prologue, before the opening credits, cut off.  Amazon sent replacements and now I have 4 defective dvd's in my collection.  I am contacting the BFS company to see if they will replace these and I may ask amazon for a refund.  I am confused and this was a royal pain.  Apparently, the BFS has released corrected versions, but where are these?  Update:  Amazon very nicely refunded my money, but the company that made the dvd's returned my e-mails only after some time.  (...)",1117411200,15,710,4.616
2131911,5,B0002X7H0G,"The second DVD set of ""Little Men"" contains the next 4 episodes from season one, including one of fans' favourites from the series, ""Philanthropy.""  These 4 episodes deal with benevolence, gambling, troubled pasts, and racial equality, all in the signature ""Little Men"" fashion that is wholesome for the entire family.  I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone looking for quality family entertainment.",1093392000,14,403,5.380952380952381
8034026,3,B0002X7H0G,"I love this series, but I didn't realize that this set only had 4 episodes. I paid $64 for 4 episodes. I thoroughly enjoyed the 4 episodes but I was expecting the whole season. I was very disappointed when I had that revelation.",1488758400,,228,4.325581395348837

8034029,5,B0002X7H0G,"This dvd is absolutely excellent, it is only a shame there isn't more available and that when you find them they are quite expensive. There are only a handful of episodes on here, I wish there was more because it leaves you wanting more. The acting is excellent, as well as the chemistry amongst characters. It is so unfortunate they cancel great shows like this from TV and jeep all of the junk!!",1334016000,4,397,4.4520547945205475
8034030,5,B0002X7H0G,"Does anyone know when the SEASONs 1-2 are coming out? OR where i can write to someone about it?
I have been waiting a long time . This was one of the best on Tv back then. I hope someone can HELP.",1313884800,,196,3.6904761904761907
8034031,3,B0002X7H0G,"Love this show and would give it 5 stars, but this particular ""package"" only has 4 episodes (2 on each disc), so I would not recommend it for purchase at this price.  Thankfully mine is not defective as other reviewers mentioned!  It was my own fault for not paying attention to the specs that said 166 minutes I guess...I just assume that when they release a TV series on DVD that it would have at least a dozen episodes or so!",1294444800,,428,4.271604938271605
8034032,1,B0002X7H0G,"Bought this item thinking that it was season 2.  Season 2 is not available in Australia, so was happy when Aussie dollar hit parity and purchased straight away.  Seems am destined to never own seasion 2.",1289779200,,203,4.611111111111111
8034033,5,B0002X7H0G,I bought mine new from a seller and it was not defective (bought in 2010). Fantastic movie/series. I've been waiting to get this for a long time!!! Finally got it!! The stories are great!! In fact I'm watching it know as I browse the web. Pure delight!!,1282694400,,253,4.404255319148936
8034034,5,B0002X7H0G,"Was mislead about this series. It's in parts. Needs better wording for the sell, and more clearfication on what it is all about. But it's good.",1275350400,,143,4.538461538461538
8034035,5,B0002X7H0G,"Little Men was a great show, based on the novel of Louisa May Alcot--Little Men.

There have been 2 releases of Little Men--Little Men set 1 containing four episodes: Changes, Quarantine, Thanksgiving, and Tough Crimes. And Little Men set 2, also containing four episodes: Emancipation, Christmas Angle, Philanthropy, and Bluffing. The four episodes on the first set are really great as are the next four that are on this set. They encourage great life lessons for kids and are shows that the whole family will enjoy.

However, Little Men set 2 will be the last release of this great series as I have written to BFS Entertainment and Multimedia Limited requesting that they finish the release of Little Men and got this reply below:

Thanks for your input. Unfortunately we no longer have the rights to that programme and will, therefore, not be releasing further episodes.
