8167145,5,B000M8HRUQ,"The DVD version of this film is a great piece or work, well worth watching.  Mr. Howell took some great archival footage and spun it together into a very enlightening narrative.  The addition of the two complete remastered 1950s documentaries was awesome, and really took me back in time.  Just buy this one if you love the bridge and the lore of northern Michigan, you won't be disappointed.  And the ""Before the Bridge"" DVD about the straits carferries is a winner too.",1243814400,4,471,4.7073170731707314
