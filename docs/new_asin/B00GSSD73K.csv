6107821,5,B00GSSD73K,"Despite the limited number of episode this past season, Venture Bros. gets better and better. Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick have pulled out all the stops and delivered some story arcs that will make your head spin.

This is one show that I enjoy going back to the first season and watching in order. With each subsequent viewing, I'm finding something new. Now that so many peripheral characters from the prior seasons are thrust into the spotlight (St. Cloud for one), it's fun to go back and see how it all seems to fall into place.",1394409600,22,535,4.572916666666667
6107822,5,B00GSSD73K,"I am a proud owner of all available VB BluRay's.  The video & audio is fantastic.  The audio is mixed very professionally; if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 system, you hear sounds the way we expect, flying between speakers!  A+ all around.  As far as the show, well, its the Venture Bros, enuff said!",1394409600,15,292,4.254545454545455
6107823,4,B00GSSD73K,Love this season. finishing it up tonight. I like that it ties in but really lacks answers from the earlier seasons. Also there are only like 10 episodes. there were 18 or something in the last one so its kind of a bummer.,1393891200,4,222,4.186046511627907
6107824,5,B00GSSD73K,Wow just Wow. Venture Bros is a phenomenal show and this is a phenomenal season. It's only 8 episodes but hot damn if they aren't the most top quality.  If you haven't started watching Venture Bros yet you need to start rethinking your priorities. Doc Hammer and Jackson Pollock have really outdone themselves this season and I can't wait for more.,1393718400,5,348,4.704918032786885
6107825,5,B00GSSD73K,"This is one of my favorite tv shows and I waited anxiously for the 5th season, for years. When it finally did, I was worried that it wouldn't be able to live up to previous seasons - Turns out, its definitely a contender. I just hope we don't have to wait another 2 - 3 years for season 6 to come along.",1392681600,24,303,3.903225806451613
6107826,4,B00GSSD73K,"It is so exciting to finally revive the latest season of this changing and interesting world of the venture brothers in the complete 5th season here with 8 complete episodes and 2 bonus episodes with a list of special features to enjoy watching, I hope that this will be a continue trend to the venture brothers as it goes on but this is a definite buy for me.",1391990400,15,360,4.3088235294117645

6107842,5,B00GSSD73K,"The Venture-verse returns, amplified to all-new heights by continuing story arcs, as the continuity prepares for a gearshift in the next season. This is the season made for nerdy fans of the show. Throughout the season long-term character arcs payoff big-time, finally! Dean and Hank must deal with what it truly means to know you're a clone, 21 outs 24's true killers, Dr. Venture and Dermott realize the truth, Brock and Moltov come to terms, the Monarch discovers why photography from the past can change everything you once thought about. It's a pretty astonishing season for characters in this universe and fans of the show alike.

The soundtrack, acting, animation, it's all simply sublime this season. Top notch entertainment, and it's absolutely hilarious!
Additionally, there are commentary tracks for the regular episodes, deleted scenes, and ""Fax My Grandson"" feature.
The commentary tracks are worth the price alone, giving an intimate and insightful look into the minds of the creators, and occasionally.. on topic show discussion, either-or it's great to listen to them ramble and wax poetic.

Don't hesitate, buy this set today, perfect for any casual or hardcore fan! Oh, and remember to watch the ""specials"" first, it's the correct/intended episode production order.",1471824000,,1283,5.315270935960591

Season 5 is hilarious, some of the episodes are so funny I had to watch then three times since I missed so much dialogue from laughing so hard.

6107861,4,B00GSSD73K,"The Venture Brothers are back for another season.  This lets you further follow their wacky antics.  They got rid of Triana, no David Bowie, a lot of stand bys are gone here.  The jokes are a bit stale, there seems to be a bit less innovation, but that can happen as a show goes on.  Still it has its moments.  It looks like they set it up for another season.  I was a biut disappointed at how short this season was and wanted a few more episodes, but you take what you can get.  THe bottom line is if you liked previous seasons you are probably going to like this one, but it will not go down as your favorite.  If you are thinking of purchasing this and have not watched the show before go grab season one, the best introductory scene to a new show ever.",1455753600,,756,4.095238095238095

6107864,4,B00GSSD73K,"Venture Bros is a great show. I'm not sure if I like Season 5 as much as previous seasons, but I like the show enough to want this season of the series. Adult Swim shows tend to be pricier, unless you buy it used or from a discounted seller, so I try to not buy their shows brand new.",1455235200,3,284,3.830508474576271

6107870,5,B00GSSD73K,"Greatest adult comedy animation series ever. I love this show because it touches on subject matter that only the sub culture underground knows about. The writers mention of people like Stiv Bators, Jim Thirwell, David Bowie, Lydia Lunch, Danceteria and so on, is positively wonderful as well as hilarious. The story line is brilliant and the characters are nothing less than classic. The Monarch has to be one of the evilest, most pathetic, funnies villains that ever graced the idiot box. This is the best show ever, and I've watched the season DVD's a 1000 times over. Positively great show! Great DVD/",1450656000,,604,4.931372549019608

6107877,2,B00GSSD73K,"Venture Brothers is excellent, as always, but there are issues with the disk itself.  I thought it was strange that the blu-ray was cheaper than the DVD; it skips, interrupting play with black screens and a weird buzzing sound.  It's not too frequent, perhaps once to six times an episode.  Not enough for me to demand a refund but enough to irritate me into writing a two-star review.",1446508800,,385,4.632352941176471

6107895,5,B00GSSD73K,"The fifth season of the Venture Bros. continues to intelligently spoof the vast world of superheros and action cliches with hilarious, specific and often obscure parody that is only outshone by Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick's intricate, witty and emotionally earnest storytelling. The animation continues to improve as the duo have more control over additional production aspects of their program and their commentaries, although often wandering afar from the episode at hand, give loyal fans a real peek into the friendship that help makes this show the strongest offering to be aired on Adult Swim. The voice acting remains stellar, whether performed by greats such as Patrick Warburton, AS staples like Dana Snyder or even Doc Hammer and Christopher McCulloch (Publick) themselves. Funny yet cohesive, nuanced yet ridiculous, Venture Bros. continues to provide audiences with smart, animated fare that remains easily one of the best television shows produced.",1436313600,,963,5.513513513513513

6107897,5,B00GSSD73K,Love this show. I don't know if there is an episode that I don't like in five season. They all have ridiculous humor and over the top action.

6107947,5,B00GSSD73K,"Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer are comedy super-scientists. ""The Venture Bros."" remains one of the funniest, most f'ed up TV shows around, and one of the strongest offerings in [adult swim]'s history. More than just a wacky parody of old cartoons and toys, VB is rapid-fire in its comic delivery, and razor-sharp in its wit. There's certainly a great deal of fun in playing ""spot the reference""; every episode is chock-full of nods both large and small to all manner of popular culture works, and somehow they manage to keep finding new avenues to explore and fit them all into to the bizarre and wonderful world they've created. Yet ""The Venture Bros."" is so much more than that. Since the first episode of the first season, JP & DH have been crafting a vast, complex, deep, and hilariously weird mythology around the Venture Clan. Season 5 picks up on number of storylines from last season: former Venture bodyguard and super-spy Brock Sampson is back with a newly rejuvenated OSI, Number 21 is now in charge of Sphinx (with only himself as a member), Hank and Dermott are pursuing fortune and fame in Shallow Gravy, and Dean is going goth up in the attic. The only problem with S5 is that it's not long enough. There are so many great characters in this show now and there's only so much time in 8 episodes to get to them all. There's also 2 special episodes -- the rather entertaining ""A Very Venture Halloween"" and the funny, goofy ""Shallow Gravy: From the Ladle to the Grave"" VH-1 style documentary. The best thing about ""The Venture Bros"" is its re-watch-ability -- and this show pretty much demands that you watch over and over, just to get a grip on the incredibly detailed storyline and catch all the jokes. I'm waiting with baited breath for Season 6!",1415232000,5,1762,4.6506410256410255

Pay attention to catch the inside jokes and references to past events and also watch through the credits to catch the final ending of each episode.  The mockumentary of ""Shallow Gravy"" is pretty funny, it is followed by a video of their smash hit ""Jacket.""

6107949,3,B00GSSD73K,"Season 5 is much different from the other seasons. For starters there is only 8 episodes not including the Halloween episode which was not what I expected. I probably only enjoyed about 2 or 3 of the episodes provided in this season. I wish the creators would have produced more but it seems like they just smashed together a bunch of fillers. There doesn't seem to be much connection between the battle against the G.U.I.L.D as compared to the other seasons. Most of these episodes do some general flashback and some familiar faces returning but nothing that really caught my attention. Sphinx Rising was probably my favorite episode because we get a look at who Sphinx (GI JOE's Cobra) was but no past fight scenes with the Sphinx crew.

All and all I would probably not recommend this to anyone who wants to watch the entire series. Season 5 can be missed. If you are a hardcore Venture Bros. Fan then you can get this season for your collection.",1414540800,,949,4.615384615384615

6107973,4,B00GSSD73K,"I feel bad giving the Venture Brothers anything less than five stars, but there is a large flaw that should be addressed with this Blu-ray's organization. The canonically important specials (Shallow Gravy: From The Ladle to the Grave and A Very Venture Halloween) are hidden away in the special features when they really and honestly should be watched before someone watches the main season. someone coming into the season cold might not realize that which would probably minor confuse them going forward.

With that one complaint out of the way, which I get start yammering on about how great this season is. The Venture Bros has been on a mostly pretty steady upward journey since the first season, and this upward trend continues with the long awaited fifth season. I'm actually glad it took so long, I wonder if its increase of quality was because they took time to recharge their batteries so they came back fresh and hitting 1,000.

Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer seem to have finally mastered the tone. Forging a unique blend of action, comedy, and intrigue to create some honest to goodness groundbreaking television. The blend can even change from episode to episode while not feeling like a different show. The only problem, and this is not a complaint, is that the season does peak early. The second episode of the season (Venture Libre) is arguably the best Venture episode thus far so almost everything after that can seem kind of flat by comparison, but it only seems flat in comparison to that one great episode, compared to most of TV or even earlier seasons of the series it is still across the board great  television. Admittedly the funny is lost in places, but Venture Bros has always been as much about the weird as it has been the funny to me and the wherever the funny is lost the weird comes out in force.",1407801600,2,1829,4.709375

6107982,5,B00GSSD73K,"While integrating nods to pop culture has become an increasingly popular source for jokes in todays sitcom and animated series culture, few shows do it as effortlessly or completely as the sporadic tales of Adult Swims The Venture Bros. Granted, the increasingly long periods between each season means that some jokes don't always arrive as fresh as they could in relation to whats being lampooned, but for the most part the show maintains its high caliber of long-form storytelling and classic cartoon sampling by never relying on a piece of satire thats only a year or so old. Its comedic references often go a ways back in cartoon adventure history and deep into nostalgia for some really obscure but relevant source material. The fifth season was the shows shortest one yet, and while it might be more hit-or-miss than any that came before, its also the season that commits the hardest to stark new directions for many of the characters and for fans of the series that can either be refreshing or alienating.

The season kicks off with What Color is Your Cleansuit?, an episode that tackles so many Sc-Fi and mad scientist tropes that its almost impossible not to get swept back up into the ceaseless volley of pop culture references that makes Venture Bros. so endearing and back in the mindset to see what new changes have befallen the Venture compound since the last season. Once you're caught up on the new rift between Dean and Hank, Deans new rebellious state, or Hanks inability to say no to his fathers insistence that he get more involved in the family sciencin, then the seasonjumps about with some off-topic episodes and others that entirely overarching story-centric. Seriously, this fifth season is all over the place.

On one hand we get some nice throwbacks to previous episodes like the reappearance of Venturestein, and then on the other we get episodes that are essentially standalones sitting in the middle of the narrative stream fed by storylines you expected to be resolved after they were opened in the episode before and having nothing to do with them. Is Spanakopita fun? Sure, and it plays out like a basic sitcom trope subverted for the Venture Bros. grand satirical scale, but it interrupts the flow of the season. Just as were starting to get into the thick of the re-rise of the terrorist organization Sphinx (briefly headed by Henchman 21), it cuts to Spanakopita where we have no connection to that thread, and then boom, an episode later, it goes back to that larger worldwide spy organization plot in a great Rashomon-ic tale of the fate of Molotov Cocktease, while also giving us episodes that further unravel the really twisted nature of the Venture family tree that has potential implications for both Rusty and the Monarch and sets up the seasons best Dr. Venture/Monarch exchange in far too long.

Maybe the fifth season only felt so off compared to older seasons because Im a huge fan of the Monarch, who, along with Rusty Venture, epitomizes the shows on-going and deeply running theme of consistent failure. The Monarchs story is non-existent for many of these episodes and his absence is felt. The shows absurdity never runs as fast and hard as it does when the Monarchs silly evilness is front and center, or at least front and slightly off-center, but in the fifth season hes nowhere near the foreground.
The animation and voice acting remains as excellent as its ever been. No one can ever say that The Venture Bros. doesnt have a beautiful palette reminiscent of the classic Hanna Barbera or G.I.Joe era of cartoons, and its presentation on Blu-ray just makes that quality all the more recognizable. And when your cast consists of Patrick Warburton (with a bigger role, at least as a percentage of the episodes), H. Jon Benjamin (occasionally), James Urbaniak, and Christopher McCulloch, its hard not to marvel and then laugh at the way the punch lines are handled.

Though the fifth season has fewer episodes and a few bold new directions, The Venture Bros. remains a solid animated series, and we cant wait to see its sixth season.

Blu-ray Bonus Features:

The set is pretty light on extras, with only the Halloween special, an initially animated and then just still-picture representation of voice actor Larry Murphy improvising as a technologically inept Sphinx agent struggling with a fax machine, deleted scenes, and then, easily the best extra, some funny audio commentaries on all episodes.",1405987200,,4450,4.903054448871182

Doc Hammer and Jackson Public have hilarious conversations usually about anything EXCEPT what is happening on the screen.  Seasons 3-5 have commentary on every episode and it has pretty much cured my insomnia - this is NOT to say it bores me to sleep or anything like that ... it is like listening to two friends having an interesting conversation and it occupies my brain so I don't start overthinking as I am trying to go to sleep.  Prescriptions didn't work, advice like cutting caffeine and changing exercise times didn't work - NOTHING worked until the Venture Brothers.  But listen to it when you are not trying to fall asleep as well because it is hysterically funny.  Occasionally they will talk about what is happening in the show and how the show is made and their creative process ... but more often than not it's just two guys talking.  Over the past few seasons I have learned, among other things: Doc Hammer is allergic to belts and lives in a magic apartment that does not smell like cigarettes or cat box, Incognito is a great movie, you need to watch the Eiger Sanction (both to appreciate the inspiration for Dragoon's voice and to see a film filled with outrageously un-PC lines) and that Doc and Jackson grew up in the same region that I did because I remember the same summer camp commercials they do.",1402531200,,1502,4.582089552238806

Maybe not as exciting as some of the other seasons but that does not make it any less important.

Cartoon or not, the Venture Bros. is one of the best shows on television. If you have the time to actually sit down and watch from season 1 all the way through the series, I'd be surprised if you didn't get a kick out of it.

6108016,5,B00GSSD73K,"As a die-hard Venture Bros. fan, I waited patiently for 2.5 years for season 5 to air on television. I love this season, it does not disappoint. Season 5 picks up where they left off, ties up loose ends to stories, develops further plotlines and introduces new villains. We see Hank and Dean grow up and follow their own paths. Brock and Shoreleave are serving in the new O.S.I. under Col. Hunter Gathers. We are introduced to Billy Quizboy's nemesis Augustus St. Cloud. In 21/Gary's absence, The Monarch is trying to find purpose in his life and learns something shocking from his past. There are more adventures this season, much like the earlier episodes; the show has gone back to its roots. In episode 2 ""Venture Libre"" Rusty, Hatred and Hank wind up lost in the jungle and reunite with Venturestein and his militia, ""United Repressed Grotesque Humanity, U.R.G.H!"" --that episode is hilarious. Another favorite of mine is episode 4, ""Spanakopita!"" where Rusty' crew travels to Greece, with a funny little reference to Zorba the Greek. In episodes 7 & 8 there are developments in the Guild of Calamitous Intent/ Council of 13 plot thread and we learn what's secretly going on in the Monarch's headquarters. There's so much to discuss about this amazing season, I can't cover all of it here. Jackson Publick & Doc Hammer worked their butts off to bring us season 5, and it shows.

6108020,5,B00GSSD73K,"OK, let's get this out of the way right away: The Venture Bros. is the best show on TV, and has been at least since season 2.  If you are unfamiliar with the show, please do yourself a favor and start from season 1, because the backstory is so intricate that you would be totally lost starting here.  Now, as to this season: it's fantastic!  The only negative is that there are so few episodes (only 8 regular-season episodes plus two specials, of which one, the ""Shallow Gravy"" special, is fairly forgettable).  But that said, the quality of the writing is top-notch, and many of the episodes rank up there with anything Doc and Jackson have ever done.  I especially loved ""What Color is Your Cleansuit?"" (undoubtedly one of the most gloriously-whacked episodes of the entire series), ""O.S.I. Love You"" and ""The Devil's Grip"".  Dean and Hank are definitely maturing in these episodes and are starting to become important characters instead of the window-dressing they often were in past seasons.  Billy Quizboy and Pete White feature in multiple episodes, and the Blofeld-meets-Truman-Capote Augustus St. Cloud as Billy's nemesis is absolutely hilarious (he must be one of the silliest villains ever).  I really wish that there were more episodes in this season, but if it's a choice between a smaller number of great episodes and a larger number of mediocre ones, I'll gladly take the former.  We should be grateful that Doc and Jackson still care enough about this series to keep it going, and I hope they continue as long as possible.  Also, I have to give a shout-out for the wonderful Hardy Boys/Tom Swift Jr.-inspired artwork on the DVD box, which is just brilliant!",1397520000,19,1673,4.838596491228071

This is the best animated series around these days, so I hope they continue and actually do the movie they announced and 2 more seasons.

Start from the beginning with Season 1 or you'll be confused a lot. It's a real treat with lots of inside jokes relating to '80s music in particular. Guest appearances (not the actual people's voices, but their images) have included David Bowie, Klaus Nomi, and Iggy Pop as well as allusions to The Art of Noise ""Cose (to the Edit)"" video and more.

With the titular brothers finally being allowed to age a little bit, they've grown immensely as characters, and in many ways this balances some of the growth enjoyed by the previous seasons' focus on Doctor Venture, which was at the expense of his sons more often than not. If you're not a fan of the show, maybe this isn't the best season to dive into first, but the same can be said of most TV shows that last 5 seasons.

As far as the product goes--this is the DVD version I'm reviewing. It seems like they could have split the content a bit more evenly between the two discs, but that's just a personal preference of mine. The video transfer is great, the audio isn't too quiet (a problem I've seen with some TV-to-DVD transfers for some reason), the packaging is solid, and the typical Venture Brothers ""Commentary""(TM) is as wantonly horrible as ever.
