1292900,5,B00003CY5A,"There are few pairings that work quite well together, and undoubtedly in this instance, Luc Besson's usual flair for action coincides with Jet Li's martial arts skills.  Most of the ""American"" movies Jet Li had made had been lackluster at best.  They've tended to focus on his acting skills rather than his fighting skills.  Unfortunately in his movies ""Romeo must Die"" and even in ""The One"", his martial acrobatics are few and far between.  ""Kiss of the Dragon"" blends a balanced mixed of Jet Li's fighting as well as the suave yet sadistic acting by Tcheky Karyo, whose solid performance complements that of Jet Li's.  Seeing these two do battle blends into a menagerie of action sequences reminiscent of ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Professional"".  As with all great action stars, it is my hope that Jet Li continues to choose to surround himself with the best of Hollywood as he makes his foray into the American market.  ""Kiss of the Dragon"" was a great start.",1004832000,,963,4.765060240963855
1292901,5,B00003CY5A,"If it's fast furious action you're after then this is certainly the film to buy. There's not a dull moment in it, with some kind of conspiracy or plot happening every 5 minutes. Jet Li (Lethal Weapon 4) is outstanding as the main character being hunted down in this film, with Bridget Fonda (Jackie Brown) supporting.
Set in Paris, the plot is filled with suspense, visiting most areas of the city. You want a twist in the plot, well this one's pretty good and not at all predictable. Another bonus is the lack of cheesy fight scenes in this flick. I couldn't find any.
In terms of action thrillers, i thought that Nikita couln't be beaten but if this doesn't in your opinion then I don't know what will. Producer Luc Besson has hit the nail on the head with this one. As good as Leon and Nikita put together, if you buy nothing else this year make sure you don't forget to purchase this.",1003968000,3,888,4.387878787878788

So given all the things involved it's not just a movie for some stereo type knuckle head guy but for martial art enthusiasts and something you can watch with your significant other.  If you're not into action and get easily offended then I wouldn't recommend it,  like my grandmother I know wouldn't like this movie.  Again though, it does have drama and humor in it so it had the ability to appeal to wide audience, the espionage in it could use work so if you are in it for that you will be disappointed, but that aside still some amazing work from jet li in some action packed stunts he performs.",1459209600,,772,4.370629370629371

1293383,5,B00003CY5A,"- Great story.  Not the typical martial arts movie storyline about getting revenge which gets boring.  Not the typical secret agent storyline of their agency out to kill their top secret agent.  If you like James Bond movies, you'll love this.  This movie has all the elements of a great James Bond movie like girls, exotic locations, exotic flair, soundtrack.

- Oh My God. I've just looked at who the writer is and it's Luc Besson so no wonder it's sooo good. I first saw his movie ""La Femme Nikita"" in 1991 and it is so good that it was remade in the U.S. as ""The Point of No Return"" with Bridget Fonda.  Luc Besson's other great movie is ""Leon The Professional"" starring Jean Reno and where Natalie Portman got her big break.  ""22 Bullets"" by Luc Beson is also a great story.

- Great actors.  I've never seen a Bridget Fonda movie but now I see she's cute.  About the actor who plays the bad cop Richard, I've seen him in ""La Femme Nikita"" and another as a good guy so I was surprised to see him play a bad guy so well too.

- Original stunts and methods of subduing an opponent.

Other great martial arts movies are:
- Ichi
- Kiss of the Dragon
- The Man from Nowhere
- The Raid: Redemption
- The Seven Samurai became The Magnificent Seven
- Three Outlaw Samurai
- La Femme Nikita became The Point of No Return
- Leon The Professional",1423180800,,1340,4.273809523809524

1293510,5,B00003CY5A,"There are so many things about this movie that really distinguish it from your average English language, Asian superstar flick. Firstly the film was written and produced by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, The Professional, The Transporter etc) which immediately gave it a distinct quality.

Tchky Karyo plays an incredible and despicable, corrupt Parisian Police inspector and villain who you will hate the entire movie. On the other side is reasonably mild mannered ""Johnny Boy"" played by Jet Li, a highly trained and decorated Chinese officer who won't waste any time putting you down. The acupuncture needles Li uses added a very unique element to the film. Finally Bridget Fonda, who delivered a great performance, rounds out the primary cast playing a forced prostitute held in captivity by the vile inspector.

The excellent cinematography seemed to further accentuate the dark and violent quality of the movie. There are some really exciting fight scenes, particularly towards the end with the blonde twins and lastly of course, with the kiss of the dragon.
This is an action filled movie with a serious tone, a good story, strong acting and great aesthetics. If you like any of those things, I highly recommend watching Kiss of the Dragon.",1400544000,,1244,5.0931372549019605

1293645,5,B00003CY5A,"For those who are fans of action or the martial arts, ""Kiss of the Dragon"" is a must-see. There is something about the way in which it is filmed, the story is told, and the actors play their parts, which makes it all come together in tremendous fashion, which is something I would not typically expect from a Jet Li movie. Though the story is bare-bones and typical of the action/kung fu genre, it nonetheless comes across with raw, visceral emotion that has seldom been equaled.

Much of this is due to the superb acting of the movie's villain (Tcheky Karyo- just try pronouncing that correctly), who has no martial arts abilities to speak of. But his talents exist in another arena, where they count for far more- his acting, and in his ability to make the viewer despise him. He possesses an animalistic ferocity and cunning that make him a fearsome adversary.

In contrast, Li's character is soft spoken and humble, yet truly exceptional when it comes to physically persuading others to consider a change of course. He is in his absolute prime here, showing off his athleticism and dedication to the art he has spent his life studying. The choreography and inventiveness with which action scenes and stunts are filmed is excellent, carefully feathering the border between being visually appealing and still being feasible in the realm of physics.

Good acting (actually) on her part which lends a down-to-earth quality to the film.  (Unless your'e one of Jet Li's opponents snacking on his shoe sole at high velocity).

1293730,5,B00003CY5A,"What makes this film really special is its variety of people involved in the story. They're actually quite memorable: The main antagonist is the very definition of a psychopath, killing his own people probably more often than everyone else in his made-up investigation team. He doesn't take anything from anyone, whether it's children, political figures, and his own men (of which he kills many--one simply because he hesitates to do as the antagonist ringleader orders, another because they happen to be near the protagonist he's trying to gun down.).

Every one of Jet Li's martial arts sequences, which pretty much are the entirety of the film (thank God all the fights aren't saved until the end), is original in its own way. At first, he's just killing bodyguards--pretty standard stuff. But soon it escalates into much worse, and one joy of the film is the fight between him and an enormous professional fighter who effortlessly punches through pillars and walls, with a clear strength difference over Li. Then we've got the silent, gray-haired Twins (who are credited simply as the Twins, and are the main antagonist's elite fighters that defend him with a blitz-style of kicking arts). When he fights them, it's both at once, and of course both of them are coordinated. He takes a few hits, but he eventually takes down one of them, which is when the fight pauses as the other Twin goes in full berserker-rage mode, tearing through every obstacle and making a beeline for Li, and becomes a match in himself, having gained a bit of endurance after watching his apparent brother die.

Sprinkled in-between are fights against practically everybody. He takes on police officers, mob bosses, an entire dojo (literally, he just walks in on them and starts beating up every single one of them, usually several at a time) of expert martial artists, and just about everything in the location.

Also worth mentioning is the variety Li performs as his finishing moves. Let's just say he doesn't simply punch them in the face a few times and they fall down and die. No, Li pulls out full-fledged finishing moves against everyone. He has his own set of fatalities individualized for every situation, and it's a delight to watch him do every one.

Now, there is a bit of an emphasis on a side-story of him trying to take care of a prostitute who is conned by the main antagonist into becoming dependent on him--through constant injections of drugs, which always forces her to come back. Yeah, the main antagonist is even worse than most bad guys in movies. He simply does not care about anything or anyone, but that doesn't mean he can't earn their trust and then use it against them, which he does. He can be charming when he needs to be, and he gets what he wants often through words. And, if that doesn't work, he blows their head off and anyone who happens to be around, just out of frustration that things didn't go the way he wanted. He's one of the few antagonists who doesn't fall into typical traps that villains fall into, constantly lies when he can get away with it, and is clearly highly intelligent and charismatic, very secretive, and by all means a demonic wolf in sheep's clothing, always looking his best. His psychopathy is unrelenting, caring only for his own gain, completely regardless for anyone in the way. If someone's in his way, no matter who it is, he'll just flat-out kill them, or if he's in a really bad mood, torture them first, and then kill them.

The result, though, is a truly excellent martial arts film, and Jet Li doing a great job kicking a city's worth of ass. Definitely a treat for people who like this kind of stuff.",1340841600,,3654,4.712050078247262

1293815,2,B00003CY5A,"Kiss of the Dragon is a weak martial arts film despite some sweet fights. The problem is the movie makes the fatal mistake of giving other elements equal importance to the martial arts performances, as well as being afraid to sacrifice some polish in order to optimally showcase of the chops of its star (Jet Li).

I'm not saying martial arts movies can't have strong plots, sub-plots, character development, love stories, etc. Nor am I saying that they shouldn't use technically strong cinematography or art direction. However, these elements must always be made to serve - and serve-up - the fight sequences. If this approach is not used, a film will usually tear itself apart. It will not deliver enough martial arts action to please fans of the genre, nor will it have enough of anything else to please the rest of the audience.

In Kiss of the Dragon, Luc Besson (a really talented writer/director) gives way too much screen time to a subplot with Bridget Fonda playing a crack ho trying to get her daughter back. Fonda gives it her best, but she's sunk by limp dialogue and the fact no one is watching for any reason except to see Jet Li. Additionally, director Chris Nahon clearly doesn't understand the genre at all. He shoots the entire movie the way he would if this were a Rambo film: loads of cutting, objects in the foreground, flashy cinematography, etc. That's fine for standard action flicks, but a martial arts movie often has to forego some of that polish to allow the audience to get a real good look at the martial artists in action. As a result of this inappropriate direction, even the strongest fight scenes in the film - and there are some good ones - don't have the impact they should because the movie gets in the way of us watching them.

Another aspect of the movie I did not like - again arising from the fact that the people in charge of the film just don't get this genre - is that there is nothing in the screenplay that provides Li's character with any kind of motivation or back story that suggests the spirit of the martial arts. Frankly, this movie could have starred any Hollywood action actor if you replaced the martial arts with gun fights.

The best way to watch this movie would be to use the chapter menu to see Jet Li's fight scenes and then bail.",1293494400,,2291,4.539951573849879

I guess I'm not used to seeing Asian films with a lot of profanity (mainly f-words) or bloody scenes almost to the point of being gross, which one scene was in here.  Yet: don't misunderstand: I liked this movie.

The hero is likable guy played by Jet Li. Despite his martial arts penchant for violence, he has a soft, boyish look to him and doesn't seem to fit the type. He's always the gentleman in here, with no profanity either. The villains, led by Tchecky Karyo, are brutal. Bridget Fonda, playing a hooker, at least wasn't some ""Pretty Woman"" type figure.

1293821,3,B00003CY5A,"Kiss of the Dragon is not Jet Li's best by any stretch, but still a fun movie especially for fans of Jet, and perhaps more so for action fans than for hard core martial arts fan (of which I'm one).  So while this film is no Fearless or Fist of Legend, they do not lend a fair comparison as they are not the same type of movie.  Where I would consider the aforementioned as 'martial arts films,' this is more of an action film.  The difference being simply an action film relies on more than just martial arts, also gun play etc.  Still, even as an action movie, it is heavy on martial arts, so gets much more credit than the disapointing 'War' (with Jet Li and Jason Statham).

A lot of reviews trash the story, but considering the bulk of action movies out there, I'd say it is actually a pretty good story; it just wasn't flushed out as well as it could have been.

Your interest in this movie will probably be determined by the type of action you are looking for.  For the action sequences, Kiss of the Dragon is more gritty (more like Unleashed, though not as good).  And while Jet displays some impressive martial arts, quick editing takes away some of the novelty, bringing more attention to the 'action' and less focus on solid scenes of the martial arts, if that makes ANY sense at all.

While this is obviously not an Oscar winning film, it's still very enjoyable.  If you are in need of a good display of butt-kicking, this will be a good fix.

I bought this DVD, and have no regrets.  My rating of 3 stars is simply because Jet had much better films, but that doesn't mean this one is no good.

This is a very entertaining film
on many levels.
The plot is simplistic and in some
places is nonsensical,
but that is alright because the
action sequences are excellent.
Jet Li's character in this film does have
some depth, the only one that does,
and I liked it very much.
Jet Li is the best martial artist on film
at the time of this review and he is in
great form in this one.
Admit it, the primary reason to watch
a Jet Li film is to watch him air out
his fighting skills, and in this case,
his needle-placement skills.
In that regard, this an excellent film,
but...

The bad news.
The characters are extremely cliche
and the acting and over-acting,
with some exception, is not at
all good, noticeably so.
What could have been an excellent crime
drama becomes an over the top moving comic
book.
Too many ridiculous things happen,
such as policemen whipping out machine guns
on city streets, hotel rooms and lobbies,
fighting in orphanages, etc.,
at will with no apparent blow-back from anyone
but a foreigner visiting the country (France).
The soundtrack had no continuity at all.
I thought the techno music suited the film
quite well, but the rap-like music nearly ruined
the fight sequence with the nasty twins at
the police station for me, rescued only
by the last few moments when there was no music
as it should have been done.
I wanted this to be a different type of movie,
but it never was.

The ending is nicely done.

The movie is worthy of multiple viewings,
but it could have been so much better.

Jet Li should have stayed in Hong Kong.
His HK movies are far superior.

1293911,3,B00003CY5A,"The crew that has something to do with Luc Besson seem to rotate jobs as films are made.  From Besson there comes a line-up of action films created by Cory Yuen, Louis Leterrier, Pierre Morel, and more, all taking turns at direction, cinematography, or choreography.

These movies have always been fun and easy to watch, with charming moments of clever action and a smart twist on the normal plate.  ""The Transporter,"" ""Unleashed,"" ""District B13,"" ""Wasabi,"" the upcoming ""War,"" and, of course, ""Kiss of the Dragon"" are among this collection.

I give my review of ""Kiss of the Dragon"" by pointing to the contributions of Cory Yuen, the director and fight choreographer, and actors Jet Li, who co-wrote, and Cyril Raffaelli.

Of the actors, this latter one is the silent blonde martial artist Jet Li fights in the climax of the film.  Though examples of him are not prolific, he is swift become my favorite martial artist of the day, due partially to his enthusiasm for le parkour.

""Kiss of the Dragon"" features very fine action from Jet Li at the hands of Cory Yuen, highlighted with Jet Li's defeat of a room full of karate students, a brutal fight in a noodel shop with a much larger gentleman, and the seminal moment, the fight against Cyril Raffaelli.  The acrobatics and speed on display in especially this final conflict are a pleasure to watch.

Of course, it is the action which shines, more than making up for decent connections.  One staple of the films produced by this crew is an unusually intelligent script or, instead of plot, a unique and refreshing take on the action scenes themselves.  The action was great, but the plot seemed to rely too heavily on crutch of the female protagonist's status as a prostitute.  Dealing with her destructive personal life in a serious way was an admirable attempt for an action film, but not enough to justify calling the script intelligent, making this an anomaly among the collection of films I've mentioned.

It's a fun movie, especially in a nostalgic way- it's one of the earliest movies put out by this group of filmmakers, and for an early attempt it does well for itself.  They've certainly polished themselves up with time, sort of leaving ""Kiss of the Dragon"" behind.

The story follows a Chinese Agent (Jet Li) who is sent to Paris, France to help the local cops there with an ivestigation. When on the mission he finds out that he is in a web of traitors who will try to kill him at any costs. Now, with the prove of a crime on a cassettetape, he has to run for his life!

Kiss of the Draghon features 5 energetic and well choreographed action sequences that gets the adrenaline pumping. Li is absolutely fantastic and kicks and punches his way through the movie with great speed. There is one scene where Li has to fight with about 25 men, which is a may it be short but spectacular scene to see. Next to being good in the fighting, he also succeeds in giving his caracther some dramatic depth. He acts good and gives a satisfying performance.

Bridget Fonda stars next to Li as the hooker with the golden heart. She acts good as well. She manages to stay on her feet and knows how to play the dramatic scenes well.

As the bad guy there is Tchky Karyo, who plays his character with such evil and anger that you just can't wait till Li gets the chance to kick his butt good!

1293915,4,B00003CY5A,"Based on a story written by star Jet Li (Romeo Must Die, Fearless) and adapted for the silver screen by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) and Robert Mark Kamen (The Transporter), Kiss of the Dragon (2001) was directed by Chris Nahon, in his film debut.  Also appearing in the film, along with Jet Li, is Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return), Tcheky Karyo (Bad Boys, The Core), Vincent Wong (Die Another Day, Batman Begins), and Burt Kwouk, probably best known from his past, reoccurring character role as the manservant Cato Fong from the various Pink Panther features.

Jet Li plays a character named Liu Jian, a highly decorated police officer/acupuncturist from Hong Kong who has recently arrived in France to assist local officials in capturing a Chinese criminal overlord.  Upon arriving Liu hooks up with a French police official named Inspector Richard (Karyo), who's in charge of the sting operation, which is currently in surveillance mode at some swanky hotel.  Here's the thing...turns out Inspector Richard is seriously bent and has ties to the criminal he's supposedly after, so much so he arranges for things to go down badly.  Liu gets caught up in the middle of things resulting in some martial arts action as Liu battles Inspector Richard's corrupt police squad goons, but manages to escape with a key piece of evidence.  Inspector Richard, who's about as oily as they come, twists everything around to make it appear Liu was responsible for the debacle, and brands him a killer.  In an effort to clear his name, Liu finds himself saddled with a greasy, junkie prostitute named Jessica (Fonda), who's connected with Inspector Richard in that he's holding her young daughter, the intent being to maintain leverage to keep Jessica on the streets...which seemed an awful lot of trouble given she was the least productive member of the group of street tramps apparently controlled by Inspector Richard (through various intermediaries, of course)...anyway, things get progressively messy as Inspector Richard and his goons tear the city apart trying to find Liu.  Eventually things come to a head as Liu battles his way into the belly of the beast in a final confrontation between Inspector Richard and his men at the police station in an effort to rescue Jessica's daughter.

While I enjoyed the action sequences immensely, I thought the story not so hot, overall.  The main problem I had was with Bridget Fonda's character in that I thought she was unnecessary, and her only reason for being in the film was to add a female element to the story.  I found myself cringing somewhat anytime her character related various bits and pieces of her sob story as it all seems just so pathetic and manufactured.  I suppose I was supposed to feel all sympathetic to her plight but I found it hard to do since so much of it was the result of her own actions (or inactions, as the case may be).  Another thing...I've seen a number of real life, strung out street walkers and I can say not a one of them ever looked as good as Bridget Fonda (most of the time they looked like twenty miles of bad road).  Now, the filmmakers did `dirty' Fonda up a bit, making her appear all greasy and such, but still, she relatively looked attractive, which made it hard for me to believe she was one of the least producing girls (in terms of turning tricks) of her group, especially given some of the lice infested street skags she was competing against.  Another element of the story that sort of bothered me was Inspector Richard and his crew, all of whom were corrupt, and the fact they had a free hand to do just about whatever they wanted, including shooting up hotels, sightseeing buffet boats, and orphanages, regardless of the toll in terms of casualties or property damage (their motto seemed to be shoot first, shoot again, and then ask questions).  Seems to me someone, at some point, would hold him and his flunkies responsible for their grossly negligent actions, but perhaps things are different, in this respect, in France than they are in other places...oh well...so what did I like about the film?  Well, I thought the action was excellent as Jet Li displays why he's one of the best and most proficient martial artists performing in film today.  Now I haven't seen many of his foreign made features, but of the western films I've seen him in, I think I liked this one the best in terms of displaying hand to hand and weapon based combat.  The martial arts sequences are staggered throughout the film, but know the last fifteen minutes or so is all action, as this is when Li's character takes it to the Man by walking directly into the police station where Inspector Richard is located and begins meting out the punishment.  There are a lot of great sequences here, but I think my favorite was where he accidentally walked into a room containing about 25 to 30 officers training in martial arts.  The subsequent fight sequence is amazing, albeit kind of short.  The extensive effort of the choreography, orchestrated by Corey Yuen, involved in this scene boggles the brain.  As far as the performances I thought most were decent enough, although I thought Tcheky Karyo, who played the main villain Inspector Richard, was a little over the top, but memorable (seemed more often than not he kept trying to one up himself on showing us just how evil, rotten, and just generally despicable he was).  Overall the story didn't do much for me except drag things down a little, but the intense martial artistry saved the day, making this a generally entertaining feature worth checking out if you're in need of an action fix.  One last thing, I didn't necessarily appreciate the gratuitous rap music used during the fight sequences.  It's not that I don't like rap (some of it is all right), but it just felt like it was stuck in there to be trendy, and not because it was appropriate.

The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) video on this DVD comes across strong and clean, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround comes through very well. There's quite a few extras available including an audio commentary track with director Chris Nahon, and actors Jet Li and Bridget Fonda, along with four featurettes, some of which focus on Li's fighting philosophy and the martial arts sequences in the film.  Also thrown in are storyboard to film comparisons, action gallery production stills, television spots, and the original theatrical trailer, as well as ones for the features Behind Enemy Lines (2001) and Planet of the Apes (2001).

1293916,4,B00003CY5A,"One of the cool things about Kiss of The Dragon is that it is a story that Jet Li wrote, and I'd say he did a fine job.  The funny thing is its an American movie, that takes place in France, with lots of Asians.  The movie is entertaining in both terms of story and action.  This is a very believable film where all the action and fights scenes is supplied by the story.  Its not one of those films where there are fight scenes thrown together just to get an action scene in so we don't get bored.  Even without action in Kiss of The Dragon, the movie is entertaining.  The movie is paced well and never felt slow to me.  The beginning has agreat start that gets you engaged in the story immediately, and brings on some quick action right away.

In the end, even from a Jet Li movie, we want to see a good fight over story.  The big fight in this film is between 2 twins (one is twice as big as the other, amusingly) and Jet Li.  It takes place inside an office building with cubicles surrounded by glass, which gets constanly shattered during the nearly 4 minute fight scene.  Its a great great great scene that is fun to watch.

I won't get into the story of Kiss of The Dragon, but know this:  I found it to be highly engaging and high quailty work for an American Jet Li film.  The fights are great too!",1157932800,3,1307,4.1146245059288535

I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality.

The fights are absolutely awesome but if you are a little sensitive, don't watch it because they're really violent and brutal.

The movie is about a chinese cop sent to France to help the police there in catching a drug dealer. But he is set up by the police chief and is framed for murder. What comes next is awesome and nonstop action. Jet Li fights loads of enemies and kicks their buts. He kicks up a pool ball and sends it flying into a guys face, and the ending is awesome. In the end, Jet Li takes on the whole police department including a group of mean and deadly twins.

If you want to see the best Jet Li movie, this is it and you'll be in for one hell of a good time. I recommend buying it as movies like this don't come around a lot. It's absolutely jaw dropping!

And, she had absolutely no sexual chemistry with him, something i cannot understand (is she an alien? i'd be freaking out just to be next to him!). The fight scenes are stylized to the point that the viewer doesn't get a lot of satisfaction.

She isn't even a bad looking woman, but in this movie she looked gross. But anyway, lol, Jet Li is awesome, and they had to slow down his martial arts moves because the audiences couldn't stop laughing because it looked fake but it wasn't! He is just very fast moving, like Bruce Lee. I can't believe et is 42. He is so hot, and such a talented guy. He knows his kung fu!",1115683200,,707,4.205882352941177
1293982,5,B00003CY5A,"This is the movie that turned me onto Jet Li.  Still to this day, I say this is his best movie.  Jet has done around 30 films, mostly overseas, but none have displayed the perfect combination of story and action.  Jet's remake of Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" (""Fist of Legend"") has superb straightforward martial arts, but the story pales in comparison to ""Kiss.""  ""My Father Is A Hero"" had a nice story, but it could have used a few more fight scenes to spruce it up, plus the main villain was cheesy sporting a pair of sunglasses.  The recent ""Hero"" (Not the ""Father is my Hero""), well...was beautiful, but was more of an art/fantasy film.  ""Kiss"" is raw and a ""heavy-subtle"" that balances nicely.

The fight scenes are incredible and full of impact.  The story, which carries a very dark tone, never lags.  You really feel a sense of hatred towards the main villain and feel for the prostitute.  Finally, a martial arts movie where the story isn't ridiculous.  There are occasional exaggerated scenes, but in all honesty, they gel well with the flow.

When anyone asks for an action film, I always have recommended this.  I also warn them that this action film contains a plot...so don't be surprised.  There are not many films out there that pull this off...the one other one that really stands out at the moment is the ""Bourne Identity.""  Only ""Kiss"" has more martial arts.  Love it!",1107475200,12,1386,4.618852459016393
1293983,3,B00003CY5A,"Jet Li's done some truly amazing work in movies, ranging from ""Once Upon a Time in China"" to ""Hero."" Even Jet's more mediocre films, like ""Black Mask"" and ""Romeo Must Die"", are well worth a look by action fans and head-and-shoulders over most action films out there.

""Kiss of the Dragon"" has some fantastic choreographed scenes, in which Jet Li's honest cop takes on a corrupt police force. Several scenes are shocking because they start off in an almost lighthearted Jackie Chan manner, then turn deadly serious. I liked this a lot - Jet's character isn't taken very seriously by strangers in the movie due to his height and race, and these fights prove that he is a man to be respected and even feared. The plot is incredibly farfetched, which is a problem that plagues many Hong Kong stars' films (Anybody ever see any of Sammo Hung's films?). But who cares? For the most part, the silly plot doesn't interfere with the fight scenes and stunts, and that's the most important thing.

If you're new to Jet Li, I doubt this movie will convert you. If you're a seasoned Jet fan, you'll probably still prefer 'Once Upon a Time in China.' If you're just discovering Jet, you'll enjoy this film a lot.",1100908800,7,1198,4.619718309859155

1293986,1,B00003CY5A,"I will start by saying I would rate this movie a 5 star if it were just for the action and martial art scenes that you are interested in.  There are some very impressive fighting sequences for certain. I myself have been a martial artist for many, many years. Jet Li is a master for certain.  I prefer the sword myself as I have trained heavily in that skill.  I will say that very few martial artists can disarm a well trained sword fighter who is also trained in kung fu or some other form of a martial art, and most would die in seconds if they tried. I would say that in one scene if Li had a sword he could easily have taken out a large group of black belt martial artists, but not with nanchucks or billy clubs.  First off, in todays world, fighting one on one is a fantasy.  In Samurai Japan that happened quite frequently as they valued honor and duty beyond all else. Even in large battles, fighting would begin as one on one, Samurai to Samurai.  So in reality, today,  he would have been swarmed immediately and laid to waste.  A sword though, could have made a huge differnece. Just a plug to any aspiring martial artists out there. Of course, it is a stone cast shadow if your up against a gun, hehe.  I hope that never happens to you.

That being said, the plot and story line for a drama/action movie that takes place in modern Paris is completely ludicrous and in my opinion a slap in the face of all French people. Lets face it, in this movie the French police make the LA cops look like cub scounts in the way they mistreat innocent bystanders.  How can a chief inspector murder so many innocent people and create such havoc in an effort to apprehend an unarmed chinese policeman?  This includes his own men also.  To top it off he is not even held accountable by his government for the mahem that he has caused - go figure? I don't know of any police in the world that would allow that to occur.

The first scenes where the supposed air captain takes out two automatic weapons and lays waste to an emtpy(???) hotel lobby is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention earlier scenes with incindiary grenades and complete devastation and murder, please!!!!!  How can Jet Li fall eight floors onto a laundry table and get up immediatley without any effect? How stupid can you get?  Or when Jet Li takes on over 25 apparent martial art black belts and walks away unscathed.  How outrages!  Even Bruce Lee never accomplished that feat in his films.  Or how about French Ninja police (do they esixt?) who jump from the bridge onto the ferry, hahahahaha. Give me a break!  The writers of this movie had there heads up where the ""sun don't shine"" for sure.  If I were French, I would be completely insulted by this movie.  Yes it is true that in most European countries the police shoot first and ask questions after, but certainly not with total disregard for innocent life and property.  I can't believe that producers would back and fund such tripe in this day and age when there are so many magnificent books that they can base a story upon.  Watch this movie once for the action scenes.  It is worth a rental.  Don't ever buy it or you will be very unhappy when you want more than just the action and come to realize just how ridiculous and shameful this movie really is.

I am not French and I know that they as a group don't particularly like Americans, of which I am one.  Nonetheless, this movie is extremely demeaning of the French police and French people in general, in my opinion.",1092614400,3,3499,4.391304347826087

I was glad that I was wrong. Finally, an American martial arts film that finally got it right: no strings, no superficial acts or effects just to get the masses to see it... beautiful hard core fighting just like the old Chinese kick ass flicks, but with a better plot (simple yet interesting) and better acting. It was refreshing to see Jet Li (and his supporting actors) shine in his role both as an actor (very underestimated) and as a true martial artist. This film does away with the ho-hum bling-bling/hip-hop, ""gangsta"" movies that are aimed towards MTV socialites by placing the story in a classy setting (Paris) and making use of beautiful cinematography. Kiss of the Dragon has an urban European flare that, in turn, gives us a delicious and interesting combination. The special features are pretty good compared to most and Jet Li's interview is especially good because he discusses his training and achievements w/o gloating. Kiss of the Dragon is one of the best martial arts films that I've ever seen in my short life, and I hope that there are more just as fulfilling yet to come! ~Andrea",1092009600,,1327,4.627118644067797

1294066,5,B00003CY5A,"Kiss of the Dragon is a hyperactive martial arts movie with a heavy European feel. After Jet Li's fans were left disappointed with the fake, CGI-enhanced fighting in Romeo Must Die he decided to go back to practical, hand-to-hand combat with literally no strings attached. KOTD is the perfect excuse for action, with minimal plot and impossible odds.
Basically, Jet Li plays a Chinese cop Lui Jian who travels to Paris to help the police bring a crime boss to justice. But the French police just happen to be heavily, heavily corrupt and kill Mr. Big, framing Lui Jian in the process.
Keen to stay alive, Lui Jian flees the scene, but not before screaming, mad and completely hatstand police inspector Richard (Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him. Outrageously outnumbered, Lui Jian prevails and fights his way through swarms and swarms of thugs out for his blood. Using only his hands and feet (and any useful nearby tool) he manages to wipe them all out.
Far-fetched it may be, but action choreographer Cory Yuen shoots it all in the most realistic and stylish way. You really will believe Lui Jian is capable of such an impossible feat, that's how realistic the action is. And all without glamorising guns.
KOTD uses the rule of increasingly mad set-pieces. The first desperate escape through the corridors and passageways of the hotel, the death-defying escape from the Seine Barge and through the tunnels and sewers, the orphanage confrontation and (especially) the final scene in the police station where Lui Jian takes on a dojo full of martial artist police officers, evil twins and finally Inspector Richard. It's all breathtaking stuff and very, very violent. With far too many sanitised PG-13 minded 'action' movies abundant these days KOTD is a breath of hardcore fresh air.
If you like this then I suggest checking out The Transporter. It may be slightly tamer but it's made by the same people (producer Luc Besson, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Cory Yuen) and is also set in France, only with a warmer, more exotic look.
The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a great Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are some extras and a commentary if you're into that sort of thing.",1088294400,2,2251,4.879895561357702
1294067,5,B00003CY5A,"This movie is probably Li's best. The movie zips along after the scene where a Chinese drug dealer gets zapped by a whore, who gouges him with long knitting needles. Some of the movie was idiotic, especially the scene where Fonda has to urinate in Jet Li's shop, and where Li's Chinese contact gets shot. The plot basically centers around Jet Li getting framed for the murder of the Chinese drug dealer, and escaping throughout France, from the corrupt police chief and his gang of drug dealers. There is one spectacular scene where Li is in the police station, and destroys a group of 30 martial arts cadets who attack him with sticks and body moves. The ending is triumphant, Li demolishes two massive  bleach blonde twins, in the most amazing show of kung fu yet.  Tcheky Karyo as the police chief has a wonderful charm, and seethes with sinister trickery simultaneously.
Chris Mahon could have gotten a little more out of the relationship between Fonda and Li. They are more like the Honeymooners, always arguing and Fonda wise cracking. The scenes didn't connect. All in all, worth seeing for Jet Li fans.",1087862400,,1110,4.746113989637306

1294069,5,B00003CY5A,"I find myself finally indulging my long-nascent love for martial arts movies, and this road has taken me rather directly from Bruce Lee and the Bruceploitation films of the 70s and early 80s to Jet Li, whom I consider to be the most worthy successor to Bruce Lee working today.  I won't even compare him to the Dragon because he is definitely his own man, one steeply trained in both the physical and philosophical ways of the martial arts.  He has a compact yet powerful, no-nonsense approach to his fight scenes, and what you get is pretty much the real deal - no invisible cables, no stuntman, no fakery, and most importantly no cheesiness.  Kiss of the Dragon is my first Jet Li film, and I am glad to say that I was in no way disappointed.  There may not be as much fighting in this film as you might find elsewhere, but this is by no means a bad thing.  This film revolves around the story and main characters, and the forging of such a strong plot- makes the fight scenes, when they come, all the more enjoyable.  Long gone are the days when martial arts movies had weak or nonexistent plots serving no other purpose than to move the film from one fight to the next.
Kiss of the Dragon is set in France, which is not your typical setting for kung fu action.  Jet Li plays a Chinese cop named Liu Jian, one of China's best, sent to France to help the authorities there nab a Chinese drug dealer.  The expected drug bust goes as far removed from planned as can be (at least from Liu Jian's point of view).  The whole thing was a set-up by the French police chief (played to the despicable max by Tcheky Karyo), leaving Liu Juan on the run and accused of murder.  Liu Juan must evade the authorities and somehow get the proof he needs to put the real bad guy away.  Bridget Fonda, an actress I have admired for some time, is wonderful in the role of Jessica, a sort-of witness to the initial murders and reluctant cohort to Richard.  She is a reluctant prostitute whom Richard keeps under his thumb; he has her daughter, so her options in life are quite limited - until she eventually meets up with Liu Jian, that is.  It is at this point we see the moving humanity that lies beneath the bedraggled, desperately hopeless prostitute that Jessica has been forced to become.  Liu Jian vows to get her daughter back, and you can pretty much rely on the fact that he will have one more chance to tell Richard face-to-face not to call him ""Johnny.""
There are a lot of action sequences in this film, all of which are quite good, but these only complement rather than subsume the gripping movement of this story.  Jet Li takes on all comers, including a room full of police cadets, making use of his hands, feet, and mind along with any helpful props that he finds readily available.  I particularly enjoyed the scene wherein he beat up a few corrupt French authorities with the French flag - I could watch that all day.  It was also nice to see several bad guys attack him at once, rather than patiently waiting for each other to be taken out one by one.  The final confrontation may have the look of letdown at first, but the viewer is soon rewarded with a rather gruesome and certainly deserved downfall of a thoroughly disgusting fellow.  It is here that you will discover the significance of the movie's title.  I could not help but wonder at the lack of reaction to all the mayhem by innocent standers-by, however.  These guys basically shoot up half of France, turning a fancy hotel into a war zone, battling it out on tops of boats and buses, blowing up buildings, etc., yet there was no observable sense of panic or sound of mind-shattering screams coming from the significant population slated to become collateral damage statistics.
The DVD comes absolutely loaded with extras.  You get a commentary by Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, and director Chris Nahon, a featurette on the making of the movie, a fascinating exploration by Jet Li of his martial arts style, background, and philosophy, a look at the choreography (including a few preparatory demos) of the action sequences with Jet Li and fight choreographer Cory Yuen, a theatrical trailer and half dozen TV spots for the film, and a couple of storyboard to film comparisons.  Jet Li is the best martial arts actor working today, and Kiss of the Dragon has everything a good film of this type needs: a great story, characters you really come to care about, terrific action sequences, and a quite satisfying ending.",1065830400,20,4470,4.525465838509317
1294070,5,B00003CY5A,"Well ladies and gentlemen, here it is at last. Jet Li's first starring role in a descent american film. I was a major NON-fan after the kung fu collapse that was ROMEO MUST DIE, but then I had to swallow my pride when he proved himslef to me in THE ONE. I instantly became a fan, so I rented this straight away after THE ONE, and let me tell you, Jet Li appears to be hell bent on erasing any memory I have of ROMEO. Li plays Chinese inspector Liu Jian, whose brought to France to aid the arrest of a Chinese drug lord and his French partner. But it turns out htat Richard (Tcheky Karyo),the Parisian police commissioner, is the partner, under orders to kill the drug lord if he nears capture. Not only does Richard do just that, but he also kills a hooker, and pins both murders on Liu. Liu now must use his martial arts skills to fight his way out and clear his name. This movie has everything I expected out of a Jet Li movie once I became a fan, and I think his english gets better with every American film he does.

I have long been a fan of Jet Li, and have always regarded his ""Fist of Legend"" as his best film, but I can't help that this film seemed to be made specifically to satisfy every desire I have ever had for a Jet Li film.
Well, it was just one simple desire really. I just badly wanted to see him extremely angry and go through an entire building of people, so given the climax of this movie, I was quite satisfied. The plot is generic, and Fonda in perticular has weak moments. I won't say she was competely terrible, because she does have her good moments as well, but I never really got the impression she could play off Jet Li that well throughout the whole movie. The fight scenes in this film are absolutely spectacular, and up to quality with the best Jet Li films. If I were to demonstrate how incredibly gifted and amazing Jet Li's abilities are, I would use this film. Tcheky Karyo, already an actor that I enjoyed, shines very bright as the villan in this film.
The DVD is more loaded than you would probably think, and has various featurettes, trailers and a commentary track that Fonda absolutely dominates. You will be yearning throughout the entire thing for her to stop talking and Jet Li to perk up. However, there are behind the scenes fight-choreography footage feeaturettes that are an awesome added bonus. The DVD transfer and audio were excellent.

It's unreal how Jet Li can take any thing from a rabbit to a small stick and kick the heck out of any body he finds.  Some of the scenes stick out more then others i.e.; the fight scene between Jet and the two big blonde twins fighters, another is the scenes were he takes on the fifty+ karate students.

The story is about some chinese agent who goes to france to find these gang of bad people, but at first he ends up being on their side but then figures they are a bad influence so he ends being chased as the french gang find out his an undercover agent. Once he is no longer chased he goes and works at his masters(trainers) asian food place. After he works a prostitute comes up to him and tries to get him laid, but he pushes her a way and has a little talk to her about why she is a prostitute. She tells him that the leader of the french gang makes her work as a prostitute like that she can bring money to him and if she makes him alot of money she gets to see her daughter once a year. Jet li than starts to feel sorry for her and then makes a deal with her that if she tells him where the gang are he will get her daughter back. This si a very great movie and jet li is great in action movies and i hope he keeps this up. This was a bit of a sad movie but all i can tell you is that it has a sweet ending, though a gory ending.

""Kiss of the Dragon"" is one of hopefully a few mistakes that Li will make in his just-beginning career. The film's plot is confusing and, if understood, boring. The film makes no effort what-so-ever in making an actual good story. Instead, we jump from fight scene to fight scene dodging huge plot holes and receiving dumb dialogue. The fight scenes are mostly pretty good, especially a random scene where Li fights off a troupe of ninjas.

True enough, Jet Li is the most amazing martial artist around today.  When he is on the screen, he is surely something.  He has power and a ton of graceful energy.  But the other characters (including Bridget Fonda) left me cold.  I just never cared about any of them.
The movie  is less than awesome, though when Li is not on the screen (fortunately, not too often).  Some think it is not worth a damn until the last reel, when Li whups the whole Paris police force (not really, but about thirty cops in a martial arts class), two blond henchmen of the head guy, and finally brutally, the head guy himself (giving him the ""Kiss of the Dragon"" as the coup de grace).

I wonder which lines people are referring to when they criticize the dialogue. . .bc some I found charming and humorous (""Oh my little farmer's daughter. . .etc""). And if Bridget Fonda sounded like an airhead, well, that was her character, right? I saw this movie in Japan--subtitled in Japanese. The line where Jet says to Bridget Fonda, ""I don't have type,"" well, people actually laughed aloud bc they understood the English for a change. I hear people speaking broken English all day long, and it doesn't bother me. I prefer to hear Jet making mistakes--I don't want him to be some smooth-talking suave guy. . .do you?

Pros:
1) Innovative finishing moves by Li, not seen in other films
2) Luc Besson steals the film with great bad guy role
Cons:
1) Horrible dialogue between Li and Fonda
2) Terrible acting performance by Fonda - it's painful to watch
3) Li has too much dialogue - his English is just good enough where you don't have to dub him, but it's still terrible and his nasal voice doesn't help his tough guy persona.  His character in Lethal Weapon 4 was great because he didn't have to do any speaking.
Don't waste your time or money on this DVD.  If you want great Jet Li action, get ""Fist of Legend"" or ""Once Upon a Time in China"" which are must-haves.",1031097600,,674,4.2578125
1294288,3,B00003CY5A,"Kiss of the Dragon (KOD), is primarily a vehicle for the limber Mr. Li, to display his considerable martial arts talents. The storyline is not particularly strong, and is largely an example of style over substance. This is neither bad, nor unusual, for a film of this type. Most of the audience is looking for action, and that is what is delivered. The violence is excessive, and the plot takes unrealistic turns more than once. The color tones are subdued, shaded to dull hues, with even daytime scenes shot in shadows. Through the numerous creative fights, and action sequences, Jet Li performs with speed, and deadly seriousness. He continues to improve his acting and English communication skills.
Li plays Liu Jian, a policeman from the People's Republic of China, sent to Paris, to participate in the arrest of a Chinese drug dealer, by the French police. Inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo), the French cop in charge of the investigation, kills the dealer with Jian's gun, intending to frame him for the murder. Of course for this silly plan to work, Jian must die. Unfortunately for Richard, he just won't cooperate. Mixed into this basic conflict, is a prostitute, played by Bridget Fonda, who could also possibly help clear Liu Jian.
The commentary track consists of separate comments by Jet Li, Bridget Fonda and director Chris Nahon, edited to together. It is somewhat informative technically, but Fonda's comments, reflecting mostly her personal thoughts, dominate. Her character doesn't have a lot of depth, but judging by her comments, Fonda seems satisfied with her role. The other bonus features are rather typical fare. The DVD itself is made to look like a red, number 3 billiard ball. Such a ball is featured in one of the movie's CG stunts.
Hong Kong veteran Cory Yuen choreographed the exciting fight scenes, and Luc Besson did KOD's screenplay. Tcheky Karyo, does a pretty good job as an arrogant, and corrupt cop. His ultimate reward, is to experience the ""kiss of the dragon"". Burt Kwouk, also makes an appearance as a shopkeeper. Jet Li's fighting skills are obvious, and his acting skills are improving too. This film is not a breakthrough vehicle to a mass western audience, but it is a decent action flick worth seeing.",1029024000,,2245,4.941798941798941
1294289,3,B00003CY5A,"This is the most serious film of Jet Li's that I've seen. Jet plays a Chinese cop in Paris trying to crack a drug ring only to discover that his French counterpart, Karyo, is the ringleader. Jet is framed for murder and goes on the lam, with the assistance of drug-addict prostitute, Bridget Fonda. Fonda knows that Karyo is dirty but he is holding her little girl as hostage. Li agrees to rescue the daughter if Fonda will testify. Karyo snatches the little girl before Li can reach her. But Li follows the Karyo to his headquaters, defeats everyone in the building and kills Karyo with the Kiss of the Dragon, an acupuncture point that shuts down the body.
The action is up to Jet's usual quality but not quantity. Lots of innocent standbys gets killed by the French cops. Li seems to focus more on his acting skills and dramatic interplay with Fonda. The dialogue is predictable but delivered with intensity. Li outdoes himself in this movie, acting-wise while Fonda is underutilized. She is a much better actress. Karyo plays a bad cop well. You want him to die.
There are some funny moments like when Li escapes from pursuing cops only to find himself in a dojo full of French blackbelts!! Of course, he whips all of them in a predictable but fun to watch sequence. When Li fights the two blondes is another funny sequence.

Jet Li plays a Chinese cop who comes to France to particpate in an international investigation, but ends up being doublecrossed. He meets this hooker who hangs in front of the shop where he's staying, and the hooker is coincidentally tied up with the same guy who doublecrossed Jet Li and has also taken the hooker's daughter and killed Hoffa and won't tell anyone where Waldo is, and so forth and so forth. The plot is way overbaked, but the bottom line of the movie is no more complicated than this: Jet Li kicks serious French [rear]. And the Amazon reviewer is right on target. I don't go to a Jet Li fightfest to listen to the bad guy twirl his mustache and explain how he did away with Professor Plum in the library. I go to see Jet Li kick serious French [rear]. And he does not disappoint.
The final sequence with him storming the police station held echoes of Game of Death for me (ascending to different levels by defeating opponents). I thought the setup with the 25 French stickfighters just standing around was a little hokey, but I shrugged it off. The fight with the two blond guys exceeded my expectations, at any rate. There, you got to see Jet being just vicious.
There was only one wrinkle in this for me. The cinematographer was just too close to the action sometimes. You missed punches connecting, kicks landing, ironing boards smashing, etc. I don't think any Western cameraman has kept up with an Asian movie star yet, at least not in any movie I've seen. That is, unless the star moves at half the speed he is accustomed to. But the crew gets an A for effort. Top notch fights, Tcheky Karyo (2nd best villain player ever behind Jack Nicholson), and a cameo from Ric Young (""I want to go to heaven!""). What more do you want?

This is a martial arts/action movie.  If you expect The English Patient, of course you'll be disappointed.  Take it for what it is, and allow some suspension of disbelief, and you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie.
Personally, I love this genre, but I've been consistently disappointed by recent efforts.  Even a movie like The Matrix--the special effects were great, but the martial arts choreography was just so-so.  Too much wire-work and CG.  What happened to jaw-dropping, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences?  Sure they may have been in ""substantively subpar"" movies like Bloodsport and Best of the Best, but I certainly don't give a damn, I loved those movies because the fight scenes were so well done.
A number of things make this movie stand out in its genre.  The first is Jet Li.  No one in the industry, now or even in the last 15 years, has come close to his level.  Jackie Chan is fun to watch, but he's too nice; it's almost like he doesn't want to hurt the other guy.  Chow Yun Fat is decent as well, but he lacks fire and has little charisma.  Steven Segal had the necessary brutality, but he was too rigid.  Van Damme had some moments, but was never badass enough for many viewers.  When Jet Li walks into a room about to engage 6-7 dudes, he looks dark and impentrable, with a steely focus in his eyes.  He's simply a bad man.  He's calm until he has to explode, and he is just brutal enough, never soft but also never going over the top.  Sometimes you want the hero to break the bad guy's face with desk drawer.  He'll do that.  That's why I dig him.
I thought director Chris Nahon and producer Luc Besson did a great job; Besson of course is known for his skill in making such movies.  Even the music was great--a little hip-hop to flow with the action.  Also, as a critic of all movie genres, I found the dialogue and plot to be more than tolerable, certainly better than that of 90% of action movies.  The problem is that the director and producer are French, and perhaps overestimated the intelligence of most Americans filmgoers.  I'll admit, as a country we need so much to be spoonfed every little detail.  If people would exert some brainpower, they would find the plot easily digestible and definitely not a point of contention.
At least rent this movie.  It's quite entertaining, in my opinion, and the last 10 minutes of the movie are fantastic--absolutely furious in their pace, some of the best action and choreography ever filmed.",1020643200,3,2605,4.586580086580087

The incredibly well choreographed and original fight sequences absolve this film of practically anything!  A few memorable scenes are the fight with champion kickboxer Colin Prince to the background of Nerd's Lapdancer, and perhaps unintenionally comedic is the scene where our hero is beating up the French policemen with the Tricouleur (French flag), and his fight with the deadly twins.  I loved the choice of music during most of the fight scenes, I thought the remix and choice of mystikal and Nerd to play during the main fight sequences really helped them.

There were all of maybe 4 or 5 fight scenes in KotD, and even though the the ""La Fayette"" French Soldier from the patriot is the main villian, it doesn't do much for the movie, or the ending for that matter.

1294414,5,B00003CY5A,"I've liked Jet Li since I first saw him in Lethal Weapon 4, where he was the only good thing in a tired cliched sequel. But here in Kiss of the Dragon, Li is given the starring role as Li Jian a dedicated Chinese agent who has come to Paris to work with the French authorities. Unfortunately, he's set up by a corrupt and psychotic French chief of police. Li Jian is accused of murder and is on the run in Paris with the entire French police in hot pursuit. The fight scenes are top-notch and brutal as expected. But what makes this movie unforgettable is the acting by Bridget FOnda. Fonda costars as a junky/hooker who is caught in the middle of the set-up. She is Li's only proof that he is innocent. The chemistry between Fonda and Jet is tremendous. He is a straight-as-an-arrow cop who has never married, he has no family,  and is completely dedicated to his job. She is a single mother who is caught in a nightmarish life where she is beaten and abused by her pimps and her daughter is held hostage by the French chief. I guess what made this movie so thoroughly enjoyable for me is the perfect combination of great acting with great action. You don't see many martial arts movies where you actually care about the characters. But Kiss of the Dragon is a very special movie. Jet Li is a tremendous presence, dressed completely in black with moves quicker than his namesake. He has wonderful charisma as his character is quiet, shy with women, and soft-spoken yet he can destroy an entire army of cops!
Fonda is the talkative, friendly, yet thoroughly abused hooker who tries to humanize Li Jian. The scenes between Fonda and Jet Li are touching and magical.

Romeo Must Die was good, but lacked in longer fight scenes. The One was OK, albeit uber-Matrix-esque and replete with CGI to say the least. Kiss of the Dragon was refreshing to watch - there is very little wirework shown, just mano a mano fight scenes, and lots of them. It is actually funny to watch a little Asian dude overtake the entire corrupt French police force though, hehe. (i.e. walking through the front door of the precinct and then proceeding to clean house). Not realistic, but Corey Yuen did a good job with the action choreography in this movie.

Jet Li, somewhere, catches ""Leon/The Professioal"" by Luc Besson, and is convinced that Besson is the man for his next film.  He treats action scenes very dramatically, and can find the deeply human characteristics of the film's characters.
Then it got lost.
A new, up-and-coming director was given the project, under the guidance of Besson, and the result was a creature of a different nature than was expected.
The Martial Arts scenes were set up by people Li brought with him, so the action scenes are outstanding, without the overt matrix-style special effects which are only fitting in the un-real VR realm within ""The Matrix.""  The story is enough to keep you interested, but it is contrived, relying on too many coincedences, with a conclusion that, after an outstanding fighting sequence, leaves Jet Li seeming uncompfortable.
If you're a Jet Li fan, then this is a must have.  If you like Action flicks, then this one is for you.
If, however, you're looking for the usual Luc Besson social commentary and pulp-fiction like perceptions of shadowy sub-cultures and the struggle to survive dispite the odds (The Professional, Le Fem Nikita, etc.), this film doesn't quite make it there.",1016755200,,1215,4.975369458128079
1294510,5,B00003CY5A,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought, ""Oh well, another movie with 'wire stunds'"" Having not seen any sneak previews, early images, or even the Kiss Of The Dragon trailer, I didn't expect much.
But I was surprised big time, when I went for it at the movies. I was in a total shock; this movie was pure and true martial arts! There wasn't even the smallest hint of wire work anywhere in the movie. And Jet Li, being Jet Li, was truly sensational in his stunts. Such flexibility and skill, would probably make Jet Li one of the best martial artists/actors in Hollywood.
Jet Li plays Liu Jian, a Chinese undercover agent, sent to assist a French surveillance team headed by the movie's bad guy, Inspector Richard, played excellently by Tcheky Karyo. Their target, a mam, who isn't talked about much, is set up to be assasinated by a pair of prostitutes sent by Inspector Richard, unbeknowst to Liu Jian. Now, one of the prostitutes, played by Birdget Fonda, isn't up to the night's ""festivities"", and so, goes and buries herself in the toilet. In the room, however, the first prostitute is taking the target to ""heaven"", while everything is being watched by the surveillance team, including Liu Jian. Liu Jian soon discovers what is going on, and tries to save the man, and manages to do so. But, as he is calling for an Ambulance, Inspector Richard comes in, and finishes off the man and the prostitute, with Liu's gun! Liu escapes, nevertheless, but not without treating the viewer with some fancy ""footwork"". He then stays in hiding with the Chinese man his agency sent him to stay with. While there, he has a meeting with the second prostitute, the one who was in the bathroom during the surveillance. From there on, it's a bumpy ride, with Jet Li and Bridget Fonda becoming an unusual pair.
This movie's story lacks the power to hold on to one's interest, in the long run. But it's good, while it's there. Nevertheless, the main ""drawing"" aspect of this movie is the fight scenes, which were practically ""delicious""! The best fight scene is when Jet takes on the Twin's, who possess deadly legs. It's not to be missed!
In general, Kiss Of The Dragon is a superb movie, and deserves 5 stars. If you haven't seen it yet, get the DVD version, as I have, and enjoy the Widescreen effect, with Dolby Digital Surround; like being in the Theatre!",1016236800,,2351,4.613365155131265

For one, contrary to the junky junk action movies that most Hollywood Directors slap together, you actually care about the characters in asian films.  They're more character driven and real.
KISS OF THE DRAGON falls right into that line.  Excellent characters.  JET LI has matured as not just an action star, but an actor.  And what could possibly be said to give justice to BRIDGET FONDA!  I've always been a big fan of BRIDGET, and she does such a great job in KISS OF THE DRAGON.  She plays a woman forced to sell her body behind promises that she will have her daughter returned to her.
The scene where she plops down and helps herself to Jet's chips and rice because she's starving... talking the entire time.  Despite her appearance, you just want to give her a great big hug and take care of her woes.

1294614,3,B00003CY5A,"Movie-making is often an incestuous business; here we have Chinese martial-arts star Jet Li starring in a film written by Luc Besson (""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon""), featuring Tcheky Karyo (""La Femme Nikita"") and Brigitte Fonda (""Point of No Return"" [aka ""Remake Without a Point""], the American trivialization of ""Le Femme Nikita"".  And it looks a lot like something Sergio Leone might have made.  Except that Sergio would do it better.
Unfortunately, it's less than the best for everyone, except possibly Fonda, who seems to be improving somewhat in her art as time goes on.
The story is a classic -- one might say a cliche as easily -- the honest cop from out of town framed by the crooked cop who then spends the rest of the film trying to kill him.  Jackie Chan [or even Terence Hill] has done basically the same story several times over, though generally not with the hard-edged violence we see here.
One of my problems with action films these days is that the really hard stunts tend to contain large chunks of CGI -- the final carjump in the remake of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", which was simply impossible to do with real cars -- and, even when they don't, we assume they do.  There's none of the air of ""Oh, gosh!  How the *&*$%* did they do *that*?"" or ""Wow! That's incredible!"" that, say, the Terminator jumping the Harley off the embankment into the Flood Control channel or the car just missing both of the falling chimneys in ""Hooper"" or the final car stunt in the *original* ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" engenders, since you know that there isn't any CGI involved there, somehow real stuntmen did real stunts that look spectacularly impossible. ((Well, actually, there *is* CGI in the ""Terminator"" Harley jump; the stuntman and bike were rigged on cables and treated as a puppet on a crane and CGI was used to paint out the cables.  But that could have been accomplishce other ways.))
And there's some of that here; one reviewer says that he's glad there isn't too much wire work, and i have to agree -- but, watching the extras on this DVD, i discovered that the niftiest stunt -- the one that inspired the grasphic design of the DVD itself -- is a combination of wire work and CGI, which disappoints me.  In one of his films from the 70's, Terence Hill grabs a number of balls off a pool table, and juggles them, while flipping them one by one back-hand at various Bad Guys' heads.  The balls Hill juggled weren't CGI and he had to make them go where he wanted them to, instead of making motions that the CGI crew could later line up balls to.
Which is not to take anything away from Jet Li -- the man's speed, precision and ahtleticism are incredible.  The scene in which he simultaneously fights -- and defeats -- three black belts using batons has to be seen to be believed, and some of his other work is equally breathtaking.
Bridget Fonda as the Hooker Who Knows Something is adequate; much better than she was in ""Point of No Return"", the only other film i can recall seeing her in.  Her byplay with a piece of steampipe is a neat visual gag.
Tcheky Karyo makes sure that every piece of scenery he comes near is well-adorned with toothmarks as the evil crooked drugdealing French cop -- Sort of like the DEA agent played by Gary Oldman in ""Leon"", but not as charming.  His demise is appropriately gross by this film's standards.
Besson's script doesn't go for the same sort of issues as he did with ""Nikita"" or ""Leon"", though he does cast a brief eye on the plight of the prostitute in modern Paris (though i suspect he exaggerates at least a bit).
The direction, cinematography and editing are competent and quick-enough-moving to work, with occasional neat little grace notes -- the injured Li, having temporarily escaped his enemies, collapses against the wall of a subway car, his head falling to one side -- and we immediately cross-cut to a bust of the Virgin, head tilted at the same angle, similar expression of weariness and suffering on her features.  Later, he bursts into the apparently-abandoned Emergency Room at a small hospital, carrying the wounded Fonda; for just a moment after he kicks open the swingong doors, they stand, she lieing in his arms in almost exactly the pose of the ""Pieta"", until he screams ""Somebody help me!"" and suddenly we jump-cut to a veritable horde of doctors and nurses and attendants rushing the injured girl into surgery and working on her, in a very effective transition.
I didn't particularly like the rap/hiphop soundtrack.
All in all a decent thriller to enjoy when there's not a ""Nikita"" or a ""Leon"" or a ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" on cable this week...
(Incidentally, keep a close eye on the telephone on the wall in the hotel laundry during the end of the laundry-chute sequence)",1014249600,2,4745,4.602366863905325
1294615,1,B00003CY5A,"Jet Li's been trying to find a good American movie to star in, and sadly he hasn't done it with ""Kiss of the Dragon.""
For starters, when your star is as electrifying an action star as Jet Li, you don't bog him down with pages and pages of witless dialogue. You give him action...and maybe 7 or 8 of this film's 98 minutes are devoted to seeing our man actually get his kung fu on. It doesn't help that the director, Chris Nahon, is obviously new to the game; some of the sequences here don't make a whole lot of sense. Perhaps that's the editor's fault as well.
This film is also surprisingly mean-spirited and very degrading to women, and one really has to wonder why Bridget Fonda would agree to take such a horrible role in a film that continually treats her character like dirt. I hope they paid her a lot of money.
Another aspect that cannot be overlooked is that this American-made movie is populated almost exclusively with Chinese and French actors. There are a few scenes near the beginning where I couldn't understand one word that was said; it might make me sound like an ""ugly American"" to say such a thing, but when you're making a movie for mass American consumption, please make sure your actors are speaking something remotely close to English if you're not gonna put subtitles up there.
This film fails on so many levels, it's really disheartening; I want to like Jet Li, but I can't say I've enjoyed any of his American movies. Sure, I liked ""Lethal Weapon 4,"" but you can hardly call that a Jet Li movie. Jackie Chan has eased into the American film market, and makes films that -- while not the greatest cinema ever made -- are funny, well-directed and well-intentioned. Jet Li's nowhere near Chan.
I find it hard to swallow that this movie came from the same writers of ""The Fifth Element,"" a film overflowing with life, energy, fun and wit. Oh well.",1013558400,4,1871,4.5058823529411764
1294616,5,B00003CY5A,"""Kiss of the Dragon"" is a great movie: action-packed, and it shows off Jet Li's talents very well. People have complained about the plot not being very substantial but that is a ridiculous grievance.
  You don't go to a Jet Li movie expecting to see ""My Dinner With Andre"" and there is a decent plot in this movie anyway. Briefly, Jet stars as a Chinese special agent hunting down Chinese gangsters in Paris, unaware that the French cops assisting him are criminals themselves.
  The action sequences in this film are spectacular and the added features on this DVD are well worth watching, especially the interview with Jet Li.",1013299200,,627,4.777777777777778
1294617,4,B00003CY5A,"Let me start by saying I love JET LI, and I wish nothing but the best for him. I own probably a dozen of his movies. I DO want JET to succeed in Hollywood. At least his talent is finally being recognized, giving him more leading roles. But I feel his choice of material and Directors has not been to his benefit and fails to showcase this man's awesome talent. I have yet to see a Hollywood Director who is able to capture the Martial Arts magic of the HK Action Directors.(Except maybe Dick Donner, who I know from personal experience to be a wonderful man.) At least this one's better than Romeo Must Die.(I'd love to see Quentin Tarantino write and Direct a Movie for JET LI.)
Lacking is a Chinese sense of humor that is a trademark of the best of JET's HK Action Movies.(And I don't mean Jacky Chan humor.) KISS OF THE DRAGON has a very serious tone making it too dark for me. JET LI has a tremendous screen presence. I understand that he studies English 4 hours a day, but I prefer when he acts in his native Chinese, where his acting really comes to the fore.(Even if his acting is dubbed.) Although I don't think it was the Movie's intention, someone at the very least should have written JET some good Schwarzenegger one-liners. I hope JET's Agent reads this.
Some scenery chewing by the main villain played by Tcheky Karyo (which works for me in HK Action Movies) and a totally superfluous prostitute character played by Brigit Fonda. Who's idea was this? Oh well, I suppose, it's forgivable considering there should be a female fish-out-of-water foil in this type of Action Movie. But for goodness sake, give her something wacky to do. Or maybe give her a fight scene. I do like the idea of the Kung Fu needles. Good choice of eccentric traditional weaponry and of course who can forget the infamous Kiss of the Dragon.(See the Movie, I won't spoil it for you.)

The fight choreography by Cory Yuen is good. I didn't like the camera placement in most of the Action shots. (Though, from what I gathered from one of the Bonus Features on the DVD, Cory Yuen did some of the hand-held camera work.) Hollywood Directors need to learn to pull back the camera a bit so that we can witness the full movements of the fighters at times. Close-ups are fine but they need to be edited into better Mastershots. JET LI's leg work is cut off from most of the fight sequences. The fight scene in The Gym against the 25 cops, though brief, is incredible and reminds me of Bruce Lee's nunchuck stand in ENTER THE DRAGON. That scene gets 5 Stars.
If you're new to JET LI and want to witness THE MASTER at his finest, I would recommend: FISTS OF LEGEND, TWIN WARRIORS, THE ENFORCER(also titled MY FATHER IS A HERO), or JET's first Kung Fu masterpiece at 19 years of age, SHAOLIN TEMPLE. Trust me, these are some of JET LI's finest. You won't be disappointed, like I was with some of this movie. KISS OF THE DRAGON is not one of JET's best. But, what do I know? I even loved what some people consider one of his worst movies: MELTDOWN. (See my review on what I think is JET's funniest HK Action Movie of all time.)
Diehard fans may want to add this one to their collections because of some short DVD Extras including a Featurette on JET LI'S FIGHTING PHILOSOPHY(which is more of a dialogue on movie making.)

1294618,4,B00003CY5A,"This is Jet Li's third movie in the United States, and I must say...this is probably his best so far.  It doesn't disappoint in the action area...within the first fifteen/twenty minutes of the movie you are already off and running with Jet Li through a hotel in Paris into a web of deceit and intrigue.  The plot is actually quite easy to follow and is well conceived.  A Chinese undercover agent caught in the web of a dirty French cop (Tceky Karyo), and a down trodden American prostitute (Bridget Fonda)plays an unlikely side-kick who is Li's only salvation to clearing his name.
The martial arts action is non-stop...and yes highly plausible...no hidden wires here.  The fighting scenes in the police station are incredible; stick fighting, wu shu, tae kwon do...you name it.
Overall, there is a good balance between action and drama.  Something that isn't always easy to come by with many action flicks today.  I firmly believe that this movie solidifies Jet Li's stardom in the U.S.A.",1012953600,3,990,4.863095238095238

In a time where we are in dire need of GOOD action stars with REAL talent Jet knows how to give us what we want. Plenty of ground action with as little Wire work as possible. Be wary this movie is not for the faint of heart, its bloody and violent, with some sexual scenes. BUT NO nudity. It's story is watchable, and all the players in this game do what they are best at. KUDOS to this awesome French director who also gave us 5th Element.

1294620,1,B00003CY5A,"And Jet Li doesn't really deserve much of the blame.  Without him, in fact, this flick would be absolutely worthless.  But it says a great deal when some of the on-set video shots actually look more exciting than the actual film used onscreen.
Director Chris Nohan has no idea how to make an action movie.  Kiss of the Dragon takes four shots to say something that should take one, and the result is a complete mess of fast cuts, all poorly executed.  When you have an amazing action star like Jet Li, famous for his agility and grace, why would you want to interfere with us watching him?  Kiss of the Dragon's modus operandi is to use every shot the director grabbed on set, obsessively ""cut on action"", and to interrupt things just when Li is about to launch into a fantastic move.  Maybe some people believe fast cuts make better action sequences.  I say:  Take a look at how the masterful Richard Donner filmed Li in Lethal Weapon 4.  Oh yes, and Nohan fills almost every showdown scene with incredibly bad rap music, where the lyrics completely interfere with us actually
*hearing* the hand-to-hand combat.  Sound does half the job when you direct a fight sequence, and in Kiss of the Dragon, I counted at least a dozen body blows that were missing sound effects.  Drunken Master 2's fight sequences (probably the best ever) moved three times as quickly, but didn't miss a single beat, so this film has no excuse.
When the action in an action movie tanks, there isn't much left, is there?  So we are free to revel in the incredibly bad acting of Tcheky Karyo and Bridget Fonda.  Fonda is trying hard, but her character is a walking, talking cliche.  But Karyo has no excuse for his frothing mad-dog act.  Imagine Gary Oldman in The Professional, only 100 times more over-the-top, and you have probably the worst action-film villain since William Sadler's lacklustre turn in Die Hard 2.
And the script?  What script?  Apparently it was based on a story by Jet Li himself and the structure seems sound, but the dialogue is a joke and the ""dramatic"" scenes totally unmoving.  Moments intended to be funny aren't; moments of supposed connection fall flat (Li and Fonda have zero chemistry); supposed ""suspense"" sequences simply drag on and on.  The opening scenes, for example, exhibit the same fussiness as in the cutting, taking four scenes to say what should've taken one.  By the time something finally happens, I've had to endure so much bad dialogue (and, again, Karyo's ludicrously bad performance) that I barely care.  Actually, I don't at all.  And the ending?  A re-definition of ""bad"", looking like something that came out of a low-budget, amateur European gore flick, except it looks even more ridiculous than anything from the Nekromantik movies.
I hope The One would be better, because it's about time Jet Li got to make a good starring vehicle on these shores.  That shouldn't be difficult, since Kiss of the Dragon qualifies as filmmaking of the lowest order.",1012608000,2,2977,4.747081712062257

It also might have been the fact that there were a bunch of Chinesse in France but everyone was speaking English...

1294731,5,B00003CY5A,"When i first watched the movie I thought is was alright. Then i thought to myself,hey they are doing all these fight scenes without ropes or explosives. You know the type of things that distract your attention away from the real fighting. Jet li reminded me of the Bruce Lee movies i use to watch. The speed at witch he calculated his moves was amazing. But more than that, it was a motivational film for myself,because i practice martial arts. So this is a must see for all movie buffs that are into a good fighting scenes. Five stars.",1010966400,4,536,4.424242424242424
1294821,5,B00003CY5A,"I've never seen a movie 3 times in a theatre before. I'm not an action junky; I do enjoy intellectual pieces as well. However, to see Jet Li in all his splendor without wires and cgi fx was a real treat.
Don't judge this movie for what it isn't. This movie is basically a clothesline for the action sequences so in all fairness one should judge it on the quality of its action.",1010880000,,377,4.178082191780822
1294822,4,B00003CY5A,"What's worse than having movies I watched in its original form, in Chinese, dubbed with English that doesn't make sense all the time (ie. Jackie Chan's ""scum of the Earth"" speech in Rumble in the Bronx)?  It's watching Hollywood kill the talents of people like Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat (Replacement Killers was pathetic!!)  with stereotypical chop sockey.  Side note: *why is that whenever an Asian appears on the screen, some gongs clang or an off-pitch flute starts to bellow in the background? *sigh*  Whenever a white person or a black person appears in a HK movie, I don't hear Yankee doodle or Roots music in the background, sheesh!  Anywyays, in this case, Kiss of the Dragon was Jet Li true to form, without ridiculous wires, pathetic fortune cookie dialog and entertaining martial arts action.  Li made this movie for his wife's cousins who complained about the [cruddy] Romeo Must Die action saying it contained unrealistic, ultra choreographed fight scenes.  Li is a pleasure to watch, although the ""acupunture spiderman wristwear"" is a bit much but if anyone could pull it off, I think Li would be the man.  If it was Segal, I would've walked out of the movie theater.  Bridget Fonda had absolutely no purpose in this movie other than to make our male eyes widen a bit whenever there wasn't any action going on, and the anxious love tension between her and Li is a bit unrealistic (kiss her already God damn it, isn't this movie called Kiss of the Dragon?!?!!).  So, if you want to watch what Jet Li is all about and what he can do...take a look at KOD.  If you want to watch grasshopper X files, purchase the complete collection of Kung-Fu gift set.",1010534400,2,1661,4.654109589041096
1294823,4,B00003CY5A,"Granted this movie isn't the best I've ever seen, I wouldn't call it the worst either. This movie was refreshing in that it was old-fashion, hardcore-action fist-to-cuffs. No wires or flying like all the movies seem to be doing these days, at least American made films since they've been doing it in HK films as far as I can remember. This movie, as pointed out by Jet Li, is more about one man's promise than anything else. Which, I admit, if you were to watch the movie, it gets a little muttled, but not entirely. Sure, I think this movie is pretty cool,[...].",1010275200,,563,4.475728155339806
1294824,4,B00003CY5A,"First off, I'll admit that while this isn't the jet li of ""fist of legend"" fame, the raw power and talent he posseses defintely comes thru on screen. The advocates of his earlier work have their points and while i enjoyed movies like crouching tiger,hidden dragon i prefer my fight scenes to be less wire and more believeable.....so i can at least pretend to do some of those moves in my head. The story line is predictable but besson's direction adds a european flavor that american movies distinctly lack and is a refreshing change a la lock stock and 2 smoking barrels, the professional etc. The fight scene with the black guy and the two german twins is amazing and on the whole you lef tthe theater amazed if you even slightly fancy yourself a martial arts fan. While jackin chan is entertaining, he is more a martial artist for chicks than the guys.no offense jackie. Jet is a can of pure unadultrated whoop ass. Watch it!!",1010102400,,929,4.568862275449102
1294825,5,B00003CY5A,"JEt Li is very good in this movie. Romeo Must Die..i must say, TRASH!!! this is more like Jet Li. Non-stop action with some touching moments
Jet Li and Bridgette Fonda make this movie very interesting and i liked it that they did not fall in love because that would not make sense and that is WHAKc!
storyline is pretty followable.
Jet Li is chinese cop that is sent to Paris fo some reason, then corrupted French cop frames him for murder.
the last fight with the 2 white twins are very good.
this would be about ranked B considering it is from Jet LI.",1009843200,,553,4.276190476190476
1294826,4,B00003CY5A,"This is definitely the finest example of hardcore fighting in ages. WHilst The Matrix was pretty damn good at the martial arts (and I think The Matrix was a better film), this filmdefinitely has better hand-to-hand (or should I say fist-to-face) action. Whilst I would not buy the DVD, I would definitely rent it. If you've got the money to burn, buy it. If you're a fan of martial arts movies, buy the video.",1008028800,,409,4.54054054054054
1294827,5,B00003CY5A,"I thought to myself, finally...a great American release for Jet...I'm a huge fan of jet and own most of his HK stuff, but none of the American releases...Romeo was an okay movie, but he's done much better...The One was just plain stupid story-wise,check out my review to see why...but Kiss was sure a sweet one...brutal fighting scenes and great action...this is jets  most violent movie considering the number of ways he killed his opponents...however, the girl (fonda) was really annoying and unecessary for the film...i just wanted her obnoxious sounding voice to go away, but i guess she was for story...story is pretty typical...jet is an undercover agent who gets involved with some bad drug lords...these baddies have a drug operation go wrong and try to frame jet's character for it...jet gets away with evidence of killings and is on the run...fonda is some hooker who ends up helping him out and she has a child that is held somewhat captive by the drug leader...anyways,you'll see jet kill like he's never killed before and some scenes will make you cringe,but i personally think its awesome...a must see and buy for any jet fan...by the way jet li's  Fist of Legend is still the best martial arts movie in my opinion =), but check KofD out as well.",1007683200,,1260,4.8018433179723505
1294828,4,B00003CY5A,"I decided to see this movie when it came out expecting to see what I saw in the usual Jet Li movies, wire-works (some of you kung-fu movie watchers know what I am talking about, but if you don't, wire-works is when the actor or stunt man is suspended in air or swinging on a cable performing unusual fighting moves). Wire-works are cute, but I do not like them because they are slow and take me away from the action most of the time. This movie HAS NO WIRE WORKS in the action sequences. I was so happy, finally a martial arts movie for the new millennium not caught into the new-old trend to hit Hollywood. The martial arts scenes are fast, rough, brutal, and are simply what Bruce Lee fans want to see. There was a fight scene Jet Li had in a dojo that reminded me of Chinese Connection a.k.a. ""Fist of Fury"".
The story was not bad; it was good for a martial arts action movie. Personally I would have made the movie a bit longer (like 10 or 20 minutes) to make sure people know exactly why things are going on. Its workable but would have been perfect with a little bit of information. The big one in the beginning such as the French investigator and the Chinese drug boss, the movie doesn't tell you their connection exactly but it's implied.
Li is an overly devoted cop, so he doesn't have much to work with until he meets Fonda's character, there his character is not just doing the job but being a character. Fonda's character used to be addicted to drugs and is a forced-to-be prostitute. So her reactions were pretty not bad for Fonda's acting and I thought she did a good job for her given character.
The score is done by Craig Armstrong (from Massive Attack), which is cool of techno/orchestra. Also there are some hip-hop songs thrown in two of the fight scenes. The one by Mystikal was bearable because of the drum beat (not a bass electronic beat) so it felt OK. Personally I don't like rap in fight scenes cause the talking (rapping) might take it away.  I like rap in the background or to set a scene, not in a fight scene, unless it is instrumental.",1007164800,10,2066,4.352331606217617
1294829,5,B00003CY5A,"""Kiss of the Dragon"" has just about everything that you would expect in a Jet Li film...action, gravity-defying martial arts, and more! Jet Li is brilliant as Liu Jian, a Chinese undercover agent who is on the run in Paris, France after being framed for a drug operation that went terribly wrong. Bridget Fonda is excellent as Jessica, a streetwise hooker who enlists the help of Jet Li's character in getting back custody of her daughter, etc. And I have to give some credit to Tcheky Karyo in his performance as Inspector Richard, a good cop gone bad in his pursuit of finding Jet Li's character and using whatever force is necessary in capturing him, etc. All in all, I think that ""Kiss of the Dragon"" will be a great DVD must-own when it is released. This is possibly one of the best Jet Li movies since ""Romeo Must Die"", ""Lethal Weapon 4"", and his current release, ""The One"".",1006992000,,880,4.540880503144654
1294830,3,B00003CY5A,"When I saw this movie I thought it was pretty awesome except for when the characters started acting. The action scenes were excellent the best part of the movie is when he makes his way up to the head bad guy in the building at the end. When I saw the trailers for The One I thought it would be totally better then KOD but man was I wrong. The action doesn't start till the end and they were too busy with the special effects. I think Jet Li's biggest mistake was turning down the lead role for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. If Jet Li doesn't start getting better directors and better scripts, he's going to end up like that Jean Claude something.",1005264000,,648,4.276422764227642
