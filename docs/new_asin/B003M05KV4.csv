4154227,4,B003M05KV4,"This was a great movie from beginning to end , one of the ones not talked about but should  - ( like bondock saints ) had a mix of everything well thought out movie a must have for any collector",1298419200,2,194,3.85
4154228,4,B003M05KV4,"This is not a bad little movie - it may lack a sophisticated plot but it is entertaining enough and effectively carries you along with the race against time confronting the central characters.  The intensity of the adventures and action is nicely balanced by the comedy element provided by Nick's (the man on a mission), mother. There is a nice little twist at the end and all in all if you are into Crime Thrillers then this offering, if you just want to be entertained, is well worth a viewing.",1293235200,,496,4.511111111111111
4154229,2,B003M05KV4,"I PURCHASE THIS MOVIE JUST BECAUSE I SEEN CURTIS JACKSON ""50 CENT"" IN THE LINE UP. I REALLY WISHED I HAD JUST KEEP RUNNING MY NET BY IT BECAUSE THE MOVIE SUCKS. I SEE OTHER VIEWS LIKE IT BUT TO ME THE ACTIONS WASNT GOOD AT ALL. AND CURTIS PERM REALLY NEEDED TO BE CUT DOWN MORE.",1288137600,2,278,3.8947368421052633
4154230,4,B003M05KV4,"They did not miss a beat with this one. It kept my interest throughout. Can you say, comedic suspense? Get the popcorn ready before you sit down to watch it. You might miss something. No less than 4 stars for this gem! I Highly recommend this movie!",1286236800,,249,4.319148936170213
4154231,4,B003M05KV4,"I picked this flick up for two reasons.  First...I love independent movies, and second is Danny Dyer.  Every time I see Danny Dyer in a role I'm impressed.  He seems to be an actor who not only knows how to pick a role, but can act it out to the nines.  In fact the acting in this flick is top notch...save for Curtis Jackson...who is new to the whole art form...and is the weakest link in the cast.  That being said...it is fun to see fiddy cents in a role that you would not normally think for him.
This film picks up pace from the very beginning, and never lets go.  The story is that of an ex thug who now finds he must delve back into his criminal ways to payback a debt in 24 hours, or he and his family dies.  Not the most original idea, but the ride it takes you on through the streets and back allies of London to the fields of Manchester is a fun one...and there are some unpredictable aspects though not many.  It is mostly the character actors and their brilliant portrayal of the characters that makes this little indie shine.  If you are looking for something wholly new..then you won't find it here...but if you don't mind a little re imagining of ideas you've seen in films before and you are up for a suspension of disbelief than this film is so much fun it should be illegal!
This is the kind of flick I like to discover...and then show a friend...and another...and another.
If you like independent film and neo noir action than this is a definite buy for your collection!",1284595200,,1490,4.274021352313167

4154301,1,B003M05KV4,"The plot for the story is decent. However, you can't overlook the racial politics in the film. Early on the white protaganist fights a huge black man. This black man is torn from the images of Jim Crow literature. The character is huge, animal-like, non-human and very slow. However, don't worry the white man will prevail and outsmart the beast. That is the slant that is given early on in the movie, which continues throughout the film. Every black character in the movie either gets killed or humuliated.",1336348800,2,507,4.7727272727272725
