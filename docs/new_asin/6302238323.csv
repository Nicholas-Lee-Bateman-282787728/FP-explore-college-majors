8170099,4,6302238323,"This was a film made in Australia, in 1975/76, and was an expensive undertaking.  Tim Burstall directed the beautiful Susannah York, along with Trevor Howard, John Waters, Noel Ferrier, and many others.
Although not a great film, it is enjoyable, not least because Susannah York always gives a believable performance, and during the making of this film, she fell in love with the director, Tim Burstall.  This was the reason she came to Australia, with her two little children, three and four at the time, and while living in Melbourne, had a marvellous run in the Noel Coward classic, Private Lives on the stage at the Comedy Thratre in Melbourne, and also in Sydney, which I went to see twice because she was so marvellous in the role of the first wife.
