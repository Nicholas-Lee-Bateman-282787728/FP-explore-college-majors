The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are accurate.
Lastly, the 3D works perfectly with this legendary film.",1525132800,,156,5.038461538461538
8706271,1,B00UGQ5V52,"I love the movie so much that I watch it several times each month. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray version is bad. It is very grainy, especially the background. In comparison, my DVR recording from the TCM channel does not have this problem. The HD is sharp and flawless.",1466812800,,266,4.680851063829787
